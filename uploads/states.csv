(Photo by Lee Lawson/Gettty Stock Photo)The battle over a lucrative contract to manage the state’s lottery systems is headed to court.
Attorneys for Scientific Games — which currently manages lottery gaming for the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency — is asking an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge to intervene in what it says is an unfair and illegal process that saw the company lose the contract, then be awarded a 10-year deal to continue, only to have that stripped away by the state last month in an effort to rebid the contract.
Lottery officials “cannot reject Scientific Games’ proposal directly, or indirectly by cancelling or modifying” the request for proposal, wrote lawyers for Rifkin Weiner Livingston, a firm that represented the company as lobbyists and now in the courtroom.
A lottery spokesperson declined comment Monday, citing the pending litigation.
The lawsuit, filed Friday afternoon, asks a judge to order lottery officials to move forward with its recommendation to award Scientific Games the contract. It also seeks to bar the state from rebidding the contract while Scientific Games appeals the Sept. 25 lottery commission vote that stripped it of the company of being the recommended bidder.
The company also asked a judge to rule that lottery commission officials violated a code of conduct and the Maryland Open Meetings Act.
At issue is a tortured yearlong bidding process that initially saw Scientific Games supplanted by its biggest competitor, Duluth, Georgia-based Intralot. That recommendation by the lottery agency was later upended when Intralot’s bid was disqualified for failing to meet minority business requirements and Scientific Games, the second-place bidder, was then recommended for the contract.
The 10-year deal to manage and monitor the lottery’s gaming systems, including terminals, is lucrative, worth hundreds of millions to the state as well as the winning bidder.

Intralot appeared to be the winner in July, with a $260 million bid that was considered $110 million less than Scientific Games, its nearest competitor. Scientific Games, which held the contract, argues that the gaming agency failed to consider the benefits of continuing with the company, which was exceeding revenue expectations for the state.
But lottery officials said at their July 15 meeting that Intralot had the edge, based on having the lowest price. The panel voted 5-1 to recommend Intralot as the winner.
That preliminary step still required ratification by the Department of General Services and the Board of Public Works. Within days, that preliminary approval was on shaky ground.
Six days later, lawyers for Scientific Games appealed the recommendation and filed a slew of records requests. It cited a flawed analysis gave Intralot the edge. On that same day, according to the Scientific Games court filing, it was determined that two of Intralot’s minority business partners — including Alyse Cohen, owner of Long Shots, an off-track betting and sports book in Frederick — had yet to be certified by the Maryland Department of Transportation.
“In short, Intralot knew or should have known that it was not a responsive offeror and was not qualified for the award,” lawyers for Scientific Games wrote in the lawsuit.
Lottery officials deemed the lack of minority business certification “not eligible for cure” and on Aug. 1 notified Intralot that its bid was determined to be “nonresponsive and not reasonably susceptible for being selected for award of this contract,” according to a letter Maryland Matters obtained in August under the Maryland Public Information Act.
The exact reason for disqualification is unclear: Most of the letter from lottery agency Procurement Director John Lloyd was blacked out.
In a post later on its website, Intralot announced that Maryland had withdrawn its contract award “based on the alleged failure to meet the minimum required percentage of subcontracting to local contractors.”
Lloyd notified Alpharetta, Georgia-based Scientific Games on Aug. 1 that it was now being recommended for the contract award. That letter was also obtained by Maryland Matters through the state public records act.
In court filings, Scientific Games’ lawyers suggest lottery officials reneged on a deal. Besides appealing the initial Intralot award to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals, attorneys for Scientific Games also sought records under the state public information act.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Scientific Games said it was contacted by an attorney for the lottery agency on Aug. 1, asking if the company would withdraw its appeal and records request if the agency rescinded the award to Intralot and recommended Scientific Games.
Scientific Games officials agreed to the deal, and lottery officials rescinded the offer to Intralot, which followed with an appeal of its own.
Before that appeal could be heard, the lottery commission met on Sept. 25. And while it was not advertised on its agenda, the panel took up the issue of the contract recommendation for Scientific Games.
After meeting in closed session for more than 90 minutes, commission Chair Everett D. Browning Sr. acknowledged the decision by Lloyd to reject Intralot’s proposal as non-responsive. The commission then voted 4-3 to withdraw the Aug. 1 offer to Scientific Games.
Scientific Games’ lawyers alleged that Browning communicated with Intralot lobbyists outside the public eye, and failed to publicly disclose those communications. Browning should have recused himself from the Sept. 25, lawyers said in court filings, which they say would have changed the outcome of the vote.
“Thereupon, the commission arbitrarily, capriciously, pretextually, without a scintilla of evidence, and with no finding of fact, in a four to three vote, denied the award to Scientific Games, breached its representations and warranties, and failed to comply with written agreements,” lawyers for Scientific Games wrote in their court filing.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1963457814-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-20 22:17:35.453323

(Montana Department of Corrections photo)Montana State Prison’s drinking water has routinely tested positive for coliform, a bacteria found in fecal matter, and the facility has received numerous drinking water violations over the past three decades, according to the state’s Safe Drinking Water Information System.
Publicly available drinking water tests from the Department of Public Health and Human Service’s Environmental Lab show the prison’s aging and troubled system tested positive for coliform 11 times in 2025 and eight times in 2024.
Questions about water quality have come to the surface since a reported water pipe break at the prison 10 days ago that left inmates without consistent drinking water and in some cases not enough water, according to an inmate and family members.
But water quality at the prison appears to be a longstanding issue. The Department of Corrections said it takes those concerns seriously. 
“The safety of inmates and staff members at Montana State Prison (MSP) is paramount, and any safety concerns brought to the department’s attention are addressed immediately,” Department of Corrections spokesperson Carolynn Stocker wrote in an email to the Daily Montanan. “The Department works closely with the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to ensure the safety of water.”
The facility has received seven “individual violations” since 2022. When inspections reveal issues, there is a set notification process. The violations, which follow testing, were over E. coli monitoring, multiple consumer confidence violations — a mandated water quality reporting process by the Environmental Protection Agency — as well as notifications about copper and lead.
“DEQ has informed the DOC that lead and copper values are less than federal action levels,” Stocker wrote in an email.
When there is an issue with water that requires public notification, it’s called a violation. Even things like not responding to a correction or repair request within a certain time period can be considered a violation, according to a DEQ reference sheet on federal rules surrounding coliform.
Following that notification, water facilities are asked to come back into compliance.
In an email late Monday, the Department of Corrections did not directly answer a question regarding consumer confidence report violations the Daily Montanan sent Friday. The DOC referred those questions to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, which did not respond to the Daily Montanan by press time. 
There have been about 50 tests for coliform, a different bacteria than E. coli, over the past year, according to the data set. 
During those coliform tests the state also tests for E. coli. None of the E. coli tests showed the presence of that pathogen, and prison water hasn’t tested positive for that bacteria since 2000, and even then it was in non-potable water, the Department of Corrections said in an emailed response to questions from the Daily Montanan.
On Monday, inmates were handed a notification dated Oct. 10, saying that there were questions about the quality of the water supply, in this case, potentially from the infrastructure problems at the prison. Amanda McKnight, who has been advocating for inmates during the water crisis, said her husband, who is an inmate, read the statement and she transcribed it.
“Our water system recently experienced a loss of pressure, which could have resulted in contamination of the water supply,” the statement reads. “Because of the loss of pressure, it is unknown if contaminants could have infiltrated the distribution system.”
The statement goes on to say water from the prison’s supply should be boiled before usage. 
“Inadequately treated water may contain disease-causing organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and headaches,” the statement reads.
The DOC did not immediately respond to a request late Monday for comment on the boil order notification.

McKnight said her husband had severe stomach issues for six months after entering the prison. Even before the current water crisis, she was sending him extra money for bottled water, she said, and that’s been a consistent worry.
“It’s devastating to know that my husband and 1,600 other human beings along with the staff who work there are being forced to live in conditions we wouldn’t tolerate for animals,” McKnight, who shared the violations with the Daily Montanan, wrote in a message. “Clean water is a basic human right. The State has known about these water issues for years and has done nothing. This isn’t an accident, this is neglect.”
The testing data goes back decades, and prison water has tested positive for coliform 37 times since 2001. Coliform bacteria aren’t necessarily harmful, though their presence in drinking water can indicate pathogens are in the water. 
Following a water sample, bacteria is grown in a petri dish overnight, said Ben Rigby, the executive director of Montana Rural Water Systems.
If it’s a “hit” or when a sample tests positive for a specific pathogen, they’ll take several more samples, Rigby said.
Rigby was previously the Water Treatment Superintendent city of Helena’s water system and said there’s always a possibility of false positives too. Reporting out any water issues is paramount to public trust, he said.
“That’s kind of rule number one, as an operator in a public water supply,” Rigby added.
There are significant federal regulations around water quality, including the Revised Total Coliform Rule. 
“Total coliforms are a group of closely related bacteria that are natural and common inhabitants of soil and surface waters,” the rule states. “Their presence in drinking water suggests that there has been a breach or failure in the water system (for example, a hole in the pipe); and pathogens, which are disease-carrying organisms, may have entered the drinking water.”
It was unclear how high the levels were of coliform bacteria. Positive tests for coliform at the prison date back to 1981, state records show. A test on Sept. 23 of this year showed the presence of coliform in the drinking water.
In an email, the Daily Montanan asked the DOC to explain the severity of the test results and its response. A DOC spokesperson explained the process the DOC uses to meet standards but did not elaborate on the positive results for coliform.
The state samples water at the facility about three times per month, Stocker wrote in an email. Those samples are delivered to the DPHHS environmental division, which then reports the results to the Department of Environmental Quality.
“If there are any concerns with the results, Corrections works with DEQ to identify and address any problems and to ensure water meets the requirements of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and state laws,” Stocker wrote. “This could include, but is not limited to, mitigation strategies such as boil advisories. The DOC continues to work with DEQ until a negative test result is achieved and the water is confirmed free from the contaminant.  When public notice is required, MSP posts that information in all public areas at the facility for staff and in the communal areas in the prison units for inmate access.”  
Sewer and water issues aren’t new at the prison, and last year, Montana Public Radio reported a sewage backup lasted for days.
“As a wife, it breaks me to know that my husband — and every man inside those walls — has been drinking, showering, and living in contaminated water for years,” said Ariana Smith, whose husband is also in the facility, said in a statement last week.
The National Guard has delivered thousands of gallons of water to the prison from the city of Deer Lodge. The prison is also drawing from two on-site wells, Lee Newspapers reported on Monday.

But there’s been major issues with the city of Deer Lodge’s water system as well. One of the city’s three public wells shut down following a 2013 violation for arsenic contamination.
“The two remaining wells are also susceptible to arsenic contamination due to the proximity of the Clark Fork River,” a 2024 Department of Natural Resources and Conservation environmental assessment states. “Having only two remaining production wells poses a severe risk to the City’s ability to provide reliable water service due to lack of redundant water supply.”
Deer Lodge — and the state prison — both lie within the Anaconda County Smelter Superfund Site.
Milling and smelting operations produced high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium and zinc that contaminated soil and groundwater.
Last week, the Department of Corrections said it was going to take $21 million in appropriated money from 2025 budget legislation to “modernize” the prison’s water system following the break. This work is expected to take from 60 to 90 days, the DOC said in an Oct. 18 press release.
DOC officials said they have tried to find the source of the problem, calling in multiple water experts, the state’s National Guard and a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation command team. Last week, the DOC announced in a press release that water had been restored to the Secure Adjustment Unit and units 1 and 2 on the high-security side of the facility. 
Work to stabilize water access continued over the weekend, the agency said in an Oct. 18 press release. On Monday, 13 plumbers were expected to be on site, DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in a statement. A leak was found outside the A unit in the low security side of the prison, and the DOC said maintenance staff believe repairing that will help with water pressure in units A, B and C.
Some work to excavate pipes at the prison has to be done by hand, according to the DOC.
“It seems like every time we fix one leak, another one pops up affecting the system in a different way,” Gootkin said in a press release. 
The Department of Corrections also said a Department of Public Health and Human Services sanitarian inspected the prison last week and provided technical assistance on the safety and adequacy of the facility’s temporary water system. 
“The temporary water system inspected today meets the highest standards to ensure the health and safety of MSP inmates and staff,” DPHHS sanitation Jenna Fisher stated in a DOC press release.
A DOC release said Fisher confirmed that the facility is supplying necessities — including portable restrooms, showers, and bottled water — in quantities they said exceed levels recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On Friday, the Department of Corrections announced potable water trucks supplied the prison’s food factory, allowing that facility’s cooking operations to resume.
Additionally, the DOC said Fisher observed that the prison’s kitchen is maintaining safe sanitation — water is being boiled, the release said — and laundry facilities remain fully operational. 
Construction planning is also progressing, with plans to replace the failing water system to begin this week, the agency said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MSP-facility-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 21:56:22.992500
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-21 01:37:29+00:00,CT Mirror,"Child found dead in New Britain hadn’t eaten for weeks, warrant says",Ginny Monk and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/jacqueline-mimi-torres-garcia-new-britain-department-children-families/,"Jacqueline 'Mimi' Torres-García was severely abused before she died, documents state, but DCF says it didn’t receive reports of the abuse.","The child found dead earlier this month in a plastic container in New Britain hadn’t eaten for weeks prior to her death, was confined and severely abused, but the Department of Children and Families didn’t receive reports of that abuse, according to a timeline of events released by the state agency last week.
Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García was kept zip-tied in a corner, lying on top of pee pads, and had been denied food in the two weeks before she died, according to court documents. The documents detail some of the evidence likely to be presented in cases against the girl’s mother, aunt, and the mother’s boyfriend in connection with her murder.
Police filed search warrants with the court to access phone records for Karla García, the girl’s mother, and Jackelyn García, the child’s aunt. Allegations about the abuse Torres-García endured before her death are contained in those warrants. 
On Oct. 8, New Britain police received a tip that Jonatan Nanita, Karla García’s boyfriend, had picked up a tote in the woods of a cemetery and put it in the back of his vehicle, then drove to an abandoned home on Clark Street and left the tote on the property. The tote was presumed to contain Torres-García’s body, according to the warrants.
The autopsy showed that there were no signs of recent trauma or injuries that caused her death, but she was malnourished. Karla García told police after her arrest that she and Nanita stopped feeding Torres-García for two weeks prior to her death and that they had restrained her in zip ties as punishment when she was “acting bad,” according to the warrants.
After the girl’s death, Nanita put her body in the basement of their Farmington home, but the smell of decay emanating from below was so strong they had to live with friends or at hotels, documents state.
Jackelyn García sent her sister a photo of the girl restrained in zip ties and lying on a pee pad, according to documents. Karla García told her sister that the child died on Sept. 19, 2024, more than a year before her body was found this month.
Karla García said most of her daughter’s punishments were at the direction of Nanita and that she had planned to go on a podcast to share the story of what happened. She wrote notes on her phone about what she planned to say on the podcast before she was arrested.
While DCF had involvement with the family, it doesn’t appear that the agency was aware of the 2024 abuse that ultimately led to Torres-García’s death. The agency said in a statement on Friday that the family had deceived them by having another child impersonate Torres-García in a welfare check on Zoom earlier this year. According to DCF, the family told them the child was being homeschooled and was visiting a relative out of state.
Torres-García’s case is not typical for DCF, which mostly handles neglect complaints.  About 80% of cases come to the agency because of neglect concerns, not abuse.  
Connecticut DCF is part of a growing movement among state child welfare agencies to prioritize family unification,  with varying degrees of success. Child removal has been shown to be harmful to kids’ development. Because most interventions deal with neglect rather than abuse, advocates say that the true problem in the overwhelming preponderance of cases is a strained, underfunded system that lacks services and support for families in poverty. Caseworker turnover is high, according to previous interviews with DCF officials. Advocates say families struggle to access services they need such as mental health or addiction treatment, housing and child care. 
DCF said in a statement issued last week that they first became involved with the girl’s family when she was born. At the time, Karla García was in a detention center, so the baby was placed with a relative, where she remained until May 2022, when she was 9 years old. That year, her parents sought guardianship of both Torres-García and her younger sibling, which was granted by the court, a decision supported by DCF at the time. 
The department then interacted with Torres-García “during a subsequent investigation” in September 2022 involving her younger siblings, but there was not enough evidence to substantiate child abuse or neglect. DCF closed that case in November 2022.
For the following two years, DCF says, it had no involvement with the family, although it notes that Karla García sought and was granted sole custody of Torres-García and a sibling in June 2024.
But in January of this year, allegations were again made against García regarding the treatment of Torres-García’s younger sibling. As DCF checked on the sibling and then attempted to check on Torres-García, her mother told DCF case workers that she was being homeschooled and had gone to visit a relative out of state. In response, “DCF conducted a video call with a person who (the) mother claimed to be Jacqueline.” But police have said they believe that Jacqueline had died months earlier. DCF, apparently satisfied with that call, closed the case in March 2025. 
Cases typically come to DCF’s attention when someone reports suspected abuse or neglect. The agency decides whether it merits investigation. These investigations are separate from criminal investigations and require a different burden of proof.
In Torres-García’s case, no one reported her missing, New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said. After the family’s most recent involvement and despite the severe abuse, no one reported concerns about Torres-García to DCF. Several lawmakers have called for more accountability and transparency from DCF about their involvement with the family.
Republican senators called DCF workers’ actions into question in a Friday statement.
“We need full details of this video call,” the statement from Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “We need full transparency. This is an example of why essential state employees’ remote work must be constantly reviewed, especially when it involves protecting our most vulnerable residents.”
Some lawmakers have also renewed calls to further regulate homeschooling because, close to the time of her death, Torres-García’s mother reported that her daughter would be homeschooled.
Following news that a Waterbury man who was allegedly locked away by his stepmother for over a decade had been homeschooled, the Office of the Child Advocate released a report that said homeschooling has been used to hide abuse and that Connecticut has little regulation of that system.
Online petitions have also called for more regulation of the system, suggesting periodic welfare checks for homeschooled children, among other measures.
Members of the homeschooling community have pushed back against those suggestions, saying the focus on education is deflecting attention from DCF, which they say should have acted to protect Torres-García.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/90-1024x683.webp,,,2025-10-20 21:56:22.992500

Here’s why,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/10/scholarship-lawsuit-california/,Students and a right-leaning nonprofit sued UC San Diego for allegedly supporting a scholarship fund for Black students. They cited the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act as evidence to support their case.,"In summary
Students and a right-leaning nonprofit sued UC San Diego for allegedly supporting a scholarship fund for Black students. They cited the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act as evidence to support their case.


A scholarship for Black students at UC San Diego is now available to anyone, regardless of race, after students and a right-leaning nonprofit organization sued the university for discrimination this July. 
The plaintiffs argued that the scholarship fund violated a series of laws, including the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which was put in place to protect Black Americans in the South. 
One of the students, Kai Peters, said he was denied access to the scholarship because he isn’t Black. Peters sent  a written statement to CalMatters through the Californians for Equal Rights Foundation, the nonprofit plaintiff. He said his rejection is an example of “institutionalized racism” — a phrase that was created in part to characterize how government institutions discriminate against Black Americans. 
“I don’t see the irony,” said Joshua Thompson, an attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which represented the plaintiffs. “The idea is that we don’t want government actors out forcing their discrimination.”
The university’s Black Alumni Scholarship Fund is now called the Goins Alumni Scholarship Fund, named after its founding donor Lennon Goins, according to a press release last week. The scholarship fund has awarded nearly $60 million to “more than 15,400 students” since its founding, the press release said.
The rebranded scholarship program is just one of numerous initiatives in California that have come under scrutiny in the last two years. Last summer, the Supreme Court overturned precedent that allowed private universities in the state to use affirmative action, and this year, the Trump Administration has ended numerous campus initiatives promoting diversity. . 
In March, the UC changed its hiring practices, banning its 10 campuses from requiring  “diversity statements” as a condition for employment. Now those statements are voluntary.
Other changes are more subtle. In February, Bakersfield College described its “Chicano/Latino Pre-Commencement Event” as a means to “encourage Chicano/Latino students to participate in (graduation) celebrations.” But by the time graduation rolled around in May, the word “Chicano/Latino” had been removed from that sentence.
Website indicates change of focus
The press release about the Black Alumni Scholarship Fund didn’t address the reason for the change, and a spokesperson for the university, Hiram Soto, declined to comment further.
But a CalMatters analysis of the fund’s website shows how the university changed course.
In September, the website said that the university scholarship fund was founded in 1983 by Goins to “expand educational opportunities for high achieving, civic-minded African American students,” focusing on admitted Black students with a record of “community service” and “resiliency to racial and other identity challenges.”
There was no mistake that this fund was by and for the Black community. “100% of BASF Scholars identify as Black/African American,” the website said, adding that the goal of the scholarship fund was to “increase Black graduation at UCSD from 2% to 5% of degrees awarded.”
Despite decades of scholarships, that goal remains unattained. In the 2023-24 school year, just under 3% of UC San Diego’s undergraduate degrees awarded went to students who identify as Black or African-American, according to the system’s data.
Racial discrimination is illegal in the U.S., but in California, the standard of what constitutes discrimination depends in part on whether an entity is public or private. While private entities, including nonprofits and foundations, have long offered scholarships and programs for certain racial or ethnic groups — arguing that spending money is a form of free speech — state agencies, including the UC campuses, are prohibited from any form of affirmative action after California voters passed Proposition 209 in 1996. 
To avoid legal scrutiny, UC San Diego moved the Black Alumni Scholarship Fund to the private San Diego Foundation in 1998, according to the September iteration of the fund’s website.
But in the lawsuit, Thompson and his legal team alleged that the university has remained involved in the scholarship’s operation. “Our allegations were that (UC San Diego officials) were conspiring with a private entity to get around (Prop.) 209 and the Equal Protection Clause.” Specifically, he said the university was giving the San Diego Foundation information about which students identified as Black on their college applications and that the leadership of the fund included some university officials.
The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 prohibits government agencies from using private entities to discriminate. Back then, government agencies and law enforcement, especially in the South, often used private groups — most famously, the Ku Klux Klan — to terrorize Black communities. 
By working with the private foundation to support Black students, UC San Diego is guilty of the same kind of “nefarious behavior” as the government and law enforcement agencies of the Jim Crow South, Thompson said. “This is the full tradition of our civil rights laws,” he said, citing both the Ku Klux Klan Act and more recent laws, such as Prop. 209. “We don’t want the government to discriminate against people on the basis of race.”
Soon after filing the lawsuit, Thompson said the scholarship fund reached out to his legal team and agreed to change its name and to open up applications to students who didn’t identify as Black.
He said other changes may be on the horizon. In February, the Pacific Legal Foundation sued UC San Francisco’s Benioff Children’s Hospital regarding another program aimed at minority high school students. Thompson said the San Francisco university system is now negotiating how to continue with that program too.
These negotiations happen informally, so there’s no written settlement agreement to show how universities are responding and what changes actually occur.
Today, the scholarship fund website says its applications are expected to open in 2026 to UC San Diego students who are involved in community service and those with a demonstrated “ability to overcome major challenges,” as well as other race-neutral criteria.

Last week, I stood outside a National Guard hangar in the Western Alaska hub town of Bethel, talking with residents of the region’s villages who’d evacuated after raging floodwaters overran their homes — in some cases, floating them off their foundations and depositing them miles away. 
The flooding, stemming from the remnant of Typhoon Halong, has displaced more than 1,000 people, many of whom suffered intense emotional trauma during the storm and may never return to their Indigenous homelands. For more context, you can find ongoing coverage at KYUK, the regional public media station I’ve been collaborating with, and I published my own overview piece last week.
One of the survivors I spoke with was Jeron Joseph, a resident of Kwigillingok. Kwig, as it’s known, was among the hardest-hit villages, which also include nearby Kipnuk. Some 35% of buildings in Kwig were destroyed, while that number is 90% in Kipnuk, and at least 15 villages in total sustained substantial damage, according to regional authorities.
Jeron had a story to tell, which he did over the course of 40 minutes, as helicopters flew overhead and National Guard service members bustled past us. It’s presented here with minimal edits for clarity.  He asks that those who know him who share this account on social media or elsewhere please omit the names of the family members he mentions, out of respect for their privacy.
Expect to hear more from Jeron in the days ahead as he and other evacuees get settled in their new environment.
 A ‘knee-high’ storm turns serious

Jeron Joseph: My name is Jeron Joseph. I am turning 31 on Halloween. I’m an Alaska Native, and I’ve lived in Kwigillingok all my life. Just a quick aside, in my culture, we don’t have men or women. We have masculine and feminine roles, and I was seen as much more like a cleaner of game than a hunter.
My first memory of the typhoon — my assumption was that it was going to be like any other fall-time storm, like knee-high depth of water, which is something that I’ve come to expect.
But my aunt, as a cautious person, decided to go to the school that doubles as a community center and shelter, at the first opportunity. I, of course, waited until the water looked concerning — it looked like whitewater rapids, which I’d never seen before. I’d never seen wind hitting the water to the point that there’s a froth of white above. In that moment, around midnight, I made the decision to start packing a backpack. I called my best friend so that I could string my thoughts together, get the most crucial things. A change of clothes, my legal documents and some painkillers, my toothbrush, head out the door. I had also put a harness on my dog, my little prima donna Jack Russell terrier mix. I got a harness on her, put a leash on, put my backpack on, and I took one step out the door.

The wind hit my back and pushed me onto each stair of my little deck, until I hit the driveway and I fell on my hands and my body, and my dog fell to my right side, but she was okay. I started walking in knee-depth water, with my boots getting filled. And on my way down to the school, I felt a log — a firewood log that Native people stack, like, next to their houses — it hit my left knee. It began pushing me, making me slide on the wooden boardwalk that we walk on in our villages to stay above the soggy tundra. I reacted just in time to push it away. I was just a few inches away from the ground. And I’m certain that, if I hit the ground, I would have fallen and ended up horizontal and gotten swept away, and would have been unable to pick myself back up. Because the water was at that speed.
 An ‘orchestra from hell’ at the neighbors’ house

My neighbor, three doors down from me, looked at me with his headlamp. He yelled at me to get inside his house. I got inside with the family there. They were kind enough to host me and my dog, which I’m very grateful for — and the matriarch of that house, you know, she is much more a Native than I am, and she gets nervous around dogs. One of her daughters gave me a pair of pants after my own got soaked, and we stayed there for the entire morning. Unable to sleep, we sat in the dark with candles, without power. They were commiserating amongst themselves, all of them with social media on their phones, tuned to existentially terrifying sights of their fellow Natives in the village and in Kipnuk. They had all racked their brains over how they might end up. But the way that my brain works, I clamp everything down, and I put myself on autopilot. I make my own feet move; I’ll think about my thoughts later.
The water kept rising and rising, and I would guess that it hit the crux of its height at 5 a.m. and it stayed that way until just after daylight broke, at which point it seemingly started to recede. Just after the crux, we could hear their larger wooden logs dancing against the floor of their elevated house, which has an iron foundation. It was a combination of whooshing winds, rushing water, and these hellish, very low drums against the floor — sort of an orchestra from hell. Eventually, they drifted away, log by log, and now it was just the water and the wind, and sometimes the house would shake. I’m certain I was not the only one who was scared that some part of the foundation would give, and either water would get in from the door or the windows, or the house would begin to drift. Neither of those things happened, but it happened to other houses — to a lot of the houses that were developed much earlier than those that were specifically made with this kind of situation in mind, including my own parents’ house. My childhood home.
Some time after sunrise, maybe 10 a.m., the water receded to a few feet behind the house, and we could see the impression in the tundra where the boardwalk used to be — it had floated about eight feet over. I really didn’t want to think it, but I hated how pretty the sunrise was that morning. It seemed as if beauty and our footing had been stolen from us.
 Looking for my family

My brother and my stepdad, who were in my childhood home at the beginning — they must’ve had my attitude about what they thought this was at first, just another fall-time knee-high storm. They decided to stay at the house, which was closer to the coast than my aunt’s house where I stay.
Water started coming in through their door. I know my brother had been taking five-minute, intermittent naps sitting on a freezer that was shoved against the front door. He had wrapped his most important things in plastic. My stepdad, I would have to guess, was going around the house, doing all of the other things as the patriarch of the house would do: looking at all the windows, looking at the places where the wall meets the floor to see if there’s any water coming in. They said that initially, they didn’t realize they were moving. My brother told me that at some point there was another house with an internet satellite on it, and that satellite hit one of their windows, and it actually closed the window after it hit theirs, and they were hooked together that way. That’s how they moved along together. After that whole ordeal, their house settled on a piece of land, where there was water around it.

I heard that they were physically okay, but roughed up — someone said they’d been rowing back in an aluminum fishing dinghy after the storm, with bags of their stuff. After the wind had subsided, and without telling anyone, I walked to the north bridge of the village, past all of the debris, and I looked around the horizon. I asked a person there if they’d seen my family. They said no. I looked at the horizon for some minutes, where some of these floating houses had come to rest — of course, anyone would recognize their childhood house, and I didn’t see mine. Somebody told me that it probably drifted in another direction, because the storm winds blew toward a little more east than just directly north.
So, I went back to the school, I washed my hands, I had a little meal. After the meal, I could not sit still. I walked out to the east side of the village. There’s two rows of elevated housing developments where their foundations have aluminum sheets all around them. These are older than the one I sheltered in, but younger than my parents’ house. That’s where my best friend who lives in Kwig was for the night, and when I asked him, he told me that at his place, the water got to just two feet high. When I heard that, I had the intense urge to make him go skydiving so that he’d be as scared as I was.
On my way to that east housing development, I asked every person or group I saw if they’d seen my stepdad, my brother, or my house. They all said no. And when that many people say no, you get that little bit of hope chipped away and chipped away until your heart just gets really heavy.
I made it to the housing development, and after a very quick, relieved hug and exchange with my friend, I began walking back to the school. I’d taken 10 or 15 steps out of the development when somebody yelled my name, ‘Jeron!’ They told me that my stepdad and my brother made it to the school.
 Processing my family’s survival

I didn’t let it all out at that moment. I opened the jar of fear, anxiety, hope, despair, grief, and displacement in that moment for, like, a second. Tears started welling up. I closed the jar back up again, started focusing on myself again, and started walking towards the school. After I made it inside, there were some neighbors seated against the wall and away from staff scrambling about. Some were waving at me hastily, loudly whispering to me. They said my name, and they pointed to where my brother and stepdad were.
They were locked in a makeshift exam room. My stepdad, along with a health aide, was tending to my brother, who was having, like, the only panic attack I’ve ever seen in my entire life. I went up to the window of the exam room, and that was the moment that I couldn’t control opening the jar of all those feelings.

And in that moment, I felt every feeling I should have up to that point, combined with hopeless concern and longing for their safety. I thought every thought I should have thought up to that point, like: There’s at least four or five reasons I shouldn’t be here, alive, and weeping. I spent at least 20 minutes at that window just crying my eyes out and feeling needles and knives in my heart. And my thought was, they’re alive, but I can’t see them. They’re alive. I can’t see them.
I went back to one of the classrooms where we had basically set up camp, cheeks still wet. I sat down in the corner and I just shut down mentally. The room was vacant. Distant hums of the school generator, occasional hurried jogging in the hall, and overseers yelling about some developments were all that was in the air. I sat there for what felt like 20 minutes, until somebody came by the door and noticed me staring into space. They asked me why I was sitting with the blankest stare they ever saw for over an hour. There was just nothing occupying my mind.
When that person came and asked me, I snapped out of it. I got up quickly and jogged past them, and I went back to the window where I could see my stepdad and my brother were, and my brother was lying down, face down. Silent. But breathing softly. My stepdad was having some kind of quiet conversation with that health aide. That was that moment where I asked myself, ‘Will I ever be able to see my brother again like the way he was before?’ That, of course, brought another wave of anxious tears.
A little later on, I had resigned myself to pacing some ways away from the cafeteria. They had dispatched rescue helicopters to pick up some of the other people who needed to be lifted up and brought to the school. One of my aunt’s best friends had to be brought in, either with a helicopter or a boat. When she came in through the front door, she was wailing, and it was probably because she herself was at a floating house all night, and this was probably the first time she was on solid ground since the entirety of the dark. A few people went up to hug her, but when she saw my aunt, they had embraced each other tightly, and neither of them could let go for a solid six or seven minutes. This still makes me emotional, just thinking about it.
Another hour or two had passed. Some people had asked me to check some books in the library so I would stop tensing; the library was right next to the makeshift exam room. On my way into the library, the exam room door opened, and I saw my brother standing up. He noticed me, then started walking towards me, arms outstretched. I stopped in my tracks. I couldn’t move anymore. I was beginning to burst into tears. He walked towards me and embraced me. He was back to his normal self. He was just smiling when he came up to me. That was the moment I experienced immeasurable joy and relief, after an entire night and day of tension. I was streaming tears, and I whispered into his ear, ‘I was walking all day. I was looking for you. Nobody said they saw you.’
 A couple of ‘days of delusion,’ then reality hits

From that moment, we had what I can only describe as a comfortable couple of days of delusion. There’s aid coming in. We are so, so grateful for the aid, and the donations that came in in the days after. Those donations got our heads above water. We had all of our persons. We had our mental faculties. Me and my aunt had our things, or at least as much as we could salvage. I’m a little more attached than she is to my avocation — I have eight years-worth of my sheet music I composed on a computer that I managed to get out.
We all had this thought in our heads that we were going to be able to get back to our lives the way they were. But then more and more, little bits of news from the National Guard, and from the search and rescue members, kept coming out. ‘The south side of town, so much of it smells like stove oil or gas.’ There were a couple of National Guard members, I heard that the fumes were giving them headaches, just being over there. A fellow Native said that those spills are probably going to pollute the fish and game. As that news was passed around, we all said to ourselves, ‘We are facing winter right now.’

I would describe it as when somebody drops a bag of flour on the floor, and there’s particles everywhere. That second day, it felt like the particles had settled down, and we could all see clearly. Only, what we could see clearly was not a future for us on this coastal tundra. Our ancestral home.
I spoke to a number of young people. I said to them: It feels like you only have one direction you can go to right now. You have blinders on. But I promise, when it’s all said and done, when all of the i’s are dotted and the t’s are crossed, you have all of your stuff and you get out — when all that’s done, you’ll have every other direction you can look toward.
I told them: Do not give in to hopelessness about something like this. Cry when it’s time to say goodbye to our home. I said to them, cry as much as you need to. Because if you don’t cry now, it’s going to manifest in other ways if you don’t get those tears out. When those tears have dried, on that holy ground where our ancestors had taken hold, you’re going to have smiles when you’re settled somewhere else.
 Leaving the village feels ‘permanent’

They loaded us onto a helicopter. The state trooper said one to two bags per person. I was a little nervous that I wasn’t going to be able to bring my stuff. I insisted on two things. One, that our dog flies to a kennel in the Bethel animal shelter, and we see where we go from there. And I really wanted to keep my sheet music that was on my computer, because there’s eight years worth of it. I still don’t know if we’re going to be able to go back to salvage stuff, which may be out of our own pockets. So, I got my dog and my computer out.
A situation can be many things. It can be horrible, it can be displacing. It can make you doubt whether you’ll see your next meal or your family. But I also told my family: This is a chance for everyone, even those unaffected, to prove what they’re capable of. If you’re going to place a hashtag on this, the ones that come to mind are #AlaskaStrong, #KwigStrong, and #KipnukStrong. That’s what I believe we should be able to get out of all of this. And that’s something that no typhoon in the world can take away.

I myself, I’m going to a family member’s house, further inland. It feels permanent. But my discussions are not done. My aunt mentioned that since the house only shifted a few inches, there’s a possibility she’s considering that we could have it as a summer home, when it’s greenest. It’s so lovely out there. You have no idea. Our house had the best views of any house on the north side of the village, and I loved those views, especially in the morning. I took some nature photographs, some pretty crazy shots, including one in the early morning where there was a layer of fog that was obstructing the sun. I think only photographers will get this, but that fog created a 100% natural, diffuse light on all the plants.
I’m going to miss that coastal air. Smells like nothing else I’ve ever come across. I’m going to miss the rain water, for drinking. And, of course, I like to think that the bonds we have with our neighbors all around Alaska, and everywhere, are stronger than displacement. And just that purity of the environment, and our way of life that we’ve rooted ourselves in for so long — our subsistence and our gathering.

Those that are lucky enough to move to similar villages to friends or relatives, or Native-adjacent small towns, I’m very envious of them. But I and my aunt, we’re going further inland. And I am very grateful. I’m here with my life. She’s here with her life. We’re here with our stories. We’re here, and we have what we need, and we’re going to find our footing again.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The legal battle over Utah’s redistricting process and what congressional boundaries should be used for the 2026 election is reaching a new fever pitch — with more complexity and uncertainty than ever. 
As a Nov. 10 deadline looms for 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to pick a new congressional map, a flurry of court filings have flooded her court docket over the past week. On Thursday and Friday, she’s scheduled two days of evidentiary hearings. 
In the filings, legislative attorneys and plaintiffs in the state’s ongoing court-ordered redistricting process argue over their preferred maps, their dueling redistricting experts, and what statistical tools should — and shouldn’t — be used to determine partisan slants or gerrymandering. Both sides are calling each other’s maps partisan gerrymanders. 
Redistricting: Utah GOP moves to block changes to electoral map, undo voter-backed law 

Meanwhile, unchartered legal waters are becoming increasingly murky as the Utah Republican Party mounts an effort to both block the map the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature advanced earlier this month (which the party also encouraged Republicans to support as the least damaging option) — and pursue what’s called an “indirect initiative” to overturn the state’s independent redistricting law.
If successful, that indirect initiative could force lawmakers to take an up or down vote on repealing Proposition 4, the 2018 voter-approved law that requires an independent redistricting process, which the courts recently deemed is now the law after determining the 2021 Utah Legislature acted unconstitutionally when it undid it to draw the map adopted that year. 
Legal fight over indirect initiative 
The lawsuit’s plaintiffs are urging Gibson not to pick the Legislature’s chosen 2025 map, known as map C, pointing to expert analysis alleging it “favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats to an extreme degree.” Meanwhile, plaintiffs are also asking the judge to block the GOP’s indirect initiative, arguing that even if they succeed in gathering the required 70,374 signatures by Nov. 14, an indirect initiative doesn’t have the power to unravel what more than half a million voters  supported and enacted in 2018. 
Anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs allege lawmakers have violated the Utah Constitution again

“A mere 4% of voters (70,374) cannot convert an unconstitutional legislative repeal of Proposition 4 into a constitutional one through a vehicle — the indirect initiative — with no constitutional genesis,” plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “To conclude otherwise would be to allow the Legislature (to) enact by a statute a mechanism to violate the People’s constitutional rights.”
The Legislature’s attorneys, on the other hand, argue that both of the alternative maps plaintiffs have submitted to the court are partisan gerrymanders. 
“At best, (the plaintiffs’) plans are not as fair as the 2025 (map) and, at worst, their plans are themselves purposeful partisan gerrymanders,” legislative attorneys wrote, adding that the upcoming evidentiary hearing later this week, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, “will confirm why the 2025 (map) is lawful and Plaintiffs’ proposals are extreme partisan outliers.”
Plaintiffs have also filed another complaint asking Gibson to block a companion law legislators passed alongside their 2025 maps that requires three specific tests to determine whether a congressional map unduly favors or disfavors a political party. 
Plaintiffs allege those tests were “cherry picked” to “infect” Proposition 4 with methods that will favor majority parties in states like Utah that have a dominant majority party. Legislative attorneys, however, argue the tests have merit, and were the result of legislators’ “good-faith effort” to clarify “vague” terms in Proposition 4 and exercise their discretion to determine which tests would be best to use.

What could happen next? 
Each outstanding legal question could have major implications for Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process. 
If Gibson picks the Legislature’s map C, but the Utah GOP’s application for the citizen referendum on the map is successful, that could leave the state in limbo with a big question mark over which map would govern the 2026 elections, since the courts have already voided the 2021 map as the result of an unconstitutional process. 
To successfully put the map referendum on the ballot, the party must gather more than 140,000 valid signatures (or 8% of the number of active voters statewide and in 15 of the 29 Senate districts) in 30 days, but no later than Nov. 15. Clerks will have 21 days to verify signatures, but voters will also be allowed up to 30 days to remove their signatures. 
If the referendum application qualifies for the ballot, the lieutenant governor would block the map from being used in the 2026 election, until voters could weigh in. 
However, the party’s signature gathering window wouldn’t end until after Nov. 10, which Utah’s top election officials have said is the latest possible deadline to give county clerks time to set their precincts ahead of the 2026 elections. 
If Gibson picks one of the plaintiffs maps? Republican lawmakers have already indicated they’ll fight the decision tooth and nail, arguing there’s nothing in the Utah Constitution that allows a judge to pick a map over one drawn by lawmakers. The plaintiffs, however, argue redistricting cases in other states set a strong legal precedent for a judge to pick remedial maps when legislators fail to follow the law.
There’s also legal uncertainty around the indirect initiative. 
If the Republican Party’s effort succeeds, that could push the Utah Legislature to repeal Proposition 4 and its independent redistricting commission — but likely not until lawmakers’ 2026 general session begins in January, well past the Nov. 10 deadline to set a 2026 map. 
And it remains to be seen whether the judge agrees with plaintiffs that an indirect initiative can’t trump a voter-approved ballot initiative. 
Dueling redistricting expert reports
In addition to sorting through these legal questions, Gibson must also wade through hundreds of pages of dueling analyses from redistricting experts retained by both the Legislature and the plaintiffs.

Their slate of experts are at odds over which maps are fair and which statistical methods are best suited for a politically “lopsided” state like Utah with only four congressional districts. 
For the Legislature, three experts have filed declarations: Michael Barber, political science professor at Brigham Young University and director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy; Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics; and Jonathan Katz, professor of social sciences and statistics at the California Institute of Technology. 
The plaintiffs have retained the following experts: Chris Warshaw, a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University; Jowei Chen, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; and Kassra Oskooii, an associate political science and international relations professor at the University of Delaware. 
Pointing to Chen’s expert analysis, which compared map C with 10,000 computer-simulated maps, plaintiffs wrote it showed that “over 99.9% of simulations create one Democratic-leaning district including northern Salt Lake County, and three Republican-majority districts – reflective of Utah’s political geography and makeup.” 
“By contrast, Map C cracks Salt Lake County’s Democratic voters in half creating four safe Republican districts, a result almost never observed among neutral simulations programmed to follow Prop 4’s neutral criteria,” they wrote. “Map C is thus an extreme outlier and exhibits a ‘statistically significant degree of electoral bias in favor of the Republican Party.’”
The plaintiffs also argued Chen’s report showed Trende’s methods to assess map C’s partisan intent was “deeply flawed” and was “infected with partisan bias from start to finish.” 
Trende, in his declaration, defended his methods while arguing that Proposition 4 “clearly, in my view, forces the legislature to adopt partisan bias as one of its standards, as it is the only standard that truly measures symmetry.” 
“Plaintiffs suggest that I have cherry-picked the standards that Utah could meet in order to enable a Republican gerrymander,” Trende wrote. “To be clear, this is false. I employed partisan bias because I believe Prop. 4 mandates its use.”

Trende also disputed claims that he drew maps with the “purpose and intent of favoring Republicans and disfavoring Democrats,” calling them “untrue.” He said the final maps considered by lawmakers were based on maps drawn by computers. “Not only were they not drawn with partisan intent; they were drawn by machines deprived of any partisan information.”
Additionally, Trende wrote that map C creates “two districts that are more Democratic than a very competitive district from the prior decade which is inconsistent with any claim of a ‘free-rein’ Republican gerrymander.”
“In short,” Trende wrote, “Plaintiffs seek to replace a map with two competitive districts with one engineered to contain one safely Democratic district.”  
In contrast, Chen’s analysis said map C’s “creation of four Republican-favoring districts clearly goes well beyond any ‘natural’ level of electoral bias caused by Utah’s political geography or the political composition of the state’s voters because Map C is such an extreme statistical outlier in terms of its partisan characteristics when compared to the 10,000 computer-simulated plans.” 
“It creates more Republican-favoring districts than 99.94% of the simulated plans,” Chen wrote. “This extreme, additional level of partisan bias in Map C did not follow from Utah’s political geography and can be directly attributed to the map-drawer’s efforts to favor the Republican Party.”

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun) The Federal Bureau of Investigations raided an alleged illegal horserace gambling operation in southwest Idaho on Sunday.
But as officials release little information about the raid — which about 200 local, state and federal law enforcement officers helped with — advocates who were at the scene are denouncing the aggressive tactics they say they saw used. 
At a news conference Monday organized by the ACLU of Idaho, advocates said that everyone attending the venue in Wilder was detained, children were zip-tied, and people were struck with rubber bullets.

Jeanette Orozco described what she said she saw while she waited for her dad to be released.
“We saw piles of zip ties on the floor. We saw people being put into vans,” she said at the news conference, as counterprotestors blared audio from a speech by President Donald Trump. “We saw people being put into buses.”
In a news release Sunday, the FBI said four people were arrested and charged in law enforcement’s execution of a federal search warrant at a horse racetrack site in Wilder called La Catedral Arena. 
The FBI canceled a news conference planned for Monday afternoon, where an FBI agent and Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue were planning to speak. 
ACLU of Idaho Executive Director Leo Morales condemned the tactics.
“The government came in full force, military-style, helicopters, drones and arrested and handcuffed, everyone … including children,” Morales told reporters at a news conference near the Canyon County Courthouse in Caldwell. “No person, no Idahoan, no American should ever accept whenever a government does this to its own people.”

 What the FBI has said

About 200 law enforcement personnel helped with the raid, the FBI said, including personnel from U.S. Immigrations and Custom Enforcement; Homeland Security Investigations; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Caldwell and Nampa police departments; the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office; Idaho State Police and the Idaho Department of Correction. 
FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker said ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division helped “process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation. Their presence was limited to that specific federal responsibility and was separate from the criminal gambling investigation being led by the FBI.”
Barker said the FBI’s news conference was canceled because law enforcement officials didn’t have more information to share publicly beyond a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The document details the investigation, but does specify law enforcement’s tactics during the raid.

Nikki Ramirez-Smith, an immigration attorney who said she was at the raid, said it appeared everyone at the venue Sunday was detained — including children. 
“We do have credible information that the children were zip-tied and tied up and handcuffed,” she told reporters at a news conference. 
She said many people remain detained, including some who have no criminal history. She said it appears all children have been released. 
“I think there is going to be a lot of children in this community that are severely disturbed and upset about what happened. And I think the community needs to rally around those kids — because this was a family event,” Ramirez-Smith said. “There were toddlers there; there were 5-year-olds there. There were a number of little children who were detained, and watched a very horrific and traumatic event that I think went way beyond what was necessary.”

Ramirez-Smith said she also witnessed personnel in military uniforms that looked like the National Guard. Idaho National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Christopher Borders told the Idaho Capital Sun that the Idaho military unit “did not have any Guard personnel there.”
The FBI could not be immediately reached for comment on the raid tactics. 
 What the FBI’s criminal complaint says  

In a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Idaho on Oct. 15, FBI Special Agent Jacob Sheridan detailed the investigation into the Wilder horse racetrack that appeared to follow a tip in February.
The complaint alleges five people were involved in the illegal gambling business at La Catedral Arena including Ivan Tellez, who allegedly owns the property and administered the operation. The FBI’s criminal complaint says Tellez is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. One person named in the criminal complaint was not listed in the FBI’s arrest announcement Sunday. 
Morales, with the ACLU of Idaho, said law enforcement could’ve taken a more strategic approach. 
“But they chose to do it in the harshest, most inhumane way — by using the entire force possible, including military operation-style, to conduct this operation. What’s left now is trauma,” he said.

Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste says that in response to increased political threats against public officials nationwide, the agency has redirected an existing state intelligence post to focus more directly on protecting Washington’s legislators.
During an interview on TVW’s “Inside Olympia,” Batiste told host Austin Jenkins that a person at the Washington State Fusion Center has been tasked with monitoring potential threats “that could occur to legislative members in session or out of session.”
The change followed the June 14 killing of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Batiste said the state patrol is adapting its threat monitoring and intelligence coordination to keep pace with a more volatile political climate.
While no one was injured during an Oct. 5 break-in at the state Capitol in Olympia, Batiste said it underscored the importance of keeping people who serve the public safe.
The Fusion Center is jointly operated by the state patrol and federal partners. The center is part of a program created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks to improve communication among law enforcement, emergency management and homeland security agencies nationwide. 
The newly refocused role within the center, Batiste said, helps identify and assess threats directed toward lawmakers both at the Capitol and in their home districts.
A broader goal, Batiste said, is to ensure the center operates around the clock.
“We have ongoing conversations about the need to do what we can to fully ensure that the fusion center is stood up as a 24-seven, 365 operation,” Batiste said. “It is not. We need to ensure that that’s an ongoing set of services.”
For now, the center can activate after hours when needed. But Batiste said the goal is a permanently staffed operation capable of responding instantly to emerging threats — especially those that arise outside business hours. 
“It heightens our awareness of the need to be vigilant at all times,” Batiste said. “And to ensure we have the information and coordination needed to protect those who serve the public.”

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Meals for seniors in Kentucky are getting a $9.1 million temporary lifeline after pandemic-era funding expired, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. 
Meanwhile, roughly 576,000 Kentuckians may go without food benefits in November as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is set to run out of funds in less than two weeks if the government shutdown persists.
While the shutdown continues, Beshear said, Kentucky will also not receive funds for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families — known in Kentucky as KTAP — which provides modest monthly payments to about 15,000 impoverished families with children.
“It appears at least as of today, we will not receive those funds from the federal government,” Beshear said Monday. The state is going to foot the costs for November, but cannot guarantee anything beyond that, Beshear said.
But the state cannot afford to pick up the costs of SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, if the federal funding is not there, Beshear said.

“For November, more than 600,000 Kentuckians rely on SNAP. That’s 1 in 8 of our people, many of which are children,” he said. “This is a scary and stressful time, and team Kentucky is committed to processing benefits the moment the federal government provides the funds.”
Kentucky is already dealing with high levels of food insecurity. According to a report from Feeding America, about 17% of Kentuckians had a shortage of food in 2023. 
‘Rebuilding trust’ 
Republican state lawmakers criticized Beshear for not moving to fill the funding gap in meals for seniors last month after the administration notified Area Development Districts, which administer state programs for seniors, of an expected shortfall in the meals budget. 
The temporary funding that Beshear announced Friday comes from a previously-funded study that never took place and will help fund senior meals through the fiscal year, Beshear said. 
The legislature will need to retroactively approve the transfer of funds when it returns to Frankfort for the session in January, he said. A Senate Republican spokesman said that is expected to happen. 
“No Kentuckian should face hunger,” Beshear said. “And while I’m glad we found a temporary solution, we must ensure that we understand our people’s needs, as well as the cost controls and procedures for the senior meal program to appropriately budget and run these programs in the future.” 
Using  extra funding provided by Congress during the pandemic, Kentucky expanded meals for seniors, including providing meals for pickup, and eliminated waitlists for meals.

Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, the co-chair of the Legislative Oversight and Investigations Committee, said in a Friday statement that “the focus must be on getting meals delivered quickly and rebuilding trust with those who administer this critical program and the elderly Kentuckians who rely on it.” 
The program provides nutrition services to people 60 and older and their spouses, according to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Meals are also delivered at home to people 60 or older “who, due to illness or incapacitating disability, are unable to attend a congregate site and have no one in the home able to prepare a nutritious meal on a regular basis.” 
Background: ‘Seniors…don’t have food to eat.’
Monday’s funding transfer happened after multiple calls from Republicans in the legislature asking Beshear’s administration to find the funds. Beshear said that the transfer took so long because “there was no ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funding available” and because the state is facing a projected  $305 million revenue shortfall. 
“We’ve got to cut all the areas, because the law says we live under a balanced budget, just like each and every one of our families,” Beshear said. 
On Sept. 8, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ Department for Aging and Independent Living notified  Area Development District directors of a funding shortfall in the senior nutrition program. 
“Due to reduced federal funding and other recent federal policy changes, fewer dollars will be available and more responsibility will be shifted to states,” that letter said. It directed districts to prioritize older adults with the highest nutritional needs, reduce or stop drive thru senior citizen center meal services to maximize nutrition dollars and more. 
A Sept. 18 news release from Kentuckiana Regional Planning & Development Agency (KIDPA) said each development district would work “to assess what these funding reductions mean for their communities.” 
Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Benton. (LRC Public Information)
“The loss of funding to support the senior nutrition programs in the KIPDA region is going to have a dire impact on some of the most vulnerable members of our communities,” Jarrett Haley, KIDPA executive director, said at that time. “KIPDA is committed to working with our dedicated network of providers to minimize the harm to the seniors that rely on these services.”
Lawmakers also called on Beshear to address the problem. During an Oct. 9 committee meeting, Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, said there were “seniors calling my office … who don’t have food to eat” and asked why Beshear had not called a special session to address the problem.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa farmers are near the end of harvest season for corn and soybean crops following yet another week of above-average temperatures in the state. 
While crop progress and condition reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture have not been issued since the start of the current government shutdown, reports from past years show farmers are typically more than halfway done with corn harvest and more than 80% complete with soybean harvest at this point in October. 
In 2024, Iowa farmers had harvested 68% of corn acres and 91% of soybean acres for the mid-October reporting period. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement that harvest  was “on pace this year and maybe even a little ahead of schedule.”

Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Lehman, who farms organic corn and beans in northern Polk County, said he finished his harvest last week. He said his harvest “came early” because of disease pressure, largely Southern corn rust, that made the corn mature and dry down quicker than usual. 
“Those same issues meant that the top end of our yields was taken away by that disease pressure,” Lehman said. 
He said he has heard similar reports from other farmers — they’re out harvesting lots of corn, but yields are down. 
Soybean yields for Lehman, and he said for other farmers he has spoken to, have been “really strong.” 
Lehman said while his farm had some precipitation in the past week, he has heard from a lot of farmers that their fields are drier than they would like for them to be heading into the winter season. 
A climate report Monday from State Climatologist Justin Glisan said stations across the state reported showers of a couple of tenths of an inch of rain to a little over one inch of rain throughout the week. The statewide average precipitation was 0.55 inch for the week. 
Glisan also reported temperatures were unseasonably warm during the past week. The statewide average temperature was 61.4 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 10 degrees above the climatological normal. Some areas of the state, mostly in the southern regions, saw positive departures from the normal as much as 14 degrees. 
Iowans can expect similar precipitation amounts in the coming week and slightly cooler, though still warmer than normal temperatures, according to forecasts from the National Weather Service. 
Trade tensions in the ag market 
Lehman said his soybean market, as an organic producer whose product usually stays domestic, is fairly normal this year. 
He said, however, that most Iowa Farmers Union members don’t grow organic soybeans and are seeing fluctuating prices that are “way below” the cost of production. 
“For every bushel we’re producing, we’re anticipating we’re losing money,” Lehman said. “To be honest, if the goal is to get to more trade deals that are more fair for farmers and workers, we’re not seeing any progress on that front.” 
Trade war tensions between the U.S. and China are one of the major issues plaguing the soybean industry this season. China, which is usually the largest soybean buyer in the world, has not purchased any soybeans this year from the U.S. 
President Donald Trump has said he will provide aid to farmers who have suffered from the decrease in trade, but exact details have not been made public. Some reports have said the funding will come from a combination of the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation fund and from the revenue the U.S. has accumulated from imposing tariffs on other countries. 
Lehman said a bailout from the government would be a “small bandage on a large wound.” 
“In addition to that, the long-term damage that comes from this trade policy is very concerning,” Lehman said. “Farmers, for years, have been working to build up trade markets around the world by being reliable trade partners. Having a chaotic trade policy means that we lose some customers that don’t come back anytime soon … a trade bailout package can’t fix that in any meaningful way.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s all-Republican U.S. House delegation sent a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Monday calling for Senate Democrats to vote in support of a funding bill to end the federal government shutdown.
On day 20 of the government shutdown, Senate Democrats remained at odds with Republicans and the Trump administration on passing a short-term measure unless demands are met to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits currently set to expire at the end of the year. If the shutdown does not end Tuesday — at 21 days — it will become the second longest federal shutdown in U.S. history. The longest shutdown lasted 35 days during President Donald Trump’s first term in office.
The House passed a short-term funding bill in September, which has repeatedly failed to advance in the Senate. In the letter to Schumer, Iowa Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra called for Senate Democrats to support the continuing resolution passed by the House to reopen the government.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter said the shutdown is “inflicting real harm on the people of Iowa: women, children, farmers, veterans, seniors, and service members.” According to the legislators, more than 18,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without pay, 160,000 veterans are not able to receive assistance from regional U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offices, and 62,000 women and children supported through the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program face service disruptions in the state because of the shutdown.
The continued shutdown could cause further problems for the 276,000 Iowans on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP, as well as 680,000 Medicare beneficiaries who use telehealth services. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services issued a release Friday saying there was a “possibility” SNAP benefits would not be issued onto electronic benefits cards in November, as instructed by the federal Food and Nutrition Service.
The letter urged Schumer and Democrats to “set aside partisanship, put the American people first, and vote to immediately reopen the government.”
Miller-Meeks, who led the letter, said Americans deserve a functioning government, “not a Schumer shutdown.”
“For 20 days, Iowans have paid the price because Senate Democrats refuse to support a clean, bipartisan plan to fund the government,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “We passed a bill that keeps essential services running, pays our troops, protects families, and allows us to finish the appropriations process responsibly. It’s time for the Senate to act and put people over politics.”
Republicans and Democrats have continually sparred over which party is to blame for the shutdown. Earlier in October, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart issued a statement criticizing Iowa’s House delegation for attending campaign fundraisers and GOP leadership events instead of working to find a solution to ending the shutdown.
“Iowa Republicans have the ability right now to stop health care premiums from more than doubling for tens of thousands of Iowa families,” Hart said in a statement. “Stubbornly, they refuse to  show up to work to end this Trump Shutdown. Instead, they’ve been letting deployed Iowa National Guard troops go without pay while they attend Republican fundraisers and relax on private islands. Iowans deserve more than out-of-touch politicians who don’t do anything about rising health care costs. Voters will remember this next November.”
Feenstra, who has an “exploratory” committee to run for Iowa governor in 2026, characterized Democrats’ demands for ending the shutdown as “giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants and adding $1.5 trillion to our $37-trillion debt” in a statement Monday.
“Their recklessness put pay for our troops and WIC payments at risk, and continues to hurt our farmers, seniors, veterans, and small businesses,” Feenstra said. “I’m glad to join forces with my Iowa colleagues demanding that Senator Schumer and the Democrats end their government shutdown. Again, the Democrats are hurting Iowa families all to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants and put our country deeper into debt.”

A fuller victory might be harder to come by, though.","Signs direct voters to a polling place at Sacred Heart Church in La Plata in this photo from the 2022 elections. (File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge issued a partial ruling Monday in favor of a group of unaffiliated Maryland voters who are challenging the state’s closed primary election system.
A fuller victory might be harder to come by, though.
Judge Pamela K. Alban determined the voters had standing to file their case, but she has yet to decide whether she’ll dismiss the case on other grounds raised by the defendants — or allow it to proceed. She said she will issue a written ruling in the coming days.
Alban indicated she was skeptical of the voters’ arguments in their lawsuit that their claims were not resolved by prior case law, but said she planned to continue considering the “nuance” of the law.
“I want to think about it a bit more,” Alban said. “I imagine no matter what I do, this may not be the end.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs, a group of five Maryland voters who are not affiliated with a political party, were quick to say after Monday’s hearing that they would appeal a dismissal by Alban. But former Maryland Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, one of the attorneys, said he is “hopeful” for a favorable result.
Across the country, primary election structures vary widely. Maryland has a “partially closed” system, because political parties can choose to allow unaffiliated voters to join, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which said Maryland is one of 18 states with either completely closed or partially closed primaries.

The group of voters in the Maryland suit are challenging the fact that the state government funds primary elections that are not open to all voters, since voters must generally affiliate with the Democratic or Republican party to cast their ballots in primaries — unless it’s a non-partisan race. Their suit names the State Board of Elections and various state officials as defendants.
Daniel Kobrin, an assistant attorney general representing the defendants, argued that the case was focused on an alleged “waste of taxpayer money,” and that the plaintiffs didn’t have the standing to sue based on their status as taxpayers.
Eric Gunderson, an attorney for the voters, said that the plaintiffs are not arguing that the state shouldn’t fund primaries. Rather, they are arguing that, if the state continues to sponsor those elections, they should be open to all. The political parties could opt to fund their own primary elections if they wished to continue restricting participation, Gunderson said.
Alban agreed with him, ruling that the case was an elections matter — not a taxpayer one — and that the five plaintiffs had standing to sue because they are all registered voters in the state.
But Kobrin also argued in his filings that previous cases have already decided the issue, and so the Maryland voters’ suit should be dismissed. In particular, he referenced a pair of rulings from the Maryland Supreme Court, from 1946 and 2004, respectively — Hennegan v. Geartner and Suessman v. Lamone.
“Candidly, I think that’s your strongest argument,” the judge told Kobrin, before opening up the floor for him to speak on the legal precedent.
Kobrin asserted that, per prior court rulings, the state’s “well established” reasons for sponsoring primary elections must be weighed against the burden faced by unaffiliated voters, who are fenced out of the process. The state’s needs outweigh the voters’ burden, he said.
If the state didn’t hold primaries, it would run the risk of general election ballots looking more like “NFL pre-season rosters, with hundreds of names,” Kobrin joked. Primaries, he said, “avoid the chaos of a general election with dozens of candidates for each race.”
Kobrin also argued that, although the Maryland Constitution provides the right to vote, it doesn’t necessarily confer upon all Marylanders the right to participate in party primaries.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Of course there’s a right to vote,” Kobrin said. “What they don’t have is the right to participate in partisan races with a party they’re not affiliated with.”
Turning to Gunderson, the judge called the legal precedent his “biggest challenge.”
Gunderson argued that neither of the two main cases cited by Kobrin centered on the issue at the center of their claim: the state’s decision to put its resources toward primary elections.
“If the parties want to have closed primary systems, they should pay for them,” he said.
Because neither of the two state Supreme Court cases deal directly with that issue, Gunderson argued that they shouldn’t bar the plaintiffs from moving forward with their case, and arguing about the precedent in trial.
But Alban prodded back, adding that Gunderson’s “seemed like a really tight reading of those cases.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vote-sign-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 19:01:31.015935

Gov. Larry Rhoden announced that Nick Lamb will serve as the department’s new secretary on Monday afternoon. The governor said in a press release that the 31-year veteran of prison systems in Iowa, New Mexico and Illinois was selected after “an extensive interview process and aggressive national search.”

“We found the right person that will help keep our corrections system strong and safe for both inmates and officers,” Rhoden said. “Nick’s leadership will ensure strong implementation of rehabilitation services that will reduce recidivism and keep our communities safe.”
Lamb is currently the deputy director of institutional operations for the Iowa prison system, overseeing nine facilities, 2,500 employees, and approximately 8,500 inmates. He’s also a retired staff sergeant with the U.S. Army National Guard. He served 21 years.
Rhoden also thanked Kellie Wasko, who resigned in a letter sent over Labor Day weekend that announced Oct. 20 as her departure date.
The three and a half years during which Wasko presided over the state’s prison system were some of the most eventful – and controversial – in recent memory for the department.
Her resignation came at the same time 20 lawmakers asked her to step down, although Rhoden said Wasko made her decision before those lawmakers went public with their demand.
Three weeks later, at a special session of the state legislature, lawmakers voted to back a plan to build a new, $650 million men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls. Lawmakers rejected an $825 million plan to build in southern Lincoln County in February, during the regular legislative session.
Prison leader quits as prison vote looms

Wasko had drawn criticism for her handling of the prison project’s controversies over location and funding, and for policy changes she’d instituted during her time in office.
Rhoden said he never lost confidence in Wasko, but also said in September that her departure could help clear a path for a new men’s prison.
Wasko came to South Dakota in 2022 from Colorado, where she’d worked first as a nurse and then an administrator for that state’s corrections department. 
Lamb, her replacement, will begin in mid-November. Brent Fluke, the deputy DOC secretary, will act as interim secretary until then.

In televised remarks made Oct. 10, Hegseth said, “Today we are announcing that we are signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.”
Later that same day, Hegseth posted on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, a clarification writing, “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States – nor anything like a base.”
Records show Idaho Gov. Little, Sen. Risch weren’t aware Qatar facility announcement was coming

Records obtained under the Idaho Public Records Act by the Idaho Capital Sun show that several elected state and federal leaders in Idaho, including Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, who serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Gov. Brad Little were caught completely off guard by Hegseth’s announcement and had no idea it was coming. 
Then on Thursday, Risch, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson and Little, all R-Idaho, wrote a joint letter to Hegseth asking for a briefing on the announcement and answers to several questions. 
“Like many foreign military sale agreements to allies, the plans to sell F-15QAs to Qatar have been in the process for years,” Crapo, Little, Risch and Simpson wrote in the letter. “However, we were given no advance notice that this agreement had been finalized or that it was going to be formally announced. While Qatar, as a long-time U.S. ally, provides substantial support to the U.S. military in the Middle East, such as allowing a U.S. base hosting thousands of U.S.-ready-to-fight-warriors, it is understandable that Qatar’s history of funding Iran-backed terrorist groups like Hamas and the extremism espoused by Qatari-based Al Jazeera has raised concerns among Idahoans.”
 Idaho elected officials raise several questions in letter to Hegseth

The Idaho Republican leaders identified several questions for Hegseth about cost and security concerns, including:

Given the technological capabilities of the Mountain Home AFB range complex, what measures will be implemented to safeguard against any compromise to our national security?
What screening, intelligence, or vetting processes are in place to ensure no trainees have ties to hostile or extremist organizations?
Are there any specific security concerns for the surrounding communities and for U.S. military personnel stationed at Mountain Home AFB?
Is there a long-term plan to convert Mountain Home AFB into a multi-national training facility for foreign allies?
How many Qatari personnel will be involved in the training mission?
How long will they be deployed to Idaho?
Will families be allowed to accompany Qatari personnel, and what restrictions, if any, will be placed on their travel?
Is there a cost to American taxpayers to house, train, and feed the foreign military personnel covered by this agreement?

“In the interest of informing our constituents, maintaining open lines of communication, and fostering closer federal and state collaboration regarding this training squadron, we would like the department to provide more information about the plans and intentions of this mission now that it appears to be finalized,” Crapo, Little, Risch and Simpson wrote to Hegseth. “We request that you provide a briefing to the Idaho Congressional Delegation, as well as for the governor of Idaho and state legislators potentially impacted by the agreement, in Boise on the details of this agreement.”

Idaho’s fourth member of Congress, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, did not sign the letter to Hegseth, but also requested a briefing on the announcement. In a letter to a group of Idaho legislators who call themselves the Gang of Eight, Fulcher wrote that he also requested a briefing from Hegseth, and that Hegseth’s office promised a response. 
“Since the Oct. 10 announcement by Sec. Hegseth, I have been in touch with various federal sources to learn as much detail as possible,” Fulcher wrote in the letter to Idaho legislators. “In addition, I have reached out directly to (Hegseth), expressing my disappointment with the lack of communication and to request a briefing. The secretary’s office has acknowledged receipt and pledged a response.”
Risch issued a press release announcing the joint letter to Hegseth and released the text of their letter to Hegseth. 
Efforts to reach Little’s office on Monday afternoon were not immediately successful. 
Trump has announced that he is changing the title of the Department of Defense to the Department of War and changing Hegseth’s title to Secretary of War, but the name change requires Congressional approval to become permanent. 
Hegseth worked as a host on Fox News prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump to serve as secretary of defense.

The proposed bill, which was circulated for co-sponsorship Monday by Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), Rep. Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), would include warnings about the presence of PFAS — even though the state has been unable to finalize a PFAS limit for groundwater. 
That provision would allow private well owners to be warned about the presence of PFAS despite the yearslong political quicksand that has mired the effort to enact a contaminant limit for the class of chemicals. The lack of a PFAS standard has been a regular sticking point in negotiations over legislation to spend $125 million already set aside for PFAS clean up. 
While the state doesn’t have a PFAS groundwater standard, it does have standards for nearly 150 other chemicals such as aluminum, nitrates and lead. 
About one-third of Wisconsinites get their drinking water from private wells, which don’t come with the same warnings that are often required of municipal water systems. 
“The public should be able to know if there is any threat to the safety of the water they and their children drink every day,” the co-sponsorship memo states. “This bill would provide Wisconsinites with more knowledge so they can protect themselves and their children from pollutants and allow them to take advantage of local and county-level testing initiatives and state-level assistance opportunities like the Well Compensation Grant Program.” 
After the legislation’s announcement, environmental groups celebrated it as a potential win for clean water. 
“Wisconsinites have a right to know about pollution that may be impacting the health of their families,” said Peter Burress, government affairs manager for Wisconsin Conservation Voters. “This legislation is a common sense solution that will protect Wisconsin families. It’s unacceptable that so many Wisconsin families could be drinking water contaminated with PFAS, lead, and nitrates — chemicals tied to cancer and birth defects  — without ever being told.”

The cutting of several executive positions comes as the network’s new president and CEO Steve Leffler aims to create a leaner organization and move more decision making power to the hospitals.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, in Burlington on May 31, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
UVM Health announced Monday that it was laying off several top executives at the network level. The change comes as new leadership takes shape with an emphasis on shifting power out of the network and back to its member hospitals. 
The network will phase out the roles of Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer and Chief of Staff by the end of the year. Jason Williams, who worked as the Chief External Relations Officer at the network level, also decided to leave his post as part of the transition, according to an email the network’s new CEO, Steve Leffler sent staff Monday afternoon. It is not clear if the network will fill his position or disperse his responsibilities to others in his department. 
University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, and Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin, three hospitals in upstate New York and a home health and hospice program comprise the hospital network.

High executive compensation at the network has come under scrutiny in recent years. In 2024, 19 executives at the network received a combined $3 million in end of year bonuses. In a September press release specifically weighing in on the rising cost of healthcare in the state, Governor Phil Scott specifically called out “perverse financial incentives and executive bonuses paid for by skyrocketing premiums.”
The changes come as part of an effort to make the network leaner and more efficient, Leffler, said in his Monday email. He officially began the new role last week, after former president and CEO Sunny Eappen stepped down. Leffler will remain in his role as president of University of Vermont Medical Center while also leading the network.
During its September budget decisions, the Green Mountain Care Board, the state’s main health care regulator, brought extra scrutiny to the hospital network for the high costs of care at its biggest hospital, UVM Medical Center, and its expensive administrative arm. Eappen’s departure was, in part, a reaction to the mounting public pressure, trustees of the hospital and network previously told VTDigger. 
Care board chair Owen Foster told VTDigger that a leaner network is a step in the right direction for the type of change he hopes to see at UVM Health. “Those decisions were definitely in line with some of the criticisms and concerns that the care board has had about excessive layers of management and lack of local control. It sounds to me like they’re making hard decisions,” Foster said. “Certainly for those people [who] are impacted, it’s painful and difficult, but overall it sounds like it’s a necessary course correction, and we appreciate the effort.” 
As part of his new role, Leffler outlined a vision for a less network-centric organization, which he said would vest more decision making power in the hospitals and those closer to the level of care.
Under Eappen, the president of each partner hospital reported to the network’s Chief Operating Officer. Now, they will once again report directly to the network’s CEO. 
In addition to the layoffs, Leffler announced that the chair of each hospital’s board of trustees will have a voting seat at the network board. He added that he will continue working on ways to involve the trustees of the member hospitals more meaningfully, including decisions on hospital budgets. Right now, the network board holds the decision-making power for its member hospitals’ budgets. 
It is likely that the network can expect more changes to follow in time, Leffler said in his email. He promised transparency throughout the process.
“I know change can bring uncertainty, but a few things are clear. We are staying together as a health system. Every health care partner, team and shared service in our health system plays a vital role, and we are stronger because we work as one,” he wrote. “These changes are about better supporting you and the work you do as a care provider, so we can stay focused on what matters most: our patients, our people and our mission.”
Foster, at the care board, added that changes at University of Vermont Medical Center are likely to be a major component of network-wide change. He noted that in the settlement agreement the hospital made with the care board for exceeding its budget last year, the hospital agreed to allocate resources for a structural transition. Foster said he hopes the hospital addresses its long waitlists for primary care and screenings by moving care out of the hospital.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 21:57:13+00:00,CT Mirror,"Lamont names 4 to PURA board, including Thomas Wiehl as chief",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/new-pura-board/,"The appointments, which follow the resignation of former chair Marissa Gillett, will almost completely transform the makeup of PURA.","Gov. Ned Lamont began his rebuild of Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority on Monday, appointing four new members to the body and naming its new chief, the consumer advocacy attorney Thomas Wiehl.
Wiehl, of Madison, will replace Marissa Gillett, who resigned from her role as the state’s top utilities regulatory earlier this month. Joining him will be three new commissioners: former state Rep. Holly Cheeseman of East Lyme, energy policy professor Janice Beecher of New Britain and investor Everett Smith of Greenwich.
“These four nominees have an extensive amount of expertise and a diverse set of experience in energy and utilities,” Lamont said in a statement announcing his picks.
“In nominating new commissioners and completing a full board, I implore everyone to remember that it’s the public whose interests should always come first and must be protected,” he continued. “The entire purpose of PURA is centered on the understanding that utility companies all provide an essential public service that everybody depends on, and we must have an independent authority providing careful, rigorous oversight to ensure that these services are safe and reliable and that the consumers paying for them are doing so at just and reasonable rates.” 
The appointments, which Lamont was largely commended on, will almost completely transform the makeup of PURA, which is in charge of reviewing and approving the rates charged by the state’s major investor-owned utilities such as Eversource and Illuminating.
Lamont opted not to re-nominate commissioner Michael Caron, who has served at PURA since 2012. His departure will make Vice Chair David Arconti, who was appointed by Lamont last year, the longest-tenured member of the authority’s board.
Wiehl comes to PURA from the Office of Consumer Counsel, the state agency that advocates on behalf of utility customers during rate cases. He served as the office’s legal and regulatory director.
The other new appointees — with the exception of Cheeseman — also fulfill Lamont’s public desire to find candidates who come from professional backgrounds outside the halls of the State Capitol.
Beecher is a professor emeritus at Michigan State University, where she previously served as director of the school’s Institute of Public Utilities. She is also the editor-in-chief of the trade journal, “Utilities Policy.” Smith is the founder and chief executive of GoldenSet Capital, which has investments in solar, wind, energy storage and natural gas. He previously worked in finance for GE Capital. 
Cheeseman served in the legislature from 2016 to 2024, and was a member of the Energy and Technology Committee.
In selecting his nominees, Lamont said he looked for candidates who could “hit the ground running, with a breadth of experience.” However, a number of controversies swirling around Gillett’s departure also made the recruitment process difficult. Lamont previously told reporters that he’d been turned down by more than one potential hire. 
PURA has operated with only three commissioners for most of Lamont’s time in office, despite lawmakers voting to increase the size of its board to five members in 2019.
The authority’s ranks were further depleted last month when Gillett suddenly stepped down amid mounting criticism over her leadership style and threats of an impeachment inquiry from Republicans in the state legislature. Those threats came after it was revealed by the Hartford Courant that Gillett’s chief of staff had directed the other commissioners to route all requests for information from staff members through her office — a policy that Gillett previously denied existed. Her resignation took effect on Friday, Oct. 10.
Adding to the authority’s myriad challenges are public frustrations over Connecticut’s chronically-high cost of electricity as well as complaints from utility executives who say that the state’s regulatory environment is bad for business. 
When asked about PURA’s relationship with the utility companies on Monday, Wiehl said that it “should be improved” while avoiding any explicit critiques of Gillett’s leadership.
“My focus is on being collaborative, making sure everyone at the commission, from staff all the way up to every commissioner, is part of the conversation,” Wiehl said. 
Wiehl’s appointment drew praise from a spectrum of onlookers that included both utilities as well as consumer advocates.
In a statement, Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said the company was supportive of the governor’s picks, and specifically singled out Wiehl as a “moderating presence” while at OCC.
“With this new commission, there is a genuine opportunity for balance and collaboration among all parties to ensure that the needs of Connecticut residents and businesses are met in the most affordable and transparent way through an open, lawful, and predictable regulatory process,” Ratliff said. “Critical needs exist for state and regional infrastructure investments to maintain a reliable and resilient grid that can accommodate new sources of generation to meet historic levels of electric demand projected in the coming years.”
A spokesperson for Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, declined to comment on the picks Monday. 
Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, said he believed Wiehl would likely continue the tough regulatory approach established under Gillett. “It’s clear that [Lamont] has chosen to stand up to the bullying by Eversource and UI,” he said.
Lamont’s office said the picks will also shift the partisan makeup of PURA to an even split between Democrats — Wiehl and Arconti — and Republicans — Cheeseman and Smith. Beecher, a political independent, will round out the group. 
Republicans had been broadly critical of both Gillett’s leadership as well as Lamont’s decision to leave other vacancies at PURA unfilled for years. House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said the governor’s appointments on Monday were both welcome and overdue.
“I’m hoping that a new broom sweeps clean and that we will be moving Connecticut in a better direction,” Candelora said. 
Each of the new members will serve in an interim capacity until their appointments are confirmed by lawmakers during the next legislative session. 
Wiehl said that his first day of work will be on Tuesday, and that he will be followed by Cheeseman and Beecher in the coming weeks. 
Smith, who may need more time to consult with state ethics officials and divest from his holdings in the energy industry, is expected to join the other commissioners at a later date, Lamont said. As a result, Caron is expected to stay on for the time being until he can be replaced by Smith.
Caron said Monday that he felt “lucky” to have served at PURA, and offered praise for Lamont’s new crop of commissioners. “I think he’s got a good crew… they’ll having no learning curve to speak of,” he said. 
In the short term, the appointments also solve a thorny question brought about by Gillett’s departure: whether PURA, with just two commissioners, could issue final decisions on rate cases and other pending matters.
Lamont’s office took the cautious view that state law requires PURA to have at least three members in order to reach a quorum, according to spokesman Rob Blanchard. As a result, the governor needed to appoint at least one member right away in order to keep the authority functioning.
PURA’s current docket includes requests to raise rates for customers of both United Illuminating and the Yankee Gas Company, as well as a proposed sale of Eversource’s Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
Wiehl said on Monday that he would recuse from those cases due to close work on them with OCC. However, his joining PURA will give the authority the quorum needed to render a decision.
Late last week, UI offered a proposed settlement to PURA that would increase the company’s annual revenues by $63.7 million. That amount is less than original $105 million increase sought by the company when it filed its rate case last year, and above OCC’s proposal for a $54 million increase.
PURA is currently scheduled to issue a final decision in that case on Oct. 28.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PURA_Lamont-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

Sen. Sam Douglass, R-Orleans, said last week he would resign effective noon on Monday after comments he and his wife made in a Young Republicans group chat rife with hateful messages leaked, making national headlines.
However, as of 3 p.m. on Monday, the office of Gov. Phil Scott had not received official notice of the first-term lawmaker’s resignation. And as of Monday late morning, Douglass also remained chair of the Orleans County Republican Committee, the body expected to help identify his replacement.
Gov. Phil Scott has the power to appoint people to vacant legislative seats in a process laid out in state law. Normally, the governor would request a list of recommended replacements from the party committee from the district represented.

The Orleans County Senate district encompasses 20 towns, including Montgomery in Franklin County, and Burke, Newark, Sheffield and Sutton in Caledonia County. Any of the district’s towns with an active GOP caucus can have a say in Douglass’ replacement, according to Chet Greenwood, Orleans County Republican Committee treasurer and a former longtime chair. 
Greenwood said that as of Monday morning, Douglass had not resigned as chair of the county party, adding that he was “not sure what his plans are.”
“It’s going to be hard for him to keep his position,” he added.  
Douglass did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether he intended to remain chair of the county committee. 
Anya Tynio, who previously ran for Vermont’s U.S. House seat as a Republican, currently serves as the Orleans County Republican Committee’s vice chair. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. 
The county committee has not formally begun the process of replacing Douglass, Greenwood said. A meeting requires a warning at least three days ahead of time, and the committee has not yet warned a meeting. He was unsure when the process will begin for compiling potential replacements for Douglass. 
The governor “can take as long as he wants” once he has the list of names, Greenwood said. 
Douglass has faced intense pressure to resign from leaders across the political spectrum in Vermont since a Politico report last Tuesday revealed bigoted remarks Young Republican leaders across the country made, including Douglass and his wife, Brianna Douglass, in a Telegram group chat.
Following Politico’s story, Vermont elected officials across the political spectrum quickly called for Douglass to resign. 
The exposé revealed members of the Young Republicans Telegram chat referring to rape as “epic” and expressing “love” for Hitler, in addition to a slew of other racist and homophobic comments. 
It’s unclear who might top the list of recommendations to replace Douglass. In the 2024 Republican primary, he defeated Aime Conrad Bellavance. The seat was previously held by Vermont Senate stalwart Bobby Starr, a moderate Democrat. 
In an early bid for legislative office more than a year in advance, Gaston Bathalon, a Democrat from Troy, announced Monday he’d run for the Orleans County Senate seat Douglass is vacating. The election isn’t until November 2026.
Bathalon, an Army veteran, has served on the Troy Selectboard and local school boards.

An Iowa company that helps state and federal agencies with taxpayer-financed health care improvement programs is being sued for alleged sexual harassment.
Telligen Inc., of West Des Moines, which is under contract with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to help 14 states pursue various health care initiatives, is being sued by Trisha Boughn of Linn County. In part, the lawsuit alleges negligence in the hiring and supervision of Ricardo Berman, the company’s former state health solutions director.
“Berman harassed Trisha and other women on the team by asking them about their personal lives, showing them a semi-nude photo of his neighbor, suggesting they work in the nude, complaining about how American women cry about ‘rape’ and how this is a problem he had experienced personally,” the lawsuit states. “Telligen either failed to notice or simply didn’t care.”
“We are aware of the situation but cannot comment on ongoing or pending litigation,” said Matt Meyer, a Telligen spokesman.

According to the lawsuit, Telligen hired Boughn in October 2018, and she is currently a program specialist for the company, reviewing patient records and making assessments of nursing homes.
In May 2024, according to the lawsuit, Telligen hired Ricardo Berman, giving him supervisory responsibilities over Boughn and seven other female employees, while he worked remotely from Washington, D.C.
Berman, the lawsuit claims, told Boughn he intended to make her a “bad ass” manager to the extent that she wouldn’t recognize herself in six months, after which his conduct “quickly escalated to inappropriate and unwelcome behavior.”
According to the lawsuit, Berman began referring to Boughn and program specialist Amanda Hope as his “angels” and as “Charlie’s Angels.”
Berman, the lawsuit claims, “insisted on holding repeated, unnecessary one-on-one meetings with Trisha, demanded constant reports about who she was speaking to and the substance of those conversations, and incessantly called her during work hours, disrupting her ability to perform her job duties.”
During those conversations, Berman allegedly steered the discussion toward matters unrelated to work and which were “almost always sexual in nature.” At the same time, the lawsuit claims, Berman knew little about the company and showed “consistent indifference towards understanding Telligen’s work.”
At the end of July 2024, Berman set up a meeting for Boughn, Hope and himself to meet in person and discuss their work during a September 2024 weekend get-together in Des Moines.
In the weeks leading up to that meeting, the lawsuit alleges, Berman frequently made unsolicited comments to Boughn about co-workers being interested in him or wanting to date him, and during one work meeting remarked, “You wouldn’t believe the number of people who work naked.”
According to the lawsuit, in August 2024, Berman told Boughn and other team members that he used a telescope to photograph a semi-nude woman who lived in the apartment below him, then proceeded to “enlarge the image and display it on the Teams meeting for all participants” to see, saying, “See, she’s got on her sexy panties. All kinds of people work naked. I get porn for free.”
On a separate Teams call, Berman allegedly remarked, “American women are dangerous. You can have sex with a European woman and nobody thinks anything of it, but you can have sex with an American woman and suddenly it’s rape.”
Lawsuit: Women given vibrators as ‘gifts’
During the September meeting in Des Moines, Berman allegedly invited Boughn and Hope to his hotel for a planned gift exchange. “Once they got to Berman’s room, he proceeded to turn the lights low and put on some music,” the lawsuit claims. Berman then gave Boughn and Hope their gifts, each with a card that read, “Manager meditation tool, earth to moon.”
The lawsuit alleges that “inside each bag was the same ‘gift’ — a large purple vibrator. Trisha and Amanda were visibly shocked and speechless. Berman broke the silence, saying with a big smile, ‘I want my managers to relax.’”
After Hope excused herself to use the restroom, “Berman grabbed Trisha’s head and forced his tongue into her mouth and down her throat,” the lawsuit alleges. “Trisha put her hands up, pulled back from Berman, and said, ‘Too much.’”
After Hope returned, the lawsuit claims, the two women left Berman’s room and Hope informed Boughn that Berman had once tried to kiss her while telling her she “had never been properly kissed.”
Two days later, as Hope and Boughn prepared to leave Des Moines, Berman allegedly requested a 15-minute meeting with them in the hotel lobby at which he angrily announced, “Starting now we are going to keep everything professional,” instructed Boughn and Hope to alert him if he was making them uncomfortable, and then blamed Boughn for ruining the weekend.
The lawsuit alleges that Boughn was distraught in the days that followed, aware that Berman was in prearranged meetings with the human resources staff and Telligen executives.
Hope, the lawsuit claims, shared with Boughn “inappropriate, flirtatious texts” she had received in the past from Dan Shipley, Telligen’s senior human resources business partner, which the lawsuit says undermined Boughn’s faith in human resources and its ability to properly handle any complaint she might file regarding Berman.
The lawsuit also claims Shipley once told Boughn about a time he and the female human resources director at Telligen had gone out drinking and the director got “very drunk” and was driving somewhere when he made her “stop the vehicle so he could urinate in the street.”
On Sept. 13, 2024, according to the lawsuit, Boughn reported Berman’s alleged sexual harassment and sexual assault to Telligen and, with the encouragement of human resources, she filed a police report on the incident. Days later, Telligen’s vice president, Neal Cohen, allegedly called Boughn to apologize for what happened on his watch. Berman was subsequently terminated, the lawsuit claims.
“Telligen then demoted Trisha,” the lawsuit alleges. “They (also) told Trisha the promotion Berman gave her was never approved, so she was not really a manager … Telligen promptly disinvited Trisha and Amanda from manager meetings to which they were previously invited.”
The lawsuit claims that when Boughn asked Telligen executives about the process used to hire Berman, they responded in a manner that indicated they “did not know much about Berman, despite hiring him for such an important position.”
The lawsuit alleges that Berman has a “known history of sexual harassment,” and that if Telligen had performed a background check or spoken to his previous employers, it “could have discovered he had multiple sexual harassment complaints filed against him at prior jobs and posed a threat to Telligen’s female employees.”
Berman, the lawsuit claims, “was wholly unqualified for a director position at Telligen” and had “virtually no understanding of how to do his job … He was unfamiliar with the nature of Telligen’s work and required significant time and explanation from staff to understand the organization’s activities.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for negligent hiring, negligent supervision, retaliation, and fostering a hostile work environment that led to sexual harassment.
Telligen has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was filed last week in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Telligen is a for-profit company that was first created in 1972 as the non-profit Iowa Foundation for Medical Care. For years, the foundation was the federally designated quality improvement organization tasked with improving health care outcomes in Iowa and other states.
Between 2011 and 2013, the foundation merged with other entities and became Telligen, an employee-owned company that continues to work with state and federal governments on health care improvement.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)LEXINGTON — Natasha DeJarnett, a University of Louisville assistant professor of medicine, said her speciality is air quality and heart disease, though in recent months she’s been talking much more with community members about another topic: a possible influx of data centers.
A wide range of questions and concerns have come up: What data centers could mean for utility and electricity costs; where data centers will be placed; how nearby property values could be impacted; and how data centers will impact public health?
DeJarnett,  speaking Monday afternoon at a conference hosted by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, remembered talking with someone from Dulles, Virginia, an area that’s become one of the nation’s biggest hubs for massive, electricity-intensive “hyperscale” data centers. 
“What she said was, ‘You don’t want a data center in your backyard.’ And I think that’s been a common conversation that we’ve heard in these community meetings,” DeJarnett said. “People are deeply concerned about their families and their children and the future of their children.” 
DeJarnett, other University of Louisville researchers and an attorney with the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council told the audience of state officials and industry stakeholders the answers to questions about data centers’ impacts remain to be seen. 
But the potential considerations, both positive and negative, of what these large-scale operations could bring to Kentucky communities are numerous. 
“Hyperscale” data centers are essentially massive computer warehouses that support a range of online services from artificial intelligence to credit card processing. These data centers also tend to use a tremendous amount of electricity to power the computers and water to cool them. A number of data center developers are eyeing Kentucky, particularly after state lawmakers enhanced tax incentives for such operations. 
Based on conversations she’s had in Jefferson County, Oldham County and outside of Kentucky, DeJarnett said one of the primary considerations is the location of a data center. She pointed to research by the California-based Kapor Foundation that found data center locations in that state tend to be in places that already have heavier pollution, including minority communities that stand to be disproportionately affected by data centers.

Byron Gary, the Kentucky Resources Council attorney on the panel, pointed to a proposed data center along Camp Ground Road in western Jefferson County in a “predominantly black, predominantly low-income neighborhood” in an area “already overburdened with industry.” 
Yet another consideration discussed by the panel: the cost of electricity infrastructure, both generating power and transmitting it, to serve data centers and how much average ratepayers should bear. 
Ted Smith, the panel’s moderator and director of the University of Louisville’s Center for Health Air, Water and Soil, referenced reporting from the Wall Street Journal that compared the scale of data center construction to the boom and bust of railroad expansion in the 19th century. When railroad companies went bankrupt, it left the excess railroad tracks stranded.  
“If you over build the power infrastructure, and it’s railroads — you then you have a problem, right?” Smith said.
He said the costs to build excess power infrastructure to support data centers could hypothetically be passed to ratepayers if there’s a downturn.
In one instance, Kentucky’s utility regulator is considering a request from Kentucky’s largest utility to build billions of dollars in new gas-fired power generation to support prospective data centers.  
Gary, the attorney, said such large data centers do create some jobs, and some communities “are desperately in need of more funding for schools” in the form of property taxes. But the benefits and drawbacks of such a large project, he said, need to be debated in public. 
He said that public debate isn’t necessarily an opportunity for a community to “shout” down a data center project but instead an opportunity to ask questions about how it could best serve a community. 
“Transparency has to be a part of it.” Gary said. “They have a say in, ‘Is this the best place for it? What benefit are we going to get as a community?’”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2400-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

Workers from firm Wicker Construction are repairing one of the “major” leaks on Monday, a press release from the city said. 
“For years, efforts to identify and repair these leaks have not been dealt with in a swift and aggressive manner, for whatever reason,” said Steve Hutton, Jackson’s recreation manager. “That stops now.”
Hutton referenced “million-dollar plus” water bills incurred by leaks at the zoo over the years. During a recent status conference with U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate, third-party utility JXN Water said the city owed over $6 million in unpaid water bills, and that the largest amount came from the Jackson Zoo.
It’s unclear how many leaks are at the zoo, which is located in west Jackson. In 2015, the release said, the city noticed that the moat surrounding the zoo’s chimpanzees, a buffer between visitors and the animals, was losing water. The city then used a fire hydrant to keep the moat full, WLBT reported.
Yet, after officials relocated the chimpanzees and turned the hydrant off, the moat remained full, revealing a “major water line leak” that ran all day, every day. The leak existed “for years,” the release said.
“It seems like when we identify one problem, it results in another problem being discovered,” said Peter Teeuwissen, Jackson’s chief administrative officer. “The voters made it clear they were hiring us to fix difficult problems. We absolutely will get these problems fixed.”
Wicker Construction will focus on fixing the major leak Monday, and then will address leaks within the moat and smaller ones around the zoo, the city said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/06080617/DJI_0792-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

It has not been previously reported.Joining Scott, of Virginia, were Reps. Frederica Wilson of Florida, Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, Mark Takano and Mark DeSaulnier of California, Lucy McBath of Georgia, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania and Yassamin Ansari of Arizona.  Dems reject Trump hand in curriculumThe Democrats said the agency’s proposal would insert President Donald Trump’s administration’s “preferences of a particular understanding of American history in curriculum, professional development, and educational programs.” Civics is a branch of social studies that focuses on rights and obligations of citizenship. Though it’s long enjoyed bipartisan support, the subject has found itself engulfed in the education culture wars regarding how and what is taught as America reckons with its complicated history. The department announced last month it would be prioritizing “patriotic education” when it comes to discretionary grants.  The department’s proposed definition of “patriotic education” calls for a presentation of America’s history that is grounded in an “accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of the American founding and foundational principles” and “the concept that commitment to America's aspirations is beneficial and justified.” But the Democrats found this definition to be “concerning,” saying this framing “creates the potential for schools that teach accurate and complex histories of slavery, Indigenous displacement, the Women’s Suffrage Movement, and the Civil Rights Movement to be limited in their ability to access certain discretionary grants.” Coalition to promote patriotismThe department’s September announcement came the same day it unveiled a civics education coalition that includes a slew of prominent conservative advocacy organizations, such as the Heritage Foundation and Turning Point USA. Left out of that initiative are some of the more traditional civics and education groups. Instead, many of the coalition’s groups have promoted Trump’s political agenda and promote a vision of U.S. identity that downplays historical wrongs associated with race and gender and projects the country as an exceptional force for good.“Some of these groups have expressed contempt for the teaching of history that does not align with the version of history they believe students should learn, and these same groups would prefer to limit children’s access to materials that depict the realities of slavery in America or the Civil Rights Movement,” the Democrats wrote. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

Community members said they’re glad to have more time to find alternative arrangements in a sparse child care landscape, but some still question the company’s management of the facility.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Mount Snow will postpone a plan to reduce its child care offerings to the local community, a spokesperson for the resort’s operator said in a statement Monday. The planned cuts, which were originally slated to take effect in November, will instead move ahead next summer.
The West Dover ski area announced earlier this month that its child care center would transition to an “employee-first” model after years of operating at a financial loss. The cuts would have affected 16 families and an undetermined number of staff, according to a spokesperson for Vail Resorts, the company that has owned and operated Mount Snow since 2019.

Parents and former employees have suggested that a higher number of families could be impacted, and that roughly a dozen staff will be laid off.
On Saturday, affected families and local child care providers met with resort leadership and officials to share concerns and work toward a solution.
“After thoughtful and engaging conversations with the community and coming to further understand their concerns, the team at Mount Snow has decided to extend our community childcare for the 16 impacted families until June 19, 2026, in hopes of better supporting their transition to alternative childcare solutions,” said Samara Sausville, a spokesperson for Vail Resorts, in an email Monday.
Elly Dagg, an affected parent, said she was grateful that Mount Snow responded to public pushback around the decision to limit community child care offerings on short notice. Resort managers called parents individually last Friday to deliver the news that families would have seven additional months to make arrangements before child care changes would be implemented, Dagg said. 
The additional time to plan for switching child care providers is particularly important to a single parent with one income, she said.  
“I’m glad we have this extra time,” Dagg said. “It now gives us a chance to figure out new care.”
The circumstances prompting Mount Snow’s transition, which will proceed as planned in June 2026, remain contested by employees and community members. 
The postponement comes after a recent petition calling on the resort to reverse its decision garnered over 250 signatures, according to Amber Good, an impacted parent who organized the petition.
Good said she is grateful that Mount Snow gave families more time to plan for the changes on the horizon, but that the decision still abdicates the “social responsibility” of maintaining community child care offerings.
Jenn Wood, a former lead teacher at the facility, resigned last week after the cuts were announced. The center’s operational deficit was known among staff members for months but was exacerbated by mismanagement and overstaffing, Woods said. 
The 12 staff members affected by the coming layoffs may leave before June due to the uncertainty of their employment, and two other staff members besides Wood have resigned since the announcement, she said. 
Sausville referred in an email to state guidelines around child care staffing, and said the center works “according to these mandates.” “Our goal is to retain as many team members as possible and explore opportunities for any impacted employees to apply for other roles at the resort,” she added.
Wood said she is helping one impacted teacher open their own child care center in order to ensure secure employment and offer alternative child care options for families. 
Andrea Sumner, director at Kids in the Country child care center, said last week that her local operation may expand if she’s able to hire enough staff.
Mount Snow’s announcement only postpones the inevitable challenge of finding child care in the rural Deerfield Valley, Good said. Parents are working with child care advocates and local representatives to find grants and other resources to fill the looming gap. 
“There is no alternative child care … The only thing we can do is create more child care,” Good said. “Eight months is a much more reasonable timeframe than just six weeks, but we still have a lot of work ahead. Parents are stepping up to tackle the childcare shortage that we expect in the valley next summer.”
Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover, helped facilitate Saturday’s meeting. She and Good said some parents were also interested in adopting a co-op model of child care, with help from local providers, to replace the lost slots at Mount Snow.
“Having until June definitely creates more opportunities and possibilities than November,” Sibilia said.

The governor seeks a study first.,"New Jersey lawmakers have sought ways to limit data centers' impact on electricity rates. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy conditionally vetoed legislation Monday that would require data centers to report their water and electricity use, asking lawmakers to add provisions directing state regulators to weigh whether those data centers’ power and cooling demands are unduly burdening other ratepayers.
The redrafted bill would require the Board of Public Utilities to study whether New Jersey ratepayers unreasonably subsidize data centers, examine whether they are funding infrastructure that solely or mostly serves data centers, and estimate how much of New Jerseyans’ utility bills are attributable to data centers’ demands.
“These changes are designed to streamline related efforts to evaluate the impacts of data centers on State and regional resources, and to create an initial assessment after which future reporting requirements may be considered based upon the information gathered,” Murphy said in his veto statement.
Data center developers should pay more for their energy demands

Portions of the original bill requiring data centers to report their water and electricity use to regulators would remain intact if lawmakers agree with Murphy’s veto, though such reporting would be much delayed compared to the bill legislators approved in late June.
As originally drafted, data center operators would have been required to report their utility use within six months of the bill’s signing. The governor’s conditional veto would extend that timeline, requiring those reports be filed by January 2027.
Bill sponsor Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) questioned the proposed delay, noting that data center operators already collected some information about their own utility use and could readily comply with the bill’s disclosure requirements.
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“Delaying action by folding this into a two-year study — while keeping critical data hidden from the public — undermines transparency and weakens our ability to respond effectively,” said Ruiz, the senate’s majority leader. “By the time the BPU completes its report, irreversible impacts may already be in place. New Jersey must lead with foresight, not complacency.”
It’s not clear whether legislators will concur with Murphy’s conditional veto. They have that opportunity in the lame-duck session following this year’s gubernatorial and Assembly elections. Ruiz signaled it could be an issue solved under the governor who takes office in January. Murphy, a Democrat, is barred from seeking a third term in November.
“While we may have lost the opportunity to be a national leader in this space, this issue will remain a top policy priority of mine in the 2026 legislative session,” she said. “We will not let critical oversight fall by the wayside while the industry continues to expand.”
Assembly Republicans opposed the original bill, but it won bipartisan support in the Senate.
The governor’s conditional veto directs the Board of Public Utilities to identify and weigh policies to defray data centers’ impact on rates and to gauge the economic benefits such centers bring to New Jersey. And it asks the board to determine whether data centers should be required to benchmark their energy and water use using a federal portal, mirroring an existing requirement for certain buildings of at least 25,000 square feet.
Murphy also seeks to bar the release of information about data centers’ utility use under public records laws, except for anonymized information disclosed in the report on data centers’ utility use.
Mammoth power demands have turned artificial intelligence data centers into a major focal point of policy and political campaigning in the Garden State.
New Jerseyans’ electricity rates rose roughly 20% at the start of June as a result of price-setting capacity auctions that soared to new highs on the promise of data centers’ electricity needs. Power prices are expected to rise again next June.
Murphy has pursued AI as a source of economic growth for New Jersey. He has launched an AI task force within the state’s innovation office, extended tax credits to AI firms and startups, and sought to integrate its use into parts of the public workforce.
“Generative artificial intelligence is a fast-developing industry, and while that development brings exciting possibilities to our State, we must always take seriously our responsibility to manage our resources to support a sustainable and affordable future,” the governor said in his veto statement.

(Getty Images)Six months after 12 families, including Kentuckians, sued the federal government over library book removals at Fort Campbell and other Department of Defense schools, a federal judge ruled Monday that the books must be restored. 
U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles in the Eastern District of Virginia also ruled that the defendants — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Beth Schiavano-Narvaez, director of Department of Defense Activity (DoDEA) — cannot further remove books in efforts to implement Pres. Donald Trump’s executive orders related to diversity, equity and inclusion. 
The ruling is limited to the five schools attended by plaintiffs, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which joined in the lawsuit on behalf of the families. The Lantern has asked DoDEA for comment on the ruling. 
Giles, appointed by President Joe Biden, found that school libraries are not exempt from First Amendment protections and furthermore “lack the quintessential elements of government speech.” 
“Defendants attempt to circumvent the First Amendment entirely by asserting that the removal of books from DoDEA libraries constitutes government speech,” Giles wrote. “Defendants contend that as DoDEA’s speech, library curation is exempt from the First Amendment. The Court is unpersuaded.”

It’s “doubtful” that either the public or students “perceives the books in school libraries as conveying a government message,” Giles wrote. 
The government speech doctrine, established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1990s, allows the government, through its own speech, to discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint on the theory that the First Amendment does not apply when the government speaks, according to Middle Tennessee State University’s Free Speech Center.
‘Censorship, plain and simple.’ 
The ACLU of Kentucky said the removed items included reading on slavery, Native American history, women’s history, LGBTQ issues and history, preventing sexual harassment and abuse and parts of the Advanced Placement (AP) psychology curriculum. 
“Libraries are intended to provide a breadth of information to students, and like with government speech, it strains credulity that the curation of a library collection would bear the school’s imprimatur,” Giles wrote in her opinion. 
Kentucky students were part of the April federal lawsuit challenging U.S. Department of Defense policies that led to schools at Fort Campbell and other military bases removing books about slavery and civil rights. 
One of the plaintiffs, a Kentucky mother, said at the time that she wanted her children to have access to a wide range of books so they could better understand the world and other people. 
Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said that the book removals were “censorship, plain and simple.” 
Giles pointed to federal politics, citing Trump, who told Congress on March 6 “we’re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military.”
“The record is clear that by removing books, Defendants intended to deny Plaintiffs access to ideas that they, by virtue of the Presidential EOs, found distasteful, ‘radical’ or ‘divisive,’” and not by the educational qualities of the books, Giles wrote. 
The ACLU’s Shapiro said in a statement: “The materials removed are clearly age-appropriate and are only offensive to those who are afraid of a free-thinking population.”

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM) The Japanese ambassador to the United States joined Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in Santa Fe on Monday to describe a path for Rocky Mountain states like New Mexico to export liquefied natural gas to Asian countries. 
Ambassador Shigeo Yamada’s visit coincided with the release of a new “roadmap” from the Western States and Tribal Nations Energy Initiative that argues that with the right infrastructure, Rocky Mountain states can produce fast, green and cost-effective natural gas to domestic and Asian markets.
All the parties who gathered around a large table Monday at a news conference in the governor’s office—including Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, New Mexico cabinet secretaries, corporate executives and others—noted that no contracts are inked for infrastructure or commerce, saying those are still a long way away. 
But they said consensus is growing that the Rocky Mountains region has all the natural gas it needs to meet America’s growing energy needs, as well as Asia’s. And the ambassador said Japan is a willing customer, particularly after the country agreed to spend $7 billion a year to purchase energy from the United States as part of tariff negotiations.

Importing natural gas from Rocky Mountain states “is one of the options we will have on the table,” Yamada said Monday, as the country looks to meet the terms of that agreement.  
The governor touted the “roadmap” and the dignitary’s visit Monday as just the latest example of how New Mexico can find a market for its energy resources in a way that benefits New Mexicans while also transitioning away from carbon-heavy and volatile revenue sources like oil and gas.
“This collective,” she said, referring to those around the table, “is a representation of those commitments to New Mexicans, to the people living in Wyoming, the people living in Japan, the people all across the globe. These are jobs and real opportunities while we’re solving real challenges.”
She also said the framework all parties described Monday is the result of an April visit she and other top state officials made to Japan and Singapore. Her office described the trip at the time as a way to strengthen business ties, promote the state’s energy and computing technologies and explore natural gas export opportunities. 
“This is the fruits of our trip,” she said, thanking the ambassador for “helping us navigate opportunities between our two countries and by highlighting and learning more about what the Western states have to offer.”
Gordon, a Republican, said Wyoming and New Mexico share a common interest in entering Asian energy markets, regardless of partisan differences on clean energy.
“I hate to say ‘bipartisan,’” he said. “This is just good business.”
Jason Sandel, the initiative’s chairman, said Asia’s demand for liquefied natural gas will double by 2025, and the Western state has identified enough resources to reduce the continent’s carbon footprint, on average, by 40%. 
The report identifies two main routes—the Pacific Northwest Pathway and the Southwest Pathway—to efficiently move an increased amount of gas to markets in the Southwest and elsewhere on the West Coast, as well as to Mexico or Washington state, where it can be shipped overseas without needing to go through the Panama Canal or risk bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The San Juan Basin in the Four Corners area is one of seven basins in the region that Lujan Grisham touted as a source for the natural gas. The region includes parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
According to the report, gas from the Rocky Mountain basins is currently more expensive on the national and global markets due to production costs, noting that making the market here more cost-effective would require “new large-scale infrastructure” that navigates “through a difficult geography with mountainous terrain that has previously presented challenges to construction.”
But the benefits could be immense, the report claims, and offer less-carbon intensive energy for data centers, for example, in the West as well as Japan and the rest of Asia energy as those countries seek to handle growing demand while also reducing reliance on fossil fuels.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1240-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

(Eric Cole/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the department’s Fish and Wildlife Commission are named defendants in two lawsuits arguing, from opposite sides, that the latest wolf hunting regulations violate the state constitution. 
First, a pair of Republican lawmakers and the Outdoor Heritage Coalition filed a lawsuit in Sanders County District Court alleging that the Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sets department policies and regulations, had not complied with state laws intended to reduce the state’s population of gray wolves when it adopted regulations for the upcoming hunting and trapping season. 
Then, four conservation organizations filed a lawsuit against the department and commission also in hopes of overturning the latest wolf management regulations, but with an opposing argument — that the decision to increase the quota of wolves that can be killed this year threatens the species and flies in the face of the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. 
The opposing lawsuits, filed Sept. 30 and Oct. 16, are continuing a series of arguments that played out during the 2025 legislative session, which pitted legislators and advocates for reducing the state’s population of roughly 1,100 wolves against those seeking to preserve and protect the species. 
At the heart of the suits are the 2025 wolf hunting and trapping regulations, in which the Commission set a statewide harvest quota of 452 wolves, two additional three-wolf quotas for hunting areas outside Yellowstone National Park, plus an additional 100 wolves approved for removal by the department for cases of conflict with livestock or humans. 
Hunters and trappers killed 297 wolves last season, while the most killed in a season was 326 during 2020. The quota for wolf harvest has not been met by hunters and trappers in recent years. 
According to FWP’s latest population survey, there are an estimated 1,091 wolves in Montana, 12 fewer than the 2023 population estimate and slightly lower than the 10-year average of 1,138 wolves. 
But that marginal decline has not been enough for Republican lawmakers who believe the animal has outgrown a stated recovery goal of 15 breeding pairs for the state and in 2021, passed a bill requiring FWP to reduce the number of wolves to a “sustainable level,” with a stated goal of preventing a decline in the state’s deer and elk populations and minimizing livestock predation.
During the 2025 Legislature, lawmakers considered a slew of bills aimed at more dramatically reducing the wolf population, including one by Rep. Shannon Manness, a plaintiff in one lawsuit, by as much as half, aiming towards a population of 450 animals, cited in federal delisting documents as a stable minimum population.
While Manness’ bill did not become law, Rep. Paul Fielder, a Republican from Thompson Falls, did carry one wolf hunting bill that became law, expanding the use of night scopes on private land. 
The two lawmakers in their complaint allege that the Commission has continually adopted more stringent hunting regulations than they could have, and, over the years, have not reduced the wolf population “in a meaningful way.”
“These actions by the Commission demonstrate that it is not establishing rules with the intent to reduce the statewide population,” the complaint states. “… By maintaining wolf populations at higher than mandated levels through inadequate harvest quotas, the Commission has allowed wolves to deplete ungulate populations, thereby diminishing hunting opportunities.”
Rep. Fielder, who at the meeting where the Commission adopted the new regulations said “it is a step in the right direction,” did not respond to an email asking to speak about the lawsuit.
Both the inability to hunt wolves, and lower numbers of game animals due to wolves’ own hunting, allegedly violates a constitutionally guaranteed right to harvest wild fish and wild game, according to the suit.
But the other lawsuit claims overhunting wolves violates a different provision of the Montana Constitution, which preserves the right to a clean and healthful environment.
“Killing of more than half of Montana’s gray wolf population in a single year … will substantially degrade a natural resource and the Montana environment and threatens total population collapse,” the lawsuit brought by WildEarth Guardians, Project Coyote, Footloose Montana and the Gallatin Wildlife Association states. 
The conservation groups argue the harvest level set by the Fish and Wildlife Commission is higher than the department recommends for keeping the population stable, and in fact could lead to the statewide wolf population dropping below the number needed to prevent the species from ending up on the Endangered Species List again. 
Citing the 2024 FWP Wolf Report, the groups say data “shows that a hunting and trapping quota of 458 together with 100 removals greatly exceeds the mortality rates associated with stable populations and is likely to cause a severe decline in overall populations.”
According to FWP’s report, an average harvest of from 308 to 334 wolves has “potential for the population to drop too low to support 15 breeding pairs (450) wolves within a three-year period,” but adds that it is likely the population will remain above that threshold. However, at more than 350 wolves killed annually, “the population will most likely fall below 450 wolves within five years.”
There is also an argument that the state’s method for estimating wolf populations, known as IPOM (Integrated Patch Occupancy Model), is not as accurate as presented, and might overestimate the number of animals in the state. 
That same argument was key in a recent judge’s order to overturn a decision by the federal government to deny endangered species protections for wolves. The judge cited criticisms of IPOM as a reason it should not be considered the “best available science” in setting wolf management policy. 
The conservation groups are seeking a temporary restraining order against the new harvest quota and ultimately are asking the courts to invalidate the new regulations and preserve the status quo. 
“While this may inconvenience some individuals and outfitters, the preservation of a healthy and genetically connected wolf population ensures that the long-term interest in wolf hunting and trapping will be preserved,” the court documents state. “… To knowingly risk erasing wolves now would not only waste this massive investment, but rob Montana citizens and future generations of their rightful natural heritage.”
The lawsuit from the state lawmakers is seeking a court order requiring the Commission to use “all available management tools” to reduce wolf numbers and follow “legislative intent.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usfws-gray-wolf-snow-large-1024x768-1.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011
,DC,2025-10-20 21:18:44+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump tried to lay off more than 2,000 Interior staff in shutdown plan now on hold",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-tried-lay-more-2000-interior-staff-shutdown-plan-now-hold,,"WASHINGTON — The Interior Department announced Monday it will pause efforts to lay off 2,050 employees throughout the country, after a federal judge expanded a temporary restraining order late last week.The new filing provides more information about how the Trump administration plans to reduce the size and scope of a department that oversees much of the country’s public lands. Rachel Borra, chief human capital officer at Interior, wrote in a 35-page document the layoffs would affect employees at the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and U.S. Geological Survey, among others. The National Park Service layoffs would target several areas of the country, including 63 of 224 workers at the Northeast regional office, 69 of 223 at the Southeast regional office and 57 of 198 at the Pacific West regional office. The Northeast region holds 83 sites throughout Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.The Southeast region “has 73 parks across 4 million acres in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.”The Pacific West region encompasses more than “60 national park sites across California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, parts of Arizona and Montana, and the territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.”The layoffs cannot take place under the temporary restraining order that U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston clarified and expanded Friday during an emergency hearing. The layoffs would be further blocked if Illston, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, issues a preliminary injunction during a hearing scheduled for later this month. Advocates and current and former Interior staff members have told States Newsroom that bare-bones staffing during the government shutdown across the department and the U.S. Forest Service already is leaving America’s treasured natural assets vulnerable to lasting damage.Hundreds proposed for layoffs at Commerce, HHSThe other briefs filed Monday were from the departments of Commerce and Health and Human Services, which said in earlier court documents officials planned to lay off hundreds of federal workers. Commerce’s latest numbers say it would like to lay off 102 workers, while the Health and Human Services Department told the judge officials plan to get rid of 954 people. Both confirmed those efforts are on hold under the temporary restraining order. The numbers were different from those included in earlier filings to the court in the lawsuit, which was brought by labor unions representing federal workers. Those declarations in the earlier filings detailed the below layoff plans:Commerce: Approximately 600 employeesEducation: Remained at 466 employeesHealth and Human Services: 982 employeesHousing and Urban Development: 442 employeesHomeland Security: 54 employeesTreasury: 1,377 employeesFederal attorneys wrote in Monday’s court documents that all other departments “have determined, to the best of their knowledge and based on their investigation to date, that they have no additional information to provide in response to the Court’s October 17, 2025, modified TRO, that was not already provided in their October 17, 2025, declarations.”Energy Department layoffs protested by DemsThe Energy Department wrote in a filing that it didn’t need to declare any planned layoffs to the court since the Reduction in Force notices it had issued didn’t have an effective date. An earlier court filing said the department sent those notices to 179 employees.Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., and House Energy-Water Appropriations subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, wrote in a letter that the Energy Department’s planned layoffs were “a clear act of political retribution that will hurt communities across the country.”“These actions, which reportedly affect 179 employees, appear to be part of a broader effort to implement the administration’s budget request without congressional approval—circumventing the appropriations process and undermining congressional intent,” Murray and Kaptur wrote. “The Department’s actions will raise energy prices for American families by disrupting the implementation of key programs that increase supply and reduce costs for hard-working Americans.”The layoffs are one of the many ways the Trump administration is approaching the government shutdown differently than it did during the last prolonged funding lapse, which took place from December 2018 through January 2019. White House officials have canceled funding approved by Congress for projects in regions of the country that tend to vote for Democrats. And signaled they may not provide back pay for federal workers placed on furlough, which is authorized by a 2019 law that President Donald Trump signed during his first term.Johnson ties shutdown to No Kings ralliesSpeaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said during a morning press conference he hopes Senate Democrats vote to advance a stopgap spending bill soon, allowing the government to reopen. The conclusion of the No Kings protests, he said, could help reduce pressure on Democrats to keep the government shut down. “Now that Chuck Schumer has had his spectacle, he's had his big protest against America, this is our plea: We're asking, and I think everybody in this room and everybody watching, listening to our voices this morning should be hoping that he is finally now ready to go to work and end this shutdown and stop inflicting pain on the American people,” Johnson said. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters outside the White House he believes moderate Democrats, specifically Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, are ready to end the shutdown.Shaheen told the New Hampshire Bulletin on Friday that no official negotiations to end the shutdown are happening. She also criticized the administration's multibillion dollar bailout for Argentina that Trump finalized last week as federal agencies remain dark during the funding lapse and as health insurance premiums are set to increase.But Hassett repeated the argument that Republicans won't negotiate until Senate Democrats vote to reopen the government. He told CNBC Monday morning he believes that will happen ""sometime this week.""""If they want to have policy disputes, they could do it through regular order, but just shutting down the government and making 750,000 government workers not get their paychecks, it’s just not acceptable,"" the White House economic adviser said.Ashley Murray and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

The Senate on Monday adopted an order scheduling a March 3, 2026 special election to fill the First Middlesex seat, held since 2018 by the late Sen. Ed Kennedy, who died on Oct. 1 at the age of 74.
The district, which sits along the border of New Hampshire, includes the city of Lowell and the towns of Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell and Tyngsborough.
The special election primary will be held Feb. 3, 2026, according to Secretary of State William Galvin’s office.
A former Lowell City Council member, Kennedy was serving as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets and Senate vice chair of the Joint Committee on Higher Education.
Lowell Democrat Rep. Rodney Elliott announced on Friday that he is running for the historically Democrat-controlled Senate seat.
“I’m running for State Senate to be the strong voice that for working families, small businesses, and the future we all want to build — one that is more affordable, more inclusive, and more sustainable,” he said in a press release. Elliott served on the Lowell City Council for 24 years, and as the city’s mayor from 2014 to 2016.
Rep. Vanna Howard of Lowell is considering a Senate run.
“Over the last few days, many friends, supporters, and colleagues have reached out encouraging me to run for State Senate,” she said in a statement to the News Service. “Senator Kennedy served Lowell, Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell, and Tyngsborough with dedication and heart, and whoever follows him has big shoes to fill. I’ll be taking some time with my family in the days ahead to consider this important decision.”
Special election candidates must submit nomination signatures with local election officials by December 23, 2025, according to Galvin’s office. At least 300 certified signatures must be filed with the state elections division by December 30, 2025.
After putting the Boston Elections Department into receivership following the 2024 election cycle, Galvin last Thursday issued an order to local election officials in Lawrence that his office will have staff present in the city to supervise the absentee ballot process and voting during early voting and on Election Day. The order states that “urgent circumstances exist” relating to the absentee ballot application and ballot activities in Lawrence.
His office “has received numerous complaints in connection the absentee ballot application and voting process,” according to Galvin’s order. The issues revolve around supporters of some candidates in the race attempting to submit absentee ballot applications on behalf of voters, according to Boston Globe reporting. 
The Lawrence Election Office has received absentee ballot applications and ballots from people other than the voters ballots were meant for, and some voters submitting an absentee ballot application “do not meet the lawful requirements to cast an absentee ballot,” the order states.
Galvin told the Globe that the situation involved at least 100 applications.
His office is ordering Lawrence election officials to verify authenticity of all absentee ballots submitted; obtain the verified name of individuals submitting absentee ballots on behalf of another voter; and keep records of submitted applications that are incomplete.
Asked why Lawrence’s election’s division isn’t being handled in the same way the Boston Elections Division was, Spokesperson Deb O’Malley told the News Service that the issues occurring in Lawrence are not related to the administration of the election, but more to campaign conduct.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/09-13_Galvin_2.jpg?fit=1000%2C700&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 18:01:56.377011

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s cannabis regulators could begin awarding new retail licenses to prospective business owners eager to join the state’s budding market as early as May 2026.
That’s according to a timeline the Cannabis Control Commission voted 2-1 to adopt on Monday. The timeline sets the pace for officials’ to review applications for the state’s 24 available retail licenses after the application deadline on Dec. 29, 2025.
“It’s clear to me that we need to do a better job forecasting what the next months look like after the application portal closes at the end of this calendar year,” Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern said. “We have never shared what 2026 held.”
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the state’s Cannabis Office will have 90 days to review applications and verify that each meets eligibility qualifications before being placed in a lottery. The timeline builds in at least 60 days to allow applicants to secure approvals at the local level in order to qualify for random selection, Ahern said.
Ahern said the intention is to begin the lottery selection process in the second quarter of 2026, likely in May. 
“I want to add that we reserve the right to delay this process depending on several external factors outside our control,” Ahern said. “For example, if we receive thousands of applications, it will be hard for us to do that.”
As of Monday, no retail applications have been submitted to the state’s cannabis office, spokesperson Charon Rose told Rhode Island Current after the meeting.

Objections on getting ducks in a row
Commissioner Robert Jacquard, the lone vote against regulators’ review timeline, argued that allowing businesses to secure local zoning approvals after the application deadline is unfair to those who met the requirements on time.
“If an applicant is better prepared, better financed, got an earlier start, I think that’s important,” he said. “We have had our regulations out for a good amount of time, people were well-warned that there would not be any extensions beyond the deadlines that were set.”
Those same feelings were shared by many of the members of Rhode Island’s cannabis industry who attended the meeting within the Public Utilities Commission’s office building in Warwick.
“Many of us have invested significant time and money securing compliant locations, paying for rent, purchasing properties, and obtaining special use and zoning permits,” Karen Ballou, owner of CultivatingRI, told commissioners. “I recognize some municipalities have made it difficult for applications to meet certain requirements, but that should not penalize those who have successfully navigated the process.”
Business owners awarded medical cannabis licenses have faced setbacks opening in Woonsocket and Foster amid disputes with local officials and property owners, causing them to miss the state’s initial nine-month deadline to begin operations. 
And not every town is willing to have a  cannabis retailer. In 2022, voters in six communities — Barrington, East Greenwich, Jamestown, Little Compton, Scituate, and Smithfield — rejected allowing retail pot shops within their borders.
Ballou said if regulators really need to give some applicants more time to get all their needed material together, those businesses should be subject to a second lottery.
Sasha Gorski, co-owner of the cultivation company Talaria, agreed, saying the 60-day window to secure local zoning permits after the application deadline shouldn’t apply to general retail applicants.
“It hurts to be punished for being ahead,” she said.
But others in the room argued the commission’s review timeline helps to create a sense of fairness as the retail industry starts to grow in Rhode Island.
“Applicants need breathing room to go through the proper channels,” Emma Karnes, an organizer for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 238, told the commission. “I think we all want a healthy pool of applicants. We all want a reasonably accessible application process.”

Karnes said many applicants seeking social equity and worker cooperative licenses may not have the same resources and capital as other prospective business owners. Such is the case for Alexa Goodrich-Houska, who is seeking to open the Living Room Cannabis Cooperative somewhere in Zone 1, which includes the communities of Burrillville, Cumberland, Glocester, North Smithfield, Smithfield, and Woonsocket.
“We don’t have trust funds, we don’t have big corporate backers,” Goodrich-Houska said. “Documentation alone can take four to 12 months and around $50,000 to know if we can even get a license.”
That’s on top of the $7,500 application fee, a yearly $30,000 licensing fee that all cannabis retailers face — though that application fee will be waived for the first year for approved social equity applicants.
Ahern acknowledged industry members’ concerns and continued frustration over new licenses not yet being issued, but reminded them it was never going to be a rubber stamp process.
“We expect a very robust, thorough process,” she said. “That was never going to be done overnight, that was never going to be done in a few weeks.”
Under the 2022 act that legalized recreational cannabis, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to retailers, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives. All recreational licenses will be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone.
Applicants have up to 60 days to demonstrate they have final zoning approval from the municipality where they intend to operate their business — a provision Ahern said was included partly because of the commission’s slow rollout in getting potential social equity applicants certified.










Applicants need breathing room to go through the proper channels. I think we all want a healthy pool of applicants. We all want a reasonably accessible application process.


– Emma Karnes, an organizer for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 238


The commission in late August opened the initial screening process for social equity applicants, defined as prospective retailers owned or mostly staffed by those adversely affected by the war on drugs. After the certification deadline closed on Sept. 29, the commission reported 94 potential applicants for the state’s six social equity licenses.
Beginning Monday, screened applicants were expected to receive letters informing them if they meet the state’s social equity criteria. Prospective applicants who don’t initially meet the commission’s requirements will have 10 additional days to prove they qualify as social equity applicants.
​​Regulations approved by the commission earlier in the year require that social equity applicants have at least 51% ownership and control by individuals directly impacted by past cannabis laws or economic disparities, or a minimum of 10 full-time employees that meet the same criteria.
Qualifying factors include convictions for nonviolent cannabis offenses or residency in disproportionately impacted areas — which can be determined by federal poverty level, unemployment rate, the number of students in a free school lunch program, and historic arrest rates by census tract. 
Final certification is expected to be approved by the commission some time in November.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Members of the committee tasked with finding LSU’s next president have been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement that prohibits them from ever discussing the search. 
The search committee is a public body that is subject to Louisiana’s open meetings and public records laws, which call for such deliberations to be made in a public setting and for any related documents to be available upon request. 
Steven Procopio, president of the good government watchdog group Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, called for more transparency in the presidential search. 
“The LSU presidency is one of Louisiana’s most important public positions, and its selection should reflect that public trust,” Procopio said. “Transparency in the search process would build confidence that more than one candidate was seriously considered.” 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who has previously touted the transparency of the committee, said the non-disclosure agreements are intended to protect the identity of potential job candidates. 
Ballard cited a state court ruling in the case Capital City Press v. LSU, in which The Advocate, along with other news organizations, sued the university when it refused to provide records on the search to replace former President F. King Alexander in 2012-13.  
The precedent requires the public release of documents related to candidates once they officially apply, but universities can withhold information on those who have only expressed interest. All of the state’s college and university systems must follow this ruling when conducting searches for top administrators.  
But the terms of the non-disclosure agreement LSU’s current search committee members have signed go much further, according to a copy of the agreement provided to the Illuminator. Read the full NDA below. 
It prohibits the discussion of deliberations of the committee or release of documents relating to the search. Members are instead required to refer all questions from journalists or the public to Ballard or SSA Consultants, the consulting firm LSU hired to guide the search. 
The agreement also prohibits committee members from keeping search-related documents after the process concludes. They must also maintain this secrecy in perpetuity. Members who break the terms of the agreement will lose their spot on the committee. 
Requiring members of public bodies to refrain from discussing the work of that body is unusual, according to Scott Sternberg, a First Amendment attorney who often represents the news media. 
“The members of that search committee have First Amendment rights … and making them sign a non-disclosure agreement is certainly a new attempt to keep a lid on people performing a public service,” Sternberg said. 
LSU considers those who have responded to its presidential job posting as having only expressed interest in the job – and not applicants. Their names will be vetted by SSA Consultants, who will present a list of qualified individuals to the search committee. Its members will invite a select number of those individuals to formally apply, at which point their names will be public record. 
SSA Consultants CEO Christel Slaughter said at a meeting earlier this month about 30 people have expressed interest for the LSU position, with 20 meeting the qualifications and five to nine highly qualified.
LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said non-disclosure agreements are standard operating procedure. He has not responded to the Illuminator’s request to review any non-disclosure agreements the university has used for previous leadership searches. 
Mark Romero, chairman of the University of Louisiana System Board, said the UL System does not require members of its search committees to sign non-disclosure agreements. The board has conducted searches for presidents for eight of its nine universities within the past four years and did not use consultants. 
Romero said he did not see the point in using non-disclosure agreements when the information would be subject to public records requests regardless. 
The LSU position has been vacant since June when former President William Tate resigned after four years to accept the same position at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Vice President for Agriculture Matt Lee is serving as interim president and is expected to apply for the permanent job. 
The board is expected to make a final hiring decision next month.

Delaware’s geography gives a Hydrogen Business a unique advantage: abundant water, existing industrial infrastructure, and proximity to East Coast markets.
By Staff Writer | Oct. 20, 2025
WILMINGTON, Del. — Hydrogen may be the smallest element on the periodic table, but it could hold outsize promise for Delaware’s energy future. That was the message Monday from Andrew Cottone III, chemist, entrepreneur, and founder of Eternium, who joined M. Jane Brady on her program A Better Discussion to explain what a hydrogen business actually does — and why it could help power Delaware’s economy for decades to come.
Cottone, best known for turning his first company, Adesis, from near bankruptcy to a multimillion-dollar success, now wants to make Delaware a model for clean hydrogen production. His new venture, he said, blends chemistry, economics, and opportunity.

“Hydrogen burns three times as much energy by mass as carbon-based fuels — strong and clean,” Cottone said. “We are sitting on the prepackaged fuel of the future, which is water.”


Hydrogen’s promise and Delaware’s potential
Hydrogen is already one of the world’s most widely used industrial gases, fueling refineries, fertilizer plants, and steel production. But most of today’s hydrogen — called gray hydrogen — is made from natural gas in processes that emit carbon dioxide. The next step is scaling up “green hydrogen,” produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity from renewable or nuclear power.
When hydrogen is burned or used in a fuel cell, it emits only water vapor — no carbon dioxide, soot, or methane. For supporters, that makes it a bridge fuel to a low-carbon future, especially for heavy industry and long-distance transport that can’t easily electrify.

“It’s truly cyclical,” Cottone said. “You split water into hydrogen and oxygen, use the hydrogen for power, and it becomes water again.”

Hydrogen can also store surplus renewable energy from the grid — capturing solar or wind power when it’s available and releasing it when demand peaks.

“Hydrogen doesn’t compete with renewables — it completes them,” Cottone said. “It’s the storage tank that makes solar and wind reliable 24 hours a day.”

Economic case for Delaware
Cottone said Delaware’s geography gives it a unique advantage: abundant water, existing industrial infrastructure, and proximity to East Coast markets. Each hydrogen plant would use about two-thirds of an Olympic-size swimming pool of water per day, and could repurpose treated wastewater, reducing environmental strain.
He expects Eternium’s planned facilities to generate hundreds of construction jobs and dozens of full-time technical positions. The company is an anchor member of the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2) — a regional partnership awarded $23 million in early-stage funding to build hydrogen infrastructure across Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

“With or without government funding, we go forward,” Cottone said. “We have a responsible business model that pencils out.”

Cottone also serves on Delaware’s new Nuclear Task Force, where he promotes synergy between hydrogen and advanced nuclear energy to achieve long-term energy independence.

“Delaware imports 100 times more energy than we make ourselves,” he said. “This isn’t about if — it’s about how we do this responsibly to position Delaware as a net exporter of energy.”

Opposition from environmental and river advocates
Not everyone shares that optimism. Several regional environmental groups — including the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, led by Maya van Rossum — have voiced concern about the climate and ecological impact of the MACH2 hub.
Van Rossum argues that hydrogen development could extend the life of the fossil-fuel industry, since most hydrogen today is produced from natural gas, releasing greenhouse gases.

“Hydrogen hubs are being used as a way for fossil-fuel interests to stay relevant,” van Rossum said in 2023, warning that the technology’s current reliance on natural gas undermines its clean-energy claims.

Her group also objects to the use of nuclear power in some hub proposals, citing environmental damage from facilities like the Salem Nuclear Generating Station on the Delaware River, which studies suggest harms billions of fish and larvae each year through its cooling-water system.
Environmental-justice organizations have raised additional concerns that proposed hydrogen facilities and pipelines could be sited near vulnerable or historically overburdened communities.
MACH2 officials, including Cottone, maintain that Delaware’s approach would prioritize local sourcing, clean-water use, and state-level oversight, ensuring both environmental protection and economic benefit.
Workforce and education
Cottone and Brady agreed Delaware’s energy future must include a plan for training local workers. Cottone’s earlier partnership with Delaware Technical Community College created certification programs that retrained former press operators for chemical manufacturing jobs — a model he plans to expand to hydrogen production.

“Our future employees are already here,” he said. “We can train them in nine to twelve months for high-quality jobs that stay in Delaware.”

A “Pete du Pont moment” for Delaware
Cottone traces his hydrogen vision back to the Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation’s Reinventing Delaware program, which helped him refine the idea of hydrogen as both a clean-energy and economic-development strategy.

“I call it a Pete du Pont moment — reinventing Delaware,” he said. “Energy is the stem cell of an economy. The more responsible, clean energy you have, the more your economy can grow.”

Brady agreed, noting that the success of hydrogen and nuclear initiatives could determine whether Delaware once again becomes a national model for innovation and self-reliance.

Editor’s Fact Box: Hydrogen and Delaware’s Economy
1. Job Creation — Hydrogen manufacturing could generate 150–200 construction jobs per plant and 40–60 permanent technical roles, with ripple effects across local suppliers.2. Clean-Tech Cluster Growth — Hydrogen development attracts investment in advanced materials, logistics, and renewable-energy research.3. Reuse of Infrastructure — Vacant industrial land and wastewater systems can be repurposed, revitalizing communities.4. Energy Independence — Local hydrogen production reduces Delaware’s dependence on imported power.5. Revenue for Schools and Services — New plants expand property, business, and payroll tax bases across all three counties.6. Balancing Environment and Economy — Supporters say hydrogen’s benefits outweigh its risks; opponents warn that its climate advantages depend on how it’s produced and where it’s built.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-170230.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:16:48.949420

Trump announced Sunday on his Truth social media platform that Mark Savaya, the owner of Leaf and Bud dispensaries throughout southeast Michigan, would serve in the role.
“Mark’s deep understanding of the Iraq-U.S. relationship, and his connections in the region, will help advance the interests of the American people,” Trump wrote. “Mark was a key player in my campaign in Michigan, where he, and others, helped secure a record vote with Muslim Americans.”
Savaya thanked Trump in an Instagram post, saying he was “deeply humbled and grateful to [Trump]” for his appointment.
“I am committed to strengthening the U.S.-Iraq partnership under President Trump’s leadership and guidance,” Savaya said. “Thank you, Mr. President.”
Savaya, a member of the Catholic Chaldean community that has deep roots in Metro Detroit, was a prominent supporter of Trump during his 2020 and 2024 campaigns. His personal Instagram page is riddled with pictures and videos of Savaya either hanging out with Trump or within his orbit, including a video where Savaya appears to be at Trump’s Florida Mar-A-Lago resort.
He donated $10,000 to Trump’s campaign in 2020, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Savaya also supported the 2024 campaign at rallies and was seen with the current president and his surrogates during other events.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2198395626-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 20:56:57+00:00,CT Mirror,Attorneys in Diamantis trial deliver closing arguments as case goes to jury,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/kosta-diamantis-trial-closing-arguments/,"The closing arguments were the last thing jurors heard before they were asked to decide the fate of Diamantis, who is charged with 21 counts.","Attorneys delivering closing arguments in the federal criminal trial of Konstantinos Diamantis Monday presented jurors with dueling descriptions of the man who ran Connecticut’s school construction program for nearly six years.
The closing arguments were the last thing jurors heard before they were asked to decide the fate of Diamantis, who is charged with 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
Federal prosecutors presented Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director, as a money-hungry official who eagerly traded his influence on school building projects for bribes from construction contractors.
“The defendant was a corrupt public officials. He asked for and accepted bribes,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Novick, adding that Diamantis also wielded his immense influence on projects to “strike fear” into contractors.
Meanwhile, Diamantis’ defense attorney, Norm Pattis, portrayed his client as a dutiful and devoted public servant, who used his aggressive personality to save taxpayers money on the state-funded school projects.
Pattis argued that Diamantis was someone who “rocked some boats” when he took over the school construction program in 2016, particularly frustrating those  contractors who were reaping huge profits on school construction projects.
“You heard him described as a person who got the job done even if he ruffled feathers,” Pattis said, adding that Diamantis “”knew how to shine sunlight into dark places.” 
Diamantis took the witness stand in his own defense and acknowledged that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars from Acranom Masonry, a company that worked on schools in Hartford and Tolland. He also admitted that his daughter was hired by Construction Advocacy Professionals, another company that was awarded work in Hartford, Tolland and New Britain. 
In both cases, he said he never used his position to benefit those contractors.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis told the jury Monday that Diamantis essentially admitted to some of the charges, namely bribery, when he acknowledged receiving payments from the two contractors.
“That was remarkable testimony by the defendant,” Francis said, adding that Diamantis was essentially forced into that testimony because of the overwhelming amount of direct evidence that prosecutors presented to the jury.
Francis also said Diamantis admitted that he threatened to remove Acranom from two school projects if the company’s executives didn’t pay him tens of thousand of dollars.
“The defendant took the stand and admitted to making every one of those threats,” Francis said. “I mean, how could he deny it?”
Diamantis sat at the defense table smiling as the federal prosecutors delivered their closing arguments. He shook his head when Francis argued that Diamantis’ testimony effectively counted as a “confession” to the bribery and extortion charges.
When it was his turn to address the jury, Pattis argued that Diamantis’ financial entanglements with the two contractors were not illegal because he never used his government position to benefit either company. 
Pattis told the jury there was no “quid pro quo” between Diamantis and Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals. 
And he argued that John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom Masonry, was the one who was extorting from Diamantis. Pattis pointed to several text messages that suggested that Duffy expected to receive part of the money that Diamantis negotiated with Sal Monarca, the owner of Acranom Masonry.
In response to that argument, Francis told the jury that Diamantis should still be convicted of bribery and extortion even if Duffy did get half the money. 
“I don’t know if Duffy was double dealing, but either way he was engaged in a conspiracy,” Francis said. “It’s not really a great defense to extortion and bribery that I gave half the money to my bagman.” 
“What the defendant is doing is distracting you from the evidence,” Francis added. 
As he made an impassioned plea for jurors to acquit Diamantis, Pattis observed that some of the jurors might not like Diamantis. He even noted that some of the jurors were rolling their eyes when he argued that Diamantis was not involved in accepting bribes from the companies.
But Pattis argued that federal prosecutors did not prove all of the elements for the crimes of which Diamantis is accused, especially when it came to the extortion charges. And he pleaded with the jury not to judge his client based on their feelings toward him.
“Think what you will of him, but hold the government to their burden of proof,” Pattis said.
Francis had the last word before the case was handed off to the jury, and he used those final moments to push back against on Pattis’ description of Diamantis as the one person who was looking to fix the state’s school construction program.
“Even if school construction did need to be cleaned up, the evidence shows the defendant had the dirtiest hands of all,” Francis said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_046-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Bruce Silcox)Microplastics were found in every sample tested from 40 lakes, rivers and streams across Minnesota, according to a report recently released by Environment Minnesota Research and Policy Center.
Plastic that makes its way into the environment degrades into microplastics over time, small pieces of plastic that don’t decompose like organic waste. The presence of microplastics in all tested waterways highlights one consequence of Minnesota’s plastic waste — Minnesota disposed of more than 650,000 tons of plastic in 2022, just 10% of which was recycled, according to studies cited in the report.
Microplastics is a relatively new and evolving area of study. Researchers have found microplastics in human tissues and organs, including in the brain, which enter the body through breathing or ingestion. Scientists don’t know the precise negative effects on wildlife and humans but are actively exploring them.
“We just don’t know and hopefully we can continue to fund the efforts to figure out what these microplastics can do,” said Katelynn Rolfes, the author of the report.
Studies have shown that microplastics harm metabolism, neurological function and reproduction in animals, and a few epidemiological studies have shown that microplastics are correlated with various chronic diseases in humans. For example, a 1999 study looked at multiple instances of work-related lung disease in U.S. and Canadian nylon fiber workers.
All 40 sites contained synthetic fibers, which come from clothing and textiles; 10 sites contained harder plastic fragments; and five sites contained film from bags and flexible plastics. The study did not find any microbeads, which are tiny plastics found in body scrubs and other beauty products.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated in 2017 that 35% of microplastics come from the degradation of synthetic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, typically from clothes and textiles.
The report is based on samples collected by citizen volunteers and staff from Environment Minnesota between May and September.
The report lists several policy recommendations to mitigate microplastics, including phasing out single-use plastics and plastic bags, implementing a refundable deposit for plastic bottles and passing laws preventing clothing manufacturers from overproducing.
Minnesota passed an “extended producer responsibility” law in 2024 requiring packaging producers to shoulder more of the responsibility for disposing or recycling their products, though it has not yet joined the states entertaining EPR legislation for textile producers. California was the first state to pass an EPR law for textiles in 2024, and similar bills have been proposed in New York and Washington.
Starting in 2017, Minnesota banned local jurisdictions from enacting their own single-use or plastic bag bans. State policy is split on the issue — 19 states have some statewide single-use plastic ban, while 19 states, including Minnesota, don’t have bans and also forbid local jurisdictions from enacting bans. The remaining states don’t have statewide bans but also allow local governments to make their own regulations.
Minnesota legislators have, in the past few years, introduced bills to reverse the ban on plastic bag bans, though they have yet to pass.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101625enviroMN111-1024x817.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

Kristin Robbins, who is running for Minnesota governor, released her proposals to prevent fraud in Minnesota programs at a Capitol press conference on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Rep. Kristin Robbins, a Republican candidate for governor, rolled out a fraud prevention agenda Monday as she seeks to amp up a key vulnerability of Gov. Tim Walz, who is seeking a third term.
Robbins, a Maple Grove Republican and chair of the House fraud prevention committee, 
proposed an independent office of inspector general to regularly audit programs, bolstering the state’s oversight of providers that receive taxpayer funds and appointing commissioners who will create a “no fraud, no excuses” culture.
“Walz turned Minnesota into the fraud capital of the country. As governor, I will make it a fraud free capital for America,” Robbins said at a Capitol press conference.
Fraudsters have in recent years have gamed state government — and federal programs administered by Minnesota — out of hundreds of millions of dollars, including the infamous Feeding Our Future scandal, the state’s autism program and a bevy of Medicaid schemes.
Walz has touted various measures he’s enacted to prevent fraud, including an executive order establishing a statewide Inspector General Coordinating Council, though it’s unclear exactly what this council will do. His administration also shut down the Housing Stabilization Services program, which Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said, while announcing indictments, is riddled with fraud. Walz has also increased data-sharing across state agencies and established a financial crimes and fraud division at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
Robbins said that currently a lot of employees within agencies want to prevent fraud, but they don’t have the training and agency heads haven’t taken action when credible allegations of fraud arise.
Robbins was first elected to the House in 2018, representing west metro cities like Maple Grove, Medina and Corcoran.
Scott Jensen, the 2022 GOP nominee for governor, and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive, are also challenging Walz and vying for the GOP nomination.
As governor, Robbins said she would order a top-to-bottom audit of all of the Department of Human Service’s Medicaid programs, where the bulk of fraud in Minnesota’s programs has occurred.
“The Walz administration has prioritized shoveling money out the door and counting that as a success. Instead, we are going to standardize the basic due diligence that Minnesotans have thought was going on and that they expect of their state government,” Robbins said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P1241836-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Stephen Ausmus/USDA)Iowa and national agriculture groups said Monday that a proposal from President Donald Trump to import beef from Argentina would harm cattle farmers. 
Trump suggested Sunday the U.S. could purchase beef from Argentina to help address the high cost of beef at grocery stores.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for ground chuck have risen sharply in 2025. August figures topped $6.63 per pound, which is up more than a dollar from prices in January. 
The bureau shows that beef prices have been on the rise over the past 10 years, likely due to declining herd sizes and drought. But more recent pressures from the new world screwworm and tariffs have likely added to the recent inflation in cost.

Trump, in an official address Oct. 16, said that the administration had a deal in the works that would bring down the price of beef. He floated the idea of purchasing from Argentina while speaking to reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One.
Bryan Whaley, CEO of Iowa Cattlemen’s Association, said the industry group is working to communicate with leaders about their concerns with the Argentina plan, “specifically the impact on cattle market prices.” 
“President Trump’s recent remarks about potentially importing Argentinian beef are concerning for U.S. cattle producers, and the little detail that accompanied those comments has created volatility in the market,” Whaley said in an emailed statement. “What we know is that consumer demand for the high-quality beef raised by U.S. producers has remained strong, despite the increased costs caused by drought, border closures, and high input costs to producers.” 
Whaley said the group will continue to elevate the issue to “avoid intervention and let the market work.” 
Iowa Farm Bureau Federation President Brent Johnson said Monday that the cattle market, where producers have positive returns on their livestock, was one of the “few bright spots in Iowa’s ag economy” amid “widespread depressed ag markets.” 
“We encourage the administration to resist actions that negatively impact the cattle farmers in Iowa and domestic beef production,” Johnson said in a statement. 
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said importing from Argentina would harm cattle producers and disrupt the free market. 
“This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,” the association’s CEO Colin Woodall Woodall said in a news release. 
Additionally, the national association said Argentina has a “deeply unbalanced” trade relationship with the U.S. given the country imports more beef from Argentina than it exports to the South American country.
“We call on President Trump and members of Congress to let the market work, rather than intervening in ways that do nothing but harm rural America,” the news release said. 
The floated idea from the president comes less than a month after the administration approved a $20 billion credit-line swap with Argentina and proposed an additional $20 billion in financing to help the country. Shortly after the first deal was announced, Argentina delivered a massive sale of soybeans to China, potentially harming U.S. trade with its largest soybean buyer.
National Farmers Union President Rob Larew said in a statement the union was also against importing beef from Argentina, noting the recent news between the U.S. and Argentina. 
“The last thing we need is to reward them by importing more of their beef,” Larew said. 
He said importing foreign beef would be a form of “undercutting American ranchers” and said  “restoring fairness” in the market should be the target to lower grocery store prices.
“In times of extreme uncertainty in the farm economy, we should be doubling down on our efforts to support family farmers and ranchers here at home,” Larew said. “The answer isn’t foreign beef; it’s rebuilding herds to meet domestic demand, restoring competition in meatpacking, enacting mandatory country-of-origin labeling so consumers know where their beef comes from, and creating a fair marketplace that works for both farmers and consumers.” 
Trump said Sunday, while speaking to reporters, that Argentina is “fighting for their life.” 
“They have no money, they have no anything,” Trump said. “They’re fighting so hard to survive. If I can help them survive in a free world – I happen to like the president of Argentina.”

(Photo by Christina Felschen/Getty Images)The state of West Virginia is investing $19 million to help upgrade and replace portions of Clarksburg’s aging water infrastructure, according to an announcement from Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Monday.
The money will help support the Clarksburg Water Board with its ongoing replacement of hazardous lead service lines in the area, which can pose serious health risks to exposed individuals. It will also assist with upgrading the system’s water mains, enhancing fire protection, decreasing leaks and modernizing water meters for customers throughout the system.
“Every West Virginian should be able to turn on the tap and know that the water coming out is safe,” Morrisey said. “For too long, aging infrastructure has threatened the health and safety of our communities. This investment is about restoring trust in our public systems.”
According to its 2025 annual report with the state Public Service Commission, the Clarksburg Water Board provides water service to about 7,800 households in the area. It sells water to thousands of other customers. 
The $19 million committed to Clarksburg by the state this month will help cover costs associated with the final phase of the city’s ongoing lead line replacement project.
The total cost of that project phase — phase 3B, according to Clarksburg Water Board General Manager Jason Myers — is $50 million.
Myers said the project will “hopefully” go to bid in January or February of 2026. Construction would then start around June. It will take three to four years for the project to then be completed, Myers said.
Once phase 3A is complete, Myers said about 2,400 lead service lines will remain that will need to be removed during phase 3B.
The city began work to replace its lead service lines after blood tests between 2020 and 2021 showed that several children in the Clarksburg area had elevated levels of lead in their blood due to exposure from eroding and aging water service lines. 
Residents in Clarksburg — including the parents of two of those children — filed a class action lawsuit against the Water Board in 2021. They alleged in the suit that the water from the system was not safe to drink and that the water system’s leadership failed to ensure its safety by not monitoring lead levels adequately.
That same year, the Clarksburg Water Board received administrative orders from both the state health department and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to draw up a corrective action plan. That plan was meant to eradicate the presence of lead in the water system and correct numerous violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Residents at that time were provided with water filters for their homes to help prevent exposure to the lead pipes.
Experts and those in the industry said it was rare for the EPA to issue such an order to a locality. The lead levels detected, however, were so high that Erik Olson, senior strategic director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the situation “could be as bad as Flint, if not worse.”
In July 2021, the Clarksburg Water Board approved the first preliminary action plan. Since then, work has been ongoing to both detail the problem and correct it. That work has coincided with a federal rule implemented under former President Joe Biden in 2024 that requires all water systems throughout the country to find and replace millions of lead service lines by 2037.
Under that rule, West Virginia would need to find and replace at least 3% of its existing water service lines, according to EPA’s most recent Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey Assessment. Billions of dollars were made available federally for lead service line replacements through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by congress and signed by Biden in 2021.
Under President Donald Trump, however, the federal rule requiring lead line replacement as well as the funding that would make it possible for West Virginia could be under threat.
In August, Trump’s EPA said it would defend the newly amended federal Lead and Copper rule — the changes made within it represented the largest update made in more than 30 years. Details, however, remain unclear on how it will be implemented as the Trump Administration has focused heavily on environmental deregulation and cuts to government spending.

As Vermont health care regulators express financial concerns, the not-for-profit is taking to social media in hopes of reassuring more than 500 staffers and 45,000 surrounding residents.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is hiring two outside advisers to help address an operating budget shortfall and related questions from state regulators.
The not-for-profit will work with Ovation Healthcare, a national support organization, and David Sanville, a former chief financial officer at Windsor’s Mt. Ascutney Hospital, according to a social media announcement.
“Let me say this very clearly: Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is not closing,” acting co-CEO Elizabeth McLarney, an orthopaedic surgeon, said in a Facebook video posted Friday.
“We are fully engaged,” added fellow leader Tony Blofson, a primary care physician, “in ensuring that BMH remains a strong, independent and trusted part of this community.”
Administrators are still calculating the exact shortfall in a $119 million annual budget that ended Sept. 30. They’ve usually offered updates through internal emails to the hospital’s more than 500 staffers and 150 community “corporator” supporters. To reach more people, McLarney and Blofson — appointed interim leaders after this month’s unexplained leave of absence of CEO Christopher Dougherty — publicized their latest message on Facebook.
In a minute-long video, the two read a shared statement that aimed to reassure the 45,000 residents in the hospital’s service area.
“For generations, BMH has been a cornerstone of care in this region,” Blofson said. “We’re going to keep it that way by adapting and innovating, doing whatever it takes to continue to provide you with the highest quality care.”
“We’re in this with you, and we are here to stay,” McLarney added. “Thank you for your trust, support and patience.”
Administrators at the 61-bed hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, have blamed their fiscal problems on everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs. In response, they have launched a hiring freeze and let go of six administrators.
But regulators at Vermont’s Green Mountain Care Board have questioned the budget numbers themselves, noting in an Oct. 1 ruling that “missing, incomplete and inaccurate information makes it challenging to understand BMH’s current financial position.”
The board ordered the hospital to revise its budget or risk becoming the first Vermont health care facility to receive state intervention under a new law. 
In a written update to VTDigger, regulators noted “it is our understanding that BMH is working diligently to address concerns” and the board would review the new numbers once received.
Hospital leaders hope the outside advisers will help. On its website, Ovation Healthcare says it has worked with more than 375 hospitals and health systems in 47 states, including the nearby Springfield Hospital, a 25-bed facility that had to reorganize its finances through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in 2019 and 2020.
“Springfield Hospital,” the Ovation site says, “went from one day’s cash on hand and millions owed to vendors and banks to a lower total debt, improved cash flow and positive days cash.”
Five years later, the Green Mountain Care Board noted in a recent ruling that “Springfield is an efficient hospital that can deliver care at lower-than-average cost.” That said, regulators added, “we are concerned about Springfield’s financial health” because of smaller yet continued negative operating margins in the past three fiscal years.

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)A coalition of North Carolina voting rights advocates on Monday denounced newly proposed congressional maps they say would dismantle the state’s historic Black Belt district and erode Black political power in the state’s northeast.
The group held a press conference hours after a Senate committee adopted a redistricting plan that would make the 1st Congressional District more favorable to Republicans. It is North Carolina’s only competitive United States House seat.
The 1st District, anchored in northeastern North Carolina, has elected Black representatives for more than three decades. It is currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, who won reelection last year by less than two points. Under the new map, Davis’s home county of Greene would be moved into the adjacent 3rd District, represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy. Members of Congress are not required to live in their districts.
Voting rights advocates said the proposal would split up communities that have long shared historical and economic ties, particularly in the state’s Black Belt region. The district includes several majority-Black counties such as Halifax, Hertford and Bertie — areas that have been the backbone of Black political participation in North Carolina since the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act.
“Please don’t buy into it when someone says ‘This isn’t about race, it’s about party,’ because those two things are intertwined,” said Kat Roblez, senior voting rights counsel with Forward Justice.
“This map … is really a retaliation against the people of the 1st District for the audacity to select the representative that the General Assembly doesn’t approve of … and was drawn explicitly for political gain,” said Marques Thompson, organizing director for Democracy North Carolina and a district resident.
Ashley Mitchell, a staff attorney with Forward Justice who also lives in the 1st District, said the redistricting plan threatens communities that fought for decades to gain representation. “It’s the people power that pisses off our legislature, which is why we see so much pushback against the voters,” said Ashley Mitchell, a staff attorney with Forward Justice. We are not going to sit back. We are going to fight back in 2026 and show that the people truly do have the power to elect our representatives and leaders, whether they like it or not.”
Republicans currently hold 10 of North Carolina’s 14 congressional seats. With the new map, the GOP could expand its advantage to 11–3, a shift that comes as former President Donald Trump pushes to maintain Republican control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterms.
“The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), said as he presented the plan in the Senate Elections committee Monday. “Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives. And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump’s agenda.”
Trump posted on social media thanking North Carolina Republicans for the plan, calling it an opportunity to “elect another MAGA Republican” next year. 
Gov. Josh Stein called the proposal a “cynical power grab” during a news conference Monday morning. “The Republican legislature is abusing its power to take away yours,” Stein said, as he urged lawmakers to instead pass new spending for the state’s mental health system and Medicaid.
Shruti Parikh, director of education & political engagement for North Carolina Asian Americans Together, said the state’s majority-Republican leadership is “taking the coward’s way out and putting a thumb on the scale.” She added that North Carolinians “deserve leadership that works for us, not politicians who twist the rules to protect their own power.”
Former U.S. Reps. Eva Clayton and G.K. Butterfield, who both represented the 1st District, also criticized the plan, saying it would “silence communities that have long been the backbone of northeastern North Carolina.” In a joint statement released through Common Cause NC, they called the map “a moral regression” and condemned the lack of public input.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-NC-Map-1024x666.png,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The chairman of the State Election Commission did not read the agency’s budget request, which included a payment he claimed was far beyond what the commission approved, before signing off on it last year, he said Monday.
Dennis Shedd has repeatedly said he and other commissioners thought voting machines bought last year would cost $28 million in taxpayer money. He blamed recently fired executive director Howard Knapp for not telling commissioners about an additional $4 million in the contract, which Shedd said commissioners learned about in the past two weeks.

FY26 E280 - Election Commission (1) 
But in September 2024, Shedd signed off on a budget request that included $32 million for new ballot scanners. Shedd’s signature and printed name appeared beneath a line affirming he had “reviewed and approved” the plan, “which is complete and accurate to the extent of my knowledge,” according to the document.
Shedd didn’t know about the discrepancy because he didn’t read the 32-page document, he told reporters following a State Election Commission meeting Monday.
“I probably didn’t even thumb through it,” Shedd said.
Shedd again faulted Knapp, who he has accused of creating a “toxic and perhaps hostile work environment” within the 65-person agency and misrepresenting the contract to commissioners, for not telling the commission about the increase in price.
An attorney representing Knapp has not responded to requests for comment Monday or last week.
The commission’s work is on a voluntary basis, so commissioners shouldn’t be expected to comb through budget requests, Shedd said.
“That’s not our job normally,” Shedd said. “We don’t take apart the budget and requests for expenses line by line.”
Gov. Henry McMaster appointed Shedd to the commission as its chairman in March 2024, saying in a statement at the time he was “uniquely qualified to lead the state election commission” because of his 12 years as a U.S. district judge. The governor’s office declined to comment Monday. The governor is responsible for appointing the entire governing board.
The five-member commission, which currently has one vacancy, acts as the executive director’s boss by overseeing and approving the director’s work, including spending.
Chairs for boards and commissions overseeing state agencies must sign off on budget requests alongside their respective executive directors. The requests, submitted in the fall to the state Department of Administration, start the process for the next budget year.
Unlike other board chairs, however, Shedd asked agency staff to add a line that he claimed showed he did not take responsibility for the accuracy of the request. The first page behind the sign-off cover sheet was a listing of 10 funding requests that totaled nearly $43.7 million, with the $32 million for a “voting system upgrade” at the top.
SC Election Commission has questions about $32M contract after firing director

“This document was completed by agency staff in compliance with state law and thereafter transmitted to the Department of Administration,” reads the “disclaimer,” as Shedd called the addition.
The first time Shedd saw the $32 million listed in the budget request was when reporters showed him a copy Monday, he said. Even if he had read through the document, he wasn’t sure he would have known whether the money was for the contract commissioners had authorized or if some of the money was meant to go elsewhere, he said.
Shedd wouldn’t have signed off if he saw the $32 million and understood where it was going, he said. He would have asked Knapp to go back to the company selling the voting equipment and attempt to negotiate the price down.
“I can tell you this much: If I had an inkling that $32 million represented that deal on the voting machines, I would have said, ‘Wait, wait,’” Shedd said.
Each item in a budget request includes a brief explanation for lawmakers of how the agency plans to spend the money. The election commission planned to use the $32 million to pay off a loan used to purchase ballot scanners and tabulators provided to every county, according to the description in the document.
Instead of reading through the request, or the included summary sheet, Shedd relied on Knapp to go over the highlights out loud during commission meetings, including any changes in amounts, he said.
“Don’t you have to take it that the person who’s working for the agency is truthful and is disclosing everything to you?” Shedd said. “Don’t you assume that?”
What began as a $28 million agreement ballooned without the commission’s knowledge, Shedd said.
The agreement Knapp made with the voting machine company came out to be about $800,000 higher than what the commission had authorized, and the loan he signed through the treasurer’s office was higher still. Knapp signed a second loan in January to add on about $2 million in sales taxes not included in the initial deal, said interim director Jenny Wooten, who took over when Knapp was fired last month.
The agency was supposed to make its first payment by Sept. 30 on machines bought and put in place ahead of last November’s election.
But it won’t get its $11 million that legislators approved in the state budget until February. That’s because the Legislature put a directive in the state budget delaying one-time allotments to agencies in case last year’s surplus would be needed to plug any gap due to an economic downturn for ongoing expenses.
Late fees on the voting machine bill start Oct. 30. Delaying the first payment is expected to cost the commission an additional $140,000, bringing the total for the ballot scanners, with interest, to more than $33 million.
The bank financing the loan agreed to push back the first installment, and the commission unanimously agreed Monday to authorize a change to the contract, allowing the agency to avoid defaulting on its payments.
Despite Shedd saying repeatedly he would have scrutinized every part of the document if he knew what he knows now, the chairman acknowledged he did not thoroughly examine the request submitted last week for the budget slated to begin June 1, 2026.
Shedd took home the request, “looked through it generally,” then told Wooten everything seemed fine and signed his name, he said. He again relied on Wooten, who mentioned a $25 million request to pay off the remainder of the loan during the last meeting, to get everything right, he said.
“I don’t go through it line by line,” Shedd said of the requests.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4301-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

When Gallup first measured media trust in the 1970s, nearly 70% of Americans said they had confidence in newspapers, TV, and radio to report the news fairly and accurately. Today, that number has plunged to just 28%. Among Republicans, it’s a staggering 8%.
That’s not just a crisis — it’s an existential threat to journalism, if not democracy. But what, if anything, can be done about it?
One bold idea is about to be tested in Indianapolis: Hire an independent public editor — not tied to any single news outlet — to monitor and critique how local journalism is practiced.
A first of its kind
Think of it like a citywide ombudsman. This person would serve the public by analyzing news coverage across all local media — print, broadcast, radio and digital — and offer fair-minded feedback, praise, and criticism. The goal: to hold newsrooms accountable while helping citizens better understand how journalism works.
The nonprofit Poynter Institute is launching the pilot project, with funding from the Lumina Foundation and the Hearst Foundations. They’re calling the role a local public editor, and the concept is simple but ambitious.
Poynter senior vice president Kelly McBride says:
“The goal of a local public editor is to help the people who live in Indianapolis understand their news ecosystem better and ultimately enable people to hold their local journalists accountable for what they need from them, and also, when appropriate, to elevate great journalism.”
McBride should know. She currently is NPR’s public editor and once served in the same role for ESPN.
Serving two audiences
The public editor, McBride says, will serve two audiences. “Your first audience is the public. It’s right there in the title. But your second audience is the journalists. You’re looking at their work. What you want with that second audience is respect.”
The public editor should not expect miraculous change from journalists. “Nobody is ever going to call you up when you have criticized what they’ve done and say, Oh my god, you are 100% right and we are going to change the way we do this. That does not happen. I’ve done this for five years for NPR. Instead, what you see is the journalists making subtle changes to their work.”
Once in place, the editor will accept questions from readers and viewers about how specific stories were covered. They’ll investigate and report back — calling out flaws, celebrating strengths, and explaining newsroom decisions.
So far, only three Indianapolis news outlets have agreed to run the public editor’s work: a public radio station and two online publications. The Indianapolis Star and the main TV news outlets haven’t signed on. McBride says some had trouble getting corporate buy-in and others prefer a wait-and-see approach. Still the public editor will critique coverage from all news outlets in town and will publish the findings on the three cooperating news outlets.
Worth a try?
As a former news director, I admit — I might have been defensive if an outsider said they were going to publicly review our work. Journalism is tough enough without someone watching over your shoulder. But looking at those Gallup numbers, I might have come around. If it helps us serve our audience better, isn’t it worth a try?
One Indianapolis supporter is Phil Bremen, a former local news anchor, NBC News correspondent and longtime journalism professor at Ball State University in Muncie.
“I think it’s a great idea,” he told me. “So many people consume media without really understanding how it gets there — or how to separate the wheat from the chaff.”
Bremen hopes both sides benefit: citizens becoming smarter media consumers, and journalists improving their craft through thoughtful feedback. And when public criticism turns out to be off-base? That’s part of the process, too.
He hopes the public editor will “weigh the evidence and lay out the facts as he or she finds them. And on those occasions when a piece of reporting that’s come under criticism from the audience is exonerated, then that’s good news.”
McBride hopes to have the editor hired and up and running yet this year. She has enough funding for 18 months but hopes it will be extended beyond that.

In this Oct. 17, 2025, image, Girod delivers the annual State of the University speech at KU. (Photo taken by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The University of Kansas said Monday the chancellor privately shared insights about a proposed compact offering preferential treatment by the Trump administration in exchange for freezing tuition rates, limiting international student enrollment and restraining campus employees from expressing political views.
KU Chancellor Doug Girod, vice chair of the prestigious Association of American Universities, responded to a request Friday to provide feedback on President Donald Trump’s unprecedented plan to bring higher education institutions into line with his agenda.
Six of nine universities originally offered the Trump deal have rejected the offer, which was denounced in a statement by the American Council on Education and dozens of other education associations. KU’s last-minute role in a virtual meeting was sought along with that of Washington University in St. Louis as well as Arizona State University. It wasn’t clear if KU was asked to sign the deal with Trump as well.
“Chancellor Girod was invited to provide feedback to federal officials on the Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education and related matters impacting universities,” said Erinn Barcomb-Peterson, director of media relations at KU. “The chancellor described the discussion as productive, and federal officials were interested in his perspective.”
After the meeting, Linda McMahon, secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, the gathering with Girod and others was “an important step toward defending a shared vision.”
“With continued federal investment and strong institutional leadership, the higher education sector can do more to enhance American leadership in the world and build tomorrow’s workforce,” she said. “A renewed commitment to the time-honored principles that helped make American universities great will strengthen the country and deepen public confidence in higher education.”
The White House convened the group ahead of Monday’s deadline for reaction and comment from nine private and public institutions — KU wasn’t on that list — initially contacted by the Trump administration. No institutions have signed the agreement.
On Saturday, Dartmouth President Sian Beilock issued a statement that said she shared on the call that “I do not believe that a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas. ”
Paul Mahoney, interim president of the University of Virginia, said a contract with the federal government predicating assessment of students on anything other than merit would erode confidence in U.S. higher education and threatened to undermine lifesaving research programs.
The Trump administration since taking office in January has blocked billions of dollars in research grants in an effort to compel operational changes at U.S. universities and colleges. Reasons for the budget cuts included alleged antisemitism on campus; policies ensuring LGBTQ+ equality, and operation of programs tied to diversity, equity and inclusion.
Frustrated by pushback from higher education, the White House delivered letters Oct. 1 to select colleges and universities on the Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. The strategy was to invite voluntary compliance with changes the Trump administration could have difficult enforcing.
The Trump administration’s compact would mandate schools freeze tuition for five years, limit international students to 15% of undergraduate enrollment, impose standardized tests for admission, abide by a ban on DEI programs and adopt a definition of gender that would block transgender individuals from using restrooms or participating in sports that aligned with their gender identity.
In addition, the arrangement would forbid participating colleges and universities from allowing employees to express political views on behalf of their institutions. Academic departments offering opinions counter to views held by conservatives would have to be closed. Students and employees would be polled on compact compliance and the results released publicly. There would be financial penalties for institutions that violated pledges included in the deal.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that other colleges or universities beyond those contacted so far could be signers of the reform deal.
American Council on Education’s statement with 35 other organizations in opposition to the compact said Trump’s maneuvering raised concern about undermining qualities that made the U.S. educational system exceptional.
“The compact offers nothing less than government control of a university’s basic and necessary freedoms — the freedoms to decide who we teach, what we teach and who teaches,” the statement said. “The compact is just the kind of excessive federal overreach and regulation, to the detriment of state and local input and control, that this administration says it is against.’
The joint statement said the proposed compact would hamper ability of colleges and universities to innovate and make advancements that contributed to the nation’s economic well-being and security.
“It would hinder, not safeguard, freedom of expression for all points of view, and it will not assist in expanding social and economic mobility for all of our students,” the statement read.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Doug-Girod-KU-speech-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 17:01:55.922322

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)PHILADELPHIA — A Department of Justice attorney on Monday urged a federal appeals panel to allow Alina Habba to remain New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor in a case likely to determine whether President Donald Trump can appoint U.S. attorneys without Senate approval.
Henry C. Whitaker, counselor to Attorney General Pamela Bondi, squared off with two attorneys challenging Habba’s legitimacy during nearly 90 minutes of arguments before three U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals judges at the James A. Byrne federal courthouse.
Whitaker defended the unprecedented series of moves Trump officials took in July to keep Habba, Trump’s former personal lawyer, in the post after the Senate did not act on her nomination within the required 120-day time period set by statute.
Thousands protest Donald Trump at New Jersey No Kings rallies

Attorney Abbe Lowell, representing a criminal defendant who says Habba lacked authority to indict him, accused Trump officials of using “a jerry-rigged way” to maintain Habba in the role and implored the judges to uphold a lower court’s August ruling disqualifying her and banning her from further prosecutions (that ruling was stayed pending appeal).
Whitaker argued his case first, but barely a minute after he started speaking, a judge interrupted with a pointed question that set the tone for the rest of the hearing. Judge D. Brooks Smith noted the two titles Habba now has after the Trump administration’s maneuvers — acting U.S. attorney and special attorney.
“Which, what, who is this person, what actual position are they serving, and when?” Smith asked.
Whitaker explained that Habba became acting U.S. attorney by default after a head-spinning few July days during which New Jersey’s federal judges, in response to the Senate’s inaction, voted to replace Habba with her second-in-command, Desiree Leigh Grace, over the objections of the Trump administration. In response, Bondi fired Grace, named Habba special prosecutor, and delegated to her the authority to supervise all pending prosecutions. Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney, and Bondi appointed Habba first assistant U.S. attorney. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant U.S. attorney automatically becomes the acting U.S. attorney when the top job becomes vacant.
The timeline as described by Whitaker spawned a slew of questions from the jurists.
“Isn’t that a redundancy?” Smith asked.
“So she has full power as acting U.S. attorney?” Judge D. Michael Fisher chimed in.
“Are there any functional differences between those two positions, or are they just titles?” Smith followed up.
Lowell capitalized on the judges’ perplexity about both Habba’s string of job titles and the various statutes Whitaker cited to defend them.
“The government cites a chimera of seven different statutes that they alternate depending on what they are trying to accomplish, to call her,” Lowell said, ticking off Habba’s various job titles since she was first appointed in March.
He added: “She’s now asking the court to affirm she’s two things at one time.”
Lowell and James Pearce, representing the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey, renewed their concerns that the Trump administration’s moves to reinstall Habba unconstitutionally bypassed checks and balances meant to protect the post’s independence.
“Executive branch practice must yield in the face of clear law,” Pearce told the judges. “At the core of this case, the government has thwarted Congress’s attempt and its constitutional obligation to regulate the filling of U.S. attorneys’ positions.”
The judges asked questions about Habba’s lack of prosecutorial experience, with Fisher noting language in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act that allows the president to appoint someone as acting officer of an agency if that person has served 90 days in the agency during the prior year.
“It’s not the best and most clearest statute I’ve ever read, I’ll grant you that,” Fisher said. “It does say to me that Congress had a very specific intent – they wanted an experienced person.”
Whitaker responded: “There is no categorical requirement that there be any level of experience.”
The judges also pushed back on Whitaker’s claims that first assistant U.S. attorneys are political positions.
“First assistants are overwhelmingly political appointees,” Whitaker said.
Smith cut in, asking: “What do you consider a political appointee? Because all I can tell you, in my experience, is that the appointment of, selection of a first assistant in a U.S. attorney’s office is anything but a political appointee.”
Whitaker responded that first assistants serve at the will of the attorney general, making them “something akin to political appointees.”
The judges also mused whether Trump officials would continue to extend Habba’s term through successive appointments and asked whether her current titles have any time limits. Neither side offered a clear answer.
“We are not asking for a limitless power to appoint acting officials,” Whitaker said. “We color within the lines here.”
Smith called the sequence of events surrounding Habba’s appointment “unusual.”
“Can you come up with an example of any time that such a concatenation of events has occurred with respect to the appointment of a United States attorney?” he asked Whitaker.
“Well, I guess I cannot,” he responded.

 Blue slips
Habba did not attend the four-hour August hearing in Pennsylvania after which U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled that she has served as the state’s top federal prosecutor “without lawful authority” since July 1 and voided all actions she has taken in that role since then.
But she showed up to Monday’s hearing with a broad smile, hugging various members of her large legal team before arguments started and asking them: “Ready to rock and roll?”
She did not speak during the hearing and declined to answer reporters’ questions afterward. Instead, she used social media to blast the “blue slip” tradition, in which a nominee’s home-state senators can block their confirmation. Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, have objected to Habba continuing in the role permanently, accusing her of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”
“The continued invocation of blue slips, a tradition not a rule, demonstrates a politically motivated effort to impede the President’s constitutional authority to appoint U.S. Attorneys,” Habba wrote. “The President appoints individuals to carry out the mission of this administration and that mandate should be respected. When millions of Americans voted for a change in leadership in November, they voted for a new direction. That choice should not be undermined by political obstruction in Congress or by criminal defendants.”
Federal prosecutions have largely ground to a halt in New Jersey, as the challenge to Habba’s authority makes its way through the courts. The government shutdown, now in its third week, added to the courts’ paralysis, with Chief U.S. District Judge Renée Marie Bumb earlier this month ordering most civil litigation suspended until at least November or until the shutdown ends.
The appellate judges now mulling Monday’s arguments did not say when they expect to issue a decision.
Fisher and Smith are both senior judges and Bush appointees, while the third judge on the panel, L. Felipe Restrepo, is an Obama appointee. Observers expect the case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Photo via President Donald Trump/Truth Social)Lethal U.S. military airstrikes on suspected drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea have congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle from Washington state raising concerns.
The latest attack, announced Sunday, is the seventh known strike since the Trump administration began the campaign in September. It killed three men. In total, the administration has acknowledged killing more than 30 people in the strikes.
U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Bellevue, and freshman U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, both say Congress should have more oversight of the attacks.
“I don’t have a problem with drug smugglers being sent to the bottom of the ocean,” Baumgartner said during a call with reporters on Sunday. “I do have concerns about the process.”
Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, wants House Speaker Mike Johnson to call the chamber back into session during the ongoing government shutdown for a hearing on the strikes.
“President Trump and his Administration continue to fail to answer pressing questions regarding the President’s orders to carry out lethal U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea,” Smith said in a statement. 
“They have failed to demonstrate the legality of these strikes, provide transparency on the process used, or even a list of cartels that have been designated as terrorist organizations,” he added.
Baumgartner, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said “Congress does need to be involved when military action is taken.” 
“I’ll be looking forward to getting updates from the White House and when we do return to D.C.,” he said, “to see what is the plan and what the authorization is.”
Baumgartner’s comments are a rare, albeit mild, rebuke of Trump administration policies from a congressional Republican. 
Republican leadership in the Senate this month turned down a Democrat-backed measure to require congressional authorization for the strikes. Republican Sens. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, signaled support for the resolution. 
The U.S. military in recent weeks has destroyed boats the White House suspects are being used by cartels to smuggle drugs from South America to the United States.
Colombian President Gustavo Petro recently accused the U.S. military of killing an innocent civilian in one of the incidents. Trump responded by saying he would cut off foreign aid to the country.
The Trump administration sent two survivors of a strike last week back to their home countries — Colombia and Ecuador — instead of prosecuting or detaining them. 
The White House says the United States is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels to justify killing the alleged traffickers, instead of arresting them. Legal experts have widely disputed this rationale. 
Meanwhile, the military leader overseeing the boat strikes announced last week he was stepping down less than a year into his tenure as head of the U.S. Southern Command. It was unclear if Adm. Alvin Holsey’s decision was tied to friction with the White House over the attacks.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Department of Justice has fined Republican leaders in the state House of Representatives and the lone Democrat on the Executive Council for campaign finance violations, according to cease-and-desist letters sent Friday.
The DOJ sent letters to Republican House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, Executive Councilor Karen Liot Hill, Deputy Majority House Leader Joe Sweeney, and the Committee to Elect House Republicans Friday evening. The letters accused the four of violating state laws that regulate how candidates for elected office can spend their money and how that money must be reported.
Osborne
In its letter to Osborne, who represents Auburn in the House, the DOJ told the state representative he and his candidate committee filed its 2022 campaign finance reports over 33 months late. For the 2024 election cycle, the DOJ said Osborne’s committee finance reports were 10 months late. It fined Osborne and his committee $2,000 over the matter.
The DOJ is also fining the Committee to Elect House Republicans, of which Osborne is chair, $1,500. The letter from the DOJ, addressed to Osborne and another House Republican, Jim Kofalt, who serves as the committee’s treasurer, said that as of January — when it first alerted the committee — roughly $68,000 was unaccounted for in the organization’s 2024 election cycle reports. Additionally, roughly $15,000 was unaccounted for in reports related to a special election in 2023 and $86,000 was unaccounted for in the 2022 election cycle reports, per the letter. It also said the committee didn’t file one of the required reports for the 2022 election cycle and had errors in its December 2022 report. However, the committee was able to reconcile these issues in the reports by hiring an accountant, the DOJ said. Still, this fix was too late in the DOJ’s eyes.
“Although this Office appreciates that CTEHR voluntarily and diligently worked to correct the issues with its campaign finance filings, CTEHR’s initial failure to timely and accurately report its receipts and expenditures during the 2022 and 2024 election cycles deprived the public of this information when it mattered most — during and immediately after the 2022 and 2024 election cycles,” the DOJ wrote in its letter. 
Liot Hill
In its letter to Liot Hill, the DOJ said she inadvertently used campaign funds from her campaign committee on personal purchases — including cleaning her home after campaign events, clothes she wore during campaign events, and her car registration, all things she said she believed were legal campaign expenses but were not — during the 2024 election cycle. And although she corrected that by reimbursing her campaign committee with her own money after the DOJ notified her of the error in December, she failed to correct the campaign finance reports in time, which constitutes a violation. Additionally, Liot Hill and her committee have yet to file two required campaign finance reports, the DOJ said. The DOJ is ordering her to pay a $1,000 fine for the violations. Liot Hill is a Democrat who represents communities including Lebanon, Concord, Littleton, Peterborough, and Hinsdale on New Hampshire’s Executive Council.
“This office recognizes that this was your first campaign for statewide office,” the letter read. “This Office further recognizes that you promptly and willingly agreed to reimburse your campaign for all improper expenditures. However, you chose to run for executive council and to accept more than $100,000 in campaign contributions. Those decisions created an obligation for you to familiarize yourself with campaign finance requirements.”
Sweeney
The DOJ also fined a political action committee run by Sweeney, who represents Salem in the House and serves on the Salem Town Council, $500. The DOJ said the PAC Granite Solutions did not file all its required campaign finance reports during the 2024 election cycle, including a 48-hour expenditure report related to a mailer. After the DOJ initially notified Granite Solutions of its missing reports in February, the PAC promptly corrected the omissions, the DOJ said. Still, because it was late, the DOJ is fining Granite Solutions.

The UW-Platteville Baraboo Sauk County is set to close after a steep decline in enrollment. The two-year campus hit an enrollment peak in 2000 with 758 students. Enrollment on the campus hit an all time low this semester with 116 students. 
Baraboo Sauk County is the eighth branch campus to be closed or dramatically downsized since 2023. It is also the second branch campus under the management of UW-Platteville to be shut down after the campus in Richland County was shuttered in July 2023. 
“This decision was not made lightly,” UW-Platteville Chancellor Tammy Evetovich said in the announcement Friday. “Enrollment continues to decline on that campus, and we are committed to being good partners with the city and county by ensuring the campus can be used in ways that best serve the region.”
Enrollment on UW’s branch campuses has steadily declined in recent years, however campus faculty and staff, as well as residents of affected communities, have blamed UW administration officials for decades of decision making that deprioritized maintaining the two-year campuses. 
State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) blamed the closures on Republican budget decisions.
“Campus closures and the march towards consolidation is a result of Republican politicians viewing higher education as a luxury good that only those who can afford it deserve,” she said in a statement. “In their view, UW is just another cost preventing them from giving more public money to their billionaire campaign backers. The ‘budget shortfalls’ that led to this closure were manufactured over the last 15 years by right-wing politicians who systematically divested from public higher education while strangling UW’s ability to manage its own financial affairs.”

(Screenshot of campaign ad)Businessman Will Martin launched his campaign for lieutenant governor Monday, joining a growing field for the second-highest executive office in Wisconsin.
Martin called himself a “common-sense conservative” in his launch ad, saying there is a “quiet crisis” of young people leaving the state. This is Martin’s second campaign for the office. He came in fifth in the 2022 primary when former U.S. Rep. Roger Roth was the Republican nominee.
“Wisconsin jobs are being lost. AI and automation are disrupting entire industries, and for far too many, homeownership has become a distant, if not impossible dream,” Martin said. “As lieutenant governor, I’ll work to cut the size and cost of state government and restore the promise of the American Dream together. Let’s ignite a new era of freedom, opportunity, and prosperity from Kenosha to Cornucopia.”
Martin worked in the administrations of former Govs. Tommy Thompson and Scott Walker. Under the Walker administration, he worked in the Wisconsin Housing & Economic Development Authority and the Department of Workforce Development.
Martin joins Former Lancaster Mayor David Varnam, who launched his campaign in September, in the race. Varnam also ran for lieutenant governor in 2022, coming seventh in the primary.
“I am concerned about my family’s future and the path Democrats are taking Wisconsin down,” Varnam said in his announcement. “We need to lower taxes to keep retirees, young people, and businesses in Wisconsin. Our schools need to focus on raising standards, test scores, and expectations for our students. As a father of two daughters, I will fight to keep men out of women’s sports and protect their locker rooms.”
Wisconsinites will cast their votes separately for governor and lieutenant governor during the partisan primary next year. The winners of the primaries will run on the same ticket in November and voters choose them as a pair.
The partisan primary is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026.
Republican candidates for governor include U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann.
Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, a Democrat, launched her campaign for lieutenant governor in August.

Oct. 14, 2025 | ScreenshotThe Michigan Court of Appeals has denied a writ of habeas corpus for seven chimpanzees currently at the DeYoung Family Zoo in Wallace, Mich., affirming a decision from the trial court that chimpanzees are not ‘persons’ under the law. 
The Nonhuman Rights Project, who are representing the chimpanzees, had been seeking a court order to show the merits of the case — but the appeals court judges called that argument “unpersuasive.”
“On the face of the complaint, the chimpanzees at defendants’ zoo are not eligible for habeas relief,” the decision read. “The chimpanzees are animals, and as the common law authorities all make clear, animals—including wild animals, such as these chimpanzees—are treated as property.  No exception exists for ‘intelligent’ animals, which in any event has no natural stopping point.”
The question of that “stopping point” was a central point in a hearing for the case last week, in which judges questioned the argument of lawyer Jake Davis that autonomy should be the defining line of which beings have a right to habeas corpus.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The lawyers for the chimpanzees issued a statement criticizing this decision, writing, “The Nonhuman Rights Project is deeply troubled that the Michigan Court of Appeals declined to protect autonomy—a supreme value under Michigan law—when the autonomous beings are chimpanzees.”
“While the decision properly treated the issue of nonhuman eligibility for habeas corpus relief as one for judges to consider under the common law, the Court of Appeals held that it was bound by 19th-century Michigan Supreme Court precedent treating animals as mere property,” the statement continued. “The chimpanzees confined in the DeYoung Family Zoo deserve the law’s protection because they are autonomous beings whose suffering matters.”

In the hearing, Judge Brock Swartzle, the presiding judge, referenced the Nonhuman Rights Project brief’s argument that the case of the chimpanzees was analogous to issues around the rights of women and enslaved people. 
In the decision, the judges specifically pushed back on that argument. 
“Plaintiff’s analogies to habeas proceedings involving women or enslaved persons do not alter this landscape,” the court’s opinion reads. “Those episodes reflect failures to honor human personhood, not expansions of it beyond the human species.”
The Nonhuman Rights Project added in their statement that they plan to send the case to the Michigan Supreme Court, asking them to “reject this outdated classification.” 
The appellate court’s conclusion noted that “only our Supreme Court may revise that common law principle,” though they added that “plaintiff’s argument for doing so is in any event substantively unpersuasive.”

“Our doors are open,” said Peter Hadler, deputy commissioner at the state Department of Social Services, which manages SNAP in Connecticut. “We’re talking to everyone who’s concerned about this.”
Hadler spoke at a press conference at The Grocery on Broad Street in Hartford with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and others.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the Connecticut legislature have the ability to temporarily fund SNAP from state funds. The legislative leaders are planning a special session mid-November to put last fiscal year’s state budget surplus towards offsetting cuts to various assistance programs.
It costs $72 million monthly to fund SNAP in Connecticut.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, is a federal program. Blumenthal and nutrition program leaders urged an end to the shutdown.
During the last government shutdown, almost seven years ago, the USDA paid some benefits early to bridge a gap. This time around, the USDA told states that funds will be depleted come November.
Blumenthal said he has talked with Lamont and believes “he cares deeply about this issue.”
Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare, which runs the state’s food banks, said his colleagues in other states are “jealous” of how the Connecticut government has been working with Connecticut Foodshare to address the possible funding gap. If SNAP funding runs out, many recipients will head to food banks, which Jakubowski said will not be able to serve everyone.
“We are here in a state in which the state government is actually interested in figuring out, how do we help people? That’s not a conversation that’s happening in every state,” Jakubowski said.
Two weeks ago, Lamont announced the state would cover the funding lapse of a different food program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC. The program provides food for young children and nursing or pregnant women. But WIC is smaller and cheaper than SNAP: it costs about $6 million each month in Connecticut and serves around 52,000 people in the state.
The shutdown began when Democrats refused to support the GOP funding bill because it lets Affordable Care Act healthcare subsidies expire. Now, the two parties are fighting a messaging battle to convince Americans the other is responsible for the shutdown.
“If it isn’t addressed today, people won’t know whether they can afford health insurance, and they won’t buy it,” Blumenthal said. “So our leverage here is that we will insist that the health care tax credit be extended.”
He added that he sees the fight as about human rights, not politics.
When pressed about what might jump-start progress in Washington, Blumenthal said he saw “energy and momentum” at anti-Trump No Kings protests over the weekend.
He said he is having bipartisan conversations in Washington but his Republican colleagues don’t want those conversations to be publicly known for fear of angering the White House. He blamed House Republicans and speaker Mike Johnson for being “out of town and out of touch” and continuing the shutdown.
Democrats across the country have argued that the shutdown is about fighting for health care, and that Republicans are at fault because they control Congress and the White House. Blumenthal was on-message on Monday.
“The White House and both houses of Congress are under their control. There are limits to what we can do,” he said.
He added it was “myth and misinformation” that undocumented immigrants receive SNAP benefits, a point some Republican lawmakers have used against the program.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9945-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 16:17:12.296846

HOST: Hallie Claflin
GUEST: Mayor Dominick Pangallo 







IF YOU WALK DOWN the crowded streets of Salem in October, you’ll come face to face – literally – with witches, goblins, ghosts, and a whole lot of tourists. The small coastal city of 45,000 is just eight square miles, with downtown and waterfront areas representing only a fraction of that area. Yet a love of history and Halloween tradition brought more than a million visitors to the witch city last year in the month of October alone, breaking a record.  
To the delight of local businesses and often the dismay of downtown residents, Salem has something other Gateway Cities don’t: a thriving seasonal tourism economy. But its tourism boom in recent decades has been met with contempt from many local residents who struggle to leave their homes amid the October crowds and heavy traffic. And the tourism season is only getting longer.  
But no spell or magic can stop the visitors from coming, meaning the city has to step up.  
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon’s Gateway Cities reporter Hallie Claflin interviews Mayor Dominick Pangallo of Salem.  
“Our October preparation happens all year long. We start November 1,” Pangallo said. “We have about three and a half to four million tourists come to Salem every year, but to have a million of them coming in one month is definitely a significant endeavor for us to be able to manage that.”  
Pangallo explains that while essential to the local economy, the tourism boom isn’t as lucrative as some may think. He says the city spent close to $640,000 last year preparing for the flock of October tourists, most of which is spent on increased police presence and public works like barricades, portable restrooms, trash receptacles, and more. 
The city brought in about $700,000 in revenues last October, not including its meals and lodging tax, which is reported quarterly instead of monthly and totaled $1.5 million in the quarter that included October last year. It’s a small amount when compared to the city’s more than $200 million annual budget.  
“It’s helpful, but it’s not the largest source of revenue supporting city services by any means,” Pangallo said. “But it helps support the services that we especially need to be able to provide in October.”  
Pangallo pointed to a bill proposed by Gov. Maura Healey that would give municipalities the option to increase their local tax on meals and lodging. He says the city already meets the maximum limit set for both and adjusting it upward could help shift the city’s cost burdens onto the tourists who directly benefit from the services. 
For local businesses, tourism is lucrative, generating around $140 million in direct spending alone, Pangallo said.   
The tourism industry represents about 1200 jobs in Salem, which is just four percent of the local labor force, Pangallo said. But because of the visitor economy, the city enjoys a 98 percent storefront occupancy rate in the downtown and waterfront areas. But there are a handful of those that don’t benefit from the Halloween buzz.  
“Not every business in our downtown is connected to the tourism industry, so when October comes around, some of those places have a hard time with the regulars being able to get in and get a haircut or pick up something at the store,” Pangallo said.  
On the episode, Pangallo discusses how the city plans for the October influx (3:00), how lucrative the visitor economy truly is (7:49), and a pending state policy change that would benefit Salem (21:09).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

Jeana Renea Gamble, 61, was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Video of the arrest posted to Bluesky showed three officers holding her to the ground amid criticism from spectators. The video went viral over the weekend and led to widespread criticism of the officers. 
The Fairhope Police Department said in court documents that they received a complaint about the costume. In a statement posted to Facebook on Monday, the department said an officer “observed an individual in a phallic costume near the Baldwin Square Shopping Center.”

“The officer approached the woman and requested that she remove the costume, which is deemed obscene in a public setting; however, she refused to comply,” the statement said.
The rally was one of  over a dozen protests happening in the state on Saturday. The protests were peaceful with no major incidents reported. 
A message seeking additional comment was left with the Fairhope Police Department Monday. Attempts to find contact information for Gamble were not immediately successful. 
Johnston Tisdale, director of Indivisible Baldwin County, the organization that sponsored the protest, said in a statement Monday Gamble’s arrest violates the First Amendment.

“Ms. Gamble was peacefully expressing her point of view on Saturday. Her violent arrest for expressing herself in ways the police found rude is indefensible, morally and legally,” Tisdale said. “Public officials must take seriously their duty to uphold the First Amendment.

Four Missouri hunters win a landmark case ensuring public access to millions of acres of public land in the checkerboard landscape of Wyoming and five other states.
The post Corner crossing remains legal across much of the West after Supreme Court rejects appeal appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Supreme Court today declined to hear Carbon County ranch owner Fred Eshelman’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that corner crossing to reach public land is legal. The decision affects access to 2.44 million acres of public land in Wyoming and more in five other states.
The Supreme Court put Eshelman’s failed lawsuit, “Iron Bar Holdings, LLC v. Cape, Bradly H., Et al.,” on its list of rejected appeals, which the court published Monday morning. The order ends a five-year fight that pitted the public’s right to access public land against private property rights.
Bradly Cape and three hunting friends corner crossed — stepping from one piece of public land to another where the two intersected with two pieces of Eshelman’s private ranch — momentarily passing through the airspace above Eshelman’s property. Even though the Missouri men never set foot on his land, Eshelman sued them for trespassing.
The hunter’s attorney, Ryan Semerad, said the Supreme Court affirmed centuries-old tradition and laws that public land is held in trust by the government for all Americans. The ruling applies to 2.44 million acres in Wyoming alone.
“That means something,” he said of the trust principle. “That’s real, it’s sturdy. We’re just thrilled.”
“Where you have checkerboarded land and there are public parcels that are only accessible by corner crossing [and] the only way to get to it is at its section corners, the private landowners can’t stop you.” Ryan Semerad
“Awesome,” was Cape’s reaction. “We never thought one time that we were doing something wrong.”
Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl had sided with the hunters in the first ruling on the federal civil suit. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals backed Skavdahl and Eshelman appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. A Carbon County jury had previously found the hunters not guilty of criminal trespass in Carbon County Circuit Court. 
The case grew out of southern Wyoming, where land ownership resembles a checkerboard of alternating square-mile sections of public and private property.
“Where you have checkerboarded land and there are public parcels that are only accessible by corner crossing [and] the only way to get to it is at its section corners, the private landowners can’t stop you,” Semerad said. “They can’t call the sheriff. They can’t sue you for trespass as long as you don’t touch or damage their property.”
1885 law
Eshelman’s lead attorney, R. Reeves Anderson, said he was not authorized to comment following the Supreme Court’s decision not to take up the case. Eshelman, a North Carolina resident, couldn’t be immediately reached.
The hunters’ legal arguments relied on the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act, which prohibits blocking public access to public land, including by fencing and using threats and intimidation. Some landowners, law officers, agencies and agriculture groups have interpreted various corner-crossing cases to insist that corner crossing is trespassing.
In a criminal case separate from Eshelman’s civil suit, the Carbon County attorney, at Eshelman’s insistence, in 2021 charged Cape, Philip Yoemans, Zach Smith and John Slowensky with misdemeanor criminal trespass.
Three of the hunters corner crossed to reach public land surrounded by Eshelman’s 20,000-acre-plus Elk Mountain Ranch in 2020. All four corner crossed to hunt on wildlife-rich Elk Mountain in 2021.
A six-person Carbon County jury found them not guilty in 2022, returning a verdict in less time than it took a hungry reporter to order and consume a quickly made taco salad from Rose’s Lariat café in Rawlins.

The Supreme Court decision today was almost as swift and certain. It filed the order without comment or dissent.
“It’s just an immediate sign they have reviewed the matter in as short a window as possible,” Semerad said of the Supreme Court. “They looked at it and said, ‘We don’t need to do anything here,’ at least that’s my interpretation.”
The order spans the 10th Circuit’s jurisdiction across Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. Had the Supreme Court heard the case, whatever decision it reached would have applied across all 50 states.
Mixed feelings
Cape said he was torn over whether it would have been better for the Supreme Court to take the case and expand the 10th Circuit decision across the country — an uncertain proposition — or settle for what he, his companions and the rest of the country won in the 10th Circuit. Semerad, too, said he had mixed feelings.
“There’s just this little nugget in me that’s like, I wanted to go do the fight,” he said of the now-disappeared prospect of arguing the case in front of nine justices. “But that is totally personal. I just wanted to throw some more punches.”
“But for now, this is where the book closes.”

Cape and friends had been hunting in Wyoming the year before they first corner crossed. They stumbled across Elk Mountain and talking to nearby ranchers they learned it was thick with elk to the point neighbors had to protect their haystacks from the herd.
Eshelman, they were told, didn’t allow the general public to hunt on his ranch or to corner cross to reach public land enmeshed in his holdings. By blocking corner crossing, Eshelman reaped for himself the bounty of property belonging to all Americans, the hunters contended.
Cape did some research and found a real estate agent’s listing for the ranch around the time Eshelman bought it in 2005. That listing described the ranch as consisting of both private and public property, amounting to 50 square miles or about 32,000 acres.
The ranch on the 11,156-foot-high Elk Mountain was listed for $19.9 million at the time. Court rulings, the listing stated, give the ranch owner exclusive access to the enmeshed public land.
“Reading that is first what got me to looking into such a thing,” Cape said of corner crossing. “It just didn’t make sense to me,” he said of the notion that corner crossing was illegal.
The legal case Cape found, a 1970s saga known as Leo Sheep, dealt with the construction of a road, also in Carbon County, across a common checkerboard corner. The Supreme Court said the government did not have the right to build a road that invaded private property.
Fence builder
Cape owns the All-Type Fence company in Cuba, Missouri and knows something about property lines, he said.
“All I wanted to do was walk and hike and hunt and cross the corners,” he said. “So that [Leo Sheep] case didn’t have any relevance [to] me. I kind of realized what was going on, that it [the real estate listing and similar claims] was just propaganda trying to keep people out.”
He briefed his hunting buddies — a high school music teacher, a mechanic and an employee at his company.
“Once I found this [Leo Sheep case] and figured this out kind of on my own and then relayed that information to them, they never doubted me,” he said. “They were good to go.”
Cape credited Semerad and fellow attorney Lee Mickus, the Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and others. Backcountry Hunters raised funds to wrangle the case through the courts for five years, ensuring the men had the funding necessary to stand and fight in court.
Eshelman is a wealthy pharmaceutical magnate, a significant political donor to conservative causes and a philanthropist who’s given millions to his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. He’s also a hunter and conservationist who placed significant development restrictions on thousands of acres of private ranch land that he bought and sold around Elk Mountain.
Backcountry Hunters’ fundraising got a boost when Steven Rinella, an author, hunter, conservationist and television personality who founded The Meateater, featured the corning crossing saga in his broadcasts.
“Our money, like doubled overnight,” Cape said. “So it was pretty easy to see early on that the support that we had was incredible.”
Also incredible, Cape said, is what he learned.
“It’s just one of those life journeys that you don’t suspect,” he said. “You learn all kinds of stuff about the legal system.
“I didn’t realize … there was that much propaganda built up, selfishness.” Cape said. Landowners “just kind of made that stuff up as they went along,” he said, something that was “kind of shocking to me.”
Semerad looked ahead. “It’s a solid foundation upon which to think about how to orient your life,” he said. “There’s going to be bad actors who have their own intentions, who want to treat these public resources — like our public lands — as a private kingdom.
“But every time they do that, they are cutting against American tradition and history, and they’re going to lose and there’s going to be a way to beat them.”

The board has postponed a decision and plant to get more input.,"For over four hours, a standing-room-only crowd of residents watched as opponents and proponents of a planned asphalt plant pleaded their cases at a Lafayette County Board of Supervisors meeting. 
After the hearing, the board unanimously voted to table a decision on rezoning a property in the town of Taylor from agricultural to heavy industrial use to allow development of the plant. 
“We feel like that we need more time,” said Supervisor John Morgan, citing new information presented by both sides and a need for additional time for written statements to be submitted.
“You’re determining the fate of our regenerative farm operation and our livelihood,” said Ley Falkner, whose family lives on and runs Falkner Farms across from the proposed plant. 
The Falkner family, their representatives and the bevy of supporters argued that the plant poses a significant environmental and health risk to residents and is anathema to the county’s existing zoning plan. 
J.W. McCurdy, the plant developer and owner of the proposed site, and other proponents made the case that there’s a need for a new asphalt plant to accommodate Oxford’s growth. They said it would create jobs and economic development and tried to assure the board that there is minimal environmental risk.
One of the central questions around the rezoning is whether Taylor and Lafayette County have changed enough to justify rezoning. Both sides presented letters from experts ranging from city planners to university professors about the risks and benefits of the proposed plant.
“I am respectfully asking you to consider the agricultural impact the zoning change could have, not only with respect to the land, but also to local food production,” wrote Andy Gipson, state agriculture commissioner and gubernatorial candidate, in a letter to the board.
Emotions ran high in the packed meeting room, with most of the public’s comments being against the plant. One woman was escorted out of the building by a member of the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Department.
“That’s unfair, you gave (Mccurdy) 40 minutes,” said Elizabeth Falkner of Falkner Farms in response to her being cut off after five minutes while addressing the board. The crowd applauded.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20134425/img_7740_720.jpg,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas.
Last month, ECHN Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, submitted an $86.1 million bid for the two hospitals. Prospect did not receive any additional bids for the hospitals, court records show. The company originally paid $105 million when it purchased the two facilities in 2016. 
Tina Varona, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare, said the health system looks forward to the “opportunity to stabilize and expand the workforce at these hospitals, provide support to enhance quality and safety, and advance strategic investments in people, programs, technologies, facilities and community partners.”
“Every hospital that has joined Hartford HealthCare has experienced measurable positive results that benefit patients — including across-the-board top safety ratings, improved access to care close to home, leading-edge technology and the recruitment of world-class clinicians,” Varona wrote in an emailed statement.
Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to a request for comment.
The deal still needs to obtain state approval, known as the “certificate of need,” overseen by the Office of Health Strategy. OHS and the Lamont administration faced criticism over the time required to approve a failed $435 million deal signed in 2022 for Yale New Haven Health to acquire the three Prospect-owned hospitals.
That deal also became mired in legal disputes, with Yale New Haven and Prospect suing and countersuing each other over the true value of the hospitals. The parties recently settled, with Yale New Haven agreeing to pay Prospect $45 million to exit the deal and end all pending litigation.
During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers passed a measure that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete, Boyd Jackson, OHS’s director of legislation and regulation, said in an emailed statement.
The acquisition of Manchester Memorial and Rockville General would further expand the footprint of one of Connecticut’s largest health systems.
Hartford HealthCare currently owns seven hospitals across the state, the most of any health system in Connecticut, and earned roughly $6 billion in revenue in 2023. By comparison, Yale New Haven Health had higher revenue in 2023, $6.4 billion, but owns only four hospitals.
The announcement of Hartford HealthCare’s success marks the latest ownership development for Prospect’s three hospitals in Connecticut — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury Hospital.
The state plans to acquire Waterbury Hospital as part of a broader plan to expand its own struggling flagship medical institution, UConn Health. The state is also in talks to acquire two independent hospitals, Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam and Bristol Hospital. 
Officials hope the acquisitions will help boost the competitiveness of UConn Health in the world of academic medical institutions, as well as push the health system towards the ultimate goal of achieving financial sustainability for its clinical operations, so that it no longer has to rely on support from the state. 
The state is also seeking to borrow $390 million to fund the expansion project. The funding would primarily go towards capital improvement projects at all three hospitals, though it would also support the acquisition of Waterbury Hospital, state Comptroller Sean Scanlon said in a previous interview with the CT Mirror. 
On Oct. 3, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors voted to approve a $13 million bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. However, the health system had not submitted an offer as of Oct. 20.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

Indiana kicks off hunt for new utility regulators as affordability outrage grows

The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. It is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website.
When regulated utilities want to hike customer bills, they go to the commission for permission. The IURC can also regulate construction projects, asset acquisition, financing, bonding, environmental compliance plans, service territories and more.
Braun has suggested it has leaned too far in one direction.
“Ratepayers, I think, have taken the brunt of it,” he told reporters last month, after opening IURC applications. He called the affordability uproar “very analogous to what we went through on property taxes.”
Braun wants new appointees to focus on ratepayers, affordability and supply.
The commission can’t have more than three members of the same party, according to Indiana Code. Braun, a Republican, will fill two GOP openings and one Democratic vacancy. He’ll also have to choose who will chair the agency.
The jobs come with salaries of $152,000.
The 12 Republican finalists are:

Alfonso Vidal, a southern Indiana businessman
Andy Zay, who has served portions of northeast Indiana in the state Senate since 2016
Anthony Swinger, a 25-year employee of the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor
William Herrick, president of Midwest Energy Partners LLC

The bill cuts 20 percent of funding […]","THE RECENT REPUBLICAN megabill, H.R.1, slashed the largest amount from basic needs programs in American history to give tax breaks to the wealthy. The bill cuts 20 percent of funding from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – a basic needs program that serves 1 in 6 very low-income Massachusetts residents. Eligibility restrictions in H.R.1 threaten benefits for around 110,000 current Massachusetts recipients, including families with children, older adults, veterans, and homeless households. In Greater Boston alone, Boston Indicators estimates about 40,000 very low-income adults could lose benefits.  
However, to echo Gov. Healey: “In Massachusetts, we won’t accept that.” The Commonwealth has the expertise, the resources, and the moral commitment to make sure our neighbors do not go hungry. Our leaders must act decisively to combat the harms of the bill by investing in systemic solutions that ensure residents with the lowest incomes can put food on the table.  
Doing this requires investing in the state’s SNAP agency – the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) – to make sure eligible families can readily connect to SNAP.  
Massachusetts has done much to bring SNAP to homes that need it, such as allowing people to apply for SNAP at the same time they apply for MassHealth, the state Medicaid program. This, in addition to need intensified by the pandemic and high food costs, has contributed to a 45 percent caseload increase since March 2020. But DTA staffing has not kept pace with the increase. Pre-pandemic DTA data show the ratio of SNAP cases per SNAP worker as about 900 to 1. Now, it’s 1,300 to 1 — nearly 50 percent higher.  
The consequences of this imbalance are clear: Right now, nearly three of every four calls seeking help from a SNAP worker don’t get through because DTA doesn’t have enough staff to respond. Accuracy suffers – when DTA workers can’t talk to everyone who calls, they don’t get information they need to keep case information up to date. Overburdened workers also make more mistakes, burn out, and struggle to provide efficient customer service. We see this in the data. Since August 2024 the total number of people receiving SNAP has been notching down – even though severe food insecurity has been going up – in part because people cannot get access to the help they desperately need. 
We commend the governor for committing to level funding DTA case workers in the immediate term – but in the post H.R.1 world, we must go further to invest in SNAP. For example, we should tap into the Commonwealth’s rainy day fund to alleviate the existing and potential harm to recipients and increased state costs expected in the next few years. This includes making sure DTA has enough staff to enroll all eligible Massachusetts families and minimize mistakes.  
Even before the bill’s cuts, SNAP was not enough to meet the cost of a meal in any Massachusetts county. We know our colleagues in the emergency food delivery system do heroic work each day trying to address gaps. We have also seen great examples of philanthropic institutions, like the Boston Foundation, coming forward to help alleviate the cruelty and shortsightedness of the president’s legislation.  
But philanthropy can’t fully replace what food assistance programs offer. SNAP alone brings $2.6 billion in federal aid to the Commonwealth each year, accounting for $1 of every $5 spent at grocery stores in Massachusetts. While H.R. 1 may pass a percentage of those costs to Massachusetts (as much as 15 percent) based on the state’s effectiveness at delivering benefits, even at the highest rate, the cost share is a burden worth bearing. Any policy reducing SNAP eligibility in Massachusetts would likely not only hurt local businesses, it would also worsen health outcomes, increase health care costs, force residents to go hungry, and harm other programs like the Commonwealth’s universal school meal program. 
In this environment, strengthening and improving the efficiency of the DTA is an economic and moral imperative. We look forward to working with Gov. Healey, our Legislature, and partners to chart a path forward in Massachusetts that expands SNAP’s reach and fully harnesses the most efficient, impactful, and cost-effective program we have to reduce hunger and poverty.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Supreme Court's video)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court has approved a framework for virtual proceedings, extending pandemic-era approaches after hearing mixed opinions from judges and attorneys.
The court filed an order Tuesday with the Kansas Court of Appeals that urges district judges to consider accepting remote hearings or remote appearances in certain circumstances to improve efficiency and access to justice.
Remote proceedings were used during the COVID-19 pandemic, but since public and private spaces resumed typical gathering practices, it has been up to judges across Kansas how they want to use the technology in their courtrooms.
Kansas has lagged behind most other states. But the exception has been for criminal defendants in jail, who make early and brief appearances in court via video conference. Other states left the remote rules created during the pandemic in place or expanded them to allow remote appearings for a variety of hearings.
The Kansas Supreme Court outlined in the rule guidelines for judges in deciding whether to allow a remote hearing or appearance. Among them: If all parties agree, a proceeding is preliminary or for scheduling purposes, the time and expense of traveling for an in-person proceeding outweighs the benefits, a remote proceeding would increase access to the court or address an attorney shortage, or a person involved in the case expresses health concerns about attending in-person.
The rule attempts to balance concerns from some judges, who want to retain the discretion to decide whether remote proceedings happen in their courtrooms, and warnings from attorneys that requiring in-person hearings harms defendants and exacerbates the state’s attorney shortage.
Nearly 80% of Kansas attorneys live in five counties that contain about half of the state’s population: Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee and Wyandotte. The rest of the state is underrepresented, according to data from the American Bar Association.
Judges would retain discretion to deny a party’s request for a remote appearance under the rule, particularly if the request is untimely or if remote proceedings “would undermine the integrity, fairness, or effectiveness of the proceeding, such as when highly sensitive, particularly dense, or exhibit-heavy testimony is expected,” the rule said. A court must not hold a remote proceeding if it could threaten or violate a person’s rights under the Kansas and U.S. constitutions, privileged attorney-client communications are made difficult, public access is restricted, it interferes with a court’s ability to produce an accurate record, or a party or the court cannot access technology needed.
Acting Chief Justice Eric Rosen said in a Tuesday news release that remote hearings will, at times, promote efficiency,” just as there will be times when an in-person proceeding is absolutely essential to be fair and effective.”
He added: “Every case has its own set of facts and circumstances, so it was paramount the rule created a clear framework for someone to make a request while retaining a judge’s discretion whether to grant or deny the request.”
The final version of the rule included changes from the draft distributed for public comment in July, including adjusted wording to emphasize the discretion afforded judges. The following sentence was also added: “This rule does not provide any grounds for appellate review beyond existing statutory or constitutional law.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kansas-Supreme-Court-chamber.png,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan’s attorney general has joined several states in filing a friend of the court brief supporting the student-led campus newspaper of Stanford University, which sued the administration of President Donald Trump over its ideological deportation policy.
Attorney General Dana Nessel announced her involvement with the brief on Monday, filed by 20 state attorneys general in Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation v. Rubo. The lawsuit was initiated by The Stanford Daily in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, citing the Trump administration as targeting and punishing noncitizens with lawful status.
In the context of the student newspaper, The Stanford Daily notes that college students and faculty were particularly vulnerable to the administration’s immigration enforcement if they expressed political beliefs that did not align with Trump’s White House.
“Taking away student visas because of someone’s political opinions is an embarrassing and unconstitutional stance for this administration to take,” Nessel said in a statement. “Michigan is home to dozens of incredible colleges and universities that attract students and faculty from across the world. Actions like this don’t just silence debate on campus – they threaten everyone’s First Amendment rights by discouraging open discussion and the exchange of ideas. I join my colleagues in urging the court to uphold the right to freedom of speech.”
The lawsuit specifically targets two Trump executive orders – EO 14161 and EO 14188 – both of which laid the groundwork for the ideological deportation policy. The orders allow federal law enforcement and other agencies to investigate, detain and deport noncitizen students and faculty engaging in constitutionally protected political speech. The Stanford Daily argues the practice is causing a chilling effect among international student journalists, who have declined assignments, removed their bylines or resigned out of fear that their reporting could be grounds for their deportations.
Nessel and the other attorneys general filing the brief said that Trump’s use of ideology in this context was unlawful, and threatens the economic vitality, public health and safety of affected states. The harms also include detriments to the overall purpose of higher education.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts recently addressed the policy in American Association of University Professors v. Rubio, which ruled that First Amendment protections apply to citizens and lawfully present noncitizens.
Joining the brief were the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

Beverly Chester-Burton, D-Shively, speaking during a legislative committee meeting, Jan. 18, 2024. (LRC Public Information)Kentucky Democratic Rep. Beverly Chester-Burton has been placed on home incarceration following her arrest in 2024 for driving under the influence. 
Chester-Burton, from Shively, agreed to an Alford plea to driving under the influence on Oct. 15. According to Jefferson County District Court records, the state lawmaker was sentenced to 10 days on home incarceration. A charge of reckless driving was dismissed. 
Chester-Burton also received a work release stipulation, meaning she can still attend legislative meetings in Frankfort amid home incarceration. 
Her attorney, Krsna Tibbs, did not immediately return a request for comment from the Kentucky Lantern Monday. However, Tibbs told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Chester-Burton “took an Alford plea on a DUI with the condition of alcohol treatment.” He said that such a plea “allows her to maintain her innocence but acknowledges that the prosecution could win based on her word versus the officer.” 
“She is not serving a jail sentence, and she has no restrictions and will meet all her legislative obligations in Frankfort as normal,” Tibbs told the newspaper. 
According to the arrest citation from last year, police officers were responding to a domestic violence call when Chester-Burton drove her vehicle into oncoming lanes of traffic and “sat there for a minute forcing an oncoming vehicle to pass around her in the opposite oncoming lane.” Chester-Burton then pulled into the correct lane, but stopped her vehicle in the middle of the road and put it into park. 
The citation said that officers approached Chester-Burton and reported a strong alcoholic odor coming from her. Chester-Burton told officers she was coming from Frankfort and “people were calling her and asking what was going on in Shively.” 
After she was arrested and being transported to jail, Chester-Burton “stated that ‘these guys act like they haven’t ever been to a birthday party,’” the report said. 
House Democratic Caucus leaders — Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, Caucus Chair Al Gentry and Whip Lindsey Burke — said in a statement Monday that public officials “are entrusted with the confidence of the people and must uphold the highest standards of conduct.” 
“Impaired driving endangers lives, and we take that responsibility seriously,” the caucus leaders said.
“We are committed to encouraging her to address any personal issues that may be impacting her life, her community, and her public service.”
Chester-Burton was previously arrested for a DUI in 2020 after falling asleep in a drive-through line at a White Castle while she was the mayor of Shively. 
Chester-Burton was elected to the House in 2023 and represents the 44th House District, which includes western parts of Jefferson County.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/chester-burton011724-1024x702.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 15:57:31.812364

(Photo by Maria Pemberton/CommonWealth Beacon)It was three months into the second presidential administration of Donald Trump when a small group of New England university administrators convened at a 1902 Beaux-Arts mansion owned by Boston University, just a few blocks from the main campus on an unobtrusive treelined side street in Brookline.
They filed into a high-ceilinged conference room in a one-time steel magnate’s estate turned events center, with huge picture windows overlooking the sleepy residential neighborhood. Representatives of the international student recruiting company that was hosting the meeting strategically positioned themselves at the entrances, handing out agendas.
The peace and quiet were a stark contrast to the growing chaos in the broader world outside. Billions of dollars of federal research funding for many of the universities where these administrators worked was being cut, and investigations and sanctions were being fired at them by the Trump administration. Soon budgets would be slashed, programs shut down, and employees laid off. This day-long event was about a group that seemed to be facing yet another threat — one with equally grave implications for these schools and the larger Massachusetts economy: international students.
Just days earlier, masked agents had arrested a Tufts University doctoral student on a street in Somerville and whisked her to a detention center in Louisiana. Thousands of student visas were being revoked. International students already admitted to U.S. universities faced a slowdown in appointments for required consular interviews and would soon be required to provide their social media histories. The administration would later try blocking Harvard from enrolling international students at all, limit the proportion other elite schools others could admit, restrict the time these students could stay in the country, and increase the cost of the follow-on visas many have historically used to remain and get jobs here.
A succession of speakers broached these topics at the conference, which was sponsored by the Norwegian international student recruiting company Keystone Education Group. Some triggered nervous laughter, and there were anxious whispers between sessions and over the buffet lunch, from which some attendees had to excuse themselves to take phone calls from colleagues helping international students worried they might also be detained or wouldn’t be allowed to return to the US if they went home for the summer.










I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world. Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.


– Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president


The message of the gathering was grim. The seemingly ceaseless flow of international students so critical to Massachusetts universities and colleges would almost certainly slow — probably dramatically.
“You cannot pretend that students from X countries are going to be coming to us in Y numbers anymore,” Vera Grek, director of graduate and international enrollment at Wentworth Institute of Technology, told the meeting.
That’s a $4 billion-a-year problem for Massachusetts alone, which ranks fourth among states  — after California, New York, and Texas  —  in the number of international students at its universities and colleges. More than 82,000 international students studied here last year, supporting an estimated 35,849 jobs.
But there was something else the officials in this room knew. The institutions that they represented largely had themselves to blame for becoming so financially dependent on international students. Many schools in Massachusetts recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else, federal data show, increasing their numbers year after year to help fill each successive class. That’s largely because of a demographic decline in the number of domestic students in the Northeast, and the comparatively high cost of higher education here, which makes it less appealing to American applicants from places in the country where the number of 18-year-olds is steady or rising.
While international students comprise less than 5% of total enrollment at US universities, they make up 35% at Northeastern University, 34% at Clark University and Babson College, 31% at MIT, 29% at Berklee College of Music, 27% at Brandeis University, and 26% at Harvard. Even onetime commuter schools like the Boston and Lowell campuses of the University of Massachusetts state system have hugely increased their number of international students. International graduate students in particular proved so lucrative that, on one Massachusetts campus — Northeastern — they had come to make up more than two-thirds of graduate enrollment.
Yet as international students became increasingly essential, there were signs that fewer of them were coming, even before the turmoil of Trump’s second term. Global demand for American higher education had already started slipping under pressure from geopolitical tensions, increased competition, and concerns among prospective applicants about cost and safety. Fewer of the international students who were still coming could afford to pay full tuition. While the United States is still where the largest proportion of international students end up, its lead has been eroding, Keystone data show, In the fall before Trump’s reelection, the number of international graduate students and new undergraduates had already started to decline, according to the Institute for International Education, or IIE, threatening Massachusetts colleges’ reliance on them.
“I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world,” says Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president, who was also state commissioner of higher education from 2009 to 2015. “Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.”
That complacency now presents a potential multibillion-dollar hit to the economy, if international student flows further decline, as projections suggest they will. The number of international students arriving in the United States in August, before the start of this semester, was down nearly 20% compared to the same period last year, new figures show. International students don’t only help universities balance their books and inject dollars into the local economy by patronizing restaurants, buying cars, and renting off-campus apartments. They also create research that fuels business, fill jobs in knowledge industries, and create their own startups.
“The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot,” says JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, an industry group. “People coming here to be educated and staying here has been a foundation of our innovation ecosystem for decades. You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.”

Massachusetts universities and colleges started doubling down on international student recruitment around 2011, when domestic enrollment began a long decline. Since then, the number of students overall has fallen by more than 14 percent, but the number of international undergraduates at Massachusetts colleges and universities jumped by about 20 percent, an analysis of federal data show. The number in graduate programs, which are big money makers for universities, nearly doubled.
University admissions offices employ designated international recruiters who spend months living out of suitcases as they travel across the globe to entice students. Some team up with schools that teach English to prospective applicants and with companies like Keystone, which works with 5,500 institutions in more than 190 countries. These recruiting agents generate leads from online inquiries and help students pick countries and schools, complete their applications, and find places to live. As an indication of how important international students have become, many universities pay commissions to these agents, according to the National Association of College Admissions Counselors.
However they recruit, there were plenty of signs, even before Trump, that it was becoming harder for US universities to enroll international students — especially those who could afford to pay full American tuition. Instead, the market has shifted away from China and the Middle East to students from Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where many need financial aid. This means less revenue than in the past for the US universities they choose.
“The countries where [cost] is not a hurdle are flattening,” Anne Corriveau, BU’s director of international admissions, told the meeting at the mansion.
In 2023, the last year for which the figures are available by country, the number of international students from China fell by four percent after years of increases, the IIE reports. Numbers were also down from other more affluent nations, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Japan, and flat from Europe, but up from places in the world with less wealth, including Mexico, Bangladesh, Colombia, and Ghana.
Meanwhile, there has been intensifying competition from other countries — notably Canada, Australia, and the UK, which last year surpassed the United States as a preferred destination, according to a 2024 Keystone survey. Interest in Italy and Spain is also up. Schools in these countries charge less, on average, than colleges in the United States, and generally make it easier for international students to stay and work when they graduate. Far higher proportions of prospective international students also say they feel more welcome and safe in those places than the United States, another Keystone survey of more than 41,000 students worldwide found in April — though two-thirds said their biggest concern about going to college in the US was the cost.
How vulnerable US universities and colleges were to their reliance on international students was laid bare by the pandemic, federal data show; the number fell by 72 percent in calendar year 2020 alone. The greatest decline was in the Northeast, which saw a drop of nearly 20 percent. Even before Trump returned to office, more than 40 percent of student visa applications to the United States last year were denied under the Biden administration, up from 15 percent 10 years ago.
The impact on enrollment of the Trump administration’s visa revocations and research funding cuts will take time to know conclusively. NAFSA: Association of International Educators, which represents international education professionals worldwide, projects based on available State Department data that the number of international students will decline by 30 percent to 40 percent this year nationwide with an estimated $7 billion economic hit. The association’s numbers suggest the Massachusetts economy will lose nearly $620 million — more than any other state except for California and New York. (Other estimates are less dire, an indication of how hard it is to track this, and of mistrust in federal data.) Even before the election, however, the enrollment of international students declined in two key nationwide measures. The number in graduate programs dropped by 2 percent last fall, or more than 10,000 enrollees, according to IIE, after years of increases and in spite of pent-up demand that accumulated during Covid. The number of first-time international undergraduates also fell by 5 percent.
“We often think about year-to-year enrollment, and really that’s not where we can see change. It’s about the slow erosion of what America represents,” says Chris Glass, a professor of higher education at Boston College who studies international shifts. “There are actually concerning trends that have been happening for years.”
Massachusetts universities prefer not to talk about this. Northeastern, for example, did not respond to repeated requests to for an interview. Most of the international student administrators at that Brookline conference wouldn’t go on the record. Another school, Gordon College, gave a response that has become typical across higher education. It “decided to pause on providing comment due to the deep sensitivity surrounding international students and ongoing current events,” a spokeswoman wrote.
All of this comes at a time when university enrollment overall is projected to decline further starting next year, as the number of 18-year-old prospective first-year students plummets – a product of the low birth rates coming out of the 2008 Great Recession called the “demographic cliff.” US high school graduates have also started going to college at lower rates, questioning the return on the investment.

A mile and a half from the Wightman Mansion, where university officials huddled to discuss international student enrollment, the smell of Korean barbecue wafted through a neighborhood of boba tea cafes, dumpling dives, ramen shops, and restaurants that sell malatang, a particularly spicy kind of hot pot. Young people balancing book bags and backpacks pedaled on Blue Bikes past storefronts advertising rental apartments. Others fidgeted with their phones while waiting for the 57 bus to Boston University. This bustling enclave in the student-packed Allston neighborhood of Boston is increasingly embracing its identity as a reminder of home for some of the tens of thousands of students who pour into Massachusetts from around the globe to go to college.
Upstairs at Stage Karaoke, a sleek space hung with video screens, LED lights, and lyrics projected in various languages, owner Alex Vichienrat says international students make up most of his business. Private, soundproofed VIP rooms encircle a communal main stage, where karaoke brings cultures together. “This is our melting pot space,” Vichienrat said. Without international students, he added, “this entire neighborhood would be gone.”
These more nuanced contributions of international students are often celebrated by advocates of international education. They’re also easy to see, in places such as Allston.
International students broaden the experience on campuses for everyone, says Max Page, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents public college and university faculty and staff.
“This is an increasingly interconnected, global world. We want to train our young people to understand the rest of the world,” Page says. Without international students, “you don’t get exposed to other people and their ideas and it can breed a narrowness of thinking. That would be a real loss, if that kind of thing was to stop.”










The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot. People coming here to be educated and staying here has been a foundation of our innovation ecosystem for decades. You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.


– JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable


Less evident are the long-term economic implications of what could happen here if international students stop coming.
The preponderance of international students in graduate programs isn’t entirely because of universities trying to meet revenue targets. It’s also because Americans are comparatively less well prepared for science, technology, and other fields. US students score lower than those in 36 other countries in math on the Program for International Student Assessment, a test  that measures how well 15-year-olds can solve real-life challenges using skills they’ve learned. Only one in five college-bound American high school students is equipped to pursue a major in science, technology, engineering, or math, the National Science and Technology Council has found.
International students now earn nearly two-thirds of all master’s degrees from US universities in computer science and more than half in engineering. Two-thirds of graduate students in artificial intelligence at American universities are foreign born.
This portends another grim scenario for Massachusetts if the slide continues or accelerates in the number of international student numbers already under way: There will be fewer of them to work in or help start businesses in increasingly competitive industries. More foreign-born than native-born residents in Massachusetts have graduate degrees, and nearly three in 10 workers here in science, technology, engineering, or math come from other countries, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan nonprofit that supports immigration.

One bright spot — for US universities, if not for students — is that competing destinations have begun to impose their own restrictions. Canada has tightened international student caps. In Australia, the government failed in a proposal to put a limit on international students last year. But it increased visa fees and slowed down processing times. While the UK has a goal of increasing the number of international students, it has restricted most of them from bringing dependents, required them to prove they have enough money to support themselves, and banned them from working until they finish their degrees.
Massachusetts could have an edge with international students who still want to come to the United States but to a place more outwardly accepting of migrants, some experts say. That’s been a concerted approach at BU, for instance, Corriveau said at the April conference in Brookline. “I used to try to sell the US in general, and now I focus more locally,” she said. “I think it’s more important that students understand what it means to be in Boston.” BU even produced a video for prospective international students acknowledging “recent events” but promoting Boston as “remarkably diverse and inclusive.”
Many international students in Massachusetts stuck around for the summer, instead of going home, out of fear they might not be allowed to re-enter the country, university administrators say. Schools including Wentworth helped find them houses and summer jobs, Grek said at the BU meeting. UMass Amherst set up a fund to help them. Bunker Hill Community College canceled summer study abroad programs out of fear that international students wouldn’t be allowed to come back.
Over the longer term, however, the state’s strength in attracting international students makes it more vulnerable than other places in the United States to a continued decline in the number of them, says Chris Slatter, Boston-based managing director at the education consulting firm Huron.
“They rent apartments, they spend in local businesses, they support innovation through research, and in many cases they contribute to the workforce,” Slatter says. “International students are the cornerstone of both institutional strategy and regional economic vitality in Massachusetts.”
If they don’t keep coming, “and, when appropriate stay, and work here, what we’d have is a different economy,” says Tom Dretler, CEO of the Boston-based international student recruitment company Shorelight. “We would be a poorer state.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Time is money, and overtime is extra money.
Just ask the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, which needs more and more state funding to cover overtime costs because it can’t hire enough correctional officers. 
The Ocean State spent the 14th most per capita on its correctional facilities and operations of any state nationwide in fiscal 2023, despite having the third lowest number of incarcerated people, according to a Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council report published Monday.
The 37-page report highlights how Rhode Island compares with other states on various spending categories, along with state and local tax rates. 
Rhode Island ranks near the top of the pack on per-person spending, boosted by a tranche of federal pandemic aid and congressional infrastructure and economy funds.
“A lot of the stories we see in this report are the same,” Justine Oliva, RIPEC’s policy and research director said in an interview Monday. “We are a relatively high tax state, and a relatively high spending state. We have historically spent a lot on government administration and on public safety.”
The business-backed policy group last reported Rhode Island’s tax and spending comparisons in 2019. The new edition also includes fiscal 2018 data to offer a five-year evolution in state spending and tax patterns relative to its peers.
Rhode Island boasted the highest per capita spending on general government administration of any state in the nation, reflecting personnel, planning and zoning and allocations to government and legislative agencies. The first place finish marks a slight rise from fiscal 2018, when Rhode Island rounded out the top three states based on per capita government administration spending. 
A bigger shift over the last five years: spending on the state corrections agency, which rose more than 35% per capita from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023. Not because its prisons are full — the 124 incarcerated people per 100,000 state residents is only greater than Maine and Massachusetts, according to 2022 federal data.
The report does not specify where the funding for the state corrections operations is going. But like other state agencies, personnel — including pensions and benefits — consume a big chunk of the bottom line, Oliva said.
70 correctional officer vacancies 
Especially true for the Department of Corrections, which has been plagued by vacancies that result in costly overtime for the remaining employees. 
In fiscal 2025, the state agency paid for nearly 594,000 overtime hours, according to the agency’s fiscal 2027 budget request to Gov. Dan McKee. The budget request did not specify the cost of overtime in fiscal 2025, but the longstanding staffing woes were projected to cost nearly $43 million in overtime for the year, according to a March presentation to lawmakers.   
Director Wayne Salisbury Jr. proposed hiring 150 more officers — to fill the 70 existing openings and add funding for more workers — to “properly staff” facilities and decrease overtime costs.
“If these positions are authorized and filled, it is anticipated that the Department would see a significant decrease in overtime,” Salisbury wrote in the Oct. 1 letter to McKee.
The request remains under review. The governor is expected to release a preliminary version of fiscal 2027 spending plan early next year.
A spokesperson for the corrections department did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.

Corrections is not the only area where Rhode Island outspends its peers, including most of the region. Police spending per capita ranked fifth overall in fiscal 2023, while spending on fire protection came in third. While states with densely populated cities typically spend more on fire protection, Rhode Island’s costs are still higher than other densely populated states, such as New Jersey, according to the National Fire Protection Association.
RIPEC’s report stops short of offering budget tips to state and local lawmakers. But Oliva pointed to Rhode Island’s disproportionate public safety spending as one area ripe for examination.
“We have to ask about what we are getting for what we are spending and the efficiency of those dollars,” Oliva said. “There is not a clear reason why Rhode Island is spending more than the nation, and neighboring states, on public safety.”
The report does not separate spending by the state government from what is spent by municipal governments, which can also vary widely, Oliva noted.
Also due for review: state K-12 education spending. Rhode Island state and local governments directed large swaths of federal pandemic relief aid to elementary and secondary education, boosting expenditures even higher. Rhode Island boasted the ninth highest per capita K-12 education spending in fiscal 2023 — and the sixth-highest based on personal income.










We have to ask about what we are getting for what we are spending and the efficiency of those dollars. There is not a clear reason why Rhode Island is spending more than the nation, and neighboring states, on public safety.


– Justine Oliva, RIPEC’s policy and research director


Yet Rhode Island students aren’t rising to the top of the class. While standardized test scores inched up in 2025, according to newly released results, the Ocean State still lags behind Massachusetts. It ranked 28th on educational outcomes in the 2025 KIDS COUNT report — the weakest showing across various metrics of state children’s wellbeing.
Meanwhile, state spending on Medicaid and other social service programs continues to balloon, outpacing per capita averages nationwide and in New England. RIPEC has long warned about unsustainable state budget growth, particularly on Medicaid, which comprised more than one-third of the $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 budget.
Federal cuts loom
Federal budget cuts to the government-subsidized health care program will only add pressure to insurers and providers, who have already clamored for state lawmakers to make them whole. Other federal budget cuts to state food stamp programs and health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are expected to hit Rhode Island hard.
“There’s no question Rhode Island is more vulnerable than a majority of states in terms of what happens federally,” Oliva said.

Property tax revenue remains the state’s top source of income, but the phaseout of the motor vehicle excise tax — eliminated in 2022 — suppressed revenue growth from property taxes, which rose 1.5% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023, according to the report. But Rhode Island’s property tax rates are still higher than most states, ranked 10th per person in fiscal 2023.
Oliva expected the Ocean State’s tax ranking to inch up in coming years, reflecting changes made in other states to reduce income taxes.
Oliva reiterated RIPEC’s resounding warning about the need for state and local lawmakers to reign in spending. But, that doesn’t mean cuts across the board.
“There are some areas in which increased spending might be an important part of improving our economic standing,” Oliva said. “We shouldn’t be aiming to be the lowest spending state in all of these areas.”
Transportation and higher education are two areas that might benefit from an extra infusion of cash, Oliva said. 
While Rhode Island’s highway spending fell in the middle of the pack among states in fiscal 2023, it frequently ranks among the worst states for road quality and infrastructure safety. And, despite reliance on state public colleges and its university to boost the state’s labor market and research presence, Rhode Island’s spending on higher education ranked 44th per capita in fiscal 2023.

Both parking and admission to the fair will be free, according to the release, and there is no need to register before the event. Des Moines University students will conduct health screenings under the supervision of faculty.
Those attending the fair will have the chance to undergo skin checks, blood pressure checks, foot and ankle screenings, neurological screenings, balance and other screenings related to physical therapy and “Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine,” the release stated.
Patients will not have to fast before attending the fair, the release stated, and coffee and snacks will be available.
“The 50 and Better Health Fair is an excellent way for our students to engage with community members through hands-on screenings and procedures they’ve learned in our labs,” said Sarah Parrott, chair of the primary care department at DMU and a family physician at the DMU Clinic, in the release. “It’s also a great opportunity to educate older adults on how to maintain their health and stay connected within the community.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 18:53:15+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: CT lobstermen reflect on the industry’s glory days,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/podcast-ct-lobster-industry-glory-days/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Dana Edwards discussed his article about Connecticut's formerly booming lobster industry and why it's largely ended.,"Connecticut once had a booming lobster business. What happened?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Dana Edwards to discuss his article, “26 years after lobster die-off, CT lobstermen reflect on a net loss,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Dana’s story here. 
WSHU: As a visuals reporter, what got you interested in telling this story? Was it the allure of going out on the sound on a fishing boat?
DA: Yeah, that was definitely part of it. I actually spent part of my childhood living on a sailboat, so I’ve always been interested in being on the water. But another entryway I had into the story is that I was new to Connecticut as a visuals fellow this past summer at the Connecticut Mirror, and so I was exploring some waterfront towns. I tried a couple lobster rolls for research purposes, of course. And I, you know, I learned there’s this famous Connecticut style of lobster roll, but I learned that most of the lobster that’s now inside of those rolls is imported from Maine or Canada, and that, in fact, there are hardly any lobsters left in Long Island Sound. So that was sort of an aha moment for me. I, you know, I thought, what happened to the lobsters and to the lobstermen?
Another angle I had into this story is I was introduced to Roddy Grimshaw, who’s one of the state’s last remaining commercial lobster men in Stonington, and I just found it to be a fascinating and frankly tragic story about, you know, what used to be a really thriving industry in Long Island sound that was decimated in the late 90s by historic die off of the lobsters. It’s been a tough journey for the lobstermen since then, there’s been coverage of the, you know, struggles that the industry has faced. But I wanted to dive a bit deeper and add a visual angle to it as a photojournalist as well as a writer.
WSHU: Let’s talk a little bit about the die-off itself. There’s been a lot of research done into this. What was responsible for it, and did it pretty much kill off the entire industry?
DA: Yeah, it might be interesting to kind of walk you through what people found out in real time, because it was sort of an unprecedented mystery at the time, right? And so in 1998 that was the peak of lobster landings in Long Island Sound and in Connecticut as well, there were 10 million pounds of lobster that were hauled in that year. And then suddenly, in the fall of 1999 in August, dead and sort of sickly lobsters started washing up onto the sound. Then there was a huge storm that hit it was Tropical Storm Floyd in September of 1999 it rained about 12 inches, and after that, within just a matter of a week or so, lobstermen were pulling up, almost no lobsters at all, and the ones they were pulling up were dead or dying.
And so at first, scientists really did not know what was going on at all, but there was a suspicion that pesticides were the cause, because just a month before that tropical storm that washed so much water into the sound the states of New York and Connecticut had begun applying pesticides to combat West Nile virus, and because mosquitoes, which the pesticides are designed to kill, are related to lobsters, that’s why people call lobsters bugs. People suspected that the pesticides killed the lobsters. There was a bunch of money that came in from the federal government to fund research into the causes of disaster, and after a few years, they found out the primary causes were a crustacean disease parasitic amoeba called parame biasis, and that the warming waters due to global warming were also a large contributing factor, because lobsters are extremely sensitive to warm waters, and so that had weakened their immune systems, making them even more vulnerable to the disease. They determined that the pesticides never reached the lethal levels in several modeling exercises.
WSHU: But also, there’s contention that there was a boom in the lobster industry in Connecticut, and that had been enabled by the fact that the fishermen were actually feeding the lobsters. So there, in the late 1980s into the 90s, there was just a real boom in the number of lobsters that were caught in Long Island Sound, which was not traditionally the case.
DA: Yeah, that’s a great point. Yeah. So that was an additional factor. Researchers referred to a quote, “perfect storm” of factors that led to this die-off. And just as you mentioned, the lobstering practices in the 80s and 90s, lobstermen referred to farming and harvesting the lobster rather than catching them. That’s because, you know, they’re using these pots or traps in which they put bait, which is, you know, various kinds of fish that are caught through other means. But they’re putting a ton of fish into these pots, and that represents a huge supplement to the natural food source of the lobsters. And so it actually artificially increased the lobster population in Long Island Sound significantly.
So there were far more lobsters on the sea floor than there had ever been, which is a little bit counterintuitive. You might think that, you know, as these lobster hauls were increasing, they were depleting the population. What they were actually doing was increasing it, but they were increasing it in a way where they were harvesting lobsters when they were young, you know, as soon as they reached the minimum size that was required by regulation. And so you had these extremely crowded conditions on the sea floor, and they were mostly young lobsters. And the biologists think that those made the lobsters even more susceptible to the die off, because they were young, and they were, you know, the disease could just spread really quickly through those crowded conditions.
WSHU: Now, you talk to the few lobstermen remaining. What happened? Because it was a pretty large industry at one time in Connecticut, there were a lot of Connecticut ports that had lobster fishermen, from Greenwich all the way up to North Stonington.
DA: So, you know, in the years after the die-off, it was this very sudden event. But it wasn’t like immediately the industry was not viable. The population would ebb and flow a bit for years, but it was trending significantly down. You know, some years would be a bit better, and that biologists think that has a lot to do with years when the water was a bit cooler, because the lobsters really just cannot tolerate warm water. So when the conditions were a bit better, you know, lobstermen were still able to, you know, make something of a living. But on the whole, most of them were no long longer able to support themselves lobstering, because it just trended significantly downwards. In 2024 there, the lobster catch in Connecticut was only 5% of what it was at its peak in 1998.
So most of the lobstermen were forced to leave the fishing docks behind entirely. Some of them switched to clamming or catching conch shells or fishing, but it’s hard to say percentage wise, but it seems like the vast majority just had to leave fishing behind entirely, and it was an extremely difficult transition. I spoke to a social scientist named Tarsila Seara who studied the social impacts of the die off and the impacts on the kind of fishing culture, and it really is a tragic story there. There were a lot of people who struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse, and the government put in place various job retraining programs, but they were not well received by the lobster men. There’s just sort of widespread bitterness about the die off. Most of the lobster men think that the pesticides were the cause, and they also hold a lot of grudges against the politicians who they don’t think we’re supporting, and the scientists whose explanations they disagree with.
WSHU: So the bottom line, are we ever going to have a viable lobster industry on the Long Island Sound?
DA: It looks extremely unlikely. In my reporting, in my story, the sort of state’s last commercial lobsterman who I profiled, they’re operating up in Stonington. That’s really the last active commercial lobster fleet in the state, and they’re not even full time. Most of them go out a couple days a week, and then they augment that with fishing. And the reason that they’re still able to catch lobster up in Stonington is that they’re just outside of the sound, and the water is slightly cooler there, and it wasn’t hit as hard by the die off in the late 90s and following years. So there’s still some lobster up there, all the way near the Rhode Island border. But deeper into the sound all the former lobstermen I spoke with who still put out some traps from time to time, just to just to see what’s out there. And they’re not catching anything. They’re a tiny fragment of what, you know, what there used to be. So, the scientific consensus is that the waters have just gotten too warm, even though this disease epidemic has passed, the American lobster just cannot tolerate the bottom temperatures due to global warming, and historically Long Island Sound was the southernmost end of the inshore range of the American lobster. So now it seems that it moved north. And you know, it may soon be the case that the southernmost tip is Massachusetts.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LOBSTER-0925-DE-206-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-10-20 14:58:31.343829

(South Dakota Searchlight/Courtesy SD Public Utilities Commission)Last month, utilities regulators voted 2-1 to tell a company that wants to put industrial scale batteries near Watertown that they’ll need a permit before they build.
Last week, lawyers for the company behind the $174 million project signaled plans to do just that.
Crowned Ridge Energy Storage I, LLC, is an affiliate of Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources. The company unsuccessfully lobbied the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission  for a permitting exemption in August, arguing the project does not meet the legal definition of a facility.
If built, the project would be the first large-scale, standalone battery storage facility of its kind in the state of South Dakota. Documents filed by the company with regulators say it would utilize lithium ion or similar battery storage technology.
South Dakota utility regulators decide energy storage facility needs a state permit

The company’s lawyers filed a notice of intent to apply for a permit last week, following the ruling against its petition for an exemption. The filing outlines a plan to construct, own, and operate a battery system with a 120-watt capacity in Codington County, about 20 miles northeast of Watertown. The project could store and continuously deliver enough electricity to power tens of thousands of homes for four hours before needing to recharge, the document says.
The batteries would cover roughly 15.4 acres and connect to a nearby Crowned Ridge-owned substation. It would store excess electricity from regional wind generation and release it when demand peaks. When less electricity is being used at night, the batteries can charge, and in the morning, when families flick on the lights, that stored electricity can be used.   
Most impacted land is agricultural, and would be leased or bought, the filing says. Construction is expected to employ about 180 workers and result in one or two permanent jobs.
The company anticipates a final permit decision by April 2027. If approved, construction could begin in May, targeting commercial operation in early 2028.
The state’s three elected utilities regulators entered uncharted territory when the project appeared on thier docket last month. 
Commissioner Chris Nelson argued in September that “batteries don’t generate electricity” and therefore fall outside the agency’s jurisdiction. 
Commissioners Kristie Fiegen and Gary Hanson disagreed, saying large-scale storage puts usable electricity into the grid when discharging and should face public review.
Now, Crowned Ridge must secure both a state facility permit. It will also need conditional use  and building permits and a road-use agreement from Codington County.

The Iowa Board of Pharmacy has charged Antoinette Thompson of Pleasant Hill with committing acts that would render her Controlled Substances Act registration inconsistent with the public interest; knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct or practices harmful or detrimental to the public; forging or altering a prescription; failing to maintain a separate registration for each location where she distributed or dispensed controlled substances; dispensing a controlled substance without a prescription; possessing a controlled substance not obtained directly from a valid prescription, and dispensing medication not based on a valid patient-prescriber relationship.

Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Thompson with eight separate regulatory violations. The disciplinary charges filed by the nursing board include failing to evaluate, document or report the status of a patient; committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient; being involved in the unauthorized manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs in an unsafe manner; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs without accurately documenting the act or without evaluating the patient; willful or repeated failure to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety, and failure to query and reviewing the Prescription Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing or dispending of an opioid.
The two licensing boards have not publicly disclosed the manner in which any of their respective regulations were allegedly violated or indicated when or where the alleged violations took place.
Court records indicate Thompson served as the medical director and nurse for the Live Hydration Spa in Ames until she was terminated when the store closed in September 2024.
According to a court petition filed by Live Hydration, Thompson’s termination was based on her “actions resulting in imminent danger to patient health and safety.” The company also alleged Thompson had violated her franchise agreement with Live Hydration by opening a competing business that offered IV vitamin therapy, injections, hormone replacement therapy and Botox treatments. Thompson denied all of the company’s allegations.
Thompson is now suing Live Hydration for breach of contract and defamation, alleging the company tried to “starve” her franchise and mount a hostile takeover of the Ames location – charges the company denies. A trial is scheduled for Dec. 15, 2026.
State records indicate the Iowa Board of Nursing approved the disciplinary charges against Thompson in April 2025, although those records also indicate the charges were not publicly reported until September 2025. A hearing on the nursing board’s disciplinary charges was scheduled for Oct. 10, 2025, although the disposition of that case is not yet known.
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy records indicate that board’s charges against Thompson were approved in January 2025, although they were only recently posted to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website. A hearing on the pharmacy board’s disciplinary charges is scheduled for Jan. 6, 2026.

(Mac Johnson/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen is asking a district court judge to pause a lawsuit over whether he will hand the state’s voter data to the federal government in light of the ongoing federal shutdown.
Nebraska Solicitor General Cody Barnett and the state Attorney General’s Office, on behalf of Evnen in a Friday motion, asked that the case be delayed so Evnen could continue discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice over how voter privacy would be protected. Negotiations had to pause because of the ongoing federal shutdown since Sept. 30 — now on day 20.
The motion states that without federal funding, Justice Department attorneys can’t work, even on a voluntary basis. It asks to pause the case until Evnen can reopen discussions, but to resume it no more than 60 days after the shutdown ends. 
“It is in the interest of judicial economy and conducive to an efficient resolution of this matter that this agreement be completed and available for production before the next stages of litigation,” the motion states.

Evnen anticipates the discussions “will yield an agreement that will impact the arguments made in this case,” according to the motion. That could mean getting in writing how the privacy of the voter information — names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers — would be protected.
The motion also confirms that Evnen will not send the requested voter data to the federal government during the course of the lawsuit.
The Justice Department requested Nebraska’s fuller voter file Sept. 8 with a Sept. 22 deadline. The lawsuit was filed Sept. 22 by Omaha voter Dawn Essink and voter advocacy group Common Cause.
Attorney Daniel Gutman, for Essink and Common Cause, confirmed that his clients do not oppose Evnen’s motion but still oppose the federal request for voter information.
“We continue to believe that releasing the entire voter file to the federal government is plainly unlawful under Nebraska statutes,” Gutman said Monday. “That’s true regardless of whether the state reaches an MOU [memorandum of understanding] with any third party, including the federal government.”
Attorney Daniel Gutman of Lincoln, center, in Lancaster County District Court. May 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The lawsuit cites a state law prohibiting election officials from disclosing certain voter information, preventing third parties from making or receiving copies of the voter registry and restricting the use of voter registry copies to only “list maintenance” or law enforcement purposes. Anyone who receives the information must attest that they will use the list for authorized purposes and won’t post it online, under threat of election falsification charges, a Class IV felony.
A public, more limited version of Nebraska’s voter file, with redactions, is available for a fee.
Evnen told KFAB in late September that he doesn’t have “any problem” with handing over voter data and is glad the DOJ is looking at other states, “because while I’m very confident about Nebraska,” he said questions had been raised about others.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has also defended the federal government’s request, saying the information sought “is well within bounds. It’s well within the law.”
Lancaster County District Judge Lori Maret had not yet ruled on the delay as of mid-day Monday but is expected to approve the unopposed motion.

“Florida has been, I think, the state that has provided the most law enforcement agreements under the 287(g) than any other state” she said at the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office in Bradenton. “It shows that they recognize the importance of bringing individuals to justice that have [been] convicted [of] crimes against the people that live in their communities.”
Under legislation passed by GOP lawmakers in Tallahassee earlier this year, all 67 counties in Florida are required to enter into 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That program allows local law enforcement to work with ICE to deport undocumented immigrants. Although municipalities in Florida are not required to enter into those agreements, hundreds of them have — including Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and St. Petersburg.
Noem said she came to West Central Florida on Monday because often “we see the news distorting the truth and not bringing the real facts” to the public when it comes to ICE detaining “criminal illegal aliens.”
She specifically cited the cases of four undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds who have recently been detained and deported.
Since January, Noem said, DHS has arrested more than 480,000 undocumented immigrants, 70% of whom she said had either been charged or convicted of criminal allegations. However, according to data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, as of Sept. 21, 71.5% held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction.
She also touted how effective the Trump administration’s offer to allow people to “self-deport” has been. DHS has promised to give individuals who wish to return to their countries of origin $1,000 each and one-way airplane tickets.
The DHS reported last month 1.6 million people have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 people have been deported since Jan. 20.
Noem also reported that since ICE began advertising for 10,000 new agents, the agency has received more than 175,000 applicants.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After two months of higher-than-expected tax revenues, Nebraska’s monthly general fund receipts fell just before economic forecasters will update the state’s projected budget deficit. 
Nebraska’s September tax receipts show a net loss of 6.6% under what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted in April, according to the state Department of Revenue. That equates to roughly $47 million in less revenue in the state’s coffers. 
State Sen. Robert Clements of Elmwood. (Courtesy of the Unicameral Information Office)
That followed tax receipts from July and August, which came in modestly above projections and brought in an additional $32 million. Appropriations Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood said while September’s drop is “disappointing,” he wasn’t too concerned, because overall net receipts for the current fiscal year remained relatively flat. 
Net tax receipts so far for fiscal year 2025-26 are about 0.9% below forecasts — a difference of about $15 million, the Revenue Department noted.
The biggest contributor to the drop was corporate income tax receipts, which came in 31% below projections, a loss of $56 million. Clements said he suspects that this is ImagiNE Act tax credits accelerating in September, based on information he received from a department analyst. 
The ImagiNE Act is an economic incentive program for businesses expanding in or relocating to Nebraska. Clements said the program was expected to dole out about $36 million in credits over 12 months, but it’s distributed roughly $22 million over the last three months alone. The incentives, within limits under state law, allow businesses to pick which tax year to take the tax credits, which can make predicting the timing more difficult.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said other factors may be at play as well, including a drop in quarterly estimated corporate tax payments. State officials previously hoped these payments would raise September’s receipts above projections, but Patent said if corporate profits have fallen this fiscal year, that would lower their payments. 
The outlier in the Revenue report was miscellaneous taxes, which came in 365% above projections, but that slice is the smallest portion of Nebraska’s overall tax revenues. That resulted in an additional net $18 million for the month, a small portion of the $661 million the state generated in September. 
Miscellaneous taxes are a bit of a mixed bag, but they can include things like Nebraska’s alcohol and cigarette taxes.
Patent said this was not due to any changes in miscellaneous taxes, but was more due to past projections. She said the state bases its miscellaneous tax projections based on monthly receipts from the previous year, which is why July’s miscellaneous receipts were about 41% below forecast, and September’s essentially offset that, Patent said. 
“It’s really just a timing thing,” she said. “It doesn’t have to do with the receipts themselves.” 
September’s receipts are significant because it’s one of the last pieces of information the forecasting board will receive before its next meeting Oct. 31. However, both Clements and Patent said the board also will receive some early estimates for October revenues because it is meeting at the end of the month. 
The board’s new projections will update the state’s expected budget deficit, which currently stands around $95 million. Members will consider monthly general fund receipts, as well as other economic factors. 
Another factor the board could consider is the impact of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” A separate Revenue report from September estimated that the new tax and spending law could cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two years of its current budget cycle. Pillen and other conservative state leaders supported the bill.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — A required work zone safety course for Oklahoma teen drivers is expanding to include an impaired driving section, the program’s founder said Monday at a driving school in Edmond. 
Tom Robins, the founder of Work Zone Safe, said impaired driving is 100% preventable and now students will learn about the impacts. More than 400 lives in Oklahoma are lost every year due to impaired driving-related crashes, according to a news release. 
“Impaired driving impacts us all, and it impacts us forever,” he said. “And so we know that teens during National Teen Driver Safety Week are going to get an opportunity now in the state of Oklahoma to have a section just specifically on impaired driving so that they can learn from the faces and families behind the flags and the flashing lights.”
Taking the course is required in Oklahoma since it became part of state law in 2023, Robins said. Over 110,000 Oklahoma teens have taken the free course. 
The impaired driving section of the course will include stories of a handful of people killed by an impaired driver, including an Edmond police officer and a student at University of Central Oklahoma. 
Students will also be taught about the impact of driving while impaired. 
Some short-term effects include arrest, fines, jail time, license suspension and raised insurance costs, according to a news release. Long-term consequences include having a criminal record, prison sentences and limited job opportunities.
Work Zone Safe is currently required in Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Wisconsin but is expanding to other states, Robins said. Oklahoma was the first state to require the course. 
Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Eric Foster, who was hit by an impaired driver in 2021, said he’s experienced first-hand what can happen when someone operating a vehicle doesn’t make good decisions. 
He said if the impaired driver hadn’t hit his stationary car, 10 people in a work zone could have been killed. 
“It’s not just about passing a test,” Foster said. “It’s about learning how serious the privilege of driving is. Because every time you start your car, you hold the power to protect or to destroy your parents, your friends, your community.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Five months after the Trump administration canceled a series of environmental grants for Alaska, including an erosion-control grant that was to have gone to one of the villages hardest hit by ex-Typhoon Halong, the fight over the money continues.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in her speech Saturday to the annual Alaska Federation of Natives convention, said she is trying to restore some of the canceled funding, including money that was to have gone to the Yukon-Kuskokswim Delta village of Kipnuk. The village of 700 had been awarded $20 million by the Biden administration to combat problems connected with permafrost thaw and other climate change effects, but in May the Trump administration canceled that and other grants.
Murkowski blasted officials who characterized the grant to Kipnuk as wasteful.
“I am offended,” she said. “I am outright mad that some have suggested that it is a waste of taxpayer dollars to protect Alaskan communities. We are Americans. Every single person that has been impacted is an American that deserves to be treated with that level of respect.”
Murkowski was responding obliquely to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and his spokesperson, who issued what delegates to the AFN convention considered to be insulting statements.

The village of Kipnuk, largely submerged by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, is seen from the air on Oct. 12, 2025.

In a post on the social media site X, Zeldin called news reports about the canceled grant “left-wing hackery” that were dishonest. The grants would not have provided protection in time for ex-Typhoon Halong, he said.
“And to be brutally candid, due to the proactive cancellation of this grant, $20 million of hardworking U.S. tax dollars are currently sitting in the U.S. treasury instead of swept into the Kuskokwim River,” his post said. He concluded the post on a pugnacious note: “As for the clowns who want the EPA to light tens of billions of tax dollars on fire, we refuse to bend the knee and play along.”
Grant cancellations hit Indigenous communities
The Kipnuk grant was to have paid for a barrier on the rapidly eroding Kugkaktlik River. The project was part of Kipnuk’s broader erosion control and climate-change adaptation plan, which includes elements of “managed retreat,” the relocation of some structures and facilities to safer ground farther from the river.
Murkowski, in her AFN speech, said it may be true that work under the canceled grant would not have come in time for the devastation wrought by ex-Typhoon Halong. But that and other grants were still needed, she said.
“They may prevent future disasters, and that’s the point,” she said. “It’s not just what happens today. It’s the ability to look forward out into the future, to make it better into the future.”
Most of Kipnuk’s residents were airlifted out of the storm-wrecked village, part of the more than 1,500 people now taking shelter in Bethel, Anchorage or other spots. The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is one of the most rural parts of North America; no road connects its communities, where the mostly Yup’ik residents depend on traditional Indigenous fishing, hunting and other food-gathering practices.
The Kipnuk grant had been among several awarded by the Biden administration to Alaska Native communities under the EPAs’ Community Change Grant Program. That program was funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a piece of legislation that passed with no Republican votes. In all, over $150 million in Alaska grants under the program were canceled by the Trump administration.

Robyn Burke, D-Utqiagvik, in her Juneau office on May 20, 2025, holds a May 2 letter from the Environmental Protection Agency annoucning that it has canceled funding for a permafrost management project. The project had been selected during the Biden administration under EPA’s Community Change Grant Program. It would have funded protections for traditional Inupiat ice cellars and gravesites in the nation’s nothernmost community and provided new equipment for the local utility cooperative that provides electricity, gas, water and wastewater services. The grant totaled $20 million and work was to have started that month. It was one of several Community Change Program grants canceled in Alaska. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	Among the nixed grants was $20 million previously awarded to Kotzebue for expansion of wind power. As in other areas of rural Alaska, residents of Kotzebue are seeking to reduce reliance on diesel fuel, which is costly and difficult to transport and store, by shifting to locally produced renewable energy.  
The administration also canceled a previously awarded $20 million grant to Utqiagvik, the nation’s northernmost community, for work to protect infrastructure from permafrost thaw, improvements to the utility system and other environmental tasks.
Aside from the more than $150 million in Community Change Grant Program funding for Alaska that the Trump administration’s EPA canceled, the agency also eliminated the Biden-era Solar For All program and, with it, $125 million in funding that had been awarded to expand solar energy in Alaska.
At a news conference following her AFN speech, Murkowski said the state’s congressional delegation and others might be able to use a $40 million pot of money to restore some of the lost project funding. That would be much less than a full restoration, she conceded.
“The Community Change Grant Program was very specific, and the criteria were very specific. And so many of our communities, including Kipnuk, met the criteria,” she told reporters. “That’s where the real tragedy is in all of this. But we’re working to get some portion of that funding to go towards Kipnuk again, to recognize that you’ve got a vulnerability in the community and how they’re able to address it. You can’t do it with just a lot of good thoughts.”
The administration also eliminated a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities. That program funded projects intended to prevent damages from disasters like floods, thus saving money that would be spent on recovery and repair.
Murkowski said the administration has taken the position that it will oppose anything having to do with resilience or “anything that has the word ‘climate’ in it,” she said.
“Crazy, in my view,” she said.
In her convention speech, Murkowski described what she saw the previous day in Kipnuk — an eerily quiet village that a week earlier would have been filled with children playing and four-wheelers zipping around. She also saw one of the main obstacles to escaping this and other storms. 
“Flying over, you realize there is no retreat to higher ground, because there is no higher ground in many parts of the delta,” she said.
Public broadcasting funding loss another AFN concern
Beyond her comments on the remnants of Typhoon Halong, Murkowski lamented the recent vote by Congress to rescind all previously appropriated funding for public broadcasting.

	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a key source of funding for rural Alaska stations, and Murkowski voted against recission of its funding. The other two members of Alaska’s all-Republican congressional delegation, Sen. Dan Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich, were enthusiastic supporters of the recission, which had been championed by President Donald Trump.
Murkowski said she and Sullivan eked out a slight reprieve by securing some Bureau of Indian Affairs money to help 14 rural Alaska stations. “But that’s one-time money. That’s this year. What about next year?” she said.
The role of public broadcasting and the threat posed by elimination of previously awarded federal funding was much discussed at the convention. Attention to that issue was heightened by the typhoon disaster and the role that public broadcasting, notably the Bethel outlet KYUK, played in relaying emergency information.
Several attendees, including those staging a silent protest during Sullivan’s speech on Friday, held signs that said: “Public radio saves lives.”
Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, in an address on Friday, urged audience members and organizations to donate to public broadcasting outlets to make up for the loss of federal support.
“We learned a lot how important public radio is, based on the last week or so,” Edgmon said.
Like other rural outlets, Bethel’s KYUK, which broadcasts across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in the Yup’ik language as well as in English, has been highly dependent on support from the now-defunded Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said Kristin Hall, the outlet’s manager.
“For KYUK, that funding made up nearly 70% of our annual operating budget,” Hall said during a panel discussion Thursday on public broadcasting. “That funding is not just a line item. That is not just a line item in our budget. That is our livelihood.”
Public broadcasting in rural Alaska is about much more than emergency communications, Hall and other panel members said. The Indigenous content is a comfort to elders, educational for youth and an important part of civic life in the villages, they said.
“Not only do we provide cultural and traditional knowledge, but it’s also a human need to see ourselves in media,” said Jaclyn Sallee, president of Kohanic Broadcast Corp., an Alaska-based nonprofit that produces and distributes Indigenous programs statewide and nationally.

Ashlee Rezin/Sun-TimesThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between WBEZ and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
The Silver carp is big, unwieldy, and requires Joe Greendyk use both hands to measure it before tossing the fish overboard into the Illinois River.
The nearly 2-foot-long aquatic menace, which now overruns the river, has become the target of a state-run monitoring program to rein in its exploding numbers.
“They’re pretty slimy and pretty strong,” Greendyk says with his hands caked in fish slime. He’s a seasonal field researcher with the Illinois Natural History Survey. “So if you don’t grip them right, they’re pretty hard to control.”
For decades, local, state and federal officials have worried that the carp could bypass Chicago and breach the Great Lakes, possibly reducing populations of native species that locals like to fish. The feared spread could wreak havoc on the world’s largest freshwater ecosystem and the multibillion-dollar tourism, boating and fishing industries that rely on it. Carp, which can out-eat and outgrow native fish, can also leap out of the water and startle boaters.

The fight to keep the carp under control and out of the Great Lakes may be getting easier. Last week, Illinois announced it had acquired land needed to move forward with a $1.15 billion barricade aimed at keeping the voracious Asian carp from entering the channel that connects the Mississippi River Basin with the Great Lakes.
The barricade, called the Brandon Road Interbasin Project, is an underwater defense system long hailed as the solution to the carp problem.
Designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it’s slated to be built in the Des Plaines River, which connects the Illinois River to Chicago’s shipping canal near suburban Joliet. The billion dollar lock and dam upgrade will deploy a bubble wall, acoustic blasts, an electric barrier and a flushing mechanism to keep the carp from passing through.
Last week, Illinois officials announced they had reached a deal on Sept. 30 for the two small upland parcels totaling 2.75 acres required for the project. The donation may, however, end up costing Illinois taxpayers.

WBEZ and Grist have previously revealed longstanding concerns from state officials over contamination at the site caused by burning coal. Pritzker cited concerns about the cost of cleaning up the toxic mess in a 2024 letter to the Army Corps.
“It would be irresponsible to write a blank check to the Corps of Engineers or any other project manager without having a better understanding of what we’re agreeing to for the long term,” Pritzker’s spokesperson said in a statement at the time.
The Illinois Department of Natural Resources confirmed that state officials are currently developing a plan to investigate the site and are reviewing whether any additional land is needed.
Despite these concerns, regional leaders are pushing forward the necessary funding. Earlier this month, Pritzker joined six other Great Lakes governors in submitting a letter to Congress, calling the project a “national priority” and urging lawmakers to provide full federal financing.
The invasive carp — a family of fish which also includes the Bighead carp, Black carp and Grass Carp —  first turned up in the Mississippi River about 50 years ago. Experts say fish began overwhelming the waterway after escaping Arkansas fish farms, where they were imported to help limit algae and weed growth. In the intervening years, the fish expanded their range throughout the river and its tributaries — beginning to dominate the Illinois River in the 1990s.
From the back of the carp sampling boat where Greendyk grabbed the slimy fish, Michael Spear, a quantitative ecologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey, said the carp populations weren’t as high in the northern stretch of the river as they are further downstream.
“But still, we should see some action,” he said.
Back in 2019, the INHS partnered with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to establish a program to track the relative abundance of the carp up and down the Illinois River. As part of the program, crews of ecologists catch and track the health of the carp and native fish every year between June and October.
The data helps the state stay ahead of the carp. If populations are surging in one stretch of the river, Illinois officials can adapt their main form of carp control: paying commercial fishermen for targeted catches, including an extra 10 cents per pound of carp.
“We’re making an increasingly large dent in the population, according to these data,” Spear said. “That incentive seems to be paying off.”
He pointed to the area near Starved Rock State, one of the northernmost stretches of the more than 270-mile-long river, where he has noted drastic declines in the carp over the last five years. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources didn’t say exactly how much carp populations have declined.
Spear watched from the back of the boat as Greendyk and the rest of the crew wrapped up their sampling work for the day. While the data is promising, he said nobody wants to find out what happens if the carp ever make it past Chicago.
“The carp may not be in some of these other Great Lakes states,” Spear said. “But there’s a lot of attention from those states, because if they get into the Great Lakes, it’s going to become a much more regional problem.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/carpottawa-1024x576.webp,,,2025-10-20 14:02:29.276627

(Photo via Roblox)Following a civil subpoena earlier this year, Attorney General James Uthmeier announced Monday that he is issuing a criminal subpoena to Roblox, an online video game.
According to Uthmeier’s office, “multiple investigations have revealed that sexual predators are using Roblox to access, communicate with, and groom minors.”
“Roblox profited off of our kids while exposing them to the most dangerous of harms. They enabled our kids to be abused,” Uthmeier said in a video posted to his social media. “Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids.”
The attorney general said there have been reports of predators using Robux, the in-game currency, “to bribe minors into sending sexually explicit images of themselves.”
According to the attorney general, victims accuse Roblox of failing to implement safety measures and failing to warn parents of the dangers the game could pose to their children. 
In a response to the Phoenix, Roblox said, “We share Attorney General Uthmeier’s commitment to keeping kids safe and we will continue to assist his office in their investigations.”
“We have a strong record of working with law enforcement and investing in advanced safety systems to help protect our users and remove bad actors. To safeguard users, we prohibit the sharing of images and videos in the chat, use filters designed to block the exchange of personal information, and we are working to implement age estimation for all users accessing chat features,” Roblox continued.
The attorney general said there have been “troubling allegations” that the game has been negligent in verifying users’ ages and failed in content moderation. 
“These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on Roblox’ platform as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused,” Uthmeier said. 
Uthmeier appeared on Fox & Friends First Monday to talk about the launch of the investigation. 
“Here in Florida we’ve arrested over 1,000 child predators just this year, and many of these investigations lead right back to Roblox,” Uthmeier said. 
Predators often pose as young people and “engage in long-term dialogue” with the minors, “and in the worst of cases, we’ve seen actual physical abuse,” Uthmeier added.
In 2023 and 2024, Roblox was included on the National Center on Sexual Exploitation Dirty Dozen list. 
The list, since 2013, calls out “mainstream entities for facilitating, enabling, and even profiting from sexual abuse and exploitation.”
In 2024, other companies on the list included Reddit, Discord, Spotify, Telegram, LinkedIn, Meta, Apple, Cash App, GitHub, and Cloudfare. A federal law, the Communications Decency Act Section 230, provides legal immunity for for technology companies for material posted by users.
The center did not release a list of companies for 2025; instead, it showcased victims it said were denied justice as a result of the federal law and called for its repeal.
“While no system is perfect, our trained teams and automated tools continuously monitor communications to detect and remove harmful content. We are committed to leading the industry in safety and transparency,” Roblox concluded its statement.

In April, Uthmeier requested information from Roblox, such as how many of the game’s users are under the age of 16, marketing materials that relate to suitability for children, documents showing parental controls, and documents showing steps Roblox has taken to ensure children do not see mature content. 
Uthmeier’s April subpoena also sought communications with the National Center relating to Floridians and communication with Florida users reporting abuse.
Uthmeier told Fox & Friends that after the April subpoena, “what we found is evidence that they’ve been operating in a careless way. They know child predators are using the app to go after our kids and they haven’t done enough about it.”

(Courtesy photo)In a recent order, the New Mexico Supreme Court decided to move forward with the state’s request to remove embattled Eleventh Judicial District Attorney Bernadine Martin in McKinley County.
In August, citing violations of state law and other concerns, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a petition to remove Martin from office. The petition was sparked after state lawmakers voted to remove funding from Martin’s office and gave it to the neighboring district attorney in San Juan County, a move spearheaded by Senate Finance Chair George Muñoz (D-Gallup), citing turnover of Gallup prosecutors.
The findings in the AG’s petition included: a hostile workplace environment; failure to prepare or subpoena witnesses in McKinley County; breaches of procurement law, despite a prior settlement with the State Ethics Commission; “improper reliance” on contract attorneys; and Martin’s alleged continued work in private legal practice while serving as district attorney, in violation of state law.
Martin has denied all allegations in court filings. A voicemail, text message and email to Martin were not returned before publication.
Additionally in September, the state took over prosecution of two cases, alleging Martin had improperly dismissed the cases and failed to send them to an outside prosecutor.
Martin has argued that the state law allowing for removal of district attorneys only applies to her current term, which started in January of 2025, after her reelection to office in 2024. She argued it would be “obviously unjust” for the New Mexico Supreme Court to hear evidence “for misconduct [that] may have occurred during a previous term.” Moreover, Martin contends removal of district attorneys should be left either to state lawmakers or voters “when the public official stands for reelection.”
The New Mexico Attorney General’s office disagreed, citing state laws that district attorneys may be removed from office in a court proceeding, for certain reasons including: “failure, neglect or refusal” to perform the duties of the office.
In an Oct. 17 order, the New Mexico Supreme Court determined to move forward with removal proceedings, and wrote that a further order would contain the reasoning at a later date.
State law for the removal of public officials requires a trial without a jury before the Supreme Court justices.
An initial hearing is scheduled virtually for Oct. 31, and will be overseen by Special Master Alan Malott, a retired Albuquerque district judge appointed by the state’s Supreme Court to help act as a trial judge, including clarifying the exact nature of arguments and scheduling.
The Supreme Court’s decision on a removal proceeding is final, according to state law.

	Speaker after speaker at the convention, the largest annual convention of any kind in Alaska and one of the largest Indigenous gatherings in the nation, referenced the storm. It has displaced more than 1,500 people, killed at least one person and dislodged houses from their foundations. Residents of stricken villages have been airlifted away, with hundreds getting temporary residency in Anchorage. The state’s largest city is about 490 miles east of the evacuees’ home villages, and vastly different in culture and character from the highly rural Indigenous communities.
“My heart with everyone impacted by the recent coastal storms,” Natasha Singh, the president of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the keynote speaker on the first day of the convention, said at the start of her address.
“While the damage is so vast, the love for our people is even greater. And even as we feel the pain and the loss, I also feel a sense of inspiration to see so many people reach out to help,” she continued.

	A special feature of the convention was a second-floor room at the Dena’ina Civic and Convention Center that was set aside to collect donations headed to the storm victims. Over two days, as convention proceedings unfolded in the third-floor ballroom, the collection room became filled with boxes of diapers, toiletries, clothing items, shelf-stable food and other necessities that were sorted by volunteers.
On Saturday, the final day, delegates passed a resolution seeking an immediate national disaster declaration, and investment by the federal government in better infrastructure in rural Alaska to protect against future disasters.
The ravages of the remnants ofTyphoon Halong demand more than an emergency response, the resolution said. The disaster “has continued to expose vulnerabilities in infrastructure, housing, and emergency preparedness for rural Alaska/extreme remote America, and highlights the need for stronger tribal-state-federal collaboration,” it said.

	The call for a national disaster declaration and the aid that would come with it was among a packet of resolutions passed on Saturday. Many of the resolutions concerned food security and efforts to ensure that Alaska Natives can safely practice their traditional fishing and hunting practices.
One highly anticipated convention speaker was former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, who is considered a possible candidate for governor or U.S. Senate.
But Peltola made no campaign announcement.
“I want to preface everything I’m saying with: This is going to be very anticlimactic for everybody, I think,” she said at the start of her speech. “No big announcements, no big declarations.”

	She spoke about the way subsistence ties Alaska Natives to their home regions.
“Those spots, the places that we hunt and fish, they’re like another personality to us,” Peltola said.
She referred to a close friend who recently died. When she was on her deathbed, her family gathered around, Peltola said. “And at one point, they just talked about places. They just said the names of the places where they pick berries, or get whitefish, gather greens. And it was one of the most beautiful moments I’ve ever experienced, just reciting names.”

The Senate measure would go beyond the House-approved probe into why sheriffs’ budget requests have ballooned. At a time when the incarcerated population in county facilities is dropping — and budget-writers are struggling to navigate federal funding cuts and holes in tax revenue — one top Democrat said the request from sheriffs left “eyebrows raised” under the Golden Dome. 
“We certainly want to take a time out here,” Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues told CommonWealth Beacon. “We need to stabilize, investigate, and control the sheriffs’ spending in the future. This is an unsustainable path that the sheriffs are on.” 
Rodrigues said the Senate’s version of a so-called closeout budget — a spending bill needed to wrap up the state’s accounting for the fiscal year that ended June 30 — would create a “sheriff fiscal oversight council,” led by the administration’s public safety and budget secretaries. The governor would appoint three other members with experience in correctional facility operations and public finance.  
Sheriffs’ offices would be required to submit monthly reports to the panel, which Rodrigues said would “ensure that they’re fiscally and operationally accountable, [and] that the sheriffs are spending money maintaining activities that are actually specifically required by state law, case law, or court orders.” 
The panel would wield significant power. It would have access to “all records, documents, accounts, correspondence and any other data and material” it deems necessary from sheriffs’ offices. If those offices fail to meet financial targets recommended by the new organization, the council could appoint a receiver or even order the state comptroller not to certify new payments toward sheriffs. 
The Senate bill would dissolve the panel on January 1, 2028, but its members could vote to extend their work beyond that date. 
House and Senate budget-writers already agreed to withhold most of the money Gov. Maura Healey proposed to replenish sheriffs’ offices after spending overruns last cycle, supporting a much smaller $26.5 million sum to cover treatment services and free communication between incarcerated individuals and their loved ones.  
Legislative leaders in both chambers also want the inspector general to examine budgeting practices in sheriffs’ offices and report back next year. 
But Senate leaders want to do even more, and it’s not clear if House Democrats will get on board. Rodrigues said the IG investigation would be backward-looking, while the proposed new panel would instead keep finances under control moving forward. 
Protracted House-Senate negotiations could delay passage of everything else in the more than $2 billion spending bill, including hundreds of millions of dollars for MassHealth and a policy rider decoupling Massachusetts vaccine authority from the recommendations of a Centers for Disease Control panel. 
It’s common for state agencies and offices to spend more than they received through the annual state budget, then to request additional money at the end of the fiscal year.  
But, Beacon Hill insiders say lawmakers for years have had questions about the way sheriffs approach their year-end shortfalls. The sudden jump in scale this time around, combined with the heightened scrutiny on sheriffs amid a series of political controversies, seems to have pushed House and Senate Democrats to take a harsher stance. 
A year ago, the fiscal year 2024 closeout budget provided sheriffs with an additional $46 million. Rodrigues said that was a “record” amount at the time. 
Healey’s fiscal 2025 closeout proposal sought nearly $163 million for sheriffs — more than three times as much as last year and roughly 22 percent of the amount they received through the annual budget. 
“No other state agency or department overspends their budget by 22 percent,” Rodrigues said.  
Sheriffs said they faced major cost growth due to salary increases, substance use disorder care, and the “no-cost calls.” The Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association said it projects the free communication program cost all sheriffs a combined $12.4 million in fiscal year 2025.   
“For years, the Sheriffs have invested in evidence-based programs that make Massachusetts a national leader in corrections and rehabilitation — especially when it comes to saving lives and improving health outcomes,” a spokesperson for the association said last week. “These are proven, responsible investments in public safety and community well-being. We welcome any review that strengthens public confidence and supports our continued focus on operating safe, efficient facilities that help people rebuild their lives.”  
Legislative leaders did not learn of the apparent massive financial need for sheriffs’ offices until Healey filed her spending bill in August, according to Rodrigues. 
“We’re not satisfied with the level of communication [from sheriffs],” he said. “This caught us completely by surprise.” 
Healey, who moved to fulfill sheriffs’ full request for nearly $163 million, has not weighed in on whether she also has skepticism about the need or supports the Legislature’s push for additional scrutiny. A spokesperson for the governor last week said only that she would review any bill sent to her. 
The Legislature’s approach could become a talking point on the campaign trail. Two Republican challengers for governor, Mike Kennealy and Brian Shortsleeve, last week criticized the House bill for withholding funds and seeking an IG probe. 
Massachusetts sheriffs are primarily responsible for managing county correctional facilities. Similar to a trend within state prisons, the number of people incarcerated in county jails has been declining. In March, sheriffs reported they had a combined 7,048 in custody, less than half of the available capacity. 
Rising spending and falling incarceration is not a new development. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the average daily population overseen by sheriffs dropped 16 percent, while the number of total sheriffs’ employees grew 5 percent, according to a MassINC report published in 2017.

(Courtesy photo)Democratic precinct committee members in Indiana House District 9 on Saturday unanimously elected LaPorte County Councilman Randy Novak as the state district’s next representative. He was unopposed.
The real estate agent will serve out the remainder of former Rep. Pat Boy’s term, which runs through November 2026. Boy resigned her post early.
Novak is an alumnus of the AFL-CIO’s Path to Power program, which recruits and elects candidates to run for local government offices. The initiative is meant to promote pro-worker policies in local government and develop a bench of candidates to move into higher office, according to the website.
Novak served on the LaPorte County Council for over a decade before winning the caucus.
“I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Representative Pat Boy for her years of dedicated service and commitment to the people of our community. Her leadership has made a lasting impact, and it is truly an honor to be selected to continue her work at the Statehouse representing District 9,” he said in a press release. “To the residents of District 9, I pledge to serve with integrity, transparency, and dedication. I will work tirelessly to advance policies that strengthen our communities and improve the quality of life for everyone in our area.”
Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian oversaw the caucus, which included precinct committee members from both LaPorte and Porter counties in northwest Indiana.
“We are thankful for Representative-elect Randy Novak, and his willingness to serve Hoosiers at this moment. He’s been a champion for labor and our working families throughout his time on the County Council, and he will bring that same commitment to service with him to Indianapolis,” she said. “We appreciate his background in labor, and his 33 years of service to the Michigan City Fire Department, including retiring as Fire Chief. We are excited for the impact he will make from day one on supporting labor, public safety, and public schools.”

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)North Carolina Republicans are quickly advancing a plan to add another Republican seat to the state’s congressional delegation. A state Senate committee on Monday adopted a plan that would likely make one more district unwinnable for a Democrat.
Republicans are redrawing the northeast 1st Congressional District to be more advantageous for the GOP — a move that will likely flip control of the seat as President Donald Trump aims to maintain Republican control of the House after the midterms.
“The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), said as he presented the plan at the Senate Elections Committee. “Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives. And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump’s agenda.”
Trump posted a message on social media thanking North Carolina Republicans for the new map, writing it would give the state the opportunity to elect another MAGA Republican next year. He said he was “watching, and strongly supporting” the redistricting effort.
Mid-decade redistricting is not unusual in North Carolina because state and federal courts have struck down maps found to be illegal. But this is likely the first mid-decade redistricting with the express intent to help a president avoid a midterm slump.
U.S. Rep. Don Davis, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, won a second term last year by less than 2 percentage points after Republicans redrew the district in 2023 to be more Republican-friendly. The 1st district is currently rated a “toss-up” for 2026 by the Cook Political Report — North Carolina’s only competitive House seat.
The current configuration of the district is part of a federal lawsuit over the dilution of Black voting power. Hise said the new plan would stand up to legal challenges.
“We will defend these maps, and I am confident they will be held by the courts,” he said Monday.
With the new map, the state’s congressional delegation would move to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. Republicans currently hold 10 seats to Democrats’ four.
Stein: “Cynical power grab”
North Carolina is among several states drawn into the redistricting wars in recent months.
Texas was the first state to redistrict at Trump’s behest. Missouri followed. In response to the Texas redistricting, California Democrats approved a ballot measure that would add Democratic seats in that state. Voters there will decide in November whether to approve the new map.
North Carolina Democrats cannot prevent passage of district maps Republicans want. The GOP holds majorities in both the state House and Senate. And Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, is not permitted by law to veto the map.
Stein called the redrawn map a “cynical power grab” during a news conference Monday morning.
“The Republican legislature is abusing its power to take away yours,” Stein said, as he urged lawmakers to instead pass new spending for the state’s mental health system and Medicaid.
And he praised Davis, whom he said he had not personally spoken to, saying that Davis’s winning record in the district spoke to his ability to represent it well.
“Don Davis won because he is who they want,” Stein said. “The people of that district chose him … and now the Republican legislature is trying to take away the ability for the people of that district to make their own independent choice, by rigging the system so much that it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for Rep. Davis to win.”
Hearing room cleared after outburst from audience
Hise’s committee presentation drew derisive laughter from members of the public who attended the meeting.
All public comment was negative, with the redrawn map being described as a racist power grab done at the request of a wannabe dictator.
Robert Yhl of Raleigh said the plan is a tool of voter suppression.
“It makes more sense to me for the legislature to do what their people elected it to do, and that is to conduct business for the people and not conduct activities ordered by a convicted felon,” he said.
As the committee prepared to vote, the audience began chanting “Racist maps make racist reps.” The committee room was emptied of most public spectators.
After the meeting, Sen. Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford), called the map “blatant racism.”
“Black people will not have representation in terms of ability to elect a person that they want,” she said. “Don Davis will be gone.”
Earlier this month, a rumor circulated that Senate Leader Phil Berger, who is being challenged in the next primary by his local sheriff, would redistrict in exchange for a Trump endorsement. Berger denied the rumor.
During Monday’s committee meeting, Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) pressed Hise on communication between Berger, other Republican senators, and the White House.
Hise said he didn’t talk to anyone from the White House, but couldn’t answer for anyone else.
Northeast U.S. House district has elected Black lawmakers for decades
The 1st District is historically significant. The district has elected a Black representative since 1992, when Eva Clayton became the first Black candidate since 1898 to win a U.S. House seat from North Carolina.
Though it has mutated over the years, the district has been anchored by counties that are part of the Black Belt in the eastern part of the state. The South’s Black Belt was named for its fertile soil. The majority Black populations in some of the district’s counties, including Halifax, Hertford, and Bertie, are part of the legacy of slavery.
Several of those counties are moved out of the 1st District under the proposed map and into the 3rd, represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy. One of them, Greene County, is where Davis lives, although congressional candidates are not required to live in the districts they run in.
Clayton and G.K. Butterfield, who have both previously represented the district, released a joint statement Monday through Common Cause NC, strongly criticizing the new map.
“The proposed congressional map would silence communities that have long been the backbone of northeastern North Carolina, fracturing counties and towns that share common bonds of history, economy and hope,” Clayton and Butterfield said. “This is not merely a political act — it is a moral regression.”
And the pair added that they were “offended that the people … have not been given ample opportunity to provide their input.”
“This is not how democracy is supposed to work,” Clayton and Butterfield said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-NC-Map-1024x666.png,,,2025-10-20 12:58:11.594126

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)All over Ohio on Saturday, crowds turned out to protest the many controversies of the administration of President Donald Trump.
In the midst of a government shutdown over health care subsidies, organizers estimated that more than 10,000 turned out to protest at the Statehouse in Columbus. It was by far the largest protest there against the second Trump administration.
Large demonstrations in Cleveland and Cincinnati were also reported, in addition to estimates of more than 1,000 in smaller communities such as Bexley, Grandview and Pickerington. Indivisible Central Ohio, one of the organizers, estimated that 6,500 turned out in Westerville, more than 4,000 in Clintonville, and 2,000 in Delaware.
National organizers said the Ohio demonstrations were among 2,700 overwhelmingly peaceful protests in 50 states that drew about 7 million people.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Today, millions of Americans stood together to reject authoritarianism and remind the world that our democracy belongs to the people, not to one man’s ambition,” Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg, co-founders of Indivisible, said in a written statement. “Authoritarians want us to believe resistance is futile, but every person who turned out today proved the opposite. This movement isn’t about a single protest; it’s about a growing chorus of Americans who refuse to be ruled. Trump may want a crown, but in this country, there are no kings.”
“No Kings” has been a slogan for a protest movement underpinned by dozens of organizers, including 50501, Indivisible, the American Civil Liberties Union and the League of Women Voters. Among many other issues, Trump’s critics object to masked immigration agents conducting violent arrests, attempts to deploy troops to cities over their mayors’ and governors’ wishes, using the Justice Department to target Trump’s political enemies, and bombing boats in the Caribbean on claims they were carrying drugs, but without furnishing any evidence.
More than 10,000 are estimated to have gone to the Ohio Statehouse Saturday to protest the administration of Donald Trump.(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)
In Columbus, thousands found those and other problems with Trump compelling enough to turn out in the middle of an Ohio State Buckeyes football game. Some noted the fact on signs they were carrying. 
Hundreds lined the sidewalks along High Street where it borders the state Capitol. Protesters waved signs, a makeshift band played, people danced and cars streamed by, laying on their horns in support. Ever the football-obsessed community, one car bore a sign saying “This Buckeye supports (Michigan) more than Trump.”
Standing on the Statehouse side of High Street, Columbus resident Phillip Johnson said the stakes couldn’t be higher.
“We’re in trouble as a nation,” he said. “Not since the Civil War has it been this bad. I believe that this is white supremacy’s last stand and Trump is their person out front.”
As a Black man, Johnson said it was inspiring to see thousands come out, many carrying signs decrying what they see as Trump’s and his allies’ racism. 
“This right here lets me know that we’re not alone, that people get what’s going on,” he said, adding that it was also a personal call to action.
“There aren’t enough African Americans down here. That lets me know that I have work to do in our community. That’s something I’m getting out of this.”
Stephanie Howard of Columbus said she was protesting “the fascist tactics and illegal actions of this administration around immigration, around free speech, around detaining American citizens and other people.”
She said Trump and his allies have reason to be concerned about the huge turnout for Saturday’s protests.
More than 10,000 are estimated to have gone to the Ohio Statehouse Saturday to protest the administration of Donald Trump.(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)
“They should be worried because this shows them that there are people eager to do something in a peaceful, constructive way,” Howard said. “The people are here and we are ready to push back. We don’t want to fight. We don’t want anyone to get hurt. But people are upset and angry and they are not going to put up with the administration and what it’s doing.”
Republicans, such as House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, called the protests “Hate America Rallies.” But organizers said the exact opposite was true.
“I heard someone was trying to say we’re unAmerican,” Mia Lewis, assistant director of Common Cause Ohio and a volunteer with Indivisible Central Ohio, said in a written statement. “Honestly, I can’t think of anything more powerfully American than a diverse group of free people exercising their rights, speaking truth to power, and refusing to bow down to a wannabe king!” 
Statewide action
Organizers in Central Ohio planned protests for earlier on Saturday in surrounding communities and then a 4 p.m. protest at the Statehouse in Columbus. In Newark, 35 miles east of Columbus, it appeared that more than 1,000 came out at noon to the Licking County Courthouse to show their distaste for Trump. 
They played music, chanted and almost made a ring around the courthouse as they marched around the sidewalk. 
A few cars sporting Trump flags drove around. In one, a passenger with a bullhorn taunted the crowd, saying they were being paid and had been bussed in. That provoked laughs.
When he said, “ICE is doing its job,” a protester shot back, “Yeah. Fascism.”
Steve Sunkle has spent his life in Newark. Asked if the size of the crowd surprised him, he said, “In this town, yes. You can’t even find a Democratic headquarters here.”

But, Sunkle said, sentiment seemed to be shifting.
“I think some of the elderly who voted for him are turning against him,” he said. “I live in an apartment building with 100 apartments. It’s hard to find a fan in that building right now.” 
He said inflation and threats to health care are reasons, “and people don’t like to see bombs being dropped on boats in the Caribbean without any proof. That’s not America. That’s the beginning of a totalitarian state.”
Diana Dudgeon stood with a sign that said “I need to be able to tell my grandchildren I did not stay silent.”
She has five grandchildren and has serious worries about the future.
“I’ve been thinking along these lines for awhile, because I’m 79 years old,” she said. “I won’t be around to see all the damage that’s being done. But my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, will. I just want them to know that I cared enough to try to do something.”
Attending her first protest, Dudgeon said she was surprised that she found it to be such a positive experience.
“This is awesome,” she said. “This is my first time. I feel very empowered. It’s so much more than I expected.” 
At the Statehouse later that day, Phillip Johnson said that was the point.
“They say fear is contagious, but so is courage,” he said. “People get a shot in the arm when they see this all over the world.”

The Louisville Democratic Party selected Gary Clemons, the president of the Steelworkers Local 1693, to run in a special election to fill the vacant seat in the 37th Senate District. 
In a Monday statement about Clemons’ nomination, the local party said he was selected unanimously by the nominating committee. 
“We are thrilled to have Gary representing Democrats in Senate District 37,” said Logan Gatti, the chair of the Louisville Democratic Party. “Gary is exactly the kind of leader Kentucky needs — grounded, community-driven and unafraid to fight for working families. He brings a wealth of experience, compassion and common sense to the table.” 
Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg appointed Yates to serve an unexpired term as Jefferson County clerk earlier this month, following the death of Republican Jefferson County Clerk Bobbie Holsclaw. Yates had declared candidacy for that office earlier this year. 
Clemons also quickly received the backing of the Kentucky Democratic Party. Chairman Colmon Elridge issued a statement Monday morning in support of the union leader. 
“The Democratic Party has always been the party of working people and Gary Clemons is uniquely qualified to go fight for our families in the General Assembly,” Eldridge said. “At a time when too many Kentuckians are feeling the effects of a Republican-created cost-of-living and health care crisis, Gary’s decades of advocacy for fair wages, fair treatment and a more affordable life for working families will mean Louisvillians won’t just have a representative in Frankfort — they’ll have someone who understands their needs and continues to stand, and fight, alongside them.”
Michon Lindstrom, a spokesperson for the Kentucky secretary of state’s office said the deadline to file for the special election is Tuesday, Oct. 21. The election will be held Tuesday, Dec. 16. 
The deadline for voters in the Senate district to register and be eligible to vote in the election is Monday, Nov. 17. The district includes western parts of Jefferson County. 
The Jefferson County Republican Party did not immediately return an emailed request for comment Monday asking about a possible nomination for the special election. 
With Yates’ departure, Democrats hold five seats in the state Senate to Republicans’ 32 members.

(Photo courtesy of Merck)Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. is breaking ground on a $3 billion expansion of its longtime Elkton manufacturing campus, a project state and federal officials say will transform the Shenandoah Valley into a hub for life sciences innovation while adding as many as 500 permanent jobs.
The 400,000-square-foot facility will serve as Merck’s Center of Excellence for Pharmaceutical 
Ingredients and Small Molecule Manufacturing, marking a significant increase from the company’s earlier $2 billion commitment and 300-job projection. Construction is expected to begin this year and finish by 2029.
Company officials said the new site, which builds on nearly 85 years of Merck’s presence in Rockingham County, will enhance the production of small-molecule medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), adding cutting-edge testing and manufacturing capabilities.
“This investment will help advance our goal of providing new, innovative treatment options for people facing serious health challenges in the U.S. and around the world,” said Merck Chairman and CEO Robert Davis, calling the expansion a milestone “for Merck, for Virginia, for manufacturing in the United States and, most importantly, for the patients we serve.”
 State officials tout ‘transformational’ investment

Virginia leaders hailed the project as one of the largest single corporate investments in the state’s recent history.
“Merck’s transformational $3 billion commitment to locate its Center of Excellence marks a giant leap forward for both America’s and Virginia’s life sciences sector,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who called the project evidence of Virginia’s growing reputation as a leader in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Commerce and Trade Secretary Juan Pablo Segura said the project underscores the state’s “rapidly expanding biopharmaceutical sector,” crediting Virginia’s workforce and business-friendly policies for attracting large-scale investments.
Local officials called the expansion a turning point for the Valley’s economy.
“This announcement by Merck marks a momentous occasion for Rockingham County and the Shenandoah Valley,” said Shenandoah Valley Partnership Executive Director Jay Langston, adding that the project “positions the Valley at the forefront of a new class of pharmaceutical innovation.”
Rockingham County Board of Supervisors Chairman Joel Hensley said the expansion will “bring valuable jobs” and represents years of collaboration among local, state and company officials.
 Incentives and workforce training

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) worked with Rockingham County and the Shenandoah Valley Partnership to secure the deal. The state will provide a $5 million performance-based grant from the Virginia Investment Performance program and a $4 million grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund to support site development.
Merck will also benefit from the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program, which offers customized workforce recruitment and training services at no cost to qualified employers. The program, ranked as the nation’s top customized workforce training initiative by Business Facilities for three consecutive years, aligns with community colleges and universities to train workers to international standards.
“The expansion provides for more job opportunities and will further strengthen our local economy,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg. “Merck’s continued commitment to our community underscores the strength of our workforce.”
Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, called the project “truly transformative,” adding that Merck “has been a trusted partner to Rockingham County for many years, providing good-paying jobs and supporting our local economy.”
 Warner and Kaine praise expansion’s impact

U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats representing Virginia on Capitol Hill, also welcomed Merck’s investment and said it reflects the company’s long-term confidence in Virginia’s workforce and life sciences potential.
Warner noted that the company’s plan to bring most of its global small-molecule production to Elkton will “strengthen America’s pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity” and “reaffirm Virginia’s leadership in the life sciences sector.”
Warner also praised Merck for continuing to produce vaccines in Elkton, including its cancer-preventing Gardasil shot, at a time when “political attacks and misinformation are undermining trust in medicine and public health.”
Kaine, who helped expand Merck’s Elkton site during his term as governor, called the new investment “welcome news for Virginia’s economy.”
The senator also reflected on his role in including the Gardasil vaccine in Virginia’s immunization requirements during his tenure as governor, making the commonwealth the first state to do so. 
“Particularly as the Trump Administration sows doubt about the effectiveness of vaccines,” Kaine said, “it couldn’t be more important that we recognize and celebrate the impressive progress that Virginians and Merck have shared with the world.”
Warner and Kaine have both been involved in the facility’s growth over the past two decades. 
As governor, Warner secured a $40 million investment from Merck to prepare the Elkton site for vaccine production, and Kaine later helped secure another $57 million to expand its Gardasil operations.
In recent years, the senators have also pushed for greater federal investment in Virginia’s biotechnology research and manufacturing sector. 
In 2021, they helped secure more than $52 million under the American Rescue Plan for the Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing cluster in Petersburg. Two years later, the Petersburg cluster was designated a Tech Hub under the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation Warner championed in Congress.
 Strengthening Virginia’s life sciences economy

Merck’s $3 billion project builds on the company’s nearly century-long presence in the Shenandoah Valley, where it has maintained major vaccine and drug manufacturing operations. 
Local officials said the scale of the project will create ripple effects across the Valley economy — from construction jobs to workforce training partnerships.
“This investment not only strengthens the regional economy through new jobs and capital investment but also positions the Valley at the forefront of a new class of pharmaceutical innovation,” said Langston of the Shenandoah Valley Partnership.

But when the system is repeatedly rigged to favor one side, that right quickly erodes. 
On October 13, North Carolina Republican leaders announced plans to vote on new United States House maps. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell), Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), and House Redistricting Chairs Brenden Jones (R-Columbus) and Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke) openly stated that they are acting on instructions from President Donald Trump, aiming to maintain Republican control of the U.S. House in 2026. They claim Trump’s state win gives them a mandate to further manipulate an already unfair district map. 
If this new map is passed, it will be harder for voters to hold their representatives accountable, especially now that changing policies, like federal Medicaid cuts, are hurting many North Carolinians.  
This recent decision isn’t a one-time power grab. It is part of a years-long strategy to entrench partisan control through redistricting. As Senator Phil Berger posted on X on September 25, “We have drawn four Congressional maps in the last six years in redistricting fights with Democrats… If we have to draw one more map this year, we will.” 
Framing this as a partisan standoff is misleading. Let’s be clear: North Carolina maps have been repeatedly redrawn because courts found earlier versions violated constitutional protections against partisan and racial gerrymandering.   
You might have heard that our state has some of the most unfair Congressional maps in the country. What does that really mean? In North Carolina, Republican leaders have made a habit of manipulating district maps to make Congressional races less competitive. This tactic, known as gerrymandering, involves strategically drawing district lines to favor one party. One method of gerrymandering, called “cracking and packing,” involves diluting opposition votes across multiple districts and/or concentrating them into a single district to limit their influence. 
In 2022, North Carolina had a balanced 7-7 party split for the state’s 14 U.S. House seats. In 2024, after the adoption of a controversial new map, the state’s representation shifted dramatically to Republicans occupying 10 of 14 seats. Now, NC Republican leaders are targeting the state’s last remaining swing district with their proposed map, the 1st Congressional District (CD1) in the historic Black Belt, to undermine the freedom to vote and suppress Black voters.   
A vast majority of North Carolina voters reject the practice of gerrymandering, with 84 percent stating that it is never acceptable for politicians to manipulate district boundaries to benefit their own party. This opposition spans all political affiliations, including 78 percent of Republicans, 87 percent of Democrats, and 85 percent of unaffiliated voters. 
Eighty-two percent of voters also recognize the importance of judicial oversight in preventing racial discrimination in electoral maps, which is crucial given ongoing and past litigation. The case North Carolina NAACP v. Berger, recently consolidated with Williams v. Hall, will decide whether the state’s three electoral maps violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, due to possible racial discrimination against Black voters. This comes amid a federal court rejecting Jefferson Griffin’s baseless attempt to challenge the election of Allison Riggs to the NC Supreme Court in 2024—a major victory powered by voters’ organizing and advocacy.  
There is an alternative to these unfair maps, and we can look to our own state not too long ago for inspiration. In 2022, NC Supreme Court intervention prevented the use of gerrymandered maps and resulted in more competitive, fair elections in the midterms. Another option is the establishment of a bipartisan citizens commission to draw fair voting maps, which is supported by 70 percent of North Carolina voters. Such reforms would help ensure courts and voters, not politicians taking orders from partisan leaders, determine fair representation. 
At the ACLU-NC, we work in the legislature, courts, and communities to protect North Carolinians’ civil rights and liberties, including your right to vote in fair elections. While Senator Berger and Speaker Hall take orders from President Trump, we answer to North Carolinians because we are all CD1, united in the fight for fair representation.

Rankin County NAACP President Angela English said a Justice Department official recently  informed her that Attorney General Pam Bondi had authorized federal investigators to move forward with the Rankin County investigation after months of uncertainty about whether it would continue under the Trump administration. 
English has been coordinating with Justice Department officials since they began investigating the department in 2023, after a group of sheriff’s deputies and a Richland police officer, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” tortured two Black men during a late-night raid. 
Last year, the six officers were sentenced to federal prison for their roles in the incident, and dozens more people have since accused Rankin County deputies of abuse. 
“We need people to be held accountable for what they’re doing,” English said. “We need people to come forward and tell their own stories.”
After learning that the investigation would continue, English organized a listening session to help investigators connect with more alleged victims of the sheriff’s department.
The session will be held Nov. 1 at the Mount Elam Family Life Center in Pearl, where attendees will have an opportunity to share their experiences in private and submit their claims to the Justice Department.
“I have not seen where the Department of Justice has signaled anything regarding the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department,” said Jason Dare, the department’s attorney and spokesperson. “The RCSD will continue its cooperation with the investigation in order to show that all aspects of the department’s policing are within constitutional boundaries.” 
The Justice Department launched an investigation into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department in September 2024, after Mississippi Today and The New York Times exposed a pattern of torture by Rankin deputies stretching back nearly two decades and involving at least 20 deputies. 
The federal agency did not respond to requests for comment on the investigation, but in July, it denied a Freedom of Information request filed by Mississippi Today seeking the status of its Rankin County investigation, saying the records “pertain to an ongoing law enforcement proceeding.” 
While the investigation had not formally been abandoned, its future was uncertain under the Trump administration, which has moved to scuttle most of the Justice Department’s ongoing investigations into law enforcement agencies accused of civil rights violations. 
In May, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division announced it was closing eight investigations into police departments in Arizona, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, Oklahoma and Louisiana. 
The division also dismissed lawsuits and investigations into the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, which were responsible for the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. 
Civil rights advocates said the sweeping changes signaled an end to the department’s longstanding practice of holding abusive law enforcement agencies accountable. 
“The Trump administration is essentially giving a green light to police abuse and unconstitutional policing,” Jarvis Dortch, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, said in a May statement.
Survivors of the Goon Squad’s abuses said news of the investigation came as a relief. 
Rick Loveday, a former jail guard who said he was brutalized by Rankin County deputies when they raided his home in 2018, said he was excited to hear the Justice Department was continuing its investigation. 
“ They did a bunch of bad stuff,” Loveday said. “Fate caught up with some of them, but they still haven’t been punished, really, for what they’ve done.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28094225/IMG_0260.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 12:58:11.594126

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office asked executive councilors and lawmakers on the state’s Fiscal Committee for an additional roughly $4.3 million to pay for litigation costs related to a number of lawsuits the state faced, including abuse allegations in the state’s juvenile justice system.
The funding is in addition to what the state Legislature budgeted for the Attorney General’s Office. However, it is typical for the office to request funding outside of the two-year budgeting process. State law specifically instructs the attorney general, unlike other state agencies, to spend more money than is budgeted for this purpose, with the approval of the Fiscal Committee and Executive Council.
“For the last decade-plus, that’s how our litigation fund has been run,” Attorney General John Formella told councilors during Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting. “The Legislature budgets an amount that I think everyone understands is not going to be enough, and the plan is for us to have to do the work, try to figure out what we’re going to need for a particular fiscal year, come to the Fiscal Committee and the Governor and Council to ask them for it.”
This funding is meant to cover the costs the state incurs in litigating the cases, not any settlements it is ordered to pay out as a result of these cases.
Approximately $1.5 million of the $4.3 million is being used to litigate cases related to abuse at the former Youth Development Center, a juvenile justice facility in Manchester that has been the center of one of the largest child abuse scandals in U.S. history, Formella said.
Formella told councilors the $4.3 million is actually a cost-savings.
“I will note that we really worked hard to cut down on our request this fiscal year knowing the budget challenges the state is facing,” he said. “This is 40% less than we requested last fiscal year, and while that is in part due to just the cases, we’ve also been able to achieve some pretty significant savings by just spreading work around the office, taking some work from one area of the office and applying it to another area of the office.”
Both the Executive Council and the Fiscal Committee approved the funding.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/formella-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 12:58:11.594126

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)Facing an Oct. 31 deadline to adopt a new congressional redistricting map, the Ohio Redistricting Commission will meet for the first time this month on Tuesday.
Gov. Mike DeWine’s office sent out an official announcement last week, with the first meeting of the “reconstituted” commission scheduled for Oct. 21 at 9 a.m.
The commission will meet in the Ohio Senate’s Finance Hearing Room, where appointed officials will be noted for the record and co-chairpersons for the commission will be chosen.
Gov. Mike DeWine is constitutionally required to officially reconvene the group and stand as one of its members. Also on the commission will be Auditor of State Keith Faber, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, and two members each from the Ohio House and Senate, one from each party in each chamber.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio have both indicated they will be serving on the commission. State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, was announced as an appointee, but a Republican Senate appointee has not been announced as of Friday.
The last time the commission was reconvened, back in 2023, trying to decide on the two co-chairs delayed the commission in getting to the official agenda.
If the co-chairs are decided in Tuesday’s meeting, the agenda includes “consideration of congressional maps.” The only two confirmed proposals on the docket are the Democratic maps that were introduced by Antonio and Isaacsohn at the beginning of September.
Though the maps were introduced ahead of the first deadline set in the Ohio Constitution for the legislature to adopt a bipartisan-approved map, no votes were held by the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting. Several Republican members of the committee said the Democratic proposals were unfairly gerrymandered, while only one member of the public spoke out against the maps.
The committee heard hours of supporting testimony for the proposals over the two meetings it held. The Dem proposal would create a congressional delegation with eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts.
A Republican caucus map has not been publicly released.
Republican co-chairs of that joint committee argued the constitution’s deadlines include not only the Sept. 30 date that passed without a vote on a map and the Oct. 31 deadline for the Ohio Redistricting Commission, but also a final Nov. 30 legislative deadline, giving them more time than is being represented by anti-gerrymandering advocates, who argue the missed deadlines show a lack of good-faith effort.
If the commission isn’t able to come to bipartisan agreement on a map by Oct. 31, the General Assembly would only need a simple majority in the Republican supermajority chambers for a map to be approved. Lawmakers would have until Nov. 30 to come to a decision.
The map is required to be approved in time for the 2026 elections, meaning whatever is approved will have implications on imminent congressional races.

(Style Weekly)The University of Virginia declined to accept an offer from President Donald Trump‘s administration to sign an agreement granting federal funding and privileges in exchange for support of the administration’s policies, according to an Oct. 17 letter submitted to White House officials. Virginia lawmakers had denounced the proposal as “political extortion” and threatened to withhold state funding from the college if it accepted. 
In a statement to the institution’s community, UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney said he and Rector Rachel Sheridan wrote in the letter to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and White House officials that federal research funding should be based on merit while declining the invitation. 
“The integrity of science and other academic work requires merit-based assessment of research and scholarship,” the letter stated. “A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education.”
UVA was one of nine colleges nationwide that the administration asked to sign the compact, which requires school leaders to cap the number of international students in the Student Visa Exchange Program, forgo considering race and sex in admissions, bar transgender women from women’s athletics, freeze tuition for five years and limit university staff from political speech, all in exchange for research funding. Institutions had until Monday to respond.
Va. Senate Dems call Trump admin’s UVA funding proposal ‘political extortion’

Mahoney added that higher education faces “significant challenges” and has not always “lived up to its highest ideals.” Still, he said “UVA believes that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation.”
Over the past week, voices opposing the invitation to UVA grew louder, including from state Senate Democratic leadership and hundreds of students and staff who protested against it on Friday. Democratic senators warned that joining the compact could have a financial impact on the institution during future budget cycles.
The decision, which came after a demonstration on campus on Friday, followed UVA’s initiative to gather feedback from the community regarding the invitation. Additionally, a workgroup was formed to review the invitation before a response was submitted.
“Your thoughtful feedback shows a profound care for the university and a strong commitment to its future,” Mahoney wrote in the letter rejecting the compact.
He added “we will continue to work to strengthen free expression and free inquiry, protect academic freedom, ensure affordability, promote intellectual pluralism, and maintain institutional neutrality in an increasingly polarized world.”
UVA joins institutions like Brown University in Rhode Island, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Southern California in declining the invitation, which critics say would undermine academic freedom and institutional independence.
According to media reports, the Trump administration is considering expanding the offer to more institutions.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)New Mexico Democratic U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján announced on Monday they had co-sponsored legislation backed by 31 Senate Democrats and sponsored by U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota to protect federal contractors during the governmental shutdown.
“Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House, but they refuse to come to the table and work with Democrats to lower costs and health care premiums. And every day Trump keeps the government shut down, New Mexico working families suffer,” Heinrich said in a statement.  “I’m proud to introduce legislation that will help ensure New Mexicans are paid for the wages and benefits lost during Trump’s manufactured crisis. Every hardworking New Mexican deserves access to affordable health care and the dignity of financial security.”
According to a news release, the Fair Pay for Federal Contractors Act will provide federal contract workers, “including low-wage service workers” with back pay and restored paid-leave benefits if used; cover costs associated with backpay in amounts equal to their weekly compensation up to $1,442; and require the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to submit a report on federal contractors accessing back pay.
“Federal contractors, like those from the Department of Energy and Department of Defense that are safeguarding our national security, should not miss a paycheck because of the Republican shutdown,” Luján said in a statement. “These skilled workers are essential for our defense and innovation, and they deserve the same backpay protections as other federal employees. It’s time to right this wrong, and I will fight to ensure that contractors are paid for what they have earned.”
The bill also has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, where is is sponsored by U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA); New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury has signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill has endorsements from numerous unions, including and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the American Federation of Teachers; and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
“Through no fault of their own, many of these families faced the reality of missing payments on their mortgages, student loans, school tuition, car loans, health care premiums, daycare, interest fees, and so many other expenses,” IAM Union International President Brian Bryant wrote to lawmakers in the House and Senate. “Today, they are looking down the barrel of a similar fate. Contract workers and their families should not suffer the consequences of a shutdown they had no hand in creating. Dedicated federal contract workers maintain the aircraft, vehicles and systems that keep our military mission-ready and our nation secure. Many live paycheck to paycheck and are among the first to feel the devastating impact of a government shutdown.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/arboretumclosed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 12:04:20.125190

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)LAFAYETTE – As its full-time undergraduate enrollment steadily declined over the past decade, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette nonetheless went on a hiring spree.
UL’s full-time undergraduate enrollment — where it makes the most money, as each student generates about $12,000 per year — declined by 1,700 students since 2015. That resulted in a $20 million loss in revenue. While its online and graduate student numbers ticked up during that period, it wasn’t enough to make the university whole.
“They are the students who really pay the bills,” interim UL President Jaimie Hebert told faculty and staff at his Sept. 25 town hall meeting, the first time the university has publicly addressed the budget shortfall.
Despite that downward trend developing in plain sight, the university’s hiring nevertheless continued on an upward trajectory, with 554 positions created from 2015 to March of this year. Because each new position means recurring costs like salary, benefits, retirement, space and administrative overhead, the hiring added $60 million to UL’s budget over that period, Hebert said.

Those rising cost commitments, according to Hebert, are part of the reason the university is scrambling to close a $25 million deficit, and staring down unknown levels of personnel cuts. So far, only six job losses and the closing of the sustainability office have been confirmed.
The annual job additions are not uniform, as some years saw more hiring than others. Data that UL provided in response to a public records request supports Hebert’s assertion that staffing increased — but it doesn’t show how the new hires were justified, for instance to support a growing program or expand research.
In 2018, hiring spiked. It then fell for the next three years before rebounding to previous levels during the post-Covid years of 2022 and 2023, right after UL first earned the prestigious R1 research designation. The numbers declined in 2024, and last fall notifications started going out to faculty and staff about cost-cutting measures.

UL wasn’t able to offer any analysis of the numbers it provided.
“We’d have to do a real deep dive to see where those people were hired. Some of them may have been part of a grant that was given” that allowed for new hires, says UL spokesman Eric Maron.
“We can’t really say whether R1 has anything to do with anything,” Maron added. “There can be peaks and valleys.”
In its response to The Current, UL indicated that 87 of those 554 newly created positions are unfilled, leaving a net of 467 positions. UL provided a list of the deleted positions.
UL enrolled its largest freshman class to date this fall and saw overall enrollment grow from last year.

Few areas of modern American popular culture have undergone greater or more rapid changes in recent years that college sports. Thanks to a series of successful legal challenges, the nation’s longstanding practice of treating college athletes as amateurs has been completely upended and, especially at big schools engaged high-profile sports like football and basketball, teams have become professionalized, with many athletes switching schools yearly, and raking in multi-million dollar deals under so-called “name image and likeness.”
In a time of such rapid change and upheaval, it comes as little surprise that many people who were used to how things once worked – be they university leaders or average citizens and sports fans — are experiencing a sense of disorientation and discomfort. And this fact was made clear in some recent opinion surveys conducted by the Elon University Poll and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, and recently Newsline caught up with the Elon poll director, Prof. Jason Husser, to learn more.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation Husser, we discussed some of the results of the recent opinion surveys of university leaders he oversaw on the subject of the rapid changes that have been underway in college athletics – particularly the professionalization of once amateur sports and the newfound ability athletes enjoy to transfer from school-to-school.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of these issues, the concerns that many university leaders have about how these changes are impacting low revenue sports, and, in addition, how these views compare and contrast to what a poll conducted this past summer revealed about the attitudes of the general public.

Over the last several decades, much of the world has made significant progress in how it views and responds to the affliction we’ve come to refer to as substance use disorder. Whereas people who once struggled with the misuse of and addiction to drugs and alcohol were once dismissed as weak and flawed, we’ve learned that substance use disorder is an illness not unlike many others that can and should give rise to treatment rather than judgment and ostracization.
A recent lawsuit settlement should help advance this ongoing piece of societal progress. The case involved a pair of North Carolina skilled nursing facilities that sought to deny admission to an individual in violation of multiple federal laws because of his substance use disorder and recent drug use. The case settlement requires the facilities to develop and implement a Substance Use Disorder Non-Discrimination Policy and to implement several other modern, medically sound policies and recently, in order to learn more, we caught up with a pair of attorneys from the nonprofit that helped spearhead the case, Disability Rights North Carolina: Holly Stiles and Sara Harrington.

More trans youth and their families are expected to seek gender-affirming care and community support following two New Hampshire laws that restricted access for minors. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont positioned to become gender-affirming care haven for New Hampshire families.","When Michelle purchased her house in a small town near Keene in 2017, she thought she would never leave. Yet, less than a decade later, she was back to house hunting and saying goodbye to the wide porch and the basement apartment that she so loved in her New Hampshire home.
“I thought that we would be there for a very long time,” she told VTDigger. “I literally cried the day of the closing, and I had such a hard time just walking out that last day,” 
By February, staying in New Hampshire with her 18-year-old transgender daughter seemed far scarier than leaving, said Michelle, who moved to Vermont early this year. VTDigger is not using her last name to protect her and her daughter’s safety.
Two bills effectively blocking gender-affirming care in the state for any new patients under 18 were then working their way through the New Hampshire Legislature. In August, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed them into law, making New Hampshire the first state in New England to set such limits. Even before that, though, in 2024, a ban on genital surgery for minors became state law.
One of the new state laws prohibits health care providers in New Hampshire from administering puberty blockers or hormone treatments to new patients under 18 — though patients receiving that care before January 1, 2026, can continue it. (It is still legal for adults to access this care in the state.) The second law blocks New Hampshire doctors from performing “breast surgeries” on minors.
But months before the state legislature passed the 2025 bills, Michelle and her family members saw the writing on the wall.
Anti-trans rhetoric was mounting in the state legislature and had only only gotten worse through the 2024 presidential and gubernatorial campaigns. They no longer felt at home in their dream house. 
When a neighbor posted an Ayotte for New Hampshire lawn sign, it felt targeted against them. Michelle said her daughter told her then, “Mama, I don’t feel safe in our neighborhood.”
“I was just devastated. I knew that what was going to happen this year was not going to be pretty, and I needed to get our family out of New Hampshire,” Michelle said. 
The night of the election felt like the final nail in the coffin, she said, with wins called for Republicans Donald Trump and Ayotte. At 2 a.m., her daughter texted her from another room, saying “we need to leave the country.” 
Instead, Michelle and her spouse immediately put their house on the market and started looking for homes in Massachusetts and Vermont. When she found the Washington County home she now lives in, she jumped. 
They moved to Vermont before Valentine’s Day. “When I looked across the street and saw a pride flag, I felt like this was it,” she said.

Affirming care in Vermont
Michelle’s family is not alone in their desire to move to a state they perceive to be more accepting for trans youth. 
Beyond New Hampshire, bans on gender-affirming care for minors are active in 25 other states. All of these were effectively upheld in June by a Supreme Court decision that determined a Tennessee law blocking gender-affirming care is not unconstitutional, which health care providers expect to drive many young people across state lines seeking care. 
The tenor at the federal level has had a chilling effect on some larger health care providers who are also closing their clinics, even in states without bans. This past summer, Yale Connecticut Children’s Medical Center announced it was ending its gender-affirming care program in light of federal pressures, and Yale New Haven Hospital stopped providing hormone treatment to minors. Though Connecticut law still protects the care, the closures have de-facto cut the state off from local access to it. In Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Penn State Health similarly opted to end gender-affirming care for minors, cutting off a large portion of the state from this care. 
Unlike in some other states, New Hampshire’s law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, 2026, still allows providers to refer patients under 18 for care out of state. As a result, advocates and clinics in Vermont say they are expecting an influx of new patients either moving or traveling from states with more restrictive access to gender-affirming care for minors. 
“We are fortunate in this region that patients may seek care nearby in neighboring states for the time being, but that remains a hardship for many due to travel and insurance hurdles,” Keith Loud, the physician-in-chief of the network of pediatric care across Dartmouth Health Children’s hospitals and clinics, said in a statement to VTDigger about the new laws. Loud noted that gender-affirming care is broader than just hormonal therapies and surgeries, and that the Dartmouth Health patients will still be able to seek support from their doctors, for referrals or other therapeutic expertise.

“There will certainly be an increase of families that are looking to move to places where there’s a different level of care, whether that’s (from) New Hampshire or whether that’s Texas or Indiana,” said Dana Kaplan, the executive director of Outright VT, a group that aims to support LGBTQ+ youth in the state.
“We’ve already seen that start, and we anticipate that it will only continue,” he said, “which is just another reason to make sure that in Vermont, we’re not backing down and we’re staying out in front as a national leader.” 
Vermont’s shield laws, passed in 2023, offer protections to providers and recipients of gender-affirming care and establish the care as an essential part of the standards of care a health insurance plan should cover. Also, denying a patient gender-affirming care would be a violation of the state’s anti discrimination laws, as Monica Allard, a lawyer with the ACLU of Vermont, told VTDigger.
University of Vermont Medical Center’s Transgender Youth Program remains the primary place in the state for young people to access gender-affirming healthcare. The hospital and the clinic have seen an uptick in inquiries from patients in other states, said UVM Medical Center spokesperson Annie Mackin. So far the clinic has mostly received calls from patients in New Hampshire, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, trying to make a plan for where they can go for care, Mackin said. 
The clinic is prepared to receive these patients when they do come, said Jason Williams, the head of communications for UVM Medical Center, in an interview. They should be able to see a clinician within a few weeks of scheduling, he said.
“We don’t think we will have to immediately change. We’ve got all the people and all the expertise,” Williams said. 
Patients at the UVM Medical Center’s clinic can meet with a therapist or psychologist or a pediatric endocrinologist to access hormonal interventions like puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy. For surgical care, patients are referred out of state, Williams said. 
PlannedParenthood of New England is also able to provide hormone replacement therapies to those above 16 years old. The population of 16 and 17 year olds who do seek gender-affirming care at PPNE are less than 1% of the provider’s patient population. 
Jessica Barquist, a spokesperson for PPNE, said that the provider has not seen a “significant influx” of patients into Vermont yet, but expects that it will come in January, when the New Hampshire laws go into effect. Because trans minors are such a small percentage of those the organization serves, Barquist said she expects the clinics to be able to easily accommodate the influx with their existing resources and schedules. 
The organization also runs a donor supported fund for gender-affirming care patients as a way to reduce barriers to care, Barquist said.
In addition to medical resources, Outright Vermont offers an extensive list of where to find items that young queer people may need, like chest binders or specialty providers, as well as places to gather with a supportive community.
Connecting young people with the health care that affirms their gender identity, that makes them feel seen and respected and even celebrated “is life altering,” said Kaplan, with OutrightVT. “It really is life changing.”

An ‘innermost sense of belonging’
The way Kaplan sees it, support for trans and queer youth that isn’t so explicitly medical is also crucial care. “There’s a continuous barrage of messages that target LGBTQ youth, telling them that they’re not valued, cared for, allowed to exist,” he said.
That support includes events like Outright’s summer camp and Friday night social support group, which aim to help kids connect both with their peers and with themselves, Kaplan said. Or the support could be information like resource toolkits for parents and family members or peer groups like a Gay-Straight Alliance club at school.  
“What we’re trying to do is really take that narrative (of difference) and say who you are is a superpower,” said Kaplan. “Through connecting to other people and realizing that there’s a larger community here and that there’s something joyful about being yourself.” 
Understanding their identity as a source of inner strength “creates a world of possibilities for young people,” he added. That sense of power and community can also be life-saving.
“Your innermost sense of belonging is the biggest predictor and a protective factor against suicide,” Kaplan said. 
Nationally, queer youth are four times more likely to to attempt suicide than their peers. In Vermont, 50% of trans youth and nonbinary people  “seriously considered” suicide in 2023, according to a 2024 survey by the Trevor Project, a percentage slightly higher than the national trend of 46%.
For Michelle and her daughter, those statistics hit particularly close to home. When her daughter was 16, she started experiencing chronic migraines that ultimately led her to shift to homeschooling.
“It was like a light went out, and she just started to get a headache that was just literally constant. Looking back, I know now it wasn’t just a typical migraine. It was a lot of internal stress that she wasn’t really able to express,” Michelle said of her daughter, who had not yet begun her transition at that time.
Nearly a year later, Michelle’s daughter attempted suicide. Soon after that, she raised the possibility of hormone replacement therapy to her mother.
“I obviously was all ears at that point,” Michelle said, describing still feeling raw from the experience of nearly losing her child. She doesn’t think that a person’s status as a minor should interfere with whether they can access gender-affirming care. 
“I’m not going to just say, ‘Well, I’m sorry, you’re 17’ and have her then go ahead and actually attempt suicide again and maybe possibly be successful in that attempt,” she said.
‘Room to do more’
Michelle’s daughter still struggles with her mental health and feelings of isolation here in Vermont but is buoyed by looking forward to her upcoming gender-affirming surgery next year, Michelle said.
As the family has settled into their new home, the harsh tenor of the national discussion about transgender people has only become more heightened. Michelle and her daughter both still feel a near-paralyzing anxiety over the rhetorical attacks on both trans children and adults. Many days, Michelle said, it keeps her daughter from leaving her room. 
Her daughter’s experience underscores a reality for many queer youth in Vermont, Kaplan said. Even though the state has strong laws and access to gender-affirming care and support, it can still be a lonely place to find yourself.
“In a rural state like Vermont or New Hampshire, isolation is a real thing. It can run really deep. It separates young people from each other, and it also makes it harder to access information and resources,” he said. 
“In Vermont, we are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place where there’s this sense of ‘Well, we’re so progressive. We are above and beyond so many other places. We’re not New Hampshire.’ I think that that can be a dangerous place for us to be,” he added. “There’s definitely room for us to do more.”

Those efforts to provide a deeper sense of belonging for queer youth in Vermont are currently overshadowed by the federal government’s efforts to limit access to gender-affirming care nationwide. Though care remains available, Vermont hospitals, clinics and providers are carefully tracking any proposed changes to federal regulations that might affect access and considering how to respond.
In spite of the challenges at the federal level, Michelle said she and her daughter have felt a broadly more welcoming atmosphere in the Green Mountain State. 
“It feels like there are more safe places in Vermont,” she said. “I’ve taken my daughter to have some piercings, and she felt incredibly welcome in the piercing studio. We went to have her first haircut in Vermont, and I literally took a huge sigh of relief when I walked into the stylist salon.” 
It was the first time she can remember that the place she was taking her daughter for a haircut felt completely safe, she said. “That’s really a simple thing for a parent, to be able to take your kids somewhere and get their hair cut.”

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Former Maine CDC director Nirav Shah joins governor’s race


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday October 20, 2025 10:50 am





The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

(Official U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention photo)The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”
Shah’s role with the U.S. CDC placed him as the agency’s second in command, but having been put in that position by the Biden administration, he returned to Maine after Trump was elected to his second term. Currently, Shah lives in Brunswick and works as a visiting professor at Colby College in Waterville. 
“The challenges facing our state require a leader with a different skill set to bring Mainers more than they have today,” Shah said. “I’ve run organizations with tens of thousands of employees and managed multi-billion dollar budgets by being curious, asking tough questions, and demanding accountability. As governor, I will run toward tough problems, not away from them.”
Shah became a household name during the pandemic, but he will face plenty of other candidates with name recognition in the Democratic gubernatorial primary next June. This includes current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, former head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future Hannah Pingree, as well as businessman Angus King III, son of Maine’s sitting U.S. senator. 
With outgoing Gov. Janet Mills termed out and looking to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the open governor’s seat is drawing candidates from a variety of backgrounds and political identities. Multiple current legislators have also thrown their hats into the ring, including Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford and Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland, who have both shed their former party affiliations to run as independents. 
Earlier this month, Jonathan Bush, the nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush announced his bid as a Republican candidate, joining more than a half dozen other candidates vying for the GOP nomination.

The American South has the highest HIV rates in the country, accounting for more than half of new HIV diagnoses nationwide in 2023. This is despite growing availability of a highly effective HIV prevention medication that has made it possible to live a long, healthy life with this once fatal disease.
This medication – called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP – reduces the risk of HIV transmission by over 99% when taken as prescribed. Yet, in Southern cities such as Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, one of the most vulnerable populations – Black men who have sex with men – are rarely using it, with fewer than 1 in 5 who are eligible taking the drug.
The Trump administration has previously frozen and proposed more cuts to HIV prevention programs in the U.S. And although the administration has restored some of the federal webpages and datasets it took down in January 2025, it is unclear what information remains missing or has changed. Communities in the South that already face the highest burden of infection will feel the greatest effects of changing public health priorities.
In my work as a public health researcher, I have spent years studying HIV prevention and the social determinants of health in the Deep South. Through interviews with health care providers and Black patients in major Southern cities, what I learned was that a powerful clash between culture and public health plays a significant role in why effective medical treatments are still failing to reach those who need it most. I call this tension the Southern paradox – where medical solutions exist but systemic forces block access.
The stories of these clinicians and patients in the South weren’t simply about a pill: They were about trust, identity, family and faith. And their words highlighted a complex web of emotions and experiences that often go unaddressed in standard health messaging.
 Southern culture and sexual health

In my recent study, I interviewed 12 people in Jackson, Memphis, New Orleans and Atlanta: eight Black men who have sex with men, along with four health care providers. Three of these providers also identified as men who have sex with men.
Many participants reported that physical access to PrEP wasn’t the issue. Instead, what stood in the way was far more personal and deeply embedded in their environment.
“In church, you’re taught to love your neighbor, but there’s always an asterisk when it comes to who you love,” one participant from Jackson told me. “If you’re gay, you’re either ignored or silently judged.”
Nearly all participants described the South as a place deeply shaped by conservative values, especially those rooted in religion and traditional family structures. The Black church emerged as both a protective factor and a challenge. While offering vital community support, it also often reinforced stigma around homosexuality and discouraged open conversations about sexual health.
One participant from New Orleans shared that he heard about PrEP from his health care provider and his friends, while another from Atlanta recalled learning about PrEP during his annual physical. Despite repeatedly being exposed to information about PrEP, both described hesitation about starting treatment. One worried about potential stigma if others discovered he was taking it, while the other questioned whether he “really needed” it. Ultimately, neither had started PrEP.
In many of these communities, sex education in schools is still focused on abstinence and often excludes LGBTQ+ topics entirely. “You grow up not hearing anything about gay sex or HIV,” one man from Memphis said. “So, when you get older, it’s like starting from scratch.”
Even decisions around condom use were heavily shaped by cultural norms. Men described relying on partner trust, age or perceived cleanliness rather than research-based ways to reduce the risk of HIV.
This absence of comprehensive, inclusive sex education leaves many vulnerable to misinformation and, ultimately, to preventable infections.
 Trust is the real barrier

One of the most striking findings from these conversations was the deep mistrust that many Black men who have sex with men feel toward the health care system.
“It’s hard to find affirming care for people in the queer community,” said one Memphis-based health provider. Others talked about fears of being “outed” through their insurance, especially if they were still on a family health plan.
A Jackson-based participant confided, “Some people avoid taking [PrEP] because for each prescription you are required to be evaluated. Some people don’t want the follow-up or the screening.” Another noted how fear of both outright and subtle judgment during medical appointments made it easier to avoid health care altogether.
Systemic racism compounds these concerns. For many Black men, historical and ongoing experiences of discrimination, including rushed visits, lack of empathy, misdiagnoses and even being denied care altogether have built a lasting sense of caution.
Even when resources like PrEP are available, these treatments often feel inaccessible to Black men because they do not trust the system offering them.
 Social networks step in

Thankfully, these conversations also uncovered moments of hope.
Many participants learned about PrEP from peers. “We talk about it regularly,” said one participant in Jackson. “I have friends who work in public health, along with friends who are taking the medication.”
In the South, where community ties often serve as critical safety nets, these social networks can sometimes provide more trusted health information than clinics or campaigns. Informal conversations in group chats, at house parties or during community gatherings often serve as powerful platforms for health promotion.
One provider in Atlanta said he intentionally shared his own experiences with PrEP to reduce stigma. “I have a little soreness,” he said with a smile, referring to a recent injection. “Then I tell everyone, ‘Yup, I just got mine.’ The casualness of that comment made a difference: It made PrEP feel normal, relatable, something for ‘us,’ not something done to ‘them.’”
These social exchanges, rooted in trust and shared experience, frequently did more to shift attitudes than traditional public health campaigns. As one participant put it, “I trust my friends more than those ads. If they’re taking it and it works for them, that means something to me.”
 Making PrEP culturally relevant

What these conversations show is that for PrEP to work in the South, access to treatment is only part of the equation. Building trust, cultural affirmation and community-led education are equally critical.
Public health messages that go beyond medical facts and address the emotional, spiritual and social dimensions of health are more likely to build lasting engagement with HIV prevention. This includes investing in Black, LGBTQ+-affirming health care providers who reflect the communities they serve. It also means integrating discussions of sexual health into everyday conversations at barbershops, churches and community centers, not just in clinics.
Public health officials and clinicians can explore alternative treatment delivery methods that address privacy concerns, such as telehealth PrEP programs, discreet mail-order services and community-based distribution points. These can make PrEP easier to access and reduce the stigma associated with clinic visits.
Most importantly, valuing the knowledge already circulating within communities and supporting peer educators as legitimate public health messengers can strengthen credibility, normalize PrEP and empower people to take charge of their health.
In the battle against HIV in the South, culture is not just a barrier. It can also be the solution. I believe that when care is offered in a way that honors people’s identities, experiences and values, it becomes not just accessible but empowering.

Singing songs and carrying signs, rally goers gathered in Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie, Lander, Cody, Torrington, Pinedale, Gillette, Worland, Sheridan, Rock Springs and Jackson in crowds some estimated to be as large as 500 or so. The protesters challenged what they see as Trump’s consolidation of power, erosion of democratic checks and balances, and authoritarian acts.
“No kings! No kings!” many chanted, some recalling the land’s last king — George III — and the 1776 revolution that showed him the door.

Little Snake River Valley folk traveled from Baggs to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, to join a mile-long line of protesters, according to a post on the Wyoming Democratic Party’s Facebook page. A social media post from Riverside, population 66, showed four protesters — some 6% of the inhabitants, not counting the photographer.
Signs ran the gamut.
“Love everyone, save our democracy.” “ The only orange monarch we want is a butterfly.” “I heart America.” “Stop pretending your racism is patriotism.” “Don’t tread on our democracy.” “Hate will never make America great.” “No faux-king way.”
In Jackson, Jenny Landgraf’s inflatable costume had her riding a giant chicken while she carried a sign, “A president most fowl.” Other inflatable costumes, apparently intended to counter notions that the gatherings might be riotous, included dinosaurs, cartoon characters, frogs, a raccoon and a person in a pickle suit.
“We are in a pickle,” read their sign.

A large inflatable red Jeff Koons balloon dog carried a placard declaring “Nobody is eating the dogs,” pushing back against Trump’s claim that Haitian immigrants were eating pets. 
On the contrary
On Thursday before the rallies, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso called the planned protests “radical” and “anti-American.” He spoke in the Senate.
Democrats are beholden to far-left activist groups with names like “hashtag resist Trump” and “American Atheists,” he said. “All will be calling on the Democrats to keep the government closed.”

Barrasso echoed House Speaker Mike Johnson, saying some are calling the protests “I hate America” rallies.
“On the contrary,” said former Wyoming Rep. Andy Schwartz of Teton County. “I saw people loving America and showing their commitment to the ideals established 250 years ago.”
He carried a sign near Jackson’s elk-antler arches that read “We the people,” and was decorated with American flags.
“It’s not perfect,” Schwartz said of the country’s record of achieving its ideals, “but we are getting a glimpse of what an alternative looks like.”
Fox News reported roughly 2,500 protests across the country with only a few arrests. Organizers estimated 7 million people rallied nationwide. Strength in Numbers, an independent data-driven political-analysis Substack column, calculated a median number of participants at 5.2 million with a high estimate of 8.2 million.
Author G. Elliott Morris headlined his conclusion that the No Kings Day saw “the largest single-day political protest ever.*” The asterisk notes that 1970s Earth Day events, not necessarily political and arranged much further in advance than No Kings, had more participants.

Sally Martyn Lacy of Jericho, Vermont, died on October 17th at the age of 97. Born in Cleveland Ohio to Herbert Vivian Martyn and Frances Dunham Martyn, Sally soon demonstrated her innate curiosity for plants and animals, riding her beloved horse Lucky, and drawing and making notations about what she saw in nature. Even with that love of the outdoors, she treasured the family lace and china left to her by British and Welsh ancestors.
Sally attended Wellesley (B.A.) and Harvard (M.Ed) and in 1955 married MIT man Thomas Bowditch Lacy. They raised their family and many pets in Brookside, New Jersey. Sally briefly worked as a special education teacher but her true callings were as animal portrait artist and advocate for working border collies. In addition to commissioned animal portraits, her pastels of the first giant panda pair from China at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in 1972 were shown in New York galleries.
Her love of equestrian dressage began in New Jersey when she acquired a frisky thoroughbred horse. Sally was also active in the League of Women Voters and was the local grammarian and unofficial wildlife rescue center. 
Her first border collie Keswick inspired Sally’s 70-year commitment to the breed. She was drawn to Scotland to study the intelligence and instinct of working border collies and their relationship with their shepherds. When Tom’s job transferred to southern Ohio, they bought enough land to keep sheep and put the dogs to work. Sally became a skilled dog handler and ably competed in sheepdog trials throughout the U.S. and Canada. She was the first woman to compete against men in the United States Border Collie Handlers Association (USBCHA) National Finals. 
Sally chaired the genetics committee of The New England Border Collie Association (NEBCA) and coordinated countless clinics to screen potential breeding dogs for Collie Eye Anomaly. Dedicated to breeding based on herding instinct and talent rather than on a physical standard, Sally unsuccessfully campaigned to stop the American Kennel Club (AKC) from recognizing the breed.
Sally and Tom retired to Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire, where she continued to breed sheep and border collies with an eye towards building her success on the trial field. She supported many novice handlers by sponsoring training clinics with Scottish herding masters and still managed to marry farm life with really good tea, NPR, twice-cooked Scottish oatmeal, and visits to the Boston Symphony. 
After Tom’s death, Sally moved to Jericho Vermont, where, at 86, she traded in her large dog-trial-ready RV camper for a Connemara pony named Hope. She credited Hope for her recovery from a serious stroke in 2021. In 2022, with a combined age of 115, Sally and Hope completed the Century Club Ride, a judged dressage test for owner-horse pairs whose combined ages surpass 100. With concerns for her pony’s future, she donated Hope to a children’s riding academy in southern Vermont, and had one last ride on her 95th birthday. 
Sally is predeceased by husband Thomas Bowditch Lacy, brother William Dunham Martyn, and nephews David Lacy and Peter Martyn. She is survived by her children Charles Martyn Lacy (Gaye Symington), Paul Matthews Lacy, Kathryn Lacy Marshall (David Marshall); grandchildren Emily Marshall (Will Matthews), Samuel Lacy (Carmen Lacy), Mary Lacy (Paul Coyne), Benjamin Marshall (Sarah Sandhaus), and Thomas Lacy of Jericho; great-grandchild Parker Marshall; numerous nieces and nephews, and her close friend and co-adventurer, Lorna McMaster.
Sally also leaves behind many friends and admirers from Westford and Colchester stables and her Jericho Center, West Bolton, and Underhill community.  Over the past summer and fall, Jean, Bradlee, Margot, Bernie and Maeve, Kellianna, Faith, Jen, Katie, Patty and many others emailed and visited her, sharing with her their observations, photographs and poetry describing bees, insects, birds, deer, flowers, and other wonders from the wetlands, woods, gardens, and trails they were exploring. Sally so appreciated seeing that familiar natural world through their eyes.
In addition to friends and neighbors, the Lacy family appreciates the care and support provided by Dr. Marie Sandoval and the skilled and caring staff at Home Care Assistance of Vermont, Mansfield Place in Essex, and UVM Home Health and Hospice.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Katie Batza’s first memory of HIV and AIDS was as a pre-teen church volunteer helping her mother deliver Meals on Wheels to a man facing death.
She was 11 years old and her politically conservative Catholic mother was dedicated to making certain those struck by the pandemic were treated with kindness, empathy and love.
HIV and AIDS, first recognized in the early 1980s, emerged as a lethal disease most commonly contracted by men having sex or addicts sharing needles to do drugs. The disease’s learning curve meant it was common for people to mistakenly believe the virus could be contracted by touch. Doctors and nurses were scared to treat the sick. The general public was profoundly alarmed. In partisan circles, AIDS was a vehicle of political attack.



“We were in charge of visiting this young man with HIV, who was in hospice,” Batza said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “My mom really wanted to make sure … that the person felt like we weren’t afraid of him, that we could be friends with him. To try and be gentle to him in the final, you know, weeks and months of his life.”
She put aside medical trappings of a life ebbing away, and would sit with him, play Legos and chat.
“I learned that his family wasn’t speaking to him and he was relying on people like my mom to kind of help him in the final weeks,” Batza said. “It was a formative memory for sure.”
Afterward, she found reason to explore shelves of the library to learn about LGBTQ+ history. She was deeply disappointed by the lean offerings.
“In that moment, I thought, ‘This isn’t right. This isn’t good. I need to figure out how to fill this bookshelf,'” Batza said.
 
Heartland answers
Decades later, Batza has become a researcher, writer and teacher on the history of this breathtaking disease estimated to have taken more than 40 million lives worldwide so far.
Batza, associate professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at University of Kansas, recently published “AIDS in the Heartland: How Unlikely Coalitions Created a Blueprint for LGBTQ Politics.” It explores the pandemic from perspectives of family, friends and others who grappled with AIDS far from population epicenters for the disease in San Francisco or New York City.
Library shelves aren’t as bare as they once were, but Batza said there was a need to help fill gaps in medical, religious, social, economic and political history of AIDS in the heartland.
“Even historians who study HIV and AIDS, they kind of gloss over the middle part of the country as a place that was really not impacted,” Batza said. “That does a huge disservice for the history that is here, as well as the people that are here fighting to make sure that the AIDS epidemic doesn’t kind of rear its ugly head again.”
For the book, she was able to draw upon oral histories, interviews and archived material at KU.
She discovered religious organizations were key in regions of the country that didn’t have a large social safety net to serve the mostly gay men struck down by HIV and AIDS. Grassroots systems did emerge in Kansas and elsewhere, she said.
“There were several of the people that I interviewed for this book who said without religious organizations there would not have been a response to HIV in this region,” she said. “Churches, synagogues, convents, these are all places that kind of had resources, whether it’s church vans or extra rooms in the convent.”
In Topeka, Westboro Baptist Church led by the late Rev. Fred Phelps offered Kansas a unique and tragic response. Phelps’ followers picketed funerals of people suspected of dying of AIDS. They sang abusive songs, hoisted disrespectful signs and stomped on the U.S. flag. Their funeral picketing was challenged in court and declared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Some of Fred Phelps’ people still kind of haunt the hills of Kansas,” Batza said.
She said Wesboro’s confrontational style fostered the formation of unlikely coalitions in the Midwest.
“You saw drag queens and motorcyclists kind of use their motorcycle engines to rev out the noise and drag queens would make these elaborate costumes with big wings to visually block off the protesters,” Batza said.
 
Hearts and minds
She said in less densely populated areas of the country there was cross-pollination of activists. In some instances, the same people in a community were involved with a series of health care, housing, transportation or religious organizations. It was amazing to seek how personal connections created a holistic approach to the HIV and AIDS crisis that wasn’t matched in bigger cities, she said.
In terms of heartland medical care for people with HIV or AIDS, there was no mirroring New York City or San Francisco where wings of hospitals were devoted to this pandemic.
Kansas did have Donna Sweet, a renowned Wichita physician who in the early 1980s was one of the first doctors in Kansas to treat patients with HIV and AIDS.
She cared for patients all over the state and led initiatives to educate others about a disease that has been transformed over the decades from an almost certain death to a preventable disease that also can be treated as a chronic health condition.
“She would literally work with farmers to find crop dusters who could pick her up and take her to farms and fields so that neighbors didn’t necessarily have to know what was happening,” Batza said. “She really did the work of changing the hearts and minds of people, you know, one person at a time. I think that kind of really grassroots effort of educating can’t be overstated.”
 
Politicized immediately
Batza, who is in her 12th year at KU, said this generation of college students know what a pandemic looks like after experiencing COVID-19. But many students have shared their dismay at hostility directed at people suffering HIV or AIDS, she said.
It can be difficult to contemplate that men and women with such a debilitating disease were abandoned by their families and friends or that hospital personnel were afraid to touch them or deliver food to them.
“It’s really a big ask for them to grasp the full scope of the early HIV-AIDS crisis,” she said. “They did not comprehend the extent of the stigma and the fact that people could get kicked out of their jobs and houses.”
In hindsight, it was inevitable HIV and AIDS would be political dynamite.
“An epidemic of any kind becomes politicized almost immediately,” she said. “Deploying shame as a political tactic … was pretty helpful for some people who were in politics at the time. But as a public health strategy, obviously, it’s proven to have failed several times over, because in ostracizing people, you’re not willing to talk about how transmission happens, how to prevent it from spreading to more people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Katie-Batza-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:16:55.344214

(Steph Quinn | Missouri Independent)Missouri has lost nearly 1.6 million pounds of food aid since May due to sudden cuts to a federal program that buys food from U.S. farmers and sends it to food banks across the country.
That’s 146,400 pounds of cheese, 433,070 pounds of canned and frozen chicken, 1.2 million eggs, 38,250 gallons of milk, 120,000 pounds of pulled pork, 115,200 pounds of sliced turkey breast, 180,000 pounds of dried plums and 114,000 pounds of frozen pork chops.
The Trump administration in late March slashed $500 million that had already been allocated to food aid nationwide through The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP. That canceled 124 scheduled deliveries to Missouri food banks, according to data obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture by ProPublica and shared with The Independent.
Food banks across the state said they have largely made up shortfalls from the March cuts by increasing their food purchases. But some food bank leaders worry that hunger in Missouri will increase with the implementation of changes signed into law this summer to federal assistance programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“Food banks are the safety net to the safety net,” said Leigh Anne Haun, executive director of Feeding Missouri, a coalition of the state’s six regional food banks. “When you talk about programs like SNAP…any time those start to get strained, or there’s holes in those nets, the food banks are the safety net underneath.”
They are also bracing for increased demand as the federal government shutdown wears on. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned Thursday that SNAP will run out of funds in two weeks if the shutdown continues, and USDA has directed regional SNAP directors to stop working on benefits for November, according to an Oct. 10 letter obtained by Politico.
Meredith Knopp, president and CEO of the St. Louis Area Foodbank, said any disruption the food bank experienced due to canceled deliveries was “minimal,” and that the tornado that hit St. Louis in May and the ongoing shutdown have affected the food bank more.
“Right now it’s just about educating and informing people where they can go for help, how they can get assistance temporarily until the government reopens,” Knopp said of the shutdown.
Knopp said purchases made by the USDA later in the year made up for canceled TEFAP deliveries. On Aug. 1, the USDA announced the purchase of $230 million in fish, dried cranberries, beans and apples for food banks nationwide.

The canceled shipments make up a relatively small portion of what Missouri food banks distribute each year. Missouri’s food banks dispensed 132.2 million pounds of food in 2023, according to the Missouri Hunger Atlas, which is published by the Interdisciplinary Center for Food Security at the University of Missouri.
But Jordan Browning, director of communications for Ozarks Food Harvest in Springfield, said food banks still have to fill in gaps.
The first canceled shipments – over 100 orders of 2% milk headed for 30 states – were scheduled to arrive on May 14, records show. That day, Ozarks Food Harvest and the St. Louis Area Food Bank in Bridgeton were each slated to receive orders of more than 2,000 gallons of milk, according to the records.
At first, Browning said, he thought the deliveries might just be delayed, which had happened in the past.
The next missed delivery date in Missouri was May 31, when all six of the state’s regional food banks were scheduled to receive shipments, according to the records. 
“They kept getting delayed further and further,” Browning said. “Pretty much until it finally came to an actual cancellation notice, we weren’t aware that we would have to make up a shortfall.”
Much of the food was high quality protein, the items that are priciest and hardest for food banks to source, food bank administrators said.
The Southeast Missouri Food Bank received all the orders staff were told to expect, according to Heather Collier, donor relations and communications manager at the Sikeston-based food bank, though some were delayed.
But Collier said shipments can be canceled before the state notifies regional food banks that they should expect a delivery. 
“Canceled loads, if they’re fully canceled, they’re usually happening before we’re even notified,” Collier said.
Collier said that although the food bank weathered the March cuts relatively easily, she expects coming changes to SNAP to increase the number of Missourians who don’t qualify for federal assistance but struggle to reliably access nutritious food.
The budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress in July cuts SNAP by $187 billion through 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill also expands SNAP work requirements to include adults ages 55-64 and parents of children over 14. 
In the Southeast Missouri Food Bank’s service area, according to Collier, 46.5% of people who are food insecure already do not qualify for SNAP.
“You’re meeting the definition of food insecurity, but not meeting the qualifications to receive assistance,” Collier said. “Food banks are going to have to make that up.”
Haun said community support will enable food banks to continue helping Missourians in need.
“It’s so important for people to connect with their local food bank now,” Haun said. “They need not just funds to allow them to address these gaps, but other types of donations and volunteering.”
Through the shutdown and any future challenges, Knopp was confident the food bank would continue to help.
“It might not always be smooth sailing,” Knopp said. “It might be clunky. But we’re here, and we will be here to support anyone who needs us.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3142-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 10:16:55.344214

In March, $500 million was cut in funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that provides food to food banks and other emergency food providers through The Emergency Food Assistance Program, another Department of Agriculture program. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data obtained by ProPublica, this meant that around 94 million pounds of food never reached those food banks. 
For some Michigan groups, especially those that faced greater losses, these cuts have made it more difficult to continue to serve their communities.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Annmarie Zaremba, the Director of Food Sourcing at Forgotten Harvest in Oak Park, said that her organization had lost about $750,000 worth of food in these cancelled deliveries. Much of that was protein like chicken and pork — food items that other donations tend not to include, but that are important for recipients to have in their diets. 
“Our goal is always to give a variety of foods to try to create as much balance distribution as we can,” she said. “For the protein that we do have in inventory, we are being very methodical about it. We have a shipping plan for our protein so that people do get something, it might not be a frozen protein every time, it might be a bean item, and then the next distribution will switch to maybe a frozen chicken item or something like that.”
Not all of the federal support for Forgotten Harvest comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation, and other programs are still providing assistance. 
“We are able to make up some of it,” Zaremba said. “It is getting harder and harder, though, without getting really creative.”
Gleaners Community Food Bank in Detroit noted that, across all USDA programs, they received 5.1 million pounds less in USDA-donated food in fiscal year 2025 than the year before. 
“Additionally, with 75% of our food going out through our partner network, Gleaners invested our own reserves to purchase over 700,000 pounds of food to help our partner network access food that was not donated,” Kristin Sokul, Senior Director of Advancement at Gleaners, wrote in an email. “While we have been able to meet requests for support as they have been presented to us from partners and community, and we’re still finalizing our fiscal year 2025 numbers, we expect that we will deliver fewer total pounds this fiscal year than we originally projected in our fiscal year 2025 budget.”

https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Recording-2025-10-17-at-11.52.26 AM.mp4
Notification of these changes also caught some organizations by surprise. 
“It happened pretty quickly,” Zaremba said. “We had probably a month or so where there was some uncertainty for a while, and then we did get final notification that all of these loads had been canceled and they wouldn’t be replaced.”
Going forward, organizations like Gleaners are having to develop new strategies for allocating food for distribution. 
“To safeguard continued access to nutritious food for our guests for years to come, we have created a Sustainability Plan to invest reserves into innovation and sustainability, increase fundraising efforts, and regularly evaluate expenses for efficiency,” Sokul wrote. “Gleaners remains focused on achieving a hunger-free community in Southeast Michigan with collaborative solutions that empower people and enable them to thrive.”
Michigan Democrats in both houses of Congress sent letters to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in the spring, expressing concerns about these funding cuts and how they would impact emergency food assistance programs. 
U.S. Reps Rashida Tlaib, Haley Stevens, Shri Thanedar, Debbie Dingell and Kristen McDonald Rivet all signed the letter from members of the House of Representatives, while Sen. Elissa Slotkin signed the version coming from the Senate.
But for other groups, the cuts were less pronounced — some fluctuations in deliveries are normal, according to Ed Scott, Director of Macomb Community Action, and occasional cancellations or substitutions are normal. Macomb Community Action had over 4,700 deliveries cancelled, according to the Department of Agriculture data.
“TEFAP (The Emergency Food Assistance Program) is a federally managed program that relies on a variety of factors, including supply chain logistics, product availability, vendor capacity, and federal contracting procedures,” Scott added. “As such, it is not uncommon for certain food items to be delayed, substituted, or canceled altogether. These changes are often beyond the control of local agencies and are part of the broader effort to ensure food safety, quality, and responsible stewardship of federal resources.”
A spokesperson for the Mid-Michigan Community Action Agency wrote, “at this time, our food programs are operating normally,” while spokespeople for Samaritas and Kent County Community Action noted that they had not experienced any cuts or cancellations.
The Department of Agriculture declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in federal court against the agency in June over funding cuts to food aid programs.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-20 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,One of most vulnerable states to climate change lacks ‘political will’ to mitigate its disaster threats,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/20/one-of-most-vulnerable-states-to-climate-change-lacks-political-will-to-mitigate-disaster-threats/,"While research suggests Mississippi is as vulnerable to climate change as anywhere in the country, state leadership has failed to embrace mitigation over the last two decades.","FLOWOOD – On the eve of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, members of the Mississippi Building Code Council sat befuddled inside a conference room a stone’s throw from the Jackson airport. 
The council’s leaders agree Mississippi would benefit from a statewide, uniform building code – a policy experts widely believe improves an area’s chances of surviving destructive weather. By lowering risk, strengthening buildings also helps against rising insurance rates. 
“It’s kind of like the three little pigs: You want the straw, the sticks or the brick?” said Jennifer Hall, vice president of the council. “I want the brick.” 
But the Legislature, the council also agreed, has no interest in expanding regulations. If anything, lawmakers are more interested in weakening what rules are in place. 
“There is a movement at the Capitol right now to do away with regulations,” Hall said at the meeting. 
After seeing the impact Katrina had on weaker homes and businesses in 2005, lawmakers in 2014 passed a statewide building code, requiring construction to meet modern standards. But the 2014 law included a key caveat: Within four months of the new regulation going into effect, any city or county could vote to opt out. As it turned out, most did just that. 
Resilience experts, public officials and coastal residents who talked to Mississippi Today pointed to crucial policies to enhance local fortitude against future disasters: funding for mitigation and strong building codes. Yet while research suggests Mississippi is as vulnerable to climate change as anywhere in the country, state leadership has failed to embrace either strategy over the last two decades. 
“Mississippi has had the opportunity to do this for years,” said Julie Shiyou-Woodard, president of Smart Home America and a Pass Christian native. “Sadly, it’s going to show. The choices we made in Mississippi after Katrina, you will see that when we get hit with a direct category 3 (hurricane) again. It will be clear.”

‘A silly question, Senator’
Mike Chaney, a Republican who has been the state’s insurance commissioner since early 2008, estimated that two-thirds of Mississippi’s counties opted out of the 2014 building code standards. Now, just about half of the state has “fairly decent” codes, Chaney said. The lower six counties– including three that touch the Coast – adopted codes shortly after Katrina, although most are now outdated, a federal database shows. The many places in the state without codes altogether are going to “hurt in the long run,” Chaney said.
Hall, who is also executive director of the Mississippi Manufactured Housing Association, said “the only way” lawmakers could have passed the 2014 bill was to allow cities and counties to opt out.
Mississippi Today reached out to several government agencies and organizations, and no one in the state, it appeared, tracked which areas have what building codes. The 2014 law gave no one the authority to actually enforce the codes it put into place, Hall said. In other words, there’s no accountability at the state level, even for the cities and counties that didn’t opt out in 2014.
Last year, the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety ranked Mississippi’s codes near the bottom among coastal states. The impact a lack of codes has on life-safety and property damage “has unfortunately been exposed in recent tornado outbreaks” in the state and “would be exploited in a hurricane impact,” the report said. 
Over the last decade, tornadoes, strong winds and thunderstorms have directly killed 67 people in Mississippi, national storm data show. Also, including hurricanes, those storms have caused over $740 million in property damage in that time.

Disaster and insurance experts also point to mitigation grants as a necessary step toward local resilience. Alabama, Louisiana and other states have launched grant programs to help homeowners in high-risk areas pay for improvements that are often cost-prohibitive otherwise. 
The Mississippi Insurance Department first established its home mitigation program in 2007, but it didn’t receive funding from the state until 2024 when lawmakers set aside $5 million for the department to do a test run. 
With grants up to $10,000, the program paid to upgrade and strap roofs onto homes – protecting against high winds and water leaks – as well as for shutters to guard windows. After slowly rolling out the program, which Chaney said was done to avoid mishaps, the state funded improvements to 28 homes. 
In a dispute that played out in news stories and on social media over the summer, legislators were critical of the department’s ability to run the program. Particularly, Sen. Scott DeLano, a Biloxi Republican, said he disagreed with Chaney’s approach. 
DeLano and other lawmakers slammed the Insurance Department for only doing 28 homes, said Chaney provided scant details about how the program would run, and argued the program should go through an independent contractor. 
As a result, the Legislature omitted funding for the program this past session, and killed a bill that would have paid for the grants through fees from insurance companies. Republican Sen. Walter Michel of Ridgeland presented the bill on Chaney’s behalf.

Some of the criticisms about the pilot fell flat, Mississippi Today found. For instance, DeLano and others pointed to the success story in Alabama – which leads the nation with over 51,000 “FORTIFIED” homes – and said Mississippi should mimic its neighbor to the east. But the Alabama Department of Insurance told Mississippi Today that its program is run almost entirely in-house. 
Chaney’s office pushed back on criticism over the results of its pilot program, arguing it executed more grants than other states in its first year. 
At a Senate committee meeting in January, DeLano criticized Chaney, who was sitting a few feet away, for not also requiring counties to have up-to-date building codes before residents could receive a grant. Doing so would attract more insurance companies into the state, the senator said. 
 After Chaney said he would only support the idea in a separate bill, DeLano fired back: 
“Are you really for mitigation then?” 
“That’s a silly question, Senator,” Chaney responded. 
Responding to Mississippi Today about the exchange, Chaney’s office said requiring a county to have certain building codes would only hold up mitigation progress. 
The two elected officials agreed about the importance of a mitigation program, but each side accused the other of not playing ball. DeLano said Chaney hasn’t provided details of his proposal, and Chaney said DeLano wouldn’t meet with him to discuss the proposal. 
Multiple people told Mississippi Today the distrust between the two sides traces back to 2016, when the state nearly lost $30 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds meant for retrofitting 2,000 homes on the Coast. An Office of Inspector General report recommended FEMA suspend the program after finding the state had spent over $30 million and did work on only 945 homes.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency fired the employees it claimed were responsible for the blunder. The agency eventually resumed the program and ended up with $19 million in federal funds, it told Mississippi Today. 
But Rep. Kevin Ford, a Republican from Vicksburg, said lawmakers still have a “bad taste in their mouth.” When asked if the earlier scandal is why the Legislature hasn’t funded the program for roughly a decade, Ford said, “Yes, 100%. There’s no doubt.”
“What it sounds like to me is there is a trust issue,” said Chris Monforton, CEO of Habitat for Humanity of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, referencing the OIG report. Monforton, who worked with the insurance department to start its pilot program, said the pilot was “very similar” to how Alabama established its mitigation grants. 
When asked about the issues from 2016, DeLano didn’t go so far as to tie it to his disagreement with Chaney, but said “we know the history of mitigation programs in our state.” 
Ford, who wrote a competing mitigation bill in the House this past session, argued that Chaney as an elected official shouldn’t have control over the millions of dollars that would fund the program, suggesting the money could be tilted towards potential voters. 
Chaney strongly disagreed with using an outside company to run the program, arguing a contractor would be more expensive and not subject to the same oversight as the insurance department. Both Ford and Michel said they would reintroduce their bills in the 2026 legislative session, and it’s unclear if either side is willing to compromise.
Rep. Jerry Turner, a Republican from Baldwyn, is the House Insurance Committee chairman and has served at the Capitol since 2004. When asked why it took 17 years for the state to fund a mitigation program, Turner said, “I’m not trying to dodge a bullet or pass a buck, but I think you’d be better served if you talked to the people on the Coast and the insurance (department).”
“I’m not siding either way,” he added. “ I’ll do anything I can to get this thing started off because I think it’s something that the citizens of the state of Mississippi deserve.”
‘The market will collapse’
The parallel rise of disaster risks and insurance costs in the nation’s poorest state begs the question: What will happen if neither trend slows down?
Chip Merlin, an attorney who specializes in insurance claims for homeowners and who worked with Mississippians after Katrina, said eventually communities will have to migrate.
“I think we’re starting to see it already,” Merlin said, pointing to parts of California and Florida that have seen residents leave because of climate risk. “There’s an emotional aspect of once your home gets damaged by flood, wind, wildfire, that I don’t want to be in harm’s way anymore. And people look for a place where it’s less emotionally taxing to live.”

David Baria, a Democratic former state lawmaker from the Coast, said he ran for office in 2007 largely because of the local issues with insurance he witnessed after Katrina. 
Baria called it “a slog” to get any kind of insurance reform passed. He introduced bills in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to fund a mitigation grant program. None made it out of committee. 
“ There were many bills that I attempted to pass to rein in insurance company practices to improve the lot of homeowners, to strengthen structures, and they were routinely opposed by the insurance industry and the leadership of both the Senate and the House,” said Baria, who served in both chambers. 
Both Merlin and Baria criticized Mississippi leadership for not better protecting policyholders, especially around delaying or denying claims after a disaster. 
In 2024, a New York Times analysis of an insurance study looked at which parts of the country pay the most in home policy premiums relative to their house’s value. The analysis found that, throughout Mississippi, that ratio was “much higher” than the national average.  
Smart Home America, a nonprofit based in Mobile, Alabama, has helped strengthen homes and design policy in over 20 states. Shiyou-Woodard, its president and CEO, said she “worked closely” with Chaney’s office to kickstart Mississippi’s mitigation program, and it was on the right track until the Legislature cut its funding.

While policy around mitigation can face obstacles, such as building contractors not wanting to deal with the extra cost of complying with new codes, Mississippi’s lack of local resilience comes down to those in the Capitol, she said. 
“Mississippi is a black hole,” Shiyou-Woodard said, explaining that its neighboring states are ahead of the game. “Why is it not catching up? There should be no reason. It has the same risk as Louisiana, the same risk as Alabama, what’s the problem? The problem in Mississippi has been political will.”
When asked what would happen if the state doesn’t act to lower the risk for homeowners, she pointed to Louisiana, which has only recently seen insurance improvements after a slew of companies pulled out due to frequent disasters. 
“When Mississippi gets hit with a significant wind event, the market will most likely collapse,” she said. “And that’s not fortune telling. That’s just based on the market, and they’re not getting ahead of it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07145917/MT-ClimateSeries-Beach-Banner.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:16:55.344214

Campbell settled nearly all the evictions filed between 2010 and 2018 outside of court, or judges had them dismissed. Yet, they still appear when searching her name in the Richland County court system.

“Here I am after years and years and years, and you’re still holding this on me,” Campbell told the SC Daily Gazette.
A bipartisan bill proposed in the House would require the state to remove from public access after 30 days any eviction filings that do not result in an actual court order telling the tenant to get out. Any cases that did result in an eviction order from a judge or were settled in court would be removed from public view after six years under the proposal.
That would wipe Campbell’s record clean.
The 41-year-old mother of four received two court-ordered evictions, also called writs of ejectment, within three months of each other in 2016, according to court records. Another seven are listed as settled, dismissed or disposed.
None of the filings, including the two court orders, resulted in Campbell actually getting kicked out of her home, she said.
Still, the long list of cases that pops up anytime someone searches Campbell’s name in the Richland County court filing system “looks so very ugly,” she said.
South Carolina appeared to have among the highest rates of eviction filings in the country in 2018, with about 23 of every 100 renters having an eviction filed against them, according to the most recent available data from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University.
Comparisons are hard to draw because different states, and even different counties within states, handle eviction cases in different ways, Stateline has reported.
South Carolina’s data, released after the state NAACP settled a lawsuit over the use of automated technology to collect eviction data, doesn’t include outcomes for those cases.
In 2024, more than 126,000 South Carolina renters had some sort of eviction filed against them in court, meaning they might face difficulty in renting in the future, according to the Legal Services Corporation’s Civil Court Data Initiative.
Lack of eviction data obscures extent of the affordable housing crisis

As costs continue to rise, paying rent each month is becoming increasingly difficult for many people, said Rev. Carey A. Grady, pastor of Reid Chapel AME Church in Columbia and an advocate for affordable housing.
Landlords may use a filing to put pressure on tenants to pay their rent, even if they have no intention of actually kicking them out of the property, Grady said.
“One filing can haunt you and your family for the rest of your life,” Grady said.
An eviction can be devastating, whether or not the landlord follows through on it, said Mary Ann Fey, pastor at St. John Neumann Catholic Church and a board member for advocacy group MORE Justice, which is short for Midlands Organized Response for Equity and Justice.
A blighted record can mean people have no place to go, continuing a cycle of hardship, she said.
Access to housing has remained a top concern of Richland County residents since the group formed a decade ago and began holding annual community meetings, Fey said.
“Housing is foundational,” Fey said. “When families can not access it, everything else — employment, education, health — becomes harder, and especially harder on children.”
People who have managed to turn their lives around shouldn’t stay beholden to the struggles they faced previously, Fey said.
“This bill does not erase accountability,” Fey said. “Instead, it ensures that the records relied on in making housing decisions are accurate, timely and truly reflective of a person’s current situation.”
Many filings don’t result in actual evictions, and even if they do, they may not reflect a person’s current economic status, said Rep. Carla Schuessler, the bill’s primary sponsor.
Unlike certain criminal charges and bankruptcies, which can be expunged, eviction filings stay with a person forever, often preventing them from finding stable housing in the future, even if they can pay rent, the Myrtle Beach Republican said.

As a former executive director of Horry County’s Habitat for Humanity, Schuessler worked with people who struggled to find housing they could afford because of bad credit histories or eviction records, she said. Removing some of those records could help get more people into homes, she said.
“There’s so much conversation with the housing market and affordable housing and workforce housing and inflation,” Schuessler said. “This is something we can do to help South Carolinians to better their lives.”
Nonpayment isn’t the only reason landlords might file an eviction, which costs $40 and requires little effort on their part, said Sue Berkowitz, director of Appleseed Legal Justice Center, which helped craft the bill.
People who live paycheck to paycheck may consistently pay late because their income doesn’t come in by the first of the month, or a landlord may file an eviction for a different lease violation, such as an extra person staying in the property, Berkowitz said.
She thinks the legislation should be altered to erase eviction records from public scrutiny sooner: three years, instead of six.
A person’s life can drastically change over six years, she said.
“Look back at how your life was six years ago, and it might be very different now,” Berkowitz said.
After several years of financial and personal hardship that led to the eviction filings against her, Campbell is back in stable housing, she said.

She works as a court mediator, helping other people settle disputes, including about evictions, and advocates with MORE Justice. She wants to raise awareness of the eviction process, making sure people know how to look up their own legal histories and what to do if their landlord files an eviction notice.
Arguing against eviction proceedings can be a stressful and time-consuming process that often involves missing work, and judges make default rulings in favor of landlords if tenants don’t show up, Campbell said.
On top of the difficulty in finding housing, an eviction record can take an emotional toll, Campbell said.
She often feels like a failure for the times in her life when she struggled to support her four children, two of whom are in college and two of whom are in elementary school.
She shares a Columbia apartment with her mother, and though the two remain mostly independent, Campbell wishes she could find her own place, she said.
Removing her eviction records could help with that, she said.
“I think just having this bill is a start,” Campbell said. “It’s a start at some change.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4658-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

As we brace with hope, relief and caution for the ceasefire to hold and the Israeli assault on Palestinian people to scale back, there is still a long road to Palestinian rights and wellbeing. The board and management at the Wedge — a 50-year-old food cooperative known for its commitment to food justice, equity, community, and democratic member-ownership — needs to realign with its values, its staff, and hundreds of its members and revoke the policy change they made to censor workers who wore pins in solidarity with Palestinians.  
In March, Wedge management issued a revised dress code prohibiting staff from wearing messages referencing values or causes not explicitly supported by the co-op. This occurred after a small group of Wedge member-owners attended the February board meeting to express disapproval of workers wearing pins that said “Labor for Palestine.”  
As Wedge member-owners and as Jews who oppose the occupation, we believe it is our moral and religious obligation to stand up for human and civil rights and support the workers, at both Lyndale and Linden Hills Wedge locations, who continue to risk their livelihoods by persistently and boldly advocating for their right to free expression and protest the ongoing suffering in Gaza.
Gazans have been starved. According to the UN, just 1.5% of arable land remains accessible or undamaged; the workers’ pins are clearly in alignment with Wedge values, which include food justice. Moreover, we find it unacceptable for any so-called progressive institution — particularly in this moment of extreme national repression — to censure objections to what numerous international and even Israeli organizations have deemed a genocide.  
So, in April, in response to this policy change, over 100 member-owners, many of us Jewish, attended a board meeting to challenge the dress code change and support workers who continued to wear pins in defiance of the dress code. We presented an open letter signed by over 600 people condemning the change. And in May, many of us attended a rally outside the Lyndale location calling on management to adhere to the co-op’s values. 
Instead of publicly answering to co-op owners, CEO Nick Seeberger claimed ongoing contract negotiations with workers was the necessary route to address the issue — despite rejecting proposals and diverting the conversation to a management-worker committee. 
In that context, Seeberger invited workers to draft their own version of a dress code, which staff undertook with tremendous thought and effort. But according to workers, the only concession their effort achieved was the allowance to wear a single pin representing a country’s flag, suggesting that this concession was a stall — not an accommodation made in good faith. 
Meanwhile, in Gaza, 92% of all residences have been destroyed, as well as mosques, hospitals, and schools, from kindergarten to university. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that roughly 240 journalists have been killed. Humanitarian aid was withheld. According to The Guardian, Gaza now leads the world in child amputees. And NPR reports that over 65,000 Gazans have been killed. 
Given this context, the Wedge’s restriction of workers’ speech repudiates our values of justice, equity and commitment to community — precisely the reasons many of us shop there. And, given the number of members who have protested the change, the continued censoring of workers contradicts our value of democratic ownership. 
While the Wedge board of directors may believe it needs to accommodate both sides, the truth is, only one side is morally just. Many Western nations and numerous international, academic, and Jewish organizations have condemned Israel’s actions. To accommodate those who support Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians is to endorse this slaughter. And despite the blessing of this week’s ceasefire agreement, we must be vigilant in truth-telling not only about the past two years of genocide, but about the state of apartheid to which Palestinians have been subjected for decades, and which is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. 
Judaism teaches that no one’s life — not even that of another Jew — is more important than any other life. In light of the atrocities committed against our Palestinian brothers and sisters, it is the duty of all democratic institutions to support those willing to speak out. 
The election for four new Wedge board of trustees runs until October 21st; this would be the time to contact candidates and see where they stand on our stated co-op goal to “meet the goals and aspirations of our community” — specifically as they relate to food justice, free speech. and member-owner participation.  
It is our fervent hope that the Wedge reinstates its former dress code and allows workers their right to free speech in support of those whose world has been destroyed. 
Editor’s note: Wedge Community Co-op responded with a statement: “We are heartbroken over the war in Gaza and have compassion for the Palestinian people. We are hopeful for lasting peace and the end to war and violence. Our mission is building community by developing a strong local food system and are grateful for the role we play in our community. Everyone is always welcome at the Wedge, every day.

Huntington Beach and its all-Republican city council have proudly led California’s conservative resistance. Now, if California voters approve Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional maps, the city would be represented by Rep. Robert Garcia, a gay progressive who leads Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.


California may have a reputation as a bastion of blue, but there are only so many Democratic voters to go around.
Under Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to gerrymander California’s congressional maps to favor Democrats, no incumbent Democrat would take on more Republican voters than Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach. 
Garcia’s new district, rather than stretching north from his home town into liberal Los Angeles County, would instead shift southward to encompass a coastal slice of conservative Orange County — notably, the conservative-leaning cities of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
Absorbing those GOP voters into the 42nd congressional district is a point of pride for the 47-year-old Peruvian immigrant, a gay progressive whose sharp-tongued condemnations of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk catapulted him into party leadership as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, the chamber’s main investigative arm. 
He also serves on the committee’s viral “DOGE” subgroup, where he and a group of fellow young progressives use their speaking time to lob sardonic rhetorical questions that cast the proceedings and the chairwoman, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, as absurd and even laughable.
“Are Bert and Ernie part of an extreme homosexual agenda?” Garcia asked Paula Kerger, president and CEO of the Public Broadcasting Service, during a hearing in March as his staffer held up a life-sized image of the beloved muppet duo.
If his party retakes control of the House next year, Garcia would almost certainly ascend to chair the committee, which has vast subpoena powers, and would become the face of congressional Democrats’ resistance to Trump.
But don’t expect Garcia, a former Long Beach mayor and city councilor, to back down from his anti-MAGA bully pulpit just because he would then represent a town whose city council has embraced the moniker “the MAGA-nificent seven.” 
“Folks have asked, ‘Hey, you know, you’re pretty progressive. Is this gonna impact the way you take on Trump or the oversight committee?’” Garcia told political commentator Katie Phang during a virtual fundraiser for Prop. 50 last month.
“Absolutely not,” he said.
Garcia’s certainty that he’ll win re-election next year, regardless of which maps are used, is precisely the problem with creating noncompetitive districts as Prop. 50 proposes to do, said state Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican former mayor of Huntington Beach. 
The city is currently represented by a Democratic congressmember, Rep. Dave Min of Irvine, who succeeded Democrat Katie Porter when she unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate last year. But since the district is currently drawn as a competitive seat, Strickland said, Min must win favor from at least some conservative voters if he wants to stay in office. That wouldn’t be the case for Garcia, should Prop. 50 pass. 
Strickland and other local officials in coastal Orange County are skeptical that Garcia — a former Long Beach mayor who said he’s thrilled that his new district would include the entire city — will prioritize their cities’ needs, especially if he doesn’t need their votes to win. 
“The problem with Prop. 50 is you have predetermined elections. You already know who your congressman is before election day,” Strickland said. “As a pretty conservative city, both Newport and Huntington will have one of the most liberal members of Congress. And I just don’t think that’s healthy.”
“We want to govern ourselves”
While Huntington Beach has long asserted its conservative tilt by resisting compliance with state laws they view as too liberal (such as housing construction requirements), the city in recent years has embraced the national culture wars and grabbed headlines for leading a conservative backlash to the state’s ruling Democrats in Sacramento. 
Residents last March approved a ban on flying the rainbow LGBTQ Pride flag on city property. They greenlit a controversial ordinance requiring voters to bring ID to vote, which Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber argue violates state election laws. (Oral arguments before an appeals court are scheduled for Oct. 22).
And a simmering battle over sexual content in children’s books and Huntington Beach’s public library came to a head in June. 
The city council had previously approved a controversial ordinance establishing a community review board for library books — what critics dubbed a book ban — and also briefly explored privatizing the library, policies they saw as a counterbalance to the state Legislature’s ultraliberal, “woke” laws. But this summer, via special election, voters overwhelmingly supported repealing the review board and limited the city’s ability to outsource library services.
“We really just want home control. We want to govern ourselves,” said Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns. He doesn’t know Garcia personally, but as a former police officer in Long Beach he’s familiar with the former councilmember’s left-leaning politics. 
“Hopefully he’s open to helping us, but if he comes in and tries to break us, you know, break our community and try to crush our council in some way,” Burns said, speaking of Garcia, “well, we’re going to resist. We’re not going to get along.”
Garcia argues that the successful repudiation of the library crackdown is evidence that the city council’s right-wing approach doesn’t fully represent residents’ values. 
“The vast majority of Huntington Beach are good, hard-working, middle-class folks that want a just future for themselves,” Garcia told CalMatters in an interview. “That’s who I’m gonna represent.”
Garcia reiterated that he’s unafraid to speak out, even when he disagrees with decisions made in cities that he represents. Even so, he said he would be proud to represent everyone in his proposed new district and would fight hard to bring federal dollars home to support local projects. He said he would prioritize issues that “everyone cares about,” such as increased affordability, combating climate change and curbing corruption. 
Still, Garcia also repeatedly noted that the proposed district would still be solidly Democratic. He effused confidence that he would handily win re-election next year and, he hopes, help Democrats retake control of the House. 
Democrats have come under fire for drawing the new maps behind closed doors without input from the public or the independent citizens redistricting commission. But Paul Mitchell, the election data guru and redistricting expert who penned the proposed maps, said that in redrawing Garcia’s district to include coastal Orange County, he and his team hewed closely to proposals that advocacy groups previously presented to the independent commission.
Moving Garcia’s district to Orange County was crucial to shore up support for three vulnerable Democrats — Min along with Representatives Derek Tran and Mike Levin — and creating two newly redrawn districts, currently held by Republican representatives Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, that Democrats believe they can flip.
“That was a critical piece of the puzzle,” Mitchell said in an interview. “It facilitates everything in Southern California.”
Fellow California Democrats have sung Garcia’s praises for graciously allowing his district to go from one that Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 32% last November to one in which Democrats only have a 10 percentage point registration advantage.
“Robert Garcia is an incredible team player,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, chair of California’s Democratic congressional delegation, in a written statement. “He’s taking in some historically Republican neighborhoods, but it’s still going to be a Democratic district.”
During the same virtual fundraiser in September, Garcia told viewers that taking on more Republican voters was “the right thing to do” because “our democracy’s at stake.” 
“This is not a moment for us to worry about not having competitive seats or about being in Congress for a lifetime,” Garcia said. “This is about winning the majority to protect people and to save our country.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/041025-US-Rep-Robert-Garcia-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

The law comes on the heels of a host of other literacy initiatives, including mandatory dyslexia screening and universal transitional kindergarten.


California took a big step toward overhauling its reading curriculum last week when Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill pushing for phonics-based instruction in elementary and middle school classrooms.
The new law provides training for school principals and reading specialists in the “science of reading,” a method of literacy instruction focused on vocabulary, comprehension and sounding words out rather than learning words by sight. The approach has led to improved reading scores in Mississippi, Louisiana and districts like Los Angeles Unified, which adopted it several years ago.
The law also updates the state’s list of textbooks, flash cards and other classroom reading materials to align with a phonics-based approach.
The law comes on the heels of a host of other literacy initiatives, including mandatory dyslexia screening and universal transitional kindergarten. Combined, the efforts will dramatically reshape the way children in California learn to read and hopefully lead to higher test scores, experts said.
“California has one of the best literacy policy frameworks in the country right now,” said Marshall Tuck, chief executive of the advocacy group EdVoice and a former candidate for state superintendent of public instruction. “We worked very hard on this and we’re thrilled to get to this point. Now we just have to see it through.”
After years of controversy, little opposition
The new law passed the Legislature unanimously and had little opposition. That’s in stark contrast to previous efforts to bring phonics to classrooms, which met steep resistance from English learner advocates and the state’s largest teachers union. English learner groups said that a phonics-based approach only works for children who are fluent in English; the California Teachers Association said teachers need flexibility to pick a reading program that works for their students.
But those groups threw their support behind the current bill after a few changes: Reading materials will be available in languages other than English, and using phonics-based instruction will be optional, not mandatory. Although the state is pushing all schools to adopt the new approach, some may choose to stay with their existing curriculum, which is permissible under the state’s school governance system that leaves most decisions up to local school boards.
“What does this all mean? It means we’ll see,” said Todd Collins, an organizer of the California Reading Coalition and former Palo Alto Unified school board member. “But I’m hopeful. I think most school districts will get the message that they need to improve early literacy.”
Scores inching up
Collins’ group surveyed 300 California school districts in 2022 and found that 80% were not using a phonics-based approach to reading instruction. That’s changing, with some of the state’s largest districts adopting science-of-reading strategies and seeing good results. Los Angeles Unified, for example, saw its English language arts test scores jump 5.5 percentage points since it adopted a phonics-based curriculum in 2022. San Francisco Unified, Fresno Unified and Long Beach Unified have also seen improvements.
California’s reading scores are about the same as the national average, according to the latest Nation’s Report Card scores, and have been inching up since the pandemic. Last year, 49% of students met or exceeded the state’s English language arts standards — still below pre-pandemic levels but a big increase from the previous year.
Helping teachers
Among those who’ve pushed for the switch to phonics is Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina who co-authored the bill. A former elementary teacher, Rubio hopes the new law will help classroom teachers as much as students and their families.
“It’s hard for teachers to see their kids feel defeated and frustrated,” Rubio said. “Now they’ll be equipped to really help their students succeed.”
She was inspired to author the bill, she said, in part because of her younger brother’s experience in school. He was wrongly placed in special education and never properly learned to read, she said, leading him to disengage from school and drop out in ninth grade. Countless other students have had the same experience, she said.
“I know how much it means to learn to read. It can shape someone’s whole life,” Rubio said. “That’s why we stuck with this.”
Another boost to reading instruction came in June, when Newsom included $200 million in the state budget to train teachers in the science of reading. The money should be enough to train every K-3 teacher in the state, Collins said. Credential programs are already training future teachers in the approach.
Tuck, of EdVoice, said the next step is ensuring the policy rolls out smoothly in schools. The new curriculum is a major shift for most schools, and teachers will need plenty of support.
“We can celebrate today, but tomorrow it’s back to work,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/111722-Whittier-LJ-CM-17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 10:01:11.172569

(Photo by Christian Nunes inaturalist.org CC-by-NC 4.0)The Iowa skipper butterfly, once prevalent in prairies across the middle of the U.S., is now at risk of extinction — according to the Center for Food Safety, which has petitioned federal agencies to list the butterfly as an endangered species. 
The Center originally filed a petition on the butterfly in March of 2023, but after several extensions and missed deadlines from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a decision, the Center has filed a notice of intent to sue over the delayed action. 
Center for Food Safety holds that the Iowa skipper, a small bright yellow and orange butterfly, has lost most of its habitat due to agriculture and is further at risk by commercial pesticide spraying, climate change and invasive species. 
Suzannah Smith, legal counsel with the Center for Food Safety, said the Iowa skipper, if listed as endangered, will get designated critical habitat, which she said will be good for a slew of at-risk pollinators. 
“Because they’re an indicator of good prairie habitat, a lot of other pollinators that are just barely hanging on the Great Plains are also really dependent on the habitat that they’re in, and so by designating the habitat for the Iowa skipper, we can also help protect a lot of other pollinators,” Smith said. 
Endangered species designation would also protect the butterfly from actions intended to harm, trap, kill, wound or capture.
Iowa skipper no longer in Iowa
The Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit aimed at fighting the industrial food model, called the Iowa skipper a “canary in the coal mine” for high-quality prairie habitat. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, North America has lost more than 60% of its grassland biome, and 99% of tallgrass prairie in the continent has been lost because of agriculture, development and invasive species. While the grassland biome used to stretch as far east as Iowa, most of the remaining biome, according to the service, is further west and south. 
The subspecies of skipper butterfly, despite its name, has not been present in Iowa since 2009, according to the center’s petition from March 2023 to list the butterfly as an endangered species. 
In addition to Iowa, the butterfly was commonly found in 14 states through the central portion of the country. Now, according to the center’s petition, Atrytone arogos iowa, the Latin name for the butterfly, is typically found only in protected prairie areas in states like Nebraska, Colorado and Oklahoma. 
The center calls the butterfly a “prairie specialist” and holds that the conversion of prairie to cropland, combined with regular application of pesticides on commercial agriculture operations, has contributed to the species’ decline. Smith said even in protected prairie areas, the butterfly is at risk of pesticide drift as the small protected regions are typically surrounded by cropland.
According to the petition, the Iowa skipper faces similar threats to the already endangered Dakota skipper, Poweshiek skipperling and rusty patched bumblebee. 
Legal action 
The Center for Food Safety’s notice of intent to sue alleges USFWS violated the Endangered Species Act by failing to issue a finding on the butterfly within its designated time frame. 
This is the second time the center has issued a notice of intent to sue over the matter. It filed in April 2024 after the initial one year and 90-day deadlines were missed. According to the center, the federal department responded in June 2024 that it would make a 90-day finding, so the center held off on the suit. In October 2024 the USFWS said a listing “may be warranted” for the butterfly, and according to the center, did not issue its 12-month finding on the matter after a full year. The center filed the latest notice of intent to sue on Oct. 8, 2025. 
Smith said it “seemed like” the service was working on reaching a decision in 2024, which is why the center gave it a “bit of a grace period.” But, she said the service then “blew past the deadline,” even before the current government shutdown. 
Staff at USFWS could not be reached for comment on the notice of intent to sue because of the federal shutdown which furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal employees. 
The Center for Food Safety said it intends to sue under the Endangered Species Act if USFWS does not issue its 12-month finding, or “develop a timeline” for the Iowa skipper in the next 60 days. 
Butterfly protections 
The Endangered Species Act, which passed in 1973, is considered one of the strongest laws in the U.S. and has become fairly controversial in the past 50 years. Some believe the law is used by environmental advocates to block various development projects. 
The first notable time the law was used, it protected a small darter fish in a Tennessee river and in the process, stalled a massive dam project. 
Smith said the endangered species designation for the Iowa skipper would protect the butterfly from any “taking” by a private or government actor. Taking, under the act includes things like harming, killing, trapping or wounding. 
Smith said spraying pesticides in an area where the butterflies are known to live would be a form of taking. Controlled burns, which are often used to manage protected areas, can also harm the butterflies, so Smith said endangered species designation for the butterfly could also alter some land management practices in areas the butterfly resides. 
The Center for Food Safety has an extinction crisis campaign as well as campaigns against pesticides, which includes herbicides, insecticides and neonicotinoids. It also fights against things like forever chemicals, genetically engineered foods and confined animal feeding operations. 
“Our belief is that our food system should be nourishing both humans and the planet, and we shouldn’t have a food system that’s destroying our planet,” Smith said. “So we’re trying to make sure that industrial agriculture, including monoculture and pesticides, aren’t pushing pollinators towards extinction.”

The Trump resistance ignited again in the U.S. and California Saturday, underscoring a country that’s on multiple tracks to push back against the president as state lawyers prepare for two marquee court hearings against his administration this week and next.
Nationwide, some protesters held colorful signs, chanted in unison and wore inflatable costumes. It was the second No Kings protest following the first one in June, and it was much bigger this time around, according to organizers: More than 7 million people showed up across 2,700 planned events, compared to June’s rally, which included 5 million people and 2,100 events.
Demonstrators slammed the administration’s crackdown on immigration, deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-leaning states, firing of federal workers and other policies. President Donald Trump’s net approval rating is now -15 percentage points, according to The Economist. Some Californians also showed their support for the state’s redistricting measure, Proposition 50.
Protesters in Los Angeles were nonviolent, reports CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn, who was on the ground in downtown Saturday. But police officers on horseback moved on demonstrators after issuing a number of dispersal orders in the evening to clear the area. Some officers also fired less-lethal munitions. Several people were detained and there was at least one reported arrest, according to ABC 7.
Tens of thousands of protestors rallied together elsewhere in California, including the northern region of the state, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Central Valley and the Inland Empire.
In response to the nationwide protests, Trump posted an AI-generated video of himself wearing a crown, flying a jet labeled “King Trump” and targeting demonstrators with a brown substance.
California’s Attorney General has sued the Trump administration 44 times and two of those lawsuits will see consequential court hearings this week and next. In both cases, California lawyers will seek to persuade judges to undo Trump’s control of the California National Guard. Whether Trump can federalize California troops has been an ongoing legal tussle since June and the issue has expanded to other states.
Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday condemned the Trump administration after a military shell detonated over Interstate 5. The shell went off during a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps. 
Newsom had previously opposed the demonstration, arguing that it was “reckless” and closed off a section of the major freeway. No injuries were reported, though shrapnel dropped onto vehicles, reports The New York Times.

Food stamp data: Newsom signed a bill by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks that bans state and local departments from sharing sensitive personal data to increase CalFresh enrollment. The Oakland Democrat’s measure is a rescission of a law Wicks successfully pushed last year. That law allowed state and local public entities — including ones related to education, crime and employment — to override all state privacy laws in order to share data about people who could potentially get food stamps. Wicks said she was reversing course in response to the Trump administration’s attempt to “weaponize state data.” Read more from Phoebe Huss of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.




Mixed success on reparations bills

Proponents of reparations are regrouping after state lawmakers had mixed success with winning Newsom’s signature for a slate of bills intended to right the lasting damages of slavery and centuries of discrimination against Black Californians, write CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich and Wendy Fry. 
Of the 16 “Road to Repair” bills the California Legislative Black Caucus prioritized earlier this year, Newsom signed five into law and vetoed five others. One bill Newsom spiked would have allowed colleges to prioritize descendants of enslaved people for admissions. In his veto message, the governor said colleges “already have the authority to determine whether to provide admission preferences like this.”
State Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson, a San Diego Democrat and chairperson of the caucus, said the caucus plans to regroup in a couple of weeks to plan its direction for next year. Two of her reparations bills were signed, including one requiring California State University to research methodologies to determine whether someone is a descendant of an enslaved person.

Weber Pierson, in an interview: “A veto is never, in my opinion, a ‘no.’ It may be a ‘no, for now.’ It may be just a ‘no’ this year. And it may be a ‘no’ but let’s try something different.”

But Chris Lodgson, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Coalition for a Just and Equitable California, argues the state isn’t moving fast enough, and that passing legislation focused on more reparations research rather than directly repairing harm “is delay by design.”

The Minneapolis school board has formally asked Superintendent Dr. Lisa Sayles-Adams for information that could lead to school closures. They passed a resolution to the effect at a recent meeting. 
The board first drafted the directive —which asks for an initial report to the board by April 2026 — at two day-long meetings in June and August. The planning follows years of discussion about closing schools in a district with 29,000 students but the capacity for 42,000 and thus a bevy of half-empty schools. 
Even as enrollment declines at a school building, the fixed expenses for building staff — like principals, secretaries, nurses, librarians, culinary workers, custodians and social workers — stay the same or go up. With so many buildings below capacity, a big portion of each Minneapolis student’s funding has to go toward covering these fixed building-level costs, draining money away from instruction and extracurricular activities. 
The board resolution comprises topics for district administrators to investigate, including efficient use of current buildings, potential changes to magnet programs, and ways to increase enrollment in the district.
Years-long discussion about the financial burden of operating small enrollment schools 
The process for downsizing the district’s footprint has been long and circuitous. 
In October 2022, the district prepared a comprehensive financial assessment forecasting that without significant cost cutting, the district would end up draining its reserves, while expenses would exceed revenues by the end of fiscal year 2026. The district has avoided that fate by cutting services and raising class sizes, but it is still unable to balance its budget without relying on reserves and other one-time funds.
The 2022 memo did not prescribe closing schools, but it did present an analysis showing enrollment growth alone could not overcome the district’s structural inefficiencies resulting from operating many schools with small enrollments. At the time of the analysis, Anoka-Hennepin was operating 37 school buildings while enrolling about 37,000 students. Minneapolis was operating 61 buildings while enrolling about 29,000 students. Minneapolis had about half as many students per building as Anoka-Hennepin.
The board first publicly discussed reducing the number of schools in March 2023, when then-board Chair Sharon El-Amin asked Rochelle Cox, the then-interim superintendent, to develop a draft plan for “school transformation.” Neither Cox nor the board took action.
Two months before current Superintendent Dr. Lisa Sayles-Adams started at the district in early 2024, the School Board passed a “transformation resolution” that directed the district to do an accounting of physical space but stopped short of calling for a timeline on school closures. 
Sayle-Adams promised to tackle “right-sizing” the district after passing a budget in June 2024, because, she said, the community asked her to address the issue. 
Low enrollment schools require more funding per student for building-level staff
The district is contending with rising costs and operating a significant number of small buildings, as well as buildings operating below capacity. Given the rising fixed costs of operating these buildings, that leaves less money for everything else, from class size reduction to teacher pay and programs commonly found in most school districts like world languages, art, music and athletics.
Across the district, as building-level enrollment has declined, students have lost access to services like academic support if they’re struggling; staff to address student behavior; and community liaisons to help parents connect with schools. Small elementary schools have difficulty funding full-time positions for electives like art, music and gym, while hiring part-time staff for these positions is challenging. Some elementary students have gone without these electives, or only have music or art for part of the school year.
Enrollment declines at middle and high schools have meant fewer elective options, like world languages, dance, theater and orchestra, as well as extracurriculars. Students also lose access to advanced coursework — like AP or IB classes — when there are too few students in the school who want to enroll. Many of the district’s high schools are now sharing athletic teams because individual schools lack enough students and funding to support a robust athletics program.
The decline in services drives some families to schools outside the district that have the services and programs they desire, compounding the enrollment declines.
Declines in enrollment mitigated by new-to-country students
Minneapolis Public Schools lost about 15% of its enrollment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a combination of factors including implementing a controversial plan redrawing school boundaries, and keeping its schools closed longer during the pandemic than any other Minnesota district, which was followed in March 2022 by a three week educator strike. 
The district has enjoyed a small enrollment increase both last year and this year. Although the district does not track the immigration status of students, the increase has been attributed almost entirely to students newly arrived to the United States from Central America. Since the 2021-22 school year, English learner students have increased from 17% of the district’s students to 23% in the 2024-25 school year, according to Minnesota Department of Education data. 
This year, the district expects to spend at least $17 million more on English learner services than it receives in funding from state and federal sources. Although the Legislature increased state aid for English learners during the 2023 legislative session, the district’s funding is insufficient to cover the cost of providing the intensive services needed by students with the lowest levels of English proficiency. 
Many of the newcomer students are also unhoused, which has led to growing costs for the district to transport students from shelters outside district boundaries, as required under the federal McKinney-Vento law. The state has started to pay the cost of this transportation under a law passed in 2023.
It is not clear whether changes to federal immigration policy will impact the district’s ability to continue to rely on newcomers to stabilize or grow enrollment in the future.
Future enrollment expected to decline, limiting district’s funding
Hazel Reinhardt, a demographer hired by the district, says enrollment is likely to continue to decline in the coming years because of lower birth rates, fewer families choosing to raise children in the city, and the state’s favorable laws around charter schools and open enrollment, allowing parents to send their children to St. Paul or suburban schools. 
Reinhardt told the board in June that once parents leave for charter and private schools or open enrollment options, “precious few” districts are able to bring them back. 
Most of the district’s funding is based on enrollment, so declining enrollment has created a ballooning fiscal crisis. Growing costs for both labor and services have outpaced increases in state and local funding. 
The district continues to cut services, increase class sizes and pull from its dwindling reserve funds to balance its annual budget. The district is expected to use $25 million from its reserves this school year after using $85 million from reserves last school year.
The district’s enrollment woes and related financial distress are not unique to Minneapolis, with similar challenges facing large urban districts like Oakland, San Francisco, Denver, Seattle and Portland. Denver and Oakland have closed a small number of schools in recent years, but not enough to stabilize district finances. And school boards in Seattle and San Francisco have walked away from closure plans after significant public pressure, leaving both districts with growing budget deficits.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692
,California,2025-10-20 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Stockton is redefining its identity through the evolution of its hip-hop scene,Tama Brisbane,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/stockton-identity-evolution-hip-hop-scene/,"Stockton struggles with an identity crisis, born out of geography and a distance that impedes everything: access to industry, audiences and opportunities.","Guest Commentary written by

Tama Brisbane
Tama L. Brisbane is Stockton’s Poet Laureate Emerita and a literary and performing arts consultant.


I watched a new era in Stockton’s hip-hop scene come of age.
Moving to the Central Valley city in the early 2000s, I found a hip-hop community that was its own form of resistance. Smoldering frustration with poverty, racial tension and a reputation for violence that it couldn’t seem to shake. Stockton’s sound was silenced more often than it was supported.
My adopted home carries a peculiar duality: burdened by perception and powered by persistence. Hip-hop here didn’t arrive gently. Hell, it wasn’t even invited — it bum-rushed its way in. 
One of the longest odds Stockton hip-hop struggles with is an identity crisis, born out of geography and a distance that impedes everything: access to industry, audiences and opportunities. We’re 45 minutes from Sacramento and nearly two hours from the Bay, in the middle of a region nobody knows how to define. The Bay has hyphy and an iconic ambassador in E-40. 
But Stockton? This in-between place never had a defining sound all its own. 
But distant didn’t mean dismissed. Even as far back as the 1980s, Stockton was in the building. Thanks to legendary and local promoters like Hardin Fulcher, Brian Sampson, Thaddeus Smith and others, acts like Too Short, The Fat Boys, even N.W.A pulled up. And the Civic Auditorium was the stage of the people, home to hip-hop before the city ever thought to make it actually welcome.
Contrast that with the venerable Bob Hope Theatre, the city’s downtown showpiece before the construction of Stockton Arena. In an earlier era, Black residents were relegated to sitting in the balcony, demonstrating how cultural exclusion was built into the city’s entertainment DNA. 
Then in 2006, Stockton opened a $68 million arena, its official entry into the lucrative concert industry. The city had a chance to debut the venue with Carlos Santana — globally famous, riding the wave of mega-hit “Smooth,” and culturally resonant with Stockton’s large Hispanic community. Instead, white, aging, tepidly popular Neil Diamond was chosen, and paid $1 million— up front. The city trumpeted a sellout show, but behind the scenes they gave away huge blocks of tickets to fill embarrassingly empty seats. 
The final tally: $400,000 in losses and a public outcry that cost the city manager his job. 
At the same time, the city’s code enforcement campaign was targeting local promoters, nickel and diming them with excessive event permit, security and insurance fees — $100 if there was dancing, more for amplified sound, and a requirement to hire off-duty police officers as security. 
How you gon’ hip-hop in stillness and silence? The fees weren’t just applied unevenly — they were weaponized, wielded against a genre and a culture. 
In 2005, when I was appointed to Stockton’s Civil Grand Jury, one of our investigations spotlighted the city’s discriminatory entertainment policies and burdensome fees. When our report was published in 2006, the city was put on notice — and on the clock — to make changes. The official door for hip-hop in Stockton was opening.
Enter Common: rapper, poet, activist. Thanks to the University of the Pacific’s Music Management Program, in 2007 he became the first hip-hop act to perform at the Hope. The sold-out show represented a seismic shift in the city’s entertainment landscape. And for weeks, one question echoed throughout the local hip-hop scene: Who’s opening for Common?
I pitched a local, collaborative showcase to the university. A Stockton-centric opening set, that reflected the range, artistry and elevation possible — and profitable — for the hip-hop scene.
Hip-hop in Stockton didn’t just survive — it’s evolved. Local artists who once struggled to book a venue now shape the entire city’s entertainment vision. In the person of Adonis Spiller, aka MadSpill, hip-hop now sits on the Stockton Arts Commission, influencing both artistic funding and policy. 
And the arena that once hosted Neil Diamond’s costly debut/debacle? It’s since welcomed E-40, Lil Wayne and a parade of revenue-generating hip-hop acts. Stockton hasn’t produced a breakout star — yet — but the infrastructure, energy and community remain undeniable.
In the end, Stockton hip-hop isn’t just about music, or even money. It’s about creating and showcasing 209 stories. Stockton’s hip-hop scene was built, not in spite of this city’s notorious violence, but oftentimes in direct response to it. 209 contends with crime, systemic disinvestment, apathy and oppression towards its youth and communities of color — conditions that color the lyrics and experiences of its artists.
Artists like Daddex, MBNel, EBK Jaaybo, Mundo, Jelani, Deozene, Surf Baby, Braxy, Zeps, BLoveJones, Haiti Babii, Steve Spiffler and Mikeila Janae are making waves regionally and beyond. It’s Jazmarie LaTour, Stockton Poet Laureate, host of the city’s longest-running open mic, and Hatch Workshops, where hip-hop happens. It’s The Lyte, or word-of-mouth but now standing room only event where performance artists come to shine. 
And one day, it’s gonna be about that time when it was, finally, Stockton hip-hop’s time.

An audit last week said the now-defunct Maryland Racetrack Operating Authority Board failed to document agreements for a $10 million loan for the track as well as millions in consulting contracts. (File photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A now-extinct state board charged with overseeing the redevelopment of Pimlico Race Course and overseeing thoroughbred racing in the state failed to formalize an agreement for $10 million in working capital and ensure that millions in consulting contracts were in the state’s best interest and competitively bid.
The findings are part of a report on the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority released Thursday by the Office of Legislative Audits.
The report found “significant deficiencies” in the operation of the board that auditors said could “adversely affect MTROA’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate effectively, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.”
Auditors said they also found “significant instances of noncompliance” with state laws and regulations.
The authority was created in 2023 as part of what is seen by many as a last-ditch effort to preserve the state’s horse racing and related industries, revitalize Pimlico and prevent the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown, from leaving Baltimore and perhaps Maryland.
The 13-member authority was tasked then with creating a “best in class” racing venue. The authority was to take over the track and consolidate thoroughbred racing in the state. The authority created the nonprofit Maryland Jockey Club last year to manage day-to-day racing operations as the state took over the track as well as the licensing of the Preakness and related races and memorabilia.
Audit finds lax credit card oversight at Department of Assessments and Taxation

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Annapolis hinted at trouble with the arrangement. Hearings early in the session yielded little additional information.
But in March, as the session was winding down, a budget conference committee added surprise language dissolving the authority and bifurcating racing and redevelopment efforts.
The Maryland Stadium Authority was tasked with overseeing the demolition and construction of a new Pimlico track as well as a modern training facility. The Maryland Economic Development Corp. assumed responsibility for racing operations and community redevelopment.
The redevelopment of Pimlico is now underway under the changes made earlier this year.
The legislative audit sheds light on concerns about the authority handing millions in state money to the jockey club and used to hire consultants.
In one instance, auditors found the authority failed to secure a written agreement with The Maryland Jockey Club governing what auditors described as a $10 million “working capital advance” or loan. A typical agreement should have detailed the roles and responsibilities of the authority and jockey club in managing and operating Pimlico and the training facilities.
“Such agreements are critical for establishing oversight over the $527 million that the General Assembly has committed to the redevelopment of Pimlico and training facilities,” auditors wrote.
The governor’s office, responding for the now-defunct thoroughbred racetrack authority, agreed with many of the findings. But it challenged the idea of $10 million in working capital as “a loan.”
Deputy Chief of Staff Manny Welsh, in a written response, said the 2023 law “does not specify that the working capital authorized in the law be treated” as a loan.
He added that the authority board “did not conduct a vote on any agreements to clarify that the working capital was to be treated as a loan advance or finalize any terms for repayment.”
Auditors, in a note at the end of the report, said they stood by their description.
In the report, auditors wrote that a draft agreement written in February 2025 “referred to the $10 million as an operating loan and as such, this description was included in our analysis. The terminology is also consistent with the description … provided to us by MTROA management during our audit.”
A second finding — which the governor’s office agreed with and deemed accurate — involved five consulting contracts totaling $1.9 million.
Auditors reported that the authority “did not ensure the contracts included clearly defined deliverables and deadlines and that the related invoices were detailed. Therefore, there was a lack of assurance that invoices were appropriate to pay and that the services were provided timely.”

The Crew monitors 12 species spanning over 140 plots each year. (Courtesy Institute of Applied Ecology)Last month, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) announced it had partnered with the Department of the Interior to cut $14 million worth of environmental grants, including $2.5 million for New Mexico.
The Institute of Applied Ecology, based in both Oregon and here in New Mexico, is one of the organizations that had a large swath of its funding cut.
“We work with native plant materials development,” said Katy Silbert, the assistant branch director of the institute’s southwestern branch. “Which means that we are collecting seeds from the wild to then grow those plants and put them back on the landscape.”
In addition to replanting, the institute does experimental research and monitoring of rare plants in partnership with private landowners, and a slew of federal, state, and local agencies across seven states.
Silbert said that the funding cuts seemingly came out of nowhere, with some of their staff learning about them while out in the field.
“One of our ecologists was doing a planting with our Bureau of Land Management partners and were finding out [about the cuts] at the same time that we were,” Silbert told KUNM.
The cuts were spearheaded by DOGE, and the Trump administration claimed on the social media site X (formerly known as Twitter) that these grants, which make up over half of Silbert’s budget, were “wasteful” because their DEI-esque hiring initiatives weren’t aligned with agency “priorities.”
The now-cancelled awards came from a slew of agencies under the Department of the Interior – from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Land Management for initiatives for delivering on the ground conservation or building conservation capacity.
“Real action = real savings,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum wrote on social media. DOI is also currently preparing to implement another round of agency-wide layoffs.
Overall, the Institute for Applied Ecology received 30 federal award cancellation notices on Sept. 23 from Department of the Interior agencies totaling somewhere around $3.5 million. Silber said $2.5 million of that was specifically for conservation in New Mexico.

Other organizations that lost funding include the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies and the Lomakatsi Restoration Project. It’s common for these types of awards and grants to be reimbursed after organizations have spent their own personal funds for a project, which is then paid back by the federal government after a review process. These agreements can span several years.
This means that Silber’s team has already spent money that they might not get back.
“It can be a challenge to balance that when we have some of these larger expenditures – because conservation, while very important, isn’t always cheap, but it’s always worth it,” Silber said.
Silber pointed out that their habitat restoration efforts are broadly beneficial for many New Mexico species – including the lesser prairie-chicken, chestnut-collared and thick-billed longspurs, and the monarch butterfly.
“There are these massive ripple effects of having fewer resources on the landscape,” she added.
While some of these projects will still go forward and others reevaluated, the slashes are having an immediate effect, forcing the institute to lay off two seasonal youth field crews and four other regular positions.
These cuts come in the midst of a systemic push to overhaul agencies under the executive branch, where President Donald Trump is broadly attacking popular conservation policies and public lands in the name of energy exploration and economic development.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/appliedecology-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As geothermal developments bloom in Utah, lawmakers aim to answer: who has claim on the geothermal resources in the state? 
“We have a lot of geothermal resources, and they’re not being developed as much as they should or could be,” Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, told the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Interim Committee on Wednesday. “And the question was, who owns the geothermal resource in the state of Utah? Is it a water right? Is it a surface right, or is it a mineral right?” 
Currently, the Utah Division of Water Rights reviews permits for geothermal developments, a process that can be done in about 30 days, Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, told the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Interim Committee on Wednesday.
While industry players are happy with the fast permitting timelines, there’s still uncertainty about who holds what right, McKell said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The process, under a new bill from McKell, will be a little bit of a hybrid. Land owners will be able to own the energy-producing heat below their land, regardless of whether someone else owns rights to minerals like oil or gas in the space.
However, energy producers must also have a water right for the geothermal fluids they have to use since traditionally, the technology uses water or working fluids to carry heat to turn turbines.
The Division of Water Rights would still approve applications to operate wells for geothermal production under McKell’s bill.
The bill would also affect the water rights division’s public record practices. If approved, it would delete part of the code that says that geothermal filings to the division are public records “unless the owner or operator requests, in writing, that the records be held confidential” for a maximum of five years.
“Previously, the state engineer would hold the proprietary data for five years. It’s reducing that to one year, which we think is a good thing to encourage geothermal development,” state engineer Teresa Wilhelmsen told the legislative panel.
The proposal passed as a committee bill, but still faced skepticism from some members. The bill will go through a full legislative approval process with considerations in Senate and House committees, a path that McKell specifically requested.
“This is a big enough issue, and I think it’s actually helpful for us to signal this to industry that we’re working on it and we’re providing this clarity,” McKell said.
Other Western states are mixed on geothermal rights, McKell said. Wyoming, for example, includes geothermal fluid in its definition of underground water, so energy producers need to apply for a water permit to access the geothermal heat. Others, like Nevada, Oregon and Washington tie geothermal rights to the owners of the land on the surface. 
Unique, waterless geothermal system moving forward in Utah

Utah has essentially been operating under the model laid out in the bill, but it’s now being codified, McKell said.
Jim Goddard, geothermal program manager at the Utah Division of Water Rights, said in a presentation that this bill would tackle one application of geothermal generation — electricity, which is accomplished at high temperatures.
Other geothermal uses, like direct heating and cooling done at lower temperatures, will be regulated differently. 
The Point development, located at the site of the former Utah State Prison, for example, has the potential to develop an existing geothermal well to provide community heating and energy, greenhouse support and recreation. Because the system used at The Point isn’t hot enough to produce electricity, it wouldn’t fit in this specific legislation.
One of McKell’s goals with the bill is to make the regulatory burden as low and economical as possible, he said. Another is to encourage private geothermal development in the state.
During the meeting Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, expressed concern about whether the geothermal operation would affect local water rights used for irrigation and other purposes.
“That is exactly why we have to keep a water right attached, so that we can go through that process and identify if existing rights will be impaired or affected by that, and then we can take appropriate action,” Wilhelmsen said.

The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties.

When do polls open?

Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 

Where do I find my polling place

The Alabama Secretary of State’s website allows you to check voter registration and the location of your polling place. You can find it here.

What do I need to vote?

Voters must present a valid photo ID before voting. Valid forms of ID include: 

Alabama driver’s license (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency digital driver’s license
Alabama Non-Driver ID (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Photo Voter ID card
State-issued ID (Alabama or any other state)
Federal-issued ID

Tribal ID


Where is the district located?

The district covers parts of Chambers and Lee counties, including Valley, Lanett and Smiths Station.

How did the seat become vacant?

The seat became vacant after Wood resigned this summer to move near the Florida panhandle, where her husband works. 

Does the seat have a partisan lean?

District 38 is solidly Republican. Wood won in 2022 with almost 90% of votes against Libertarian Charles Temm Jr. She won with about 70% of votes in 2018 against Democrat Brian McGee.

What issues dominate the race?

Messer and Nelson have both said they want income tax reform, but the current rates are locked via a 1933 constitutional amendment. Any changes would have to be done through a different constitutional amendment. 
Messer also wants an election audit law, which Wood tried to do while she was in the Legislature. Nelson wants every school, public and private, to have a school resource officer.
Multiple attempts to reach Dixon have been unsuccessful. 

Campaign fundraising

According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $55,000 and spent almost $41,000. About one-third of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began.
Messer has raised about $16,000 and spent almost $22,000. He had almost $9,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. According to campaign finance records, the EAGL PAC donated $1,000, the sole PAC donation to Messer’s campaign.
Nelson has raised over $22,000 and spent almost $21,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. All of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses.

What happens after Tuesday?

The Republican with the most votes will face Democratic candidate Hazel Floyd, 21, on Feb. 3, 2026. If a candidate does not receive 50% of the vote, a runoff primary election will be held on Nov. 18.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May, including Wood. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24.

They’re also holding on to their properties longer before putting them up for sale, in keeping with a nationwide trend.
Las Vegas home sellers saw a median profit of 53% in the third quarter of this year, down from 59.6% a year ago. The typical Las Vegas home sold in the third quarter had been owned for about eight and a half years, according to a new report from ATTOM, a real estate data analyst. 
Seller gains in Southern Nevada topped out in the second quarter of 2022 at 81.8%, based on transactions going back to 2008.  Profit margins are based on the difference between the purchase and resale price.  
The median sale price of a home sold in Reno in the third quarter was $548,000, down from $555,000 in the second quarter, and down from $577,570 a year ago. 
Profit margins in Reno peaked in the second quarter of 2022 at 88.5%. 
Reno homeowners who sold in the third quarter earned a median profit of 54.8%, down from 68.1% a year ago. The typical homeowner in Reno owned their property for approximately nine and half years. 
Homeowners in the U.S. made a median profit of 49.9% on homes and condos sold during the third quarter. That’s down from 55.4% a year ago, according to the report. 
The median sale price of a home in the U.S. in the third quarter was $370,000, up 1.2% from the second quarter and up 3.4% from last year. 
The median sale price in Las Vegas, according to ATTOM, was $445,000, down from $449,000 last quarter, but up from $440,000 a year ago. 
U.S. homeowners are keeping their properties longer before putting them up for sale. 
“Owners had held homes sold in the third quarter of 2025 for an average of 8.39 years before selling them, the longest average homeownership tenure in at least 25 years and up from 8.13 years for homes sold in the previous quarter,” the report says. 
Among metropolitan areas with populations above 1 million, the largest average profit margins last quarter were in San Jose, CA (94.3%); Seattle, WA (80.2%); Buffalo, NY (80%); Rochester, NY (77.3%); and Hartford, CT (75%).
The lowest average profit margins among the biggest metro areas were New Orleans, LA (19.6%); San Antonio, TX (22.8%); Houston, TX (30%); Austin, TX (31.8%); and Dallas, TX (33.5%).
 Profit margins are still above pre-pandemic levels, according to ATTOM’s data.  
“Prior to 2020, home sellers saw profit margins of around 30 percent. As the Covid-19 pandemic induced people in search of more space to leave cities and buy homes, profits doubled to more than 60 percent in mid-2022,” the report says. “The average seller’s return has been dropping steadily since that peak, but over the last three quarters it’s held just below 50 percent.”
Big cities. Bigger prize. 
In terms of cash, the typical home sale generated a profit of $123,100, the report says, but notes “large disparities, with sales in the top major urban areas generating 18 times more in profit than those at the other end of the spectrum.”
The west coast swept the category of top large metropolitan areas with the largest raw dollar profits, with San Jose, CA leading the way with $740,500, followed by San Francisco, CA ($450,000); San Diego, CA ($350,000); Los Angeles, CA ($349,500); and Seattle, WA ($325,000).
According to a 2024 Consumer Affairs report, some 158,000 Californians have moved to Nevada since 2020, making up 43% of new residents within the past four years.
Major metros with the smallest raw profits were New Orleans, LA at $41,000, followed by San Antonio, TX ($55,895); Oklahoma City, OK ($63,000); Birmingham, AL ($68,500); and Louisville, KY ($71,000).
While real estate gains “remain below the peak levels reached during the pandemic, recent quarters suggest a more stable, sustainable market environment,” the report said of the national outlook. “Continued buyer demand, bolstered by moderating mortgage rates, may be helping to maintain solid returns for sellers across much of the country.”
Institutional investors not going away  
Purchases by institutional investors such as hedge funds made up 6.4% of sales nationwide in the third quarter, down from 7% in the second quarter, but up from 6.1% a year ago. Homes sold to institutional investors accounted for 6.4 percent of all sales nationwide, down from 7 percent in the previous quarter but a slight increase over 6.1 percent in the third quarter of last year.
Texas had the highest proportion of sales to institutional investors at 8.8%, followed by Missouri (8.8 %); Tennessee (8.7%); Indiana (8.4%); and Mississippi (8.4%).
Additionally, Las Vegas was among the five metro areas with the lowest percentage of lender sales. Seattle, WA had the lowest share (0.5% of all sales), followed by Los Angeles, CA (0.6%); Charlotte, NC (0.6%t); Las Vegas (0.6%); and Phoenix, AZ (0.6%).",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-468653152-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 08:01:47.879333

A Homewood charter school that was founded to serve LGBTQ+ students got renewed last week, but school officials said they had taken out language about their mission. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)I’m not a fan of charter schools. Broadly speaking, they do little to improve learning outcomes and siphon resources from traditional public schools.
We don’t need that in a state that underfunds education, particularly where Black Alabamians are concerned.
But I hate bullies. And I hate what the bullies running our state have done to Magic City Acceptance Academy.
The charter school opened in Homewood in 2021, focusing on LGBTQ+ students. It was the first of its kind in Alabama, but not the first in the nation. New York’s Harvey Milk High School dates back to 1985. Pride School operated from 2016 to 2018 in Atlanta.
Whatever you think of charter schools, LGBTQ+ students are often the targets of cruel people. Three-fourths of LGBTQ+ students responding to a 2022 survey said they had experienced harassment; a third of them said it had been physical. Other surveys have found that physical bullying of LGBTQ+ students is even worse in the South. Which can lead to horrible outcomes, including increased risk of suicide.
Needless to say, all public schools should enforce anti-bullying policies and make students feel safe and welcome. But there is a clear logic to opening a school where students don’t have to worry that their sexual identity will put them in danger.
Magic City did not limit its enrollment to gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender students. But it aimed to make LGBTQ+ students feel welcome. Students in the school told al.com in 2022 that they could thrive at Magic City. They could even attend the prom, something they didn’t feel safe doing before.
Unfortunately, Magic City couldn’t stop the ambitious bullies in our political class.
In 2022, Republican Tim James tried to boost his floundering gubernatorial campaign by attacking a drag performance presented by the school’s teachers. Even by the gutter standards of Alabama politics, it was despicable. It led to harassment of school students and officials and forced the charter to invest in security.
Two years later, Gov. Kay Ivey signed SB 129, a law banning publicly-funded DEI programs and “divisive concepts,” which can be roughly defined as anything suggesting a world beyond the views of wealthy white heterosexuals.
That’s about as clear as I can get. The law is vague in its definitions. Which is convenient for those who get into politics to hurt people.
And in Magic City’s case, it seems to have worked.
The school did get its charter renewed last week. In some ways, that was a victory over Alabama’s far-right media, which treats vulnerable people as things to be threatened.
But a lot seems to have been lost. Magic City Acceptance Academy is no longer a school that aims to help LGBTQ+ students. That language is gone, according to the testimony of Patton Furman, the principal and superintendent of the school.
“We have taken that out,” he told the Alabama Public Charter School Commission. “We are affirming to all people.”
That’s fine, but the point of the academy was giving LGBTQ+ students a place to live as themselves. If a school is simply “affirming” everyone’s existence, what makes it so different from a public school?
There are smaller losses, too. The school altered its logo. It had to recontextualize the rainbow motifs in its building.
They’re even teaching kids at the school to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America,” President Donald Trump’s preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. That’s sad. I’m sure that petty burst of insecurity has already been replaced two or three times over in Trump’s head with something else from his bottomless persecution complex.
I sympathize with Furman, who is playing a bad hand as best as he can. A school that welcomes everyone is nothing to criticize.
But it’s a terrible marker of the nation’s degeneracy. Ten years ago, bigotry around sexual identity seemed to be dying. We could see a future where gender and orientation mattered as much as eye and hair color. We could imagine a nation free of the poison of closeted behavior and the trauma of forcing people to deny who they are.
Today, Alabama makes it a crime to provide health care to transgender people. Lawmakers work every year to force LGBTQ+ communities out of public life.
This is the environment the school faces. We live in a time where a small band of zealots want to beat Alabama into an either/or way of life, where conformity is all and individuality is a threat.
So there are two ways to view the changes they’ve made.
One is that Magic City has abandoned their outreach to LGBTQ+ youth.
The other is that they’re concealing that mission, hoping to survive until the storm ends.
In the latter case, it may be the only way for the school to keep going.
But it’s a baleful moment. A place meant to allow LGBTQ+ youth to be their best selves now models ways to hide what it is.
That’s an outrage. Places like Magic City should be lifting us to a better future. Instead, they’re knuckling under, showing what governance by bigotry and grievance has cost us.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PXL_20230516_163756103-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-20 09:01:55.297692

The cyber attack ended up crippling several critical services like the Department of Motor Vehicles for over a week, and the full extent of the data that was compromised is still unknown as state officials, the Cyber Security Infrastructure Administration, and the FBI continue their investigation. 
However, one critical state service – the Secretary of State’s voter registration information – remained untouched. This was due in large part to a 2021 law that mandated centralizing voter data into a top-down voter registration system, consolidating all counties’ voter information. 
The old system, which had required each county to individually track and record voter data, was a bottom-up system where counties had to manage their own lists and cybersecurity before the information was transmitted to the SOS system. In contrast, the Voter Registration and Election Management System (VREMS) requires that all counties report voter registration and election data into a single system, which allows for more uniform list maintenance and provides a more secure cybersecurity infrastructure, as seen with the cyber attack earlier this year. The change, although expensive, has resulted in a safer and more transparent system for election officials and voters alike. 
The implementation of VREMS removed siloes between the Secretary of State and county clerks, allowing not just for easier list maintenance, but also strengthening the state’s ability to safeguard the information in one system rather than the patchwork the state had previously. 
All in all, the adoption of the new VREMS systems has demonstrated its value in more ways than one, and Nevada voters can rest assured knowing that their voter registration data was not compromised in the latest cyber attack. However, the attack is also a signal of what’s to come and a reminder that we cannot let our guard down. 
Specific voter data – such as addresses, partial security numbers, and driver’s license numbers – is sensitive and should remain guarded from malicious or third-party actors. Yet, budget cuts at the federal level to organizations like CISA, combined with a rise in cyber attacks like the one we experienced earlier in the year, add layers of complexity to that mandate for state officials. 
While we wait to learn more about the full extent of Nevada’s cyber attack, we’re taking this time to learn what went right in Nevada’s switch to the VREMS system and protect against future attacks by continuing to learn and adapt to emerging cybersecurity threats. For so many Nevadans, participating in elections is a dearly held right. We must do everything we can to make sure that this right, and the information we give to exercise it, remains safe.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/election-day-10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 08:01:47.879333

Here's what to know.","Next month, Connecticut voters will head to the polls to elect candidates for local positions in their city or town.
No statewide or national elections — like those for United States Senate and House of Representatives seats or for governor of Connecticut — are held in odd-numbered years. But on Nov. 4, many communities throughout the state will still elect officeholders to positions like mayor, city councilor, alder or board of education member.
Here’s what to know about the upcoming elections.
How do I know who’s running in my city or town?
The Secretary of the State’s office publishes sample ballots online for each city and town, which show the candidates running. You can find yours here.
Many Connecticut municipalities publish the sample ballots on their websites as well. 
Where and when can I vote?
Polls will be open from Oct. 20 through Nov. 2 for early in-person voting. Early voting is a relatively new option for Connecticut voters — the state implemented it for the first time last year after the legislature approved it in 2023.
Early voting will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day, including weekends. On Oct. 28 and 30, the polls will have extended hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Each municipality is required to have at least one polling location — typically at a town or city hall — and those with populations of 20,000 or more have the option to open multiple locations. 
Your early voting polling location may be different from your Election Day polling place. Find your early voting location on the Secretary of the State’s website here.
On Election Day, polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can find your polling place here.
Can I vote absentee?
Possibly, if you meet certain requirements.
In Connecticut, you are only allowed to vote by mail for one of the following reasons: you’re an active member of the U.S. military; you will be out of town on Election Day; you will be serving as an election official at a different polling location; you can’t vote for religious reasons that day; or sickness or a physical disability will prevent you from making it to the polls on Election Day.
Absentee ballots for the Nov. 4 election became available on Oct. 3. To get one, you must first apply for it by sending a completed absentee ballot application to your town clerk’s office. You can download the application here or pick one up at your town clerk’s office.
A ballot will then be mailed to you, and after filling it out, you or a “designee” can return it by mail, drop it in a ballot drop box or return it in person to the town clerk. Full absentee ballot guidelines, including who qualifies as a designee, can be found here.
Last fall, Connecticut voters approved a constitutional amendment that allowed for universal (also known as “no-excuse”) absentee voting, paving the way for the legislature to pass a law allowing every voter to cast an absentee ballot. However, the legislature has not passed such a law, so absentee ballots are still only available to voters who meet the qualifying circumstances.
What if I’m not registered to vote?
Connecticut offers same-day voter registration during the early voting period and on Election Day. 
During early voting, you can register at your polling place. On Election Day, you can register at your town’s Election Day registration site, which can likely be found on your municipality’s website.
What are some of the biggest races?
The two largest cities with mayoral elections in November are New Haven and Stamford. In both cities, incumbent Democratic mayors are running for reelection against Republican challengers.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker is running for a fourth two-year term. His Republican opponent is Steve Orosco, a former MMA fighter and the founder of SMASH MMA, a mixed-martial arts events organization.
Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons is running for a second four-year term. Her Republican opponent is Nicola Tarzia, founder of a plumbing, heating and construction services company and former Stamford Board of Education member.
Norwalk and Hamden also have mayoral elections, but in those municipalities, candidates are running for open seats. 
In Norwalk, the Democratic nominee is Common Council President Barbara Smyth, a retired teacher who defeated fellow council member Darlene Young in the primary. She’ll face off against Republican nominee Vinny Scicchitano, an auto repair shop owner and member of the Saint Ann’s Club of Norwalk.
Hamden’s Democratic nominee is former school board chair and longtime town official Adam Sendroff, who won a five-way primary race. His Republican opponent is Jonathan Katz, a paralegal who holds degrees in economics and international political economy from Fordham University.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1105_SR_Polling_027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Vermont’s lack of an “authority having jurisdiction” over all energy codes means there is no state agency enforcing the energy codes, resulting in our abysmal energy code compliance rates.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Richard Faesy: ‘Affordable’ housing and Vermont energy codes.","This commentary is by Richard Faesy, of Starksboro. He is a principal and co-founder of the Energy Futures Group. 


Building more affordable houses for Vermonters is in everyone’s interest. However, making sure that homes are energy efficient, healthy, durable and resilient so that they remain affordable over their lifetime is equally as important. Instead of only looking at the first cost, considering the year-over-year energy operating costs would also provide the best indication of true home ownership costs. Financing a little more upfront for an energy efficient home can pay for itself with energy savings that more than offset any increase in monthly mortgage payments. 
Vermont energy codes are developed with just this approach in mind; only those measures that more than pay for themselves in energy cost savings are included. Reverting back to the 2020 Residential Building Energy Standards (RBES) energy code actually makes housing less affordable than building to the more cost-effective 2024 RBES. This energy code rollback, ordered by Gov. Phil Scott on Sept. 17, not only makes housing less affordable but also means that the state will need to find other potentially more costly ways to meet our climate goals.
However, while Scott’s executive order is a setback, it could also provide an opportunity to level an uneven playing field for all builders and new construction. 
If Vermont is serious about providing affordable housing, we need to ensure that all homes are at least built to the 2020 RBES energy code. Past market assessment surveys conducted by the Vermont Department of Public Service have shown declining RBES compliance rates over the time; the most recent study, looking at homes built between 2017 and 2021, shows that only about half of new homes were built to the 2015 RBES, two code cycles behind today’s standards. This is a disservice to homeowners who are paying too much in energy costs and is unfair to those law-abiding builders who choose to build to the current energy codes.
Vermont’s lack of an “authority having jurisdiction” over all energy codes means there is no state agency enforcing the energy codes, resulting in our abysmal energy code compliance rates. Besides home buyers paying higher energy bills, builders can compete on home prices by building sub-standard homes and undercutting their legally compliant competition.
Naming a state agency such as the Division of Fire Safety to oversee both energy and building codes for all buildings in Vermont — and not just “public buildings” as is currently the case — while establishing a code enforcement system would provide consumer protection. It would also make sure all builders are playing by the same rules, make gains towards our climate goals and ensure that all of the homes our state needs to build are truly “affordable.”

(Getty Images)Frustration over utility rates and concerns about the impact of new businesses locating in Indiana have driven discussions about Indiana’s energy policy to an unprecedented but justified level of intensity in recent months. 
It is not hard to understand why. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to our daily lives. It is also critical to the state’s manufacturing and industrial sectors, which currently account for 26% of the state GDP, a larger share than any other state.  
Though it is easy to understand why energy anxiety has hit new levels, it is a little harder to pinpoint, exactly why. It is a long and complex story. Suffice to say that economic incentives to support utility investment, the necessary process of retiring aging power plants and building replacement generation, inflationary pressures, changing customer demand, and a litany of other factors have all played a role in bringing us to this point. The interplay of these factors help explain why the process of creating balance between customers and utilities — which is the ultimate goal of the regulatory process — is difficult.  
Unfortunately, while Indiana and some very dedicated policymakers and stakeholders have tried very hard to find the right balance between those pressures and their impact on customers, we haven’t gotten the mix quite right. 
Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

At this historic juncture, with a need to expand electric capacity on a scale the likes of which this country has not seen since the 1940s and 50s, we now have two broad paths open to us. One is to keep doing what we have been doing. The other is to try new approaches to adjust the balance. Understanding the story of how we got here is important, not to lay blame, but to focus on the essential question: “Which path do choose?” If we want reliable and affordable power as well as economic prosperity and development, we cannot continue along our current trajectory.  
But if we choose a different path, what does that look like?
One step is to establish better support for customer investment in the energy resources which serve them. Indiana already has customer generation and, in fact, industrial customers in Indiana generate hundreds of megawatts of their own power to support their operations. But more could be done to balance the rights of customers and the interests of utilities. Expanded options for ownership and operational models for customer generation, actively supporting voluntary partnerships between utilities and customers to develop generation, and removing geographic and economic constraints on generation are all positive steps that could expand private investment in energy resources and reduce the need for costly new utility construction at public expense.
We also need to re-evaluate the incentives currently provided to utilities. In the past, Indiana has encouraged infrastructure investment by providing financial incentives for cost recovery. But a sustained cycle of incentivized capital investment by utilities will continue to drive utility rates higher. In that regard, Gov. Mike Braun has suggested we need to be more “attentive” to the investments utilities make.  
One approach would be to revisit prior legislation to add stronger ratepayer protections. Utilities should be required to provide better justification for investments which receive automatic rate recovery; to demonstrate more than ordinary business risk before recovering cost overruns from customers; and adjust their profit margins to reflect the reduced risk arising from pre-approved investments. These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.
Indiana has many advantages as we head into the future. Our location at the Crossroads of America means we have the highways, the pipelines, the transmission facilities and other resources to propel ourselves forward. As we consider that future, no single answer is the “right” one. It is clear that if we want different outcomes, we need to implement different approaches.  Hopefully, we choose that path.

There will soon be fewer steelhead released into Washington’s waters due to the impending closure of Skamania Hatchery. 
Located in Washougal, the hatchery produces summer and winter steelhead that are released into southwest Washington rivers for recreational fishing. 
The hatchery produces 331,000 steelhead per year, according to the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
Operations at Skamania Hatchery will begin to slow in in the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July, as the state Department of Fish and Wildlife begins the three-year process of closing the facility. 
The Washougal and Beaver Creek hatcheries will take over some steelhead production. 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife estimates that closure of the Skamania Hatchery will reduce the total production of steelhead in Washington by 161,000 per year after factoring in the increased fish from the other facilities.
The hatchery’s closure will most strongly affect southwest Washington recreational steelhead anglers, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife announced its decision to close Skamania Hatchery in June after not receiving its full two-year budget request from the state Legislature. 
The agency had asked the Legislature for $1.9 million to maintain operations at the North Toutle and Skamania hatcheries, but only received $750,000 as lawmakers worked earlier this year to resolve a budget deficit in the $12 billion to $16 billion range. 
“This funding is far short of the amount needed to sustain current hatchery operations at both facilities,” the Department of Fish and Wildlife said in its budget request for next year. 
The North Toutle Hatchery produces Tule Fall Chinook and coho salmon. 
With only enough funding to support continued operations at one of the two hatcheries, the Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that the benefits of keeping the North Toutle Hatchery open outweighed the benefits of the Skamania Hatchery. 
Rather than asking the Legislature to backfill its initial request amid declining revenue forecasts, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is asking for $432,000 in the 2026 supplemental budget to start closing Skamania Hatchery. 
“The Department recognizes the necessity of exercising fiscal restraint this year
considering falling revenue forecasts, rising caseload costs, shifting federal impacts, and
increasing tort liabilities,” Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind said in a letter to Office of Financial Management Director K.D. Chapman-See. 
Two Skamania Hatchery staff will be reassigned to the Washougal Hatchery but stay onsite at the Skamania Hatchery to oversee the three-year closure process. 
Those staff members will continue trapping and fish ladder operations for returning adult fish that were released from the hatchery as juveniles. 
Staff will finish closing the hatchery and begin decommissioning it once there are no more adult fish returning. 
Decommissioning the hatchery will involve removing any intake or other in­water structures, demolishing infrastructure and restoring habitat in the area. 
That process may take an additional six years after the hatchery closes and cost roughly $8 million, which the Department of Fish and Wildlife said will need to come from a future capital budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/485006935_1056478596514356_3017860874306171660_n-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Without this, Michigan would have had to either dig into state coffers at the expense of other priorities to maintain existing services, or it would have lost billions of dollars in Medicaid funding, restricting Michiganders’ access to health care, eliminating coverage for important services like doulas or community health workers, and disrupting our state health care system for everyone. This was necessary and we are thrilled the Michigan Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer took steps to protect it.
Michigan Democrats blunted the effects of Trump’s tax reforms. Now businesses are bristling.

Stronger and more equitable school funding, including an increase in per-pupil spending and increased funding focused on the students who need it most, additional funding for student mental health services, and the continuation of universal free school meals are all vital to ensuring kids have what they need to learn. We were pleased to see these things make it into the final budget agreement. An investment in technology to protect Bridge card users from benefit theft was also included as well as a significant down payment in the expansion of the successful and evidence-based Rx Kids program, which will help more Michigan babies and parents get a stronger start toward health and economic security.

While it’s positive that the Legislature looked at state revenue streams and recognized that the status quo just wasn’t good enough, we are concerned that roads were prioritized at the expense of more meaningful investments in the people of Michigan at a time when they need it most. 
Despite the budget agreement including some things that center Michiganders’ needs, more must be done to truly shield them from the harm caused by the federal megabill. The most vulnerable of Michiganders will be hit the hardest by the megabill at a time when they are already struggling to make ends meet. We know from our latest Kids Count in Michigan data released a couple of weeks ago that more than 17% of our state’s children are living in poverty, and over 40% of Michigan households are either in poverty or can’t afford the basic cost of living. 
And while early childhood is the age group that has the biggest return on investment, Michigan lawmakers largely left them out this year. We were deeply concerned that, overall, the budget lacked a holistic approach to funding the early childhood service sector and a comprehensive strategy to address the early childhood workforce shortage. 
Additionally, funding for other services, such as Early On and early literacy programs, was at best held flat or decreased at a time of growing need. What’s worse is that funding for our Great Start Collaboratives, which serve as an important resource to families through connections to services, home visiting programs and parent education, was completely eliminated, breaking a nearly two-decade-long commitment to these support systems that serve thousands of kids each year. As child care and early education programs remain out of reach for many Michigan families due to both the high cost and lack of availability, we need further investment, not stagnating funding.

Budgets are not just spreadsheets, they are moral documents, and the people of Michigan — kids, families and workers — should always be central to them. 
The agreement that was finally reached doesn’t completely miss the mark in that regard, but we had hoped to see more people-centered investments to mitigate more of the harm caused by federal funding cuts to programs Michigan families and our local communities rely upon to stay healthy and thriving. In the face of increases in child care costs, rising housing costs and unknown future health care costs, our state lawmakers need to continue to champion policies that will protect Michiganders from what we know are going to be some extremely challenging times ahead.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, Pool)After three executions in less than a year — ending a nearly 15-year pause in Indiana’s use of capital punishment — it’s not clear when the state will carry out another.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four are currently considered competent for execution. 
No new inmates have been added since 2013, and capital prosecutions remain rare and costly.
While prosecutors say there are still appropriate cases for capital punishment, local jurisdictions are increasingly weighing when those charges are best pursued compared to life-without-parole sentences, especially given the legal costs and the length of appeals.
“Prosecutors are using this only when absolutely necessary,” said Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull. “Justice sometimes demands it — but it must also be reliable, fair and certain.”
There’s no timeline for the next execution — it’s up to the Indiana Attorney General’s Office to request execution dates from the state supreme court.
The future of execution methods is also unclear, given mounting scrutiny over how much Indiana taxpayers have paid for the lethal injection drug pentobarbital used in the state’s three most recent executions.
 Who remains on Indiana’s death row
Indiana’s remaining condemned inmates are housed at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.
Eric D. Holmes was sentenced in 1993 for a double murder during a 1989 robbery at a Marion County Shoney’s restaurant. Holmes and an accomplice ambushed three former coworkers, killing two with knives. His federal habeas appeal was denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review his case.
Kevin Isom was sentenced in 2013 for killing his wife, Cassandra, and her two teenage children in Gary in 2007. He fired at responding officers before a SWAT team took him into custody. His case remains under federal habeas corpus review.
Jeffrey Weisheit was sentenced in 2013 for the deaths of two children in Vanderburgh County. Prosecutors said he bound and gagged 5-year-old Caleb and 8-year-old Alyssa Lynch before setting his home on fire. His most recent federal appeal was denied in 2023.
William Clyde Gibson III, sentenced in separate cases in 2013 and 2014 for killing three women — Karen Hodella, Stephanie Kirk and Christine Whitis — in Floyd County. Each was strangled to death in 2012. His appeals are ongoing in federal court.
Michael Dean Overstreet was sentenced in 2000 for the 1997 kidnapping, rape and murder of 18-year-old Kelly Eckart in Johnson County. He was declared mentally incompetent for execution in 2014, effectively suspending his death sentence unless a future court finds him competent.
Three others who were long listed on Indiana’s death row — Joseph Corcoran, Benjamin Ritchie and Roy Ward — have since been executed. 
Corcoran was executed in December 2024 for the 1997 killings of four men in Fort Wayne — one brother and three friends — marking Indiana’s first execution since 2009.
Ritchie was executed in May for the 2000 shooting death of Beech Grove Police Officer William Toney.
And Ward was put to death earlier this month for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County, marking the state’s third execution in twelve months.
Pending capital cases
No new inmates have been added to Indiana’s death row since 2013. But several defendants across the state currently face capital murder charges.
According to data from the Indiana Supreme Court and county filings, four defendants have pending death penalty cases: John Adams in Marion County; Carl Boards II in Madison County; Orlando Mitchell in Marion County; and Dalonny Rodgers in Hendricks County.
County prosecutors have not filed any new death penalty cases in 2025, as of mid-October. 
Over the past five years, filings have been limited to between one and three capital cases per year — a decline from the 1990s and early 2000s, when multiple capital prosecutions often ran simultaneously, according to state data. 
Three new death penalty cases were filed in 2021, two in 2022, two in 2023 and one in 2024, Supreme Court data shows.
Prosecutors weigh costs, time and other factors
Mull chairs the Indiana Prosecuting Attorney Council’s Complex Litigation Committee that advises Hoosier prosecutors on capital cases, law enforcement shootings and other highly complicated cases. He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that prosecutors reserve death penalty filings for “the worst of the worst offenders.”
“These cases are filed where we have very strong and incontrovertible proof of guilt,” Mull said. “We do not want to be a state where we have someone who is wrongfully put on death row.”

He noted that while justice sometimes requires pursuing the death penalty, prosecutors also weigh a defendant’s mental condition and the toll that lengthy appeals take on victims’ families.
“Many families simply don’t want to go through decades of appeals and hearings,” Mull said. “They want closure. Life without parole often accomplishes that.”
Costs of capital litigation are another consideration.
“These cases can run into the millions of dollars over time,” he said. “Counties generally get reimbursed for a percentage of that by the state, but it can still leave taxpayers locally on the hook for a huge amount of money.”
Death penalty prosecutions can cost counties millions to litigate, depending on how long the case remains active.
Multiple state studies — including a 2010 review by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency — have found that a death penalty case in Indiana costs about five times more than a comparable case seeking life without parole, largely because of the extra trials, legal motions, expert witnesses and appeals required.
The Indiana Abolition Coalition further points to counties that have been forced to raise taxes or divert road funds to cover the costs of single capital prosecutions that later resulted in life sentences instead.
Under Indiana law, counties can seek 50% reimbursement for defense costs in death penalty cases through the Indiana Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys.
Marion, Madison and Wayne counties collectively received more than $230,000 capital reimbursements during the 2024–25 fiscal year for ongoing cases, according to the CCAA’s latest annual report.
Statewide, capital reimbursements totaled about $197,000 in fiscal year 2022–23 and $312,000 in 2023–24, according to CCAA data.
Mull emphasized that the state’s appellate process can take decades, contributing to delays that frustrate families and communities. He suggested lawmakers consider legislation to shorten appellate timelines, arguing that “citizens and victims have a right to speedy justice,” just as defendants do.
“There’s no reason it should take 10 or 20 years to determine whether it was a fair trial,” he said.
Questions over Indiana’s execution drugs
The state resumed executions last year using pentobarbital, a single drug protocol also used by the federal government.
Gov. Mike Braun’s office has refused to disclose how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months.
At least one of those sets of pentobarbital was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. The remaining sets will expire at the end of the month, according to court documents.

The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
Over the past year, Braun and several Republican lawmakers have discussed potential alternatives to lethal injection amid ongoing shortages and legal challenges.
Some have floated legislation to authorize nitrogen hypoxia, mirroring Alabama’s new method, while others have proposed a review of whether the state should keep the death penalty at all.
Bills to abolish capital punishment have been filed in recent sessions but have not received hearings.
Federal death row in Terre Haute
Indiana is also home to the nation’s only federal execution chamber, located in the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. The facility gained national attention during the final months of the first Trump administration, when officials carried out 13 executions there between 2020 and 2021.
Today, only three men remain on federal death row — two of them housed in Terre Haute. The third, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing, is being held in Colorado because of what Bureau of Prisons officials have described as “unique security management requirements.”
Federal executions have been paused since 2021, though, when former President Joe Biden ordered a moratorium to review the government’s use of pentobarbital. In December 2024, Biden commuted the death sentences of 37 of the 40 men who were then on federal death row, converting their punishments to life without parole.
He did not commute the sentences of Tsarnaev; Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston church; and Robert Bowers, convicted in the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.
Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has pledged to restart executions in Terre Haute and directed Justice Department officials to assist state prosecutors interested in re-trying Biden clemency recipients in states that retain the death penalty.

This story was originally published by ProPublica. Sign up to receive their biggest stories. 
When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.
Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.
“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”
One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”
And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”
During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.
Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.
Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.
And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.
One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”
The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.
The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.
The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.
The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.
Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.
“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”
Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”
“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”
Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.
In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.
“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.
McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”
“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.
Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.
The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.
“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”
‘Authoritarian playbook’
Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.
“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”
Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.
And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”
U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.
Where the fallout is felt
The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.
The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”
Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.
“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”
In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.
“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.
In plain sight
Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.
Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”
With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.
On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”
The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.
Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.
Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.
“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”
Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.
“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.
Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.
Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2224603707-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Mikie Sherrill in her bid to become New Jersey’s next governor, a strategy election observers say is intended to secure the support of voters who loathe President Donald Trump.

You’re loud, you’re proud, and you don’t eff around,” Whitmer said. “This is a clear choice: We got a guy who’s going to get bossed around by D.C, versus a woman who can get sh*t done. We got a bad actor who’s willing to sell you out, or a badass Navy pilot who will take on any woman who messes with New Jersey.”
Thousands protest Donald Trump at New Jersey No Kings rallies

Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University and executive director of the FDU Poll, said enlisting Democrats’ most notable national names earns Sherrill media coverage while also helping her overcome lackluster support among some Democratic factions and reinforce her message that she will fight the Trump administration.
“She understands that perhaps people aren’t excited to vote for her, but they will crawl over broken glass to vote against Donald Trump. And so she’s doing everything she can to try and make it seem like voting for Mikie Sherrill is voting against Donald Trump,” Cassino said. “If you’re trying to nationalize the race, bringing in national figures helps to do that and helps to build her narrative of saying, ‘This is a national race, not a local race.’”
It’s a strategy other Democratic candidates have embraced too, with Jersey City mayoral hopeful Mussab Ali this season touting endorsements from Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN).
Jack Ciattarelli, Sherrill’s Republican rival, has brought in several GOP VIPs, including MAGA influencers like Scott Pressler and Jack Posobiec, who appeared at a Ciattarelli rally earlier this month in Wildwood, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who appeared with Ciattarelli at the Saddle Brook Diner last Wednesday. Posobiec again joined Ciattarelli in Dumont on Sunday.
But Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has not had lawmakers with higher name ID at his side the way Sherrill has. Observers say that’s probably deliberate.

Bringing in national politicians to campaign with him doesn’t quite square with Ciattarelli’s favorite line that he’s a lifelong Jersey guy focused solely on the Garden State while Sherrill is an out-of-stater who may have higher aspirations, said Ashley Koning, a political science professor at Rutgers University and director of its Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling.
Many GOP politicians nationally have become so polarizing that inviting them to campaign here becomes a “difficult dance” for Ciattarelli, Koning added.
With a moderate Republican at his side, he could irritate the White House, an unwise move considering Trump endorsed him, she said. Yet a more conservative Republican campaigning for him risks alienating undecided voters in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000 and unaffiliated voters comprise over a third of all registered voters, she said.
“It is so hard to pinpoint what kind of national Republican would play well with voters in New Jersey right now, because at least historically, we’ve had a very different brand of Republicanism than is being executed on the national stage right now,” Koning said.
She added: “Even if they have their party base on their side and with increases in Republican registration, he still likely needs independents to cross the finish line.”
The Sherrill campaign’s choice of backers — moderate Democrats instead of more polarizing politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) — is also likely intentional, Cassino and Koning agreed.
“These are obviously kind of popular, or not really controversial, political figures, at least among Democrats and independents,” Koning said.
While persuading popular lawmakers to stand beside her bolsters Sherrill’s cachet as a four-term congresswoman, it also underscores an unsavory reality about politics — money motivates, Cassino said.
Donors might be more generous seeing big-name politicians support her, while those politicians might hope Sherrill returns the favor someday, he said. Gateway to Leadership, a Sherrill-affiliated leadership PAC, raised nearly $400,000 in the 2023-24 election cycle and donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and groups, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks campaign finance.
“Mikie Sherrill is a very prolific fundraiser, and so other politicians want to be on her good side because she might be giving them money at some point. It’s not a quid pro quo, but it is definitely something that makes her more popular and makes people want to come out in support of her,” he said.
If nothing else, luring big-name politicians to New Jersey can make the race more interesting, said Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. Voters from both major parties are used to hearing from state party leaders but don’t often get to see or interact with national leaders, he added.
“This is a fun chance to meet national figures who they read about, see on TV, and follow on social media,” Rasmussen said. “I don’t think there’s a serious risk for the campaigns — there’s always the possibility of backlash for a controversial position or a misspeak, but these are experienced, polished leaders who aren’t looking to jam up themselves or anyone else.”
Whoever the candidates line up to stump for them, though, doesn’t signify anything about how the race is going, observers said.
“I know we’re all trying to read the tea leaves,” Cassino said. “But the candidates are just as much in the dark as the rest of us are.”
Ciattarelli campaign spokesman Eric Arpert said Sherrill’s reliance on out-of-state Democratic lawmakers is an attempt to “save her failing final efforts.”
“She’ll never understand the problems we face, and can’t be trusted to fix them. Jack’s campaign continues to be about delivering the positive change New Jersey so desperately needs, and it’s why our momentum and energy continue to grow,” he said.
Asked in Paramus whether enlisting Democratic lawmakers from other states illustrates Ciattarelli’s frequent attack line that he is from New Jersey and she is not, Sherrill said she thinks people “know what I’m focused on.”
“I have been directly focused on driving down costs for families and running on my record of effectiveness and ruthless confidence, if you will, and of course my opponent continues to run away from his record, while at the same time supporting Trump, who is driving up costs for everyone. That seems to be resonating with people,” she said.

And what about the Royals, the other team state lawmakers were hoping to convince to stay in Missouri when they created the subsidy program?  Crickets. 
A ballot summary prepared by Hoskins’ office for a pair of proposed initiative petitions seeking to repeal the stadium funding law declares that voter approval could “likely cause the Kansas City Chiefs to move their stadium from Missouri to Kansas.”
There is no mention of the Royals, an omission that sparked a flurry of questions — and criticism. 
Does Hoskins have some reason to believe the Royals have already decided to leave the state or have no intention of using the stadium tax incentives? 
Or, as critics allege, is Hoskins hoping to sink the measure by making predictions about the future plans of the Chiefs, who — unlike the Royals — have a statewide fanbase, three recent championships, and a star player in Patrick Mahomes who is the face of the sport?
The Secretary of State’s Office insists it has neither inside knowledge of the Royals’ intentions nor a desire to bias voters against the proposed repeal. In a statement, the office said it “does not have access to or knowledge of the private business decisions of any professional sports franchise,” and that the ballot summary must reflect the “clearest, most immediate potential consequence” of the law.
Besides, Hoskins’ office said, the current version of the summary is just the “first bite at the apple.” A recently approved state law gives the secretary of state up to three times to get the ballot language right — if proponents are upset enough about the first version to take the issue to court. 
Brad Ketcher, a lawyer working with the group behind the ballot measure to repeal the subsidy, believes that’s the point. Writing an unfair ballot summary forces backers of initiative petitions to invest the time and money into legal challenges that could otherwise be dedicated to gathering signatures or engaging with voters. 
“Hoskins is all but admitting,” Ketcher said, “that he drafted flawed language with an eye toward slowing the measure.”
Lawsuit, threat of criminal charges part of GOP effort to block vote on Missouri map

Over the last month, Hoskins has found himself at the center of the political storm, facing criticism — and lawsuits — over his office’s role in the initiative petition and referendum process. 
Hoskins has used his authority to pre-emptively reject 100,000 signatures for a proposed referendum on Missouri’s new congressional map. He’s also come under fire for crafting what critics call “deceptive and prejudicial” summary statements for two public‐education related constitutional amendments. 
He was tasked with rewriting the ballot language for a proposal to reinstate Missouri’s abortion ban after a Cole County judge determined the initial wording by lawmakers failed to alert voters that the amendment would ban most abortions. 
But his initial draft was rejected when the judge determined it was “insufficient and unfair.” Hoskins got the judge’s sign off on the summary on his next attempt. 
Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist in Missouri, filed a lawsuit earlier this year asking a judge to strike down a new law that says any ballot language deemed insufficient or unfair by a court must be sent back to the secretary of state up to three times for revision. If, after three attempts, the courts still find the language unacceptable, a judge is then allowed to rewrite it themselves.
Nicholson said Hoskins’ behavior is exactly why the law is so dangerous and should be overturned.
“Denny Hoskins is required to write fair and impartial language,” Nicholson said. “But instead, he is reinforcing all the concerns people had when the legislature passed the law, that a bad-faith politician could use it to waste the people’s time and resources.” 
As for the Chiefs and Royals, their future — in Missouri or Kansas — remains unresolved. 
“We have heard nothing to indicate that the Royals have decided to leave the State of Missouri,” said Gabby Picard, a spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, whose office plays no role in the intuitive petition process, when asked about the team’s omission from the ballot summary.
“In fact,” Picard said, “Gov. Kehoe and his team remain in frequent communication with the Royals and the Chiefs to ensure that both teams stay in Missouri — where they belong.”
The teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums in Jackson County expire in 2030. Kansas lawmakers put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums.
The Missouri plan would allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties. The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years.
Missouri AG, General Assembly seek to dismiss lawsuit against stadium funding bill

A pair of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit hoping to get the entire package thrown out, arguing it violates the constitution by including multiple provisions and aid to private interests. 
The initiative petitions aiming to repeal the stadium subsidy seek to direct any money saved toward preventing cuts to Medicaid that could result from legislation passed this summer by Congress. 
Hoskins, Ketcher alleges, “has chosen to protect billions for billionaire sports team owners at the expense of everyday Missourians and their health care.” 
For his part, Hoskins defended his work — and his team loyalties. 
“Secretary Hoskins applauds the Royals on a hard-fought season and, like many Missourians, is cheering on the Chiefs this football season,” his office said in a statement. “Regardless of team colors, the goal remains the same: ensuring Missouri voters have the facts they need to make an informed decision at the ballot box.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/032625_RighttoLifeHoskins-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

They need to make it the highest priority.","Classroom coaching is a proven strategy that improves reading scores with relatively little investment, by hiring coaches to work one-on-one with teachers on how they can improve their students' reading, writes Kalman Hettleman. (Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Education)Most teachers aren’t taught to teach reading. They should be and they’re supposed to be. And you would think they are.
There are many programs to teach them, spanning roughly pre-service college undergraduate and graduate degrees, certification/licensure, in-service guidance manuals, classroom coaching and “professional learning” sessions (which are short and scattershot).
Yet, the evidence is incontrovertible that the great majority of teachers haven’t been brought up to speed to teach reading, which is a lot more demanding than you think.
Still, no surprise, there’s no ready fix. Improvements in each of the training modes are necessary.
But there is one reform that can be a gamechanger: It’s classroom coaching that allows well-trained coaches to work one-on-one with classroom teachers.
In fact, classroom coaches are key drivers in state Superintendent Carey Wright’s flagship early literacy initiative. Wright, who came to nationwide fame for the remarkable increase in literacy that occurred when she was state superintendent in Mississippi, cites classroom coaches as a vital, if not indispensable, feature of the “Mississippi miracle.”

The job description for coaches encompasses in class-support, modeling instructional strategies, and helping teachers analyze data on student performance. At the same time, the coaching must be custom-tailored to each teacher’s strengths and weaknesses. All of which require that the ratio of coaches to classroom teachers be realistic.  Beware the educational curse of programs that are a mile wide and an inch deep.
In Mississippi, Wright took the bold, and probably unprecedented, step of scouring local districts for good coach candidates, then hired them as state employees under her direct supervision. She intends to pull off the same feat in Maryland — if funds are available.
She and the state board of education are making an all-out effort to corral funding. At the last session of the General Assembly, the Maryland State Department of Education’s priority request included kindergarten to third grade literacy coaches, but it was not funded. MSDE intends to resubmit the request at the coming session.
For now, Wright is making a start with the Comprehensive State Literacy Development Grants Project. The $40 million federal grant over five years is being channeled to local school districts for literacy initiatives, with coaching a leading priority.
In addition, she is pitching coaching to foundations. So far, funding has been obtained for pilot coaching in one local district.
Unfortunately, the prospects for more funding from Annapolis, especially for coaches to work with a reasonable number of classroom teachers, are not bright. Requests for more money are a political no-no these days because of the state’s fiscal problems.
Nonetheless, funding for coaches would require only a relatively small amount of funding. By rough calculation, $30 million would be a significant down payment on the number of classroom literacy coaches needed statewide.
At the same time, it is essential that the funding be additional state aid, not funding diverted from other Blueprint initiatives. Bear in mind that classroom instruction is almost in a class by itself in current underfunding under the Blueprint. The Kirwan Commission and the Blueprint missed the boat in failing to provide funding earmarked for them — a fatal flaw, unless corrected.
As things now stand, classroom coaching poses a litmus test of whether Annapolis means what it says when it proclaims support for early literacy — the gateway to fulfillment of the Blueprint and student success.
So, Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly: Invest in early literacy, with classroom coaches the highest priority, and our schoolchildren (and taxpayers) will get the greatest dividends.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/US-Dept-Education-photo-tutoring-1.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

What is the endgame? What are the real goals behind the suppression and gutting of the processes that have been the bedrock of the democratic process in America?
Endgame is not just a short or long-term effect or result. It means the final, decisive stage of any strategic activity.
What do you think the final result will be of some of the disturbing and questionably illegal actions occurring in the halls of government in our state and nation?
In Missouri, what is the endgame of a governor who follows the dictates of a national Republican agenda when it comes to denying abortion care, signing a redistricting map whose origin is in question and making direct participation in the democratic process more difficult, if not impossible — all of which are contrary and diametrically opposed to the will of the majority of Missourians?
What is the endgame?
When all is said and done, what life might be like for Missourians cannot be minimized.
Typically, we see damaging legislation, policies and budget cuts as cyclical, and find some measure of comfort. We believe and hope that changes will occur in the next election cycle and things could get better with a new incoming administration.
Given the political climate we are in, with the rapid and extreme changes taking place at the state and national level, there is a greater chance that recovery might be extremely difficult, or worse, might never occur.
Our state and Congressional representatives willingly give tacit and overt approval of what appears to be arbitrary policy changes, budget cuts, new tariffs and other measures that hurt many Missourians. Will the effects be short-term or lasting?
That’s especially true when it comes to the cuts in Medicaid, which will deny many Missourians needed health care and other services, as well as result in the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers, eliminating access to critically-needed medical treatment.
Or when it comes to farmers not having access to markets to sell their produce, running the risk of losing farms that have been in families for generations.
Or when it comes to being able to deal with the rising costs of groceries and other consumer goods.
Are these current conditions temporary or do they represent the quality of life to come?
On the national level, what is the endgame when our branches of government — executive, legislative and judicial — repeatedly disregard their role and responsibilities, then abuse, capitulate or totally forfeit their constitutional powers when it comes to executing and protecting the integrity of our democracy?
Will the disregard for the rule of law be a short-term occurrence with this administration or will it become the norm of future administrations?
Paying close attention to what is occurring in the legislative halls and the streets in cities and states across America should compel us all to ask: what is the endgame?
When we are constantly bombarded with lies, distortions, divisive name-calling, hate speech, coming from the very political leaders who should be promoting collaboration and finding solutions — Is this just temporary?
Or will it result in a total collapse of our political values, traditions, civic culture and civility itself.
Just as important: what is our game plan to make sure all the disregard for the democratic principles and laws that define America is short-term and short-lived?
Teams that survive and ultimately win do not leave their game plan up to chance. They do not just sit idlily by, watch and hope that the opposing team gives up their fight and loses the game.
They become intimately familiar with the tactics and plays of the opposing team.
Teams that win also have an offensive and defensive game plan and strategies to counter the opposing team that they commit to and consistently employ.
For those of us who do not like the game we are in, and the possible long-term results, we need to determine our own desired endgame.
What will it be?
What team will you be on?

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)When patients struggling with opioid addiction walk into the newly opened Community Medical Services (CMS) clinic on Milwaukee’s South Side, “we want them to feel that this is a space for healing and growth,” said Amanda Maria De Leon, regional community impact manager for CMS. The clinic provides therapy and medication-assisted treatment for people working to stabilize their lives after addiction.
Medication-assisted treatment involves medications like Methadone to control opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Together with therapy, medication-assisted treatment allows patients to begin to stabilize and repair their lives. Although studies have associated medication-assisted treatment with reductions in overdoses and other improved recovery outcomes, its use also carries stigma. Confronting that social disapproval, while also providing a comfortable environment for patients, is part of the mission of CMS.

Walking into the clinic, patients are met with an open waiting room and ample seating. There is a small area with toys for young children in one corner, and across the room nurses sit at a desk waiting to check in patients. Hanging over the small play area is a plaque dedicated to a young girl who spoke at one of the city zoning hearings in favor of the clinic opening. De Leon explained that the girl, who was 8 years old at the time, had befriended a local unhoused man to whom she’d given food. “She knew he needed treatment,” De Leon told the Wisconsin Examiner, saying the girl told the zoning board, “I want them to open this clinic for my friend.” 
Around a corner from the lobby, behind a set of protective glass windows, nurses dispense liquid methadone into small cups for patients on a daily basis. Walls and therapy rooms throughout the facility are painted calming  blues and  greens, and feature art or motivational messages. Small, decorative coffee tables sit between two small couches large enough for one or two people to sit facing each other. 
“We create a space like this intentionally, because we don’t want a patient to feel like it’s a transaction,” De Leon told the Examiner. She said that the facility is designed to be therapeutic both to the patients and the staff, to mitigate burnout.

Dr. Dan Lemieux, one of the medical doctors at CMS, said that he’s “used to the hustle and bustle” of a clinic. His background began in family medicine, where Lemieux was used to seeing 20-25 patients each day. Over time he also began working in Suboxone treatment programs. “I think about eight years ago I kind of pulled back on family medicine a little bit and did a little more time in addiction,” Lemieux told the Wisconsin Examiner. “I found it more gratifying, enjoyed helping people a little bit more.” Lemieux began working at methadone clinics after the COVID-19 pandemic and found his way to CMS, where he has worked for about two years. 
Lemieux has worked as the medical director of CMS clinics in West Allis, Madison, Fond du Lac, and now the Southside Milwaukee Clinic. Recalling the workload at West Allis, Lemieux told the the Examiner, “I think the counselors are really good at just keeping the flow going, and the front desk staff. So it never seemed overwhelming or busy, and the clients are always very appreciative.” Lemieux said he likes the highly focused sessions in recovery work, because “you can really spend your time kind of helping the client with those particular issues.” 
Overdose deaths driven by the synthetic opioid fentanyl began skyrocketing in Milwaukee County around 2016, claiming hundreds of lives annually. New records for overdose deaths were set and broken every year from 2018 to 2022, when the death toll peaked at 674 lives lost. Nearly 5,800 non-fatal overdoses occurred that same year, according to the county’s overdose dashboard.

Recently, as new programs and services were established to stem the tide, overdoses began to decline. Last year there were 450 overdose deaths in Milwaukee, so far there have been fewer than half that number this year. CMS is  one of the many organizations on the frontlines of the crisis, both as a treatment clinic and as a harm-reduction advocacy organization. 
De Leon showcased a storage room full of boxes of hygiene kits, testing strips for both fentanyl and the tranquilizer xylazine (a more recent trend in the drug market), and Narcan (used to reverse an overdose), all of which are either used or distributed by the CMS outreach team. Sometimes staff visit homeless encampments and food pantries, other times they hold pop-up events in areas with high overdose rates. The team even organized a sober tailgate at American Family Field at a Milwaukee Brewers game and distributed over 1,200 tickets. 
“We just deliver a little hope,” said De Leon. “Hopefully when you’re feeling a little better you’ll walk into a door of a treatment center. We don’t care where you walk into.” CMS also works with numerous partner organizations including the Milwaukee Overdose Response Initiative (MORI), various fire departments, the West Allis overdose response team and other nodes along an evolving network. 
De Leon said the network has become bigger and more collaborative. At an open house CMS held at  the new clinic, dozens of people showed up, she said, including community members, firefighters and police officers from multiple departments, probation and parole representatives and treatment providers. “I was speechless,” said De Leon. “We had over 70 people show up to our open house…That would have never happened in a methadone treatment world 20 years ago.”

“We’re breaking down silos, we’re educating people,” she added. Today, people have easier access to methadone treatment programs. In Milwaukee County, both the jail and the Community Reintegration Center (formerly known as the House of Corrections) have medication-assisted treatment programs. De Leon stressed that when people are taken to correctional facilities they should tell staff whether they need medication-assisted treatment in order to access those programs. 
The West Allis Fire Department became the first to carry Buprenorphine, which is given to people after reviving them from an overdose to stop sudden withdrawal symptoms. Bipartisan legislation at the state level legalized both fentanyl and xylazine testing strips.
Nevertheless, stigma associated with both addiction and medication-assisted treatment creates barriers to progress. Although CMS has clinics in the cities of West Allis and South Milwaukee, its new clinic is the first it has been able to open in the city of Milwaukee itself. The opening marked an end to years of contentious meetings with the city’s zoning board and local residents. Now, patients living near the South Side won’t need to travel far, and the new clinic could also lighten patient loads at other clinics.

Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic, who represents the district where the new CMS clinic is located, said she supports the treatment center opening. “I strongly supported this facility opening in our community,” Dimitrijevic told the  Examiner. “Providing residents with nearby access to needed health care and harm reduction tools makes us all safer and healthier. I am proud to have led by example on this issue by welcoming CMS to our community and am grateful for their work serving our residents.” 
Another clinic is expected to open up on Milwaukee’s North Side in early 2026. But many people are not sold on medication-assisted treatment, fentanyl testing strips and overdose-reversing medications. In 2023, when the city of Milwaukee’s zoning board approved the North Side clinic, reactions from the community were split. Leadership from the fire departments of Milwaukee and West Allis spoke in favor of CMS opening a clinic, stressing the dire need for relief and treatment access across Milwaukee County. 
Others called treatment centers “predatory” and expressed concerns about the clinic’s   for-profit business model. 
At least one 2014 study, which analyzed self-reported services from disease testing to psychiatric care, found that for-profit providers “were significantly less likely than nonprofit and public programs to offer comprehensive services”. The study said that “interventions to increase the offering of comprehensive services are needed, particularly among for-profit programs.”

Other objections to the new clinic came from neighbors who  argued that opening the clinic would hurt their property values and quality of life. A corporate representative and a real estate attorney from the Vin Baker Treatment Center, a facility named for a Milwaukee Bucks player that is located on N. 76th Street in Milwaukee, said that CMS would disrupt its business, jeopardizing a $3 million investment into the Vin Baker center. Ald. Lamont Westmoreland, who represents a North Side district, also opposed CMS,  referring to city planning documents which recommended against opening social service businesses in the area. “I support treatment facilities, just not at this particular location,” Westmoreland said before the center opened. 
John Koch, national director of community and public relations at CMS, explained that CMS is a for-profit entity with private equity backing. Koch said that the private equity investment, coupled with grants, has allowed the clinic to scale up to address the overdose crisis. opening new treatment centers, providing grants to extend clinic hours and embedding staff with local fire departments and homeless outreach programs for harm reduction. CMS bills Medicaid and other patient insurance to cover  patient care, “and 90% of our people are on Medicaid”, Koch told the Examiner. “We work very heavily with Medicaid. And then outside of that we receive grants to open new projects.” 
The private equity backing allows for “continuous investment back into the company to address the opioid epidemic as it’s needed,” said Koch. “If we were Ma and Popping it and just growing non-profit style, it’s so much slower and we would never be able to match the need.” CMS has opened seven clinics across Wisconsin, with over 70 clinics operating nationwide. “What we’ve been able to do is be innovative with our money, and meet people where they’re at,” said Koch. “So that’s our secret sauce, is using funds to just continue to provide more access to treatment. If we did not have private equity backing, we would never have been able to be this big, or be treating 30,000 people…That’s what’s allowed us to beat the opioid epidemic.”

Koch knows firsthand how treatment access can be the feather on the scale deciding life or death. In 2013, he was living on the streets of Chicago struggling with a heroin addiction. One night, not long after completing his second adult prison sentence, Koch encountered a police officer who saw that he needed help and gave him the number to a treatment center. Koch went the next day to begin recovery, which also included medication-assisted treatment. Today Koch is raising a family  and works to give people the second chance he got years ago. 
Despite such success stories, there is still public skepticism about medication-assisted treatment. De Leon recalled a conversation she had after making a presentation on harm reduction at a national conference. “This guy came up to me and said, ‘You know, you really changed my thinking,’” she said. He mentioned that in some cases people on probation or parole are expected to get off methadone in order to be fully released from supervision, despite the fact that he’s seen it significantly improve people’s lives.

De Leon asked why people were being forced to get off methadone and the man replied, “Well, nobody should be on these medications for the rest of their life.” She countered that if someone is finally stable after decades of addiction then, “Why not?…Would you tell me to get off of my insulin?” The man said no. “Then why would you tell somebody to get off of lifesaving medication that has him the most stable he’s ever been?” People are free to work on tapering off if they choose, but the priority should be stabilizing and saving a life, she argued. 
Dr. Lemieux said that he’s also seen medication-assisted treatment make a difference. “It’s always a tough conversation to try and change minds,” Lemieux told the Examiner. “Just the data that comes out shows that people in recovery are getting jobs, they’re reuniting with family, they’re working more, crime goes down, and it’s just a win. They’re getting their lives back, and just being a part of that is very rewarding and amazing. I just hope that more people see this, realize this, and reducing deaths is just another huge point, too.”

The department accounts for a larger piece of the pie than any other state agency. But it’s unclear where budgeters may want to cut. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers scrutinize Health Department ahead of budget session appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s 2026 budget session is still four months away, but lawmakers are already scrutinizing the Wyoming Department of Health’s budget. 
At $2.2 billion in the current budget, the department accounts for a larger piece of the pie than any other state agency. And some lawmakers are concerned about what may lie in Wyoming’s financial future. 
“Wyoming is headed toward an impending fiscal cliff that is caused by what I believe is unsustainable spending,” Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft said last month at the first meeting of the newly formed Subcommittee on the Wyoming Department of Health Budget. 
In August, Pendergraft made a motion at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting to form the subcommittee, which he now chairs. He sought five meetings. Two of those have already taken place — one in Casper, another online. 
“This has been a fact-finding thing,” Pendergraft told WyoFile. “This isn’t a grudge match. This isn’t going out and trying to hack with a meat cleaver or anything. But the necessity may well be there — that we’re going to be forced to do some cutting. And if that is the case, we want to do so as judiciously as possible.”
At the end of this month, state financial forecasters will release revenue projections to coincide with the governor’s budget preparations. Those estimates will then be revised in January to provide the latest data to lawmakers, who hold the state’s purse strings. Both reports will give a clearer picture of the state’s financial footing. 
Forecasters have long cautioned lawmakers in their CREG reports of the shakiness of the state’s economic picture. Wyoming’s revenue streams are slowly diversifying, but in the process, the state has grown more reliant on its investment portfolio as well as oil and gas production — all of which come with higher volatility than coal. 
While lawmakers wait for the latest forecast, Pendergraft said it’s important to be prepared to make tough choices. 
“We don’t want this to catch us kind of by surprise, like it did in 2017, like it did in 2021,” Pendergraft said. 
In 2017, a fossil-fuel bust resulted in an 8% across-the-board cut to the state budget. And on the heels of the COVID pandemic, Gov. Mark Gordon signed a budget in 2021 that included over $430 million in cuts and the elimination of more than 300 state positions. 
“We wanted to learn from those experiences and not repeat bad mistakes if possible,” Pendergraft said. 
The formation of the subcommittee also reflects changing political winds at the statehouse. 
In even-numbered years, lawmakers create a two-year budget, and 2026 will mark the first budget session since the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won control of the lower chamber in the 2024 election. With that victory, caucus members and allies, including Pendergraft, comprise all but one member of the House Appropriations Committee. The panel has considerable power since it gets the first crack at the budget alongside its Senate counterparts. 
In April, the caucus announced it aimed to take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing Wyoming’s budget by identifying unconstitutional and wasteful spending.” 
Altogether, another budget showdown could be in the works — with the Department of Health’s comparatively large budget at the center of it. 
In 2024, the Senate passed the budget by just two votes after most Freedom Caucus members and allies voted against it in the House. In a surprise and unprecedented move earlier this year, the Senate refused to pass a supplemental budget after the two chambers split on several spending policies. 
The subcommittee’s meetings have so far contrasted with the caustic budget fights of the last few years. The tone has been cordial and data has driven much of the conversation as Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson has walked the committee through the ins and outs of the agency’s mission and budget at the last two meetings.

In September, Johansson guided the subcommittee — which, alongside Pendergraft, includes Powell Republican Sen. Dan Laursen and Laramie Democrat Rep. Trey Sherwood — through each of the department’s four divisions. 
Approximately 95% of the department’s budget covers medical services, including via facilities like the Wyoming State Hospital in Evanston, the Life Resource Center in Lander and the Veterans Home in Buffalo. The other 5% accounts for administrative costs, such as claims processing and state employee salaries. 
Wyoming has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, so the federal-state health insurance program is reserved for certain low-income and medically needy individuals and families. As of August, 66,225 Wyoming residents are enrolled in Medicaid — 61% are children. 
Like other state-federal programs, for every dollar Wyoming spends on Medicaid, the federal government contributes a matching amount. Those kinds of matching funds can restrict lawmakers — if the state doesn’t spend, the federal government doesn’t match. 
“There are some constraints within that budget … that are important to consider when looking at the budget overall,” Elizabeth Martineau, senior fiscal analyst with the Legislative Service Office, told the subcommittee in September. 
Martineau pointed to, for example, the preschool services unit of the state’s budget. 
“If you don’t meet that maintenance of effort, you could lose those funds,” she said. 
Likewise, investing in community mental health services can save the state money in other areas, Andy Summerville of the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers, told the committee. 
Community mental health centers are a large item in the department’s budget, Summerville said, but their budget has remained mostly flat since 2002, mostly between $50 and $55 million per year. 
“One of the unique characteristics of the community mental health centers is that part of the behavioral health redesign mission is diversion away from state institutions,” Summerville said. “It’s diversion away from the state hospital, life resource center, keeping people in their communities, working with the criminal justice population much more strongly now, trying to keep them out of jail or reduce recidivism.” 
Separately, health officials and many county sheriffs are pushing lawmakers to support legislation to boost treatment for mentally ill people detained in county jails while they wait for a bed at the state hospital. 
Pat Sweeney, a former Republican lawmaker from Casper, also testified to the committee. He was a member of the House in both 2017 and 2021. 
“During the pandemic, Department of Health did an unbelievable job trying to manage that,” Sweeney said. “But did our citizens suffer because of it? Yes.”
Pendergraft asked Sweeney if he had “any large regrets” from the times the Legislature had to cut. 
“I think we could have been maybe a little more strategic than across the board,” Sweeney said.
The subcommittee’s next meeting is Nov. 7 in Casper.

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City on the first day of school on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Rather than continuing the chaotic annual strategy of throwing everything  but the kitchen sink at Oklahoma’s failing public school system, it’s clear that we need leaders with the vision to develop a 10-year roadmap.
Because I don’t know about you, but over the past decade, it’s felt like we’ve careened from one crisis to another. And somehow we’ve ended up with lawmakers who haven’t been particularly visionary on the public school front, and who have preferred a scattershot approach to tackling whatever happens to be the latest predicament. 
Take the 2025 legislative session, for instance. They weighed or passed laws dealing with cellphone bans, overhauling federally protected individualized education plans, ending virtual school days, mandating recess, free college tuition for the children of long-time teachers, overhauling how school boards operate, tutoring incentives, teacher pipeline grants, extending the educator salary schedule and expanding educator testing requirements. And late in session, lawmakers decided to add an extra day of school to the year in exchange for a seemingly random $25 million in new funding. (Yes, we were confused, too.)
And that’s all completely separate from the havoc now ex-state Superintendent Ryan Walters added to the mix. After the session ended, he randomly demanded the end of standardized testing and that schools begin providing free lunches to students – without additional funding to buy that food.
I cannot imagine how destabilizing all this chaos must be to school administrators, staff, teachers and our children, who are always having to pivot because our lawmakers cannot plan effectively and because our leaders give the sense that they’re in constant panic mode.
As the oft-repeated phrase goes: “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results.”
We clearly are there because our results are not moving the needle in a substantive way.
Just take a look at the abysmally low proficiency test scores for  Oklahoma students in reading and math. Just 27% of third graders are classified as proficient or advanced in reading based on national standards. Only 33% hit those grade-level targets in math.
That’s troubling, given the fact that the building blocks for future student success are largely developed in kindergarten through third grade.
Since our leaders can’t seem to come up with a blueprint to set the foundation for legislative policy and funding priorities, I’ll help them.
That plan would ideally include:

A long-term recurring compensation plan for teachers and staff to ensure we’re attracting the most talented educators into our classrooms. Walters showed us with his recruitment signing bonus programs that people will come here if they’re paid well. And, I suspect good teachers will remain if they’re paid competitively. Right now, we rank toward the bottom in the region in terms of pay. And with over $20 an hour average wages offered by private businesses, a starting teacher or staff member can probably make as much or more working full-time at a place like Amazon, which doesn’t have as many politicians meddling in their workday.
Guaranteed money for new textbooks — or electronic learning tools — so schools can plan. 
A huge, recurring investment in tutoring and strategic educational enrichment programs given our children’s lagging learning outcomes.
Planned annual increases in funding to address teachers’ health care benefit costs and to help school districts combat inflation and insurance, all of which are soaring for them just like they are for the rest of us. 
Regular investments in school security. 
An examination of the worthiness of the plethora of school credits lawmakers have haphazardly pushed through over the years. We’re now paying people to send their children to private schools. We offer a tax credit to school donors, and we have a fund aimed at helping property-tax poor districts afford buildings. That last fund is probably a good thing as long as there is a stable, reliable funding source.
And most importantly, it should focus on funding safety net programs, including those operated by other agencies, that help tackle the underlying root issues that may be causing students to struggle: poverty, hunger, homelessness, lack of health care access and mental illness.

It’s been heartbreaking to hear about children who don’t have enough to eat or those that are struggling with unmet emotional needs. Intruder drills have become a reality in our classrooms, but routine investments in security could help harden schools from violence.
Children deal with broken playground equipment or aging technology. And it’s hard to explain to a child that lawmakers are not making proper investments in staff pay so now there’s a shortage of bus drivers, delaying the time it takes them to get home from school.
Enough is enough. 
We’ve managed to develop and implement a visionary plan for our foster care system. We’ve developed a long-term plan for our roadways. 
So why can’t we do the same for our schools? 
In fact, it seems pretty common sense to spend the next 15 or so months bringing together stakeholders from all spectrums of life — parents, educators, lawmakers, nonpartisan education experts, business leaders — and even children.
The roadmap would need to have some flexibility to address policy needs as they develop in our ever-changing world.
Maybe such a plan could be a legacy of Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and his newly appointed state Superintendent Lindel Fields when they both leave office in January 2027.
Because Oklahomans deserve nothing less than a stable path forward for our schools. They deserve to know that our tax dollars are being used efficiently and in the most effective way possible. And they need the assurance that our leaders did what we expect to put a solid plan in place to get our schools moving in the right direction.

Pantries and emergency food providers across the state are bracing for additional stress and demand as changes to the SNAP public food assistance set in and nudge some recipients out. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — He said he worked 20 years for U.S. troops in his homeland of Afghanistan, in roles ranging from soldier to cook and interpreter, before his at-risk family was flown out of the country in 2021 as it fell again to the Taliban.
Now age 46 with 10 children, the Afghan refugee works full-time in a Nebraska production job and says $2,100 in monthly public grocery assistance has helped his family make ends meet. He and his wife expected to gain financial independence as their kids got educated and into careers.
Mohsen asked that his full identity not be revealed, because he fears retaliation against  family members still in Afghanistan. In the U.S. since 2021, he said he now worries about how the loss of public SNAP grocery aid will hurt his family. He and his wife have 10 kids ranging from a toddler to college-aged. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
But any sense of stability has crumbled, the man said, as his family faces the impact of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law that Trump calls “big” and “beautiful” — and Nebraska’s implementation this week of related changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Mohsen, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation against family in the U.S. and abroad, is among an estimated 7,000 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status who are poised to lose their SNAP benefits, according to Nebraska Appleseed, a statewide organization that advocates for low-income people and immigrants. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services put that number closer to 6,300.
 Vets, homeless, foster care impact

Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines. Also eligible are Cuban and Haitian newcomers and those in the U.S. as part of a compact of free association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. 
Currently about 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for SNAP.

According to Appleseed, another 10,000 or so SNAP recipients in Nebraska — including veterans, homeless and people recently aged out of foster care — are at risk of reduced SNAP benefits under changes and stricter work requirements in the new law. Appleseed estimates are based on 2023 data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Supporters of more stringent restrictions have argued that they will increase accountability, self-sufficiency and help cut government spending. 
While the changes were expected to squeeze out some participants — accommodating a reported $186 billion cut in SNAP spending over the next decade — Nebraska’s release last week of details on how the bill impacts local populations has advocacy agencies scrambling to try and ensure no one goes hungry. 
Based on guidance received recently from the feds, DHHS issued a statement Friday on the changes to be enforced starting Oct. 20, 10 days before the federal deadline for full implementation. 
State officials said they’ve started contacting recipients to alert them, and also have assembled a list of frequently asked questions. Eligibility for each person or family is to be reevaluated when they recertify for the program, which happens every six months, or when household characteristics are updated. So cutoffs won’t all happen at once. Mohsen, for example, recently recertified and faces SNAP loss in April.











There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland.


– Tim Williams, Food Bank for the Heartland



DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell noted that Nebraska is mandated to enforce the changes. Due to the federal shutdown, the state is waiting for additional guidance and said it will provide updates as more information is received. Under the new law — backed by all five members of Nebraska’s congressional delegation — states will be subject to financial penalties based on error rates. 
In addition, Nebraska will have to provide an estimated $17 million more in the coming fiscal year to administer the program, said Eric Savaiano, Nebraska Appleseed’s economic justice program manager.
“Monumental” changes, as he called them, have spurred formation of a Nebraska coalition of emergency food providers and refugee advocacy agencies to discuss ways to respond and fill gaps.
 Hit from different directions

Some advocates say it is particularly jarring to know the loss for newcomers, such as Afghans and Ukrainians, who fled war. Refugees and people granted asylum typically left their homelands seeking safety from persecution and violence and have been vetted by the U.S. government to be granted that relief.

In the case of Mohsen, he said he was lawfully admitted to the U.S. in 2021, moved to Nebraska in 2022, and has applied for asylum. He said he previously had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, based on service work with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, and was rejected. While the government has authorized him to work while his asylum application is pending, he does not have permanent residency or citizenship status, which is now grounds for losing SNAP benefits.
“Twenty years I worked with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. They promised they will help me,” Mohsen said. “We already had the hard life in Afghanistan — why make our life so hard here?”
He said hits are coming from other directions, too. Family members have been denied Medicaid benefits, he said. Bills from a few emergency room visits have piled up and haunt him as he has ignored them to pay others.
His three oldest children were denied federal financial aid to attend Nebraska’s public university system, and the reason given, the dad said, was “illegal” immigration status. 
“We did not come here illegally,” he said. The three ended up enrolling at Metropolitan Community College.
Mohsen, interviewed this week after he finished parent-teacher conferences for his elementary-age kids, said his wife stays at home to care for their children. The youngest, 3 years old and a U.S. citizen, likely still could qualify for SNAP.
The Nebraska Examiner sought comments about the megabill’s impact on SNAP from all five members of the Nebraska delegation. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, responded. He said he negotiated to reduce Nebraska’s cost of implementing SNAP by half. 
“I tried to get the best bill possible, while also increasing funding for our military by $150 billion, modernizing our air traffic control and preventing a 20% tax increase on all families,” he said.
 Pantries scramble

Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity says advocates have been trying to prepare for the changes but still hold out hope the state will create a program to help cover lost food benefits.

DHHS’ Powell said all options would be considered.
But the shifts come as Nebraska lawmakers struggle already with a state government budget shortfall. 
Vlach said it feels particularly “immoral” to pull assistance from a refugee who fought alongside the U.S. She said it hints at something darker.
“When we look back at history, every time a targeted group had food taken away, it marked the beginning of something horrific,” she said.
Toby Rees of Kountze Commons in downtown Omaha said her food pantry already is short of proteins supplied by the Food Bank for the Heartland and has tried to compensate by, for example, using donor funds and grants to buy groceries at a discount from cooperating stores. 
“The need is going to increase,” she said, noting the new faces among about 400 people that visited the pantry Monday. Kountze does not ask for income or other verification, nor does it limit  visits, she said. More immigrant and refugee families are seeking a new and “safe” place to get food, she said. 
“It’s really scaring them,” she added.

Vlach said the coalition is preparing documents in 13 languages that provide information and pictures on available Omaha area pantries and places where people can seek food. 
“Everybody’s resources are limited,” said Rees. “But we are banding together.”
Tim Williams of the Food Bank for the Heartland says his organization provides food to about 500 pantries and other partners in 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa. About 20% of commodities comes from the USDA emergency food assistance program and the rest largely from donors and companies. 
He called SNAP one of the most useful tools for families to access nutritious food. The food bank is worried about the added burden on pantries at a time of less federal emergency food assistance and greater demand.
“There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland,” said Williams. 
 Work requirements 

Appleseed’s Savaiano fears that expanded work requirements under the new law will create more administrative paperwork that will “gum up” the process and lead to reduced SNAP benefits for populations beyond refugees and immigrants.
Currently, able-bodied adults are limited to three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they work 20 hours a week or qualify for an exemption. The new law expands work requirements through age 64 (it was age 54 before), and excludes parents with children younger than 14 (it used to be 18). 
DHHS said three groups no longer are exempted from work requirements: veterans, homeless individuals and those aging out of foster care. The state said those exemptions were temporary due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act and now are being removed. A new exception was added for Indians, Urban Indians, and others eligible for Indian Health Services.

Advocates are urging Nebraskans to lean on federal lawmakers to repeal SNAP changes or support alternative programs.
Confounding Mohsen, he said, is why his case seeking a more permanent status has moved so slowly through the immigration court system.
“I worked honestly for those 20 years,” he said of service to the U.S. military. “Sometimes it makes me crazy, it’s upsetting.”
Mohsen hopes to find other avenues to put healthy food on his family’s table, but he is bracing for the last resort. That would be for his older children to quit or delay schooling and help the family financially. He said education and hope for meaningful careers was always the lure of the U.S. 
“Our big hope is education,” Mohsen said. “If they don’t get education, it’s not meaningful for us.”

In multiple instances, the state GOP’s platform contradicts itself and the stated beliefs of traditional Republicans, writes guest columnist Jim Malcom.
The post The Wyoming Republican Party is a big RINO appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Republican Party platform contradicts what traditional Republicans stand for. I say this as a registered Wyoming Republican voter. 

Opinion

The platform has 23 “timeless truths that will always inform and direct our party and our country…” Meanwhile, unlimited guns threaten life, its anti-abortion fixation drives the government to enforce specific religious interpretations and many of these “timeless” principles emerged in the last century.
The first and highest principle listed, Life (No. 1 in the platform), declares the government’s “only purpose” is protecting individual rights. But then the platform immediately begins a series of demands for government control and violations of those same rights.
Real Republicans believe in limited government, defend individual liberty and respect religious freedom. Yet Wyoming’s GOP thinks it knows better than everyone and forces one narrow interpretation of Christianity. They want you and your doctor to follow their interpretation of their religion.
Many Christians, Jews and others differ on when a fetus becomes its own life. (See Genesis 2:7, Job 33:4, etc.). Ancient religious law treated miscarriage as property damage, not murder (Exodus 21:22). But Wyoming’s GOP encodes a specific Christian view. Their theology “trumps” everyone’s law. Consider: Even 60% of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in most cases.
Real Republicans defend property rights. The government can’t touch your land, business or money without due process. But according to the Wyoming GOP, you don’t own your own body. That’s government property now. A rancher’s cattle have more bodily autonomy than Wyoming women under this “Republican” platform.
Here’s the kicker: After claiming their highest value is life, they abandon every policy that helps children survive and thrive — health care, education, childcare, nutrition programs. They chain women to pregnancy and then abandon the children. The contradictions multiply from there.
The second platform principle, Equality, is then violated through many of the rest of the principles. The largest political party in the Equality State, right after declaring equality for all under the law as a principle, goes about carving out special treatment for gun owners, Christians and businesses.
Consider principle No. 3: Second Amendment. First, the GOP platform omits the first half of the actual amendment’s wording, “a well regulated militia,” and then declares there will be no restrictions on arms or ammunition. This undermines their first principle, Life, by exposing schools, churches and public forums to needless gun violence. How can our militia be “well regulated” when driving a car has more restrictions and training requirements than the Wyoming Republicans’ Second Amendment interpretation? No insurance, licensing or background checks required, or even able to be considered.
Equality again is denied in the platform’s sixth plank: Religious Freedom, which gives privilege to Judeo-Christian viewpoints. Thomas Jefferson, who coined the phrase “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence, was also the author of the foundational idea of separation of church and state. The First Amendment says “no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Instead, the platform elevates Christian beliefs and pushes specific versions of those beliefs on women and others. Women may have first gained the right to vote in Wyoming, but the Republican party platform denies them religious equality now.
Another notable example, Right to Work (plank No. 20) effectively discriminates against workers attempting to engage in collective action while ignoring that employers engage in what amounts to collective action through PACs, lobbyists and other means on a regular basis. Their wealth advantage, unbound from living paycheck-to-paycheck, enables them to generate governmental and business pressures on employees that need unions or similar structures to achieve equal consideration.
The history of these so-called “timeless truths” is mind-boggling. Gun control was considered common sense by the NRA and most Americans until the 1970s. Now, school violence is a multibillion dollar industry. 
Then there are the changes over time in the beliefs on unborn children. In 1968, Christianity Today issued the following statement regarding abortion: “Whether the performance of an induced abortion is sinful we are not agreed, but about the necessity of it and permissibility for it under certain circumstances we are in accord.” It wasn’t until the 1980s that abortion became the wedge issue that it is today.
Right to Work laws originated in the 1940s as a strategy to weaken labor unions and was encoded in the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Timeless? Not even close. Michigan repealed right-to-work in 2023, showing that it is not a settled question. Judeo-Christian principles? Christians, including Martin Luther King Jr., have decried right-to-work as “a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights.”
Limited government — except when controlling women. Individual liberty — except for medical decisions. Religious freedom — except for other religions. Constitutional government — except when the Constitution is inconvenient.
Ask yourself who benefits from these principles, and who they harm. A platform with these biases removed would be attractive and defendable by all Wyoming Republicans, not just the most extreme activists.

Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue. July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state senator is calling out Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services because he believes they have been “totally ineffective” in overseeing local abortion clinics. 
He raised the issue this week during a public hearing of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee on several interim studies, including Legislative Resolution 238. That resolution, introduced by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, examined the quality of patient services at Nebraska abortion clinics and the quality of the state’s oversight of the clinics. 
Holdcroft also introduced Legislative Bill 512 earlier this year, which seeks to increase requirements for patients looking to access abortion pills. The bill is pending in the Legislature, waiting on its first round of floor debate. Holdcroft said he intends to focus on the bill during the 2026 session and has no plans to introduce more abortion-related bills next session.

For the hearing and his interim study, Holdcroft did not reach out to either of Nebraska’s two abortion clinics — Planned Parenthood in Omaha and CARE Reproductive Health in Bellevue. He said he “didn’t expect much in return” had he requested information from them.
Instead, his five invited testifiers included representatives from regional and national anti-abortion groups, individuals who filed complaints against abortion clinics with DHHS, a former Planned Parenthood employee and written testimony from Creighton University pharmacy professor Edward DeSimone. Holdcroft mentioned that he also requested a DHHS official testify at the hearing, but he received no response. 
Holdcroft and his testifiers made a range of accusations against both clinics, though Holdcroft later told the Nebraska Examiner that the main focus of his concern is the CARE Reproductive Health clinic because it’s located just outside his district in Bellevue. 
Multiple testifiers, including Holdcroft, shared suspicions that both clinics worked with providers who lacked the proper licensing to work in Nebraska. Several others accused the Planned Parenthood clinic of having a range of hygienic concerns within the facility, including moldy ceilings, old carpeting stained by blood and other fluids, and one instance of a sewage leak that some testifiers claimed leaked into patient areas. 
“There was a gross dereliction of duty by the organization to care for its facilities, patients and employees,” said Mariah Arabalo, a former Planned Parenthood employee who currently works for State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, who has voted in favor of multiple abortion restrictions, including a total ban. 
Meanwhile, Omaha’s Planned Parenthood clinic finished a multi-year $1 million renovation project earlier this year. Erin Wagner, senior director of strategic communications for Planned Parenthood North Central States, said the project has tripled the clinic’s capacity, increasing the number of available exam rooms from four to 12. She said the organization is investing in similar renovations across the country. 
Wagner said during the 2024-25 fiscal year, the Omaha clinic saw roughly 4,000 additional patients compared to the previous year. This was partially due to the clinic seeing a rise in out-of-state clients, particularly from Iowa, which passed a bill in 2024 that banned abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy, when an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity. As a result, the number of Iowa patients coming to Nebraska for abortion services rose from 222 in 2023 to 358 in 2024, according to DHHS data.

While Wagner couldn’t speak to every complaint made about conditions at the Omaha clinic, she acknowledged the sewage leak, though she wasn’t sure what specific areas it impacted. She claimed Planned Parenthood officials immediately began working to fix the issue.
“The minute that people were aware it was happening, they were trying to take care of it,” Wagner said. 
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who sits on the HHS Committee, speculated that Planned Parenthood may go out of business naturally due to staffing issues. A report from The Guardian shared that at least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed this year across seven states, mostly due to financial constraints after they were cut off from federal funding. 
While she worked at Planned Parenthood as a nurse, Arabelo said she witnessed a “gaslighting culture” that superiors imposed on employees. If a worker expressed hesitation about participating in a procedure they didn’t feel adequately trained for, she said they were told their refusal would lessen patients’ access to care. 
Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, said staffing has been a challenge, but said it is no more extreme than staffing shortages affecting other medical clinics. 
Wagner said new abortion bans that have been implemented in multiple states since 2022 have made it harder to recruit workers. Curry Grubb said it’s additionally challenging that as a nonprofit, the group can’t pay employees as much as they could make at a hospital or other medical centers. 
Holdcroft and other testifiers alleged that both the Planned Parenthood clinic and CARE Reproductive Health work with out-of-state medical professionals not licensed in Nebraska. Officials from both clinics denied the allegations. 
Holdcroft argued that such out-of-state providers also violate a Nebraska statute that requires physicians who perform an abortion to be available for at least 48 hours to their respective patients, because often they leave the state after supplying their patients with abortion medication. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If you’re sending a woman home with the intention that she’s going to have a miscarriage in her bathroom in the next 48-72 hours … you need to give her a phone number that she can call for help,” Holdcroft said. 
Holdcroft said DHHS officials have claimed the statute doesn’t apply to medication abortions, but Holdcroft argued it applies to all forms of abortion. The statute states that physicians must be available “for a period of at least forty-eight hours for postoperative care,” but the statutory definition of abortion referenced in law is broad and includes abortions via medication. 
Wagner said Planned Parenthood offers all patients receiving a medication abortion a 24-hour phone line they can call with any questions or concerns about their symptoms. It’s also their policy to call all patients a week after their appointment, she said.

Most of the testifiers’ main concerns Thursday were that their complaints to DHHS have gone largely unanswered. Matthew Heffron, senior counsel for the nonprofit law firm Thomas More Society, said he submitted a 21-page complaint to DHHS in 2024 which made 229 allegations against the Bellevue clinic. 
In response, Heffron claimed DHHS officials told him they investigated just one of his allegations, and the case was quickly closed with no penalties given to the clinic. He said he suspects department officials he communicated with did not even read his complaint. 
“This sort of result cannot be the way DHHS oversees health facilities in Nebraska,” Heffron said. “Because if it is, the people of Nebraska cannot trust DHHS.”
Amy Gehrke, chief impact officer for the national nonprofit Center for Client Safety, shared a similar story. She said she filed 12 complaints to DHHS about the Bellevue clinic, and no formal consequences followed. 
Gehrke said her nonprofit investigates potential illegalities at abortion clinics across the U.S., and DHHS has been one of the hardest state agencies to work with. She said responses she received from department officials to her complaints were confusing and sometimes contradictory. 
When asked by committee member State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, Gehrke clarified that the nonprofit does not investigate possible law violations at crisis pregnancy centers, saying “there’s no need for that.”
Fredrickson noted that a large portion of Nebraska’s government leaders, including Gov. Jim Pillen, Attorney General Mike Hilgers and DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, are vocally anti-abortion. He questioned why they wouldn’t jump on the opportunity to act on these complaints. 
“This seems like right up (Corsi’s) alley, to be frank,” Fredrickson said. 
In response, both Heffron and Holdcroft said they don’t believe Corsi is responsible for the lack of oversight. Instead, they suspect that lower level employees are controlling these issues. Holdcroft added that investigating clinics falls under DHHS’ purview, not the governor’s or AG’s. 
DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell shared a written statement in response to the hearing’s allegations. 
“DHHS thoroughly investigates each complaint. Per Neb. Rev. Stat. 38-1,106, all complaints and investigations are confidential,” Powell wrote.
If little changes, Holdcroft said he is considering requesting the new Legislative Oversight Committee to investigate DHHS. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, chair of the HHS committee and a member of the oversight committee, said he would take the matter to Corsi and committed to pursuing the issue in the oversight committee if there is no progress. 
After Nebraska made its abortion ban stricter in 2023, banning the procedure after 12 weeks post-gestation, the percentage of medication abortions jumped to 81%, according to DHHS data. Holdcroft said because of this, the department ought to adjust its oversight to account for this shift. 
Although Nebraska’s abortion restrictions are not as extreme as some neighboring states, Curry Grub said the move from a 20-week to a 12-week ban has forced many clients to make decisions faster. Wagner added that it has also prompted Planned Parenthood to increase patient education efforts. 
“We’re not going to shy away and back off on what our goals are for increasing access to health care, even if there’s more barriers being put up,” Wagner said.

(Photo illustration by Winslow Productions/Tetra Images)As the residents of Ketchum will be asked on Election Day to decide which form of government is best for the town, the public is invited to learn more about different types of local government and the role that city councils and mayors play in that governance in Idaho.
On Nov. 4, Ketchum residents will find a measure on their ballot that states:
“Shall the City of Ketchum adopt the council-manager plan of government as set forth in sections 50-801 through 50-812, Idaho Code?”

A “yes” vote would change the City of Ketchum’s form of government to a council-manager plan, where the City Council appoints a city manager as the chief administrative (executive) officer.
A “no” vote would retain the City of Ketchum’s current mayor-council form of government, in which an elected mayor is the chief administrative (executive) officer of the city.

To ensure voters have information about that decision, The Community Library will host a civics-focused event with Stephanie Witt, a professor in the master of Public Administration and Political Science programs at Boise State University. Witt will present a brief history of local governments with a focus on Idaho, discuss the role of councils, and analyze the differences between the “strong mayor” and “city manager” forms of government, according to a press release from the library.

The event is planned for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at the library’s John A. and Carole O. Moran Lecture Hall. Registration is recommended to save a seat, and space is limited, the press release said. The event will also be livestreamed, and the link to watch online can be found on the library’s event calendar at www.comlib.org. A recording will be available to watch later on the library’s event archive.
“This is one of the major questions in front of Ketchum voters this fall, and we are eager to help people more objectively understand what these different styles of government are,” said Martha Williams, The Community Library’s director of programs and education, in the release. “Dr. Witt will be an excellent guide in deepening our understanding of these options from a non-partisan perspective. From her decades of research, she’ll also help us examine larger questions about the role of city government in our everyday lives. We hope that people can attend – whether you live in Ketchum or elsewhere – learn, ask questions, and leave better informed to make your own decision at the polls.”
Witt’s research centers on intergovernmental relations and human resource management, and she writes about Idaho, city, and county governments in the West, human resource management, and public administration. She is also the director of training for the School of Public Service at BSU, the former editor of the Social Science Journal, and has served as department chair, associate dean, and the associate vice president for academic affairs at BSU. Her recent and relevant publications have focused on civility in state legislatures, the collision of culture and governance, and governing cities in uncertain times.
Other measures also on the Nov. 4 ballot for Ketchum voters include:

According to Moody’s Oct. 9 update: “Idaho’s Aaa issuer rating reflects its strong credit position supported by continued higher than average economic and demographic growth, healthy and stable finances, and low leverage and fixed costs.”
Idaho State Treasurer Julie A. Ellsworth is sworn in on the steps of the State Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth noted in a press release: “This reaffirmation highlights the strength of Idaho’s economy and the sound financial management that protects our taxpayers. By keeping Idaho’s top-tier rating, we ensure continued confidence in our state’s fiscal stability and investment quality.”
In May of this year, Fitch Ratings also reaffirmed its highest credit rating for Idaho. Fitch said: “Fitch believes the state is well positioned to absorb multiple rounds of recent tax cuts and dedicated spending allocations from the general fund, given Idaho’s prudently managed budget with significant one-time spending that rolls off to create fiscal capacity.”
According to a new report from Pew Charitable Trust, Idaho has approximately 87 days’ worth of spending capacity in its rainy day reserve. This is the eighth best nationally for budget savings. For comparison, Washington state has only 13 days’ worth of savings for spending, which is 49th worst. The national average was 47 days.
Although states across the country are facing a tightening budget outlook, the continued decisive action of policymakers to right-size Idaho’s spending, combined with an $880 million general fund reserve (15%) and $1.3 billion in total reserves (22%), provides the Gem State with ample resources to weather economic changes.

Reporting Highlights

Aggression: Under President Donald Trump’s deportation mission, ICE officers are using force to detain and jail immigrants.
Impunity: The administration gutted guardrails and offices meant to rein in abusive actions.
Disappeared: Some families say they have no idea where their loved ones were jailed after immigration raids.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.
Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.
“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”
One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”
And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”
During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.
Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.
And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.
One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”
The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”
Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.
The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.
The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.
The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.
Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.
“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”
Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”
“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”
Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.
In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.
“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.
McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”
“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.
Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.
The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.
“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”

 “Authoritarian Playbook”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.
“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”
Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.
And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”
U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

 Where the Fallout is Felt

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.
The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”
Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.
“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”
In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.
“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.
 In Plain Sight

Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.
Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”
With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.
On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”
The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.
Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.
Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.
“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”
Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.
“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.
Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.
Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gettyimages-2224603707-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Robert Cerniglia, a Korean American who’s lived in North Carolina for all his life, recalls the late 2016 opening of H Mart in Cary as monumental for members of his community.
It’s where he shops for snacks and other food items that aren’t readily available in other places. It’s the only H Mart in North Carolina, and shoppers flock to it from all over the state.
But in recent years, prices have been going up.
“A lot of the stuff that I normally buy has just increased in price,” Cerniglia said. “This is definitely something we’ve noticed a lot since the pandemic. The pandemic was really the highest price increase that we’ve seen, but it’s not really getting better.”
Representatives for H Mart did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

“Everything has continued to be more expensive,” said Matthew Laurentz, another H Mart shopper. “Inflation has continued to drive things up.”
The current political climate hasn’t helped with that.
Since taking office in January 2025, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on many international exports, including those from South Korea.
The country was the sixth-largest U.S. goods trading partner in 2024, with bilateral trade in goods totaling $200 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
In July, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods made in South Korea. He later lowered the rate to 15%, including for South Korean cars.
Officials representing the two nations have recently made “meaningful progress” in negotiations over $350 billion of investments in the U.S. that Seoul had earlier pledged in a deal to reduce tariffs, according to Reuters. But in the meantime, consumers are paying the price.
Vehicles and electronics comprise South Korea’s top exports to the U.S. by value. These include vehicle manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia, and electronic brands like Samsung and LG.
Prices have increased across the board since implementing more tariffs, but Ira Gabriel, senior group manager for corporate and marketing PR at Hyundai Motor America, stopped short of blaming the tariffs for the higher prices. 
Gabriel said pricing adjustments are influenced by a number of factors, including market dynamics, consumer demand, and upgrades to vehicle features as part of the annual model year changeover. 
“We will continue to respond to shifts in supply and demand with a flexible pricing strategy, targeted incentive programs, and a commitment to adding value for our customers,” Gabriel told NC Newsline in an email.
More than just cars and computers
Over the past few years, Korean cosmetic products — K-beauty for short — have skyrocketed  in popularity among younger Americans. South Korea shipped more skincare and cosmetics to the U.S. than any other country last year, AP News reported.

Korean snacks and media are also attracting more mainstream attention. Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters is returning to theaters for Halloween, and Buldak ramen and other Asian foods have gone viral on TikTok. 
But even as the cultural bond between the U.S. and South Korea grows stronger, their geopolitical relationship has become more strained. 
Tensions between the two countries rose last month when more than 300 South Korean workers were detained after an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.
Following negotiations, the South Korean government chartered a flight for them to return home. 
The company said in a statement on its website that the safety and well-being of its workers is a top priority. 
“Hyundai works closely with HR and legal teams to ensure compliance with immigration and visa regulations,” Gabriel wrote in an email.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4179-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-20 10:56:49.386096

Tim Moore (R-N.C.) has served the people of North Carolina’s 14th Congressional District. Many of them are still waiting to meet him.
Over a period where some North Carolina lawmakers have held as many as six town halls, Moore has held zero — so fed-up constituents have hosted two without him.
At gatherings in April and September, residents of Shelby and Kings Mountain came to the microphone to raise their concerns with a life-sized cutout of Moore after the genuine article declined invitations to attend. Hosted by Red Wine and Blue, a suburban women’s political advocacy group, the gatherings drew dissatisfied voters from across the political spectrum.
David Johnson, a Charlotte man who has voted for Republicans for 60 years, introduced himself at the April event as a “reasonable, common sense conservative man” before reading a series of questions written on note cards to the cardboard standee.

“I consider myself to be an Evangelical Christian, and I’m dismayed by your behavior in support of Donald Trump. He is vindictive and cruel and his actions are the antithesis of what Jesus taught and expects of us. Do you condone this behavior?” Johnson said. “Your silence speaks volumes. Please stand up for your constituents and represent all of us.”
Moore declined to comment for this article. In an April statement on X, his office disavowed the first event.
“A ‘town hall’ being promoted in Shelby is not an official event and is not affiliated with Congressman Moore’s office,” the post reads. “In recent months, left-wing groups across the country have staged similar events to create political theater, instead of genuine dialogue. Our office remains committed to serving constituents through direct outreach, regular meetings, and responsive casework.”
The events are part of a trend in North Carolina politics: Republicans have almost entirely ceased holding in-person town halls amid constituent backlash over federal funding cuts, changes to Medicaid and SNAP, and immigration crackdowns. Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to stoke opposition to the Trump administration ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Only one Republican, Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.), has held an in-person town hall with constituents in 2025, according to public affairs platform LegiStorm, compared to three of the state’s four Democratic members of Congress. And neither of the state’s Republican senators has held an in-person, virtual or telephone town hall since the beginning of the year.

‘Just an opportunity for people to yell’
When Edwards met with constituents in Asheville this March, he faced vitriol from the audience.
Constituents confronted him over Trump’s comments about annexing Canada, cuts to the VA, and the potential elimination of the Department of Education. At times, the congressman was drowned out by boos and jeers.
“Would you give me a chance to answer this question, and then you can start yelling after I answer it?” Edwards said at one point amid the interruptions.
Edwards has not held an in-person town hall since, nor has any other North Carolina Republican. National Republican Congressional Committee chair Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) told his colleagues in March to stop holding in-person town halls entirely.
“In-person town halls are no longer effective because Democrat activists are threatening democracy by disrupting the actual communication at town halls,” Hudson later told reporters.

Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), the longest serving member of Congress in the state, has followed that same practice for more than a decade. She last met constituents at an in-person town hall in Statesville in 2010 and has not held a telephone town hall since June 2015, just a week before Trump rode down the golden escalator to kick off his campaign.
She said in a Fox News appearance in March that constituents are welcome to come to her office with questions, but as a rule, she doesn’t “do town halls.”
“It’s just an opportunity for people to yell at their member of Congress,” she said.
Even though North Carolina Republicans on Capitol Hill outnumber their Democratic colleagues 12-4, they have held just four more town halls than the state’s Democrats.
“The Republican Party appears to believe that they have very little to gain and potentially a lot to lose by holding town halls,” said Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University.
All members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation were contacted for comment for this article. Of the Republicans, only Rep. Addison McDowell (R-N.C.), who has held two telephone town halls this year, gave a statement. He said he was pleased to reach more than 100,000 constituents through his events in March and August.
“From truck drivers to parents, folks share their hopes and struggles, especially wanting their kids to have a shot at the American dream of owning a home,” McDowell said. “I welcome hearing from those who disagree, because listening makes me a better representative, and I plan to host more before year’s end.”
Telephone town halls are emerging as the medium of choice for Republicans who still wish to meet with their constituents at large. Others, like Rep. Mark Harris (R-N.C.), have tried virtual town halls through platforms like Zoom.
Lawmakers say these formats allow them to reach a much larger pool of voters, particularly in districts that are largely rural, while critics argue they enable members of Congress to avoid difficult questions and exclude voters who disagree with them.
Cooper said that part of the appeal to members of Congress of telephone and virtual options is to avoid “disastrous” scenes like the Edwards town hall.
“They’re obviously a lot more scripted. I think there is a sense from voters that it’s unclear who gets through and who doesn’t get through,” Cooper said. “You’re not going to have somebody get ganged up on by a bunch of constituents, basically.”
‘I need to hear directly from them’
Where Republicans are shying away from unhappy voters, Democrats are taking every opportunity to renew their attacks on the Trump administration.
“Time and time again, constituents tell me that they are horrified by what Donald Trump is doing in Washington,” Rep. Deborah Ross (D-N.C.) said in a statement. “They want to see leaders standing up in the face of Donald Trump’s attacks and corruption. Their words motivate and encourage me to keep fighting.”
Ross has held more town halls than any other member of Congress in the state, with three in-person and three via telephone. She said it’s important to listen to both those who agree with her and those who do not. “To accurately represent my constituents, I need to hear directly from them,” she said.
Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.) is the only other member of Congress from North Carolina to hold multiple in-person town halls in 2025, with two in addition to her two via telephone. Foushee also held a federal worker listening session in August, which she said was “particularly moving” given the impact job cuts have had on her community.

“Being a Member of Congress is about representing your district as a whole, and without meeting with people from all corners of my district, I would not be able to properly fight for all of our community’s needs in Congress,” Foushee said in a statement. “It isn’t about left or right, it’s about meeting the needs of the American people.”
While Republicans are facing shouts and boos from in-person audiences this year, Democrats in North Carolina haven’t had that experience. Foushee’s town hall crowd in Pittsboro in April asked what steps she and her colleagues are taking to protect health care, defend voting rights, and resist federal cuts, listening intently to her answers.
“I just applaud Valerie Foushee for doing this and giving people a chance to interact with her, and I appreciate her listening and trying to answer those hard questions,” said Pittsboro resident Connie McAdams after the event.
Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.) has held one in-person town hall in Charlotte and one via telephone, while Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), representing the state’s only swing seat, is the sole Democrat to not hold an in-person town hall in 2025. He held one via telephone in March.
The flurry of town halls by Democrats in North Carolina matches the national party’s approach. According to LegiStorm, Democrats held more town halls in 2025 than both parties combined in 2024, with 1,184 as of Sept. 22. That’s more than double the 585 town halls hosted by Republicans.
With a total of 1,772 town halls between the parties — about 1,000 of which have taken place in person — 2025 has the most activity since 2021, when Republicans sought to turn the country’s pandemic malaise against President Joe Biden.
Some events are aimed at calling out Republicans who have not met with their constituents. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) held a “People’s Town Hall” in Hudson’s district after his guidance to avoid such events.
Democratic challengers facing long odds in the 2026 midterms have tried the same playbook, hoping to turn their opponents’ absence to their advantage. Chuck Hubbard, a retired journalist challenging Foxx in the Fifth Congressional District, has held in-person town halls in Greensboro, Boone, Lenoir, and Stokes County in 2025.
“My opponent says she won’t hold town halls ’cause she’s afraid of people yelling at her,” Hubbard said in a video on social media. “Well I am gonna hold town halls. I look forward to hearing from you.”
‘What are you afraid of?’
If North Carolina lawmakers are increasingly able to avoid confrontations with voters without electoral ramifications, it is in part because 13 of the state’s 14 congressional seats are noncompetitive. This month, the General Assembly is set to vote on a map eliminating North Carolina’s last swing district.
“They have drawn safe districts where they can easily win, I guess, by having a majority of people that agree with everything that they do, so they don’t have to compete,” said Janice Robinson, North Carolina program director for Red Wine and Blue. “It’s corruption and it’s morally wrong.”
Cooper said politicians may feel no need to hold town halls when they can appeal to voters directly on social media, where confrontations are easier to ignore than in face-to-face interactions. The value in hosting such events comes from showing voters they’re available and listening, he said, as voters need a way to tell their representatives when they’re upset.
“Maybe the puzzle isn’t why are these folks not [holding town halls], but rather, why are others holding them?” Cooper said. “They are going to be reelected almost no matter what happens.”

Robinson said her group organized the constituent-led town halls in Moore’s district so that voters can still have an outlet to voice those frustrations to a lawmaker who has not given them the chance to do so. Her group emailed videos of both events to the Moore’s office, but never heard back.
“How are you going to be able to represent the people in your district if you are not taking time to hear from the people in your district?” she said. “It baffles me that elected officials can just ignore the people that they are supposed to be representing.”
Channeling that desire to be heard, other advocacy groups have held similar gatherings. Local chapters of Indivisible, a national progressive organization aimed at resisting the Trump administration, have held empty chair town halls for Foxx, Rep. David Rouzer (R-N.C.), and Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.) to push them to hear from constituents in person.
The state’s senators have also been the subject of these forums. Around 700 gathered in Raleigh in March to protest Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) for ducking town halls, directing their fury at a stuffed chicken standing in for him. Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) got the same treatment in Winston-Salem in April.
“I think the American people want to see less destruction and some idea that there’s a plan in the works here,” said Richard Scott, an unaffiliated voter from Fuquay-Varina after the Tillis event. “It’s about time that in North Carolina, we begin to realize there’s a whole lot of people that aren’t in one party or another, and you should be listening to them.”
Robinson said she hopes people across the partisan spectrum push back on lawmakers who refuse to do town halls. As redistricting narrows the winning margin for each member of Congress, she said, it creates an opening for a surge of typical non-voters to make a difference.
“It comes down to, what are you afraid of? Are you afraid of being challenged? Are you afraid of having a question asked that is someone expressing that they disagree with you?” Robinson said. “If you are that thin-skinned, then you should not be in office.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tim-Moore-Town-Hall-e1760737664186-1024x766.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 10:56:49.386096

(Photo by Steve Fala)At the 2025 York Paw Paw Festival, I stopped by the Lancaster Conservancy booth and encountered a retired gentleman who brought up the subject of a local waterway being considered for a large energy project. He favored developing it for power generation over preserving the natural landscape. After some courteous but lively debate, he exclaimed “well, we will just have to ‘agree to disagree,’” and moved on.
Cuffs Run is a small stream running down a steep valley and draining into Lake Clarke on the western side of the Susquehanna River. York Energy Storage (YES) received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in November 2024 to study the area for a pumped storage facility to generate electricity. The project will flood almost 600 acres of the surrounding area creating a large reservoir for producing power.
To understand the potential impacts of this proposal, one can look 10 miles downriver to Constellation Energy’s Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility and adjacent reservoir. This project would be similar in scope and size. 
The Lancaster Conservancy is leading a coalition of partners fighting this project which includes the Susquehanna National Heritage Area, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, Farm & Natural Lands Trust of York County, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation along with local Republican politicians. Unfortunately, political involvement in today’s climate is more about assigning blame than finding solutions. A request to reconsider the YES permit submitted by the coalition failed in January when the commission ran out the clock procedurally, automatically denying the request.
The arguments against development assert it would destroy preserved farmland, scenic trails and forests, displacing over 40 residents. According to the conservancy, “the viewshed from the popular multimodal Enola Low Grade Trail in Lancaster County” would be permanently scarred. Which brings us back to the gentleman at the booth and his straight-forward reason for supporting the project, “I need electricity to run my AC.”
That simple explanation encapsulates why the effort to stop this project will fail unless the coalition drastically changes its approach.
There are over 13 million residents in Pennsylvania presumably most who need cooling in the summer months. Is relocating 40 residents that high of a price to pay? Removing farmland, trails, forests and displacing residents in the name of development has been done countless times in the name of progress. What percentage of the 13 million residents know or care about a “viewshed.”
Has the current administration shown any greater inclination to support environmental preservation over business development than previous administrations, especially in a congressional district solidly in its corner?
It’s only a matter of time before this project is approved, permitted, and construction begins. The results will be irreparable with the landscape gouged out and cut up permanently spoiling the countryside just to pump water up to a reservoir during low electricity demand periods (typically at night) and releasing the flow to power the turbines and create electricity during peak periods.
Fortunately, there may still be a path forward but it involves reaching across the aisle to find unnatural allies. In total, the coalition partners have approximately $50 million in annual revenues. In comparison, Constellation Energy and Brookfield Renewable Partners, which operate several hydro and nuclear plants along the river, have close to $30 billion in annual revenues with continuing items on the regulatory docket.
On October 2, Constellation Energy and the State of Maryland announced a comprehensive agreement paving the way for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Station license renewal. The agreement includes better water quality and pollution standards and healthier fisheries management.
This endeavor can represent a new paradigm going forward as Brookfield’s Safe Harbor and Holtwood hydroelectric dam licenses expire in 2030 and are beginning their recertification process now.
The Conservancy has estimated in the last 10 years, over $100 million has been invested by governments and nonprofits along the river to support a thriving and growing outdoor recreation and tourism economy. This amount pales in comparison to the expected $1.6 billion investment for a single project by Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor.  These corporations possess the resources to purchase land and obtain permits while having powerful lobbyists and allies in Washington, D.C.
While it may appear on the surface to be “dancing with the devil” to partner with large conglomerates, this is not the case as these energy facilities produce renewable clean energy.
If a broader holistic approach to the region’s energy demand and environmental needs is not embarked upon soon, then an isolated effort to preserve Cuffs Run is doomed to failure. While a “David and Goliath” story makes for a good fairy tale, it rarely happens in real life.
To engage with these corporations, the coalition requires knowledge outside their current capabilities including urban planners, energy grid experts, corporate policy, and renewable energy experts.
Preserving Cuffs Run for future generations while ensuring they have affordable, clean energy are intertwined and reachable goals. Today’s reality requires an alternate approach than previous environmental showdowns. Pursuing this path will benefit us all.

(Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)MEMPHIS — A Tennessee Highway Patrol officer rested his hat on the roof of a white sedan — its front plastic bumper slightly sagging, doors and trunk open — as he searched between the front seats with a flashlight.
The car’s driver, a middle-aged Black man with dreadlocks pulled back into a ponytail, stood between another Highway Patrol officer and a man in an FBI vest near the hood of a THP vehicle and an unmarked pickup truck. The driver crossed his arms and stared at his feet, outfitted in white socks and slides. Two more officers wearing Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) vests walked between the sedan and the flashing blue lights of the THP car.
It was just after dusk on a Tuesday at a Sunoco gas station on Lamar Avenue, a main roadway that runs through several of Memphis’s most poverty-stricken neighborhoods, where the overwhelming majority of residents are minorities, according to the U.S. Census.
Two additional unmarked vehicles pulled into the small gas station and three more officers emerged: one U.S. marshal and two others wearing vests labeled only, “POLICE,” bringing the total to eight law enforcement officers and four vehicles.
At least 45 minutes into what one HSI officer at the scene described to Tennessee Lookout as a “simple traffic stop,” a Highway Patrol officer handed the driver a pink ticket.
The violation: The dangling front bumper.
The driver silently walked around his car, closing the trunk and each of the doors as the eight law enforcement officers slowly withdrew. “Nice talking with you, man,” one officer called over his shoulder as he walked away.
A few minutes later, the driver, who declined to give his name, emerged from his car with a cellphone in his hand.
“That’s the craziest s–t ever,” he said as he lifted the hood and popped the plastic bumper back into place.

Nearly three weeks after the Memphis Safe Task Force was launched at the direction of President Donald Trump with the support of Gov. Bill Lee, officers from multiple federal and state agencies have issued more than 4,600 traffic citations — far outpacing the task force’s 1,044 arrests and 206 firearm seizures reported by the U.S. Marshals Service as of Friday morning.
Local advocacy groups have logged hundreds of reports from community members of multi-agency traffic stops, some posting videos of the interactions to social media.
Trump established the task force through a presidential memo on Sept. 15 to “end street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent.” His memo specifically calls for “strict enforcement” of laws “prohibiting assault, battery, larceny, graffiti and other vandalism, unpermitted disturbances and demonstrations, noise, trespassing, public intoxication, drug possession, sale, vagrancy and use, and traffic violations.”
But federal and state agencies have thus far refused to release details of the citations and arrests — charges, names and circumstances — to the Tennessee Lookout beyond broad categorizations. A Department of Justice  spokesperson cited “operational security” as the reason for the limited information but declined to elaborate on the record. 
The Tennessee Highway Patrol did not respond to requests for the overall number of traffic stops performed, including those that did not result in citations or arrests. It is also unclear how many of the task force’s arrests resulted from traffic stops.
Lack of data leaves unknowns about impact on ‘violent crime’
Trump, Lee, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and other public officials have celebrated the arrest numbers, crediting the task force with taking hundreds of “career criminals” and “known gang members” off of Memphis streets. But the limited data released by the task force so far does not provide enough information to support these statements, and community advocacy groups contend that the majority of the people being arrested or cited are not violent criminals.
The U.S. Marshals Service’s broad breakdown of the 1,044 arrests includes eight homicides, 48 sex offenses, 110 firearm arrests and 116 arrests involving narcotics charges. Two arrests were due to probation or parole violations, 418 were for “warrants” with no additional explanation provided, 155 were for “other” reasons, and 187 were for Administrative ICE Warrants, which are signed by U.S. Immigration and Customs officials and do not carry the same investigative powers as criminal warrants signed by a judge. 
Among those arrested were 92 “known gang members,” according to the U.S. Marshals Service, though the data released does not include any further information about these individuals’ alleged gang ties. U.S. marshals also reported 56 missing children have been located by the task force, but did not include the circumstances of those cases.
A report to local officials of the task force’s actions on Oct. 13 showed that 37 out of the 51 people arrested that day were not charged with violent offenses, according to reporting from MLK50: Justice Through Journalism. This includes seven arrests for people “unlawfully present in the United States” — a civil offense — with no other criminal charges listed. The document also listed 59 misdemeanor citations.
Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy reported that his staff had 52% more felony cases and 30% more misdemeanor cases to handle after the task force’s first week, compared with his office’s normal volume. Felony charges can include both violent and nonviolent crimes. Mulroy’s office could not be reached for updated information.
‘Needle in a haystack approach’
Minutes after the stop at the Sunoco station, Tennessee Lookout observed another Highway Patrol vehicle and unmarked pickup truck pulling into a different gas station on Lamar Avenue behind a vehicle with a duct-taped rear window, damaged door and missing front grill.
THP, ATF and FBI officers surrounded the car with a handicap placard hanging from the rearview mirror driven by an elderly Black woman and man. The officers left roughly 15 minutes later. The woman driving the car, who declined to share her name, said the officers told her they pulled her over because the registration tags were not up to date and let her go when they discovered that wasn’t true.

Scarlet Neath, a senior adviser for The Policing Project at the New York University School of Law, said stops like this are examples of “pretextual stops,” or “low-level traffic stops that are made for equipment, administrative (or) other minor violations — like objects hanging from a rearview mirror, a single broken tail light or missing registration sticker — that really have no connection to road safety and which are frequently used as an excuse to look for evidence of an unrelated crime.” 
“Police use them as a pretense for fishing for evidence of activity like possessing drugs,” Neath told Tennessee Lookout.
Memphis barred the use of such stops in 2023, a few months after 29-year-old Tyre Nichols died after police beat him during a traffic stop. But state legislators passed a law in 2024 that blocked local governments from instituting such rules, nullifying the Memphis ordinance.
Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers materials describe pretextual stops for traffic violations as the easiest way to investigate a driver or vehicle for a suspected crime when an officer might not have enough facts for “reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.”
Regardless of an officer’s intent for the stop, the training materials state that pretextual stops don’t violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, so long as they are not “based solely on race or religion.” Pretextual stops must also be “reasonable,” and no longer than necessary to investigate “reasonable suspicion.”
Studies of such stops have called their effectiveness and fairness into question.
A study of the Metro Nashville Police Department’s traffic stop practices conducted by Stanford Computational Policy Lab and the Policing Project in 2018 found that “Black drivers were stopped substantially more than white drivers” and “these disparities were particularly pronounced among stops for non-moving violations, such as broken tail lights and expired registration tags.”
The study also found that these stops “had no discernible effect on serious crime rates, and only infrequently resulted in the recovery of contraband or a custodial arrest.”
Tennessee rep calls Memphis preemption bill worse than “overreach”

“Evidence to date on using random low-level traffic stops to interrupt or detect serious and violent crime shows that it’s a needle in a haystack approach,” Neath said.
Another study examining California traffic stop data from 2019 estimated that the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department made 58,292 stops that year, but “only 487 (less than 1%) were for suspicion of a crime that could be classified as a felony.” Deputies in Riverside County spent about nine out of every 10 hours on the clock on traffic stops initiated by deputies, adding up to an estimated annual cost of more than $258 million.
The cost of running the Memphis Safe Task Force and the amount of time it spends on stops that don’t result in arrests or citations are unclear.
Neath said more data would be needed to examine whether the task force’s traffic stops are effective, including why a stop was made, its outcome (arrest, deportation, seizure, charges brought, etc.), and whether the person who was arrested or faced an immigration consequence had a history of criminal charges.
“All charges are not created equal in terms of public safety, just like all traffic stops are not equally important to road safety,” she said.
Shelby Co. mayor, advocates say traffic stops generate fear
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris expressed concern about potential racial profiling in the task force’s traffic stops during a Tuesday news conference alongside immigration lawyer Colton Bane and community organizer Carlos Ochoa. 
Harris said task force members pulled over one of the county’s employees — a Latino man — and “detained him for a small while, while they investigated his paperwork,” before letting him go without an explanation of why they stopped him.
Bane said he has received “numerous” reports from clients and non-clients of task force officers refusing to return driver’s licenses to Hispanic people after traffic stops. In one instance, a client called Bane during a traffic stop in which Department of Homeland Security and Highway Patrol officers returned the man’s work permit and Social Security card but refused to return his state-issued ID. When Bane arrived and introduced himself as the man’s attorney, a Department of Homeland Security officer retrieved the ID from his pocket, returned it to Bane’s client, and released him.
Bane said the traffic stop was initiated because of his client’s “drive-out” tags — the temporary paper tags that come with vehicles purchased from car dealerships. The client’s temporary tags are valid until Nov. 30, Bane said.
A DOJ spokesperson referred Tennessee Lookout to local law enforcement when asked whether task force members have seized state-issued identification during traffic stops. Tennessee Highway Patrol did not respond to Tennessee Lookout’s questions.
Ochoa, a member of Vecindarios 901, said members of immigrant communities are afraid to leave their homes, seek medical care, take their children to school or visit local parks.
“The most important thing here is to balance safety and liberty,” Ochoa said. “Everyone is interested in reducing crime. Nobody here is interested in reducing liberty … As a community, we need to balance those two things.”
When asked about community response to the task force, a spokesperson for the United States Marshals Service told Tennessee Lookout, “Though some in Memphis are not supportive of the effort, we have found the overall attitude of the residents, as well as local and state leaders, is positive and they are glad to see the efforts being made are reducing crime and putting the dangerous people behind bars and off the streets.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)On Oct. 13, Group Health Cooperative held what appeared to be its largest membership meeting in at least a decade. Scores of GHC patients filed into the Alliant Energy Center’s Exhibition Hall, packing the meeting room until there were no seats left. They voted unanimously to direct their cooperative to change course and voluntarily recognize GHC workers’ chosen union. 
This win was a long time coming for GHC workers like me. We are unionizing for many reasons. Personally, I started working as a family medicine physician at GHC 22 years ago, and was excited about working for a primary care-based, member-owned cooperative that valued clinical staff voices. But GHC has changed. Through my union involvement I’ve come to see that many of my coworkers also face struggles with high turnover and understaffing, unfair pay and discipline and racial inequities. These struggles collectively hurt our ability to provide excellent patient care.
By supporting each other and working together through a union, we can better advocate for ourselves and improve our ability to provide the best patient care. Our input as employees is not only useful, but critical, to making GHC the best it can be.
But since we announced our intention to unionize in December, GHC has waged a relentless union-busting campaign. Following the legal counsel of antiunion law firm Husch Blackwell, administrators have engaged in surveillance and other intimidation tactics, and even used union activity as a factor in discipline. Their actions are under investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. GHC has also consistently parroted legal arguments straight from the Trump administration’s attacks on workers’ rights. 
GHC’s most fundamental attack, however, has been on our ability to choose for ourselves what our union looks like. We are creating a union of providers and nursing staff in primary and urgent care and closely related units – basically, the generalists you first see when you get care – since we all share issues in common and would benefit from bargaining together.
But GHC administrators are seeking to forcibly add on workers in specialty care units like optometry and radiology who haven’t even sought collective bargaining. Why? They hope to dilute our Yes votes and make it impossible for us to win a union election. They like to claim that the National Labor Relations Board sides with them, and that these specialty care workers must join with us – but don’t believe it. While the NLRB has said that the employer’s version of our union was feasible, they also said they weren’t offering an opinion on the appropriateness of a primary and urgent care union. GHC is still free to recognize the union we chose. 
GHC has also been confused, or is misleading, about what it is we’re asking for. Speaking with Wisconsin Examiner’s Erik Gunn, GHC representative Marty Anderson said “voluntary recognition” wasn’t likely, because they’d want “an NLRB sanctioned and overseen vote.” But voluntary recognition is an NLRB-sanctioned process: all GHC needs to do is tell the NLRB that they recognize our chosen union, either with or without an NLRB-sanctioned card check or secret-ballot demonstration of majority support. That’s voluntary recognition. It would save everyone further time and expense, not to mention cultivate a positive relationship between both parties going forward. We look forward to a collaborative relationship with GHC as we move forward as a union. 
Attending the meeting on Oct. 13 and seeing the support from our patients and community was truly heartwarming. It reinforced my decision to become active in our union movement – both for ourselves and for the care that we provide to our dedicated patients. Excellent patient care is at the heart of our union movement.
And GHC patients have made it clear, with a unanimous vote, that they stand shoulder to shoulder with their caregivers. As a cooperative where members stand “at the top of the leadership chart,” GHC’s Board should respect membership’s vote by voluntarily recognizing our union, effective immediately. To do anything else is unthinkable in any cooperative that claims to be democratically run.
To show your support, please send an email to the GHC Board telling them to respect the will of the membership and recognize our union: https://act.seiu.org/a/ghc-board-1.

But most of the attention will be on three specific elections that were at the heart of  federal redistricting litigation.,"Absentee voting has begun for several special legislative elections in Mississippi, which have the potential to add more Democratic seats in a state controlled by Republicans. 
​​A federal three-judge panel ordered Mississippi to conduct special elections for 14 legislative seats this year because the court determined lawmakers diluted Black voting strength when they redrew districts in 2022.
Seven races are on the ballot for the Nov. 4 general election: six in the Senate and one in the House. But most of the attention will be on three specific elections that were at the heart of the federal litigation. 
SEE THE MISSISSIPPI TODAY 2025 SPECIAL ELECTION GUIDE
The state complied with the federal panel’s order by creating two majority-Black Senate districts with no incumbents in them and by significantly redrawing one House district. 
Senate District 2 contains portions of DeSoto and Tunica counties. Charlie Hoots is the Republican nominee, and Theresa Isom is the Democratic nominee. Neither has been elected to the Legislature before. 
Sen. David Parker, a Republican from Olive Branch, was the incumbent in this district, but he announced over the summer that he would not run in the new district. 
Senate District 45 includes portions of Forrest and Lamar counties. This is a new district without an incumbent. Johnny DuPree is the Democratic nominee, and Anna Rush is the Republican nominee. DuPree is the former mayor of Hattiesburg, and Rush is an attorney in Hattiesburg. 
House District 22 involves portions of Chickasaw, Clay and Monroe counties. Jon Lancaster is the Republican nominee, and Justin Crosby is the Democratic nominee. 
Unlike the two Senate races, Lancaster is an incumbent,  currently in his second term. First elected as a Democrat in 2019, Lancaster switched to the Republican Party in 2021. 
Republican House members are expected to fight to keep Lancaster in office, while national and state Democratic leaders are hoping to flip a GOP seat to a Democratic one in a rural area. 
Seven candidates are also vying for a state Senate seat left open by John Horhn after he became Jackson’s mayor in July. He had represented District 26, which spans across north Jackson into parts of rural Hinds and Madison counties, since 1993.

After President Donald Trump lost his reelection bid in 2020, he and his allies were pushing false narratives about the election being stolen, pressuring state and local officials, and calling for audits of the results.
In Fulton County, Pennsylvania, a Republican stronghold where Trump won a larger percentage of the vote than anywhere else in the state, local leaders wanted to help.
“Sending this email to see what’s going on with this rigged election,” County Commissioner Randy Bunch, a Republican, wrote to state Sen. Judy Ward, also a Republican, in a Nov. 12 email obtained by watchdog group American Oversight. “We can’t let this election get stolen if there is anything I can do please let me know.”
A few weeks later, according to court documents, the county let an outside company examine its voting machines and download data from them. In text messages sent shortly afterwards, one county commissioner said that if the county hadn’t given the company access, a Trump ally would have forced it to do so via a subpoena.
That decision to allow a third party to access sensitive voting equipment set off far-reaching consequences for Fulton County. As a result of a state order, it had to purchase all-new voting equipment. After years of legal proceedings, the county is facing more than $1 million in fines, an amount equal to roughly one-eighth of the county’s yearly budget.
“It sure is a mess,” said Paula Shives, a Democrat who was a county commissioner at the time, but didn’t approve granting access to the voting equipment. “And unfortunately, it looks like the residents of Fulton County will be responsible for the damages.”
Five years later, election officials in predominantly Republican counties around the country are again getting requests to inspect their voting equipment in connection with the 2020 election.
Recently, The Washington Post reported that a Republican consultant reached out to clerks in Colorado to ask if they would allow a third party to review whether their voting machines complied with federal law. The consultant claimed to be cooperating with “officials working on the President’s executive order.”
A representative of the U.S. Department of Justice also recently approached counties in Missouri asking for access to election equipment used during the 2020 election, though the exact purpose of the request was unclear.
In both cases, officials said they declined the requests. But Lawrence Norden, vice president of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center, noted that election officials in other states might act differently.
“This is just one more thing that election officials are going to have to grapple with,” he said. “They need support from the states to make clear to them what the rules are and the protocols are for dealing with the request for access to the equipment.”
All of this gives new relevance to the choices officials in Fulton County made five years ago — and the expensive consequences the county is still dealing with today.
Commissioner asks: ‘Who authorized this?’
Fulton County sits along the state’s southern border with Maryland west of Gettysburg. Its roughly 15,000 residents are reliable Republicans who haven’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won the state by a landslide.
Even though Trump romped to victory in Fulton County in 2020, two Republican commissioners there still pushed for an audit in the chaotic period following the election.
Court documents say Bunch and fellow Republican Commissioner Stuart Ulsh allowed a Pennsylvania-based technology company called Wake TSI to “inspect and copy components of” its Dominion Voting election equipment. Wake TSI was also involved in the review of the Maricopa County, Arizona, 2020 election.
Wake TSI was contracted at the time to a nonprofit company run by pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who was challenging election results around the country, according to The Washington Post.
Text messages obtained by American Oversight showed that pressure from a Pennsylvania state senator, Doug Mastriano, may have contributed to the county’s decision to let Wake TSI examine its machines. According to the Post, Mastriano, who is from neighboring Franklin County, told Trump he could arrange an audit in the state, something Trump and his allies had been pushing for.

Shives, who found out after the fact that the examination had gone ahead, expressed consternation in a group text message with the other two commissioners, the records show.
“Who did that,” she asked.
Patti Hess, then the county’s election director, replied with a photo of paperwork from Wake TSI, adding that it was “sent by Senator Mastriano” and that “all counties are to do this.”
“‘All counties are to do this’ by whose order?” Shives asked. “Who authorized this? When was it scheduled? Who was notified and who was present during this process?”
“It was happening this way or in a subpoena,” Ulsh said after some back and forth.
No county appears to have ever received a subpoena in connection with Mastriano’s review.
Why state law restricts access to voting equipment
After commissioners released Wake TSI’s report — which uncovered no fraud — on the county’s website, officials at the Pennsylvania Department of State were alarmed that the county had given a non-governmental outside organization access to its voting equipment. State laws and regulations require such equipment to be kept secure and accessible only to a limited number of government officials and employees of the manufacturer in order to prevent the introduction of any malware.
Attempts to access voting systems occurred elsewhere around the country. In Coffee County, Georgia, Trump attorneys and local election officials allowed an outside company to access voting equipment, which factored into an indictment against Trump and those officials, though that case has since stalled.
In Colorado, Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters received a nine-year prison sentence for allowing an outside individual to access and copy data on voting machines. Peters is appealing her conviction, and Trump has advocated for her release.
Trevor Timmons, a former chief information officer with the Colorado Department of State who now serves as chief technology officer with elections consulting firm The Election Group, said access to voting equipment across the country is generally “severely limited.” Poll workers will have some access, needed to run the machines on Election Day, with election directors and vendors typically having the type of higher-level access needed to program machines.
The logic behind keeping access tight is that if someone has physical access to the machine’s programing, they could potentially reprogram the machine to influence the outcome of elections. For example, he said, in a demonstration at a recent hacking conference, he saw someone add the letters “il” in front of the word “legal” in a ballot question, changing the meaning of a question on marijuana legalization.
In the Mesa County case, Peters “allowed somebody in and they imaged the disk, they got a copy of everything that was sitting on that disk,” he said. “To a sophisticated attacker, it allows them to make it easier to learn how the system works and to customize targeted attacks against that software and against those hardware devices.”
County defies court order
In July 2021 the state decertified Fulton County’s machines, telling county officials that no one could “verify that the impacted components of Fulton County’s leased voting system are safe to use in future elections”
The county sued the state over the decertification, and while that case was playing out, the Department of State secured an order from the state Supreme Court temporarily barring any more third-party access to the equipment.
But there was more to the story.
Fulton County had separately sued Dominion Voting for breach of contract, claiming Dominion “failed to provide a system that was free from defects and compliant.” As part of that lawsuit, county officials allowed another company, Speckin Forensics, to examine the machines — an inspection that occurred after the Supreme Court order went into effect.
The Department of State asked the courts to hold the county in contempt for violating the order. After two years of litigation, a special master appointed by the state Supreme Court ordered the county and its attorney to pay $711,252.21 to the department and $324,672.88 to Dominion Voting.
Ulsh, who lost his 2023 reelection bid, told Votebeat and Spotlight PA that he didn’t want to talk about the decision to allow Wake TSI’s examination and the aftermath, calling it “fake news.”
A bill awaits the county’s taxpayers
The county is nearly out of options to avoid paying the fine. It recently lost an appeal in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in its breach-of-contract case against Dominion, but it also is separately appealing to the state Supreme Court its loss in the case the county had brought against the Department of State.
Both the Department of State and Dominion Voting said they hadn’t yet been paid. Last week, Dominion was purchased by a new company, Liberty Vote. A spokesperson for the new company did not return a request for comment.
“I don’t know how the current board of commissioners are going to (pay) that,” said Shives, who lost her reelection bid in 2023.
Bunch, who is still a commissioner, did not respond to a call seeking comment, or an email to him and the other two current commissioners asking how the county would pay the bill if its appeals are unsuccessful.
“I thought they were crazy,” said Stanley Kerlin, a local attorney and Republican who served as solicitor for the county’s board of elections from 1981 to 2019. “They got sold a bill of goods that that machine was no good and it doesn’t count votes correctly.”
He said it was illogical, in his view, that a conspiracy would involve Fulton County, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump. And if commissioners had doubts about the performance of the machines, he said, a better move would have been hand-counting a precinct or two.
Now, as a result, he said, the county will have “squandered” hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
Kerlin said the commissioners have said they won’t increase taxes to pay the fine. The other option, taking it out of the county’s savings account, still requires taxpayers to foot the bill.
Kerlin said the audit and the fine don’t get talked about much in the county, which shocks him.
“I think a lot of people don’t understand it,” he said, but added, “they’ll understand when they see the headline that the county has to pay ($700,000) to the state.”

 Kentucky Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert is urging attorneys to step up for what she admits is a stressful and low-paying job but one that is also rewarding: Protecting the interests of vulnerable children as guardians ad litem.
Guardians ad litem are court-appointed attorneys who represent children in dependency, neglect and abuse court cases. Kentucky needs more of them, especially in rural areas, Lambert said.  
Guardians ad litem are well positioned to connect families to resources like counseling and food pantries while fighting for children’s safety, essentially supplementing social workers’ jobs, Lambert said. 
The Administrative Office of the Courts is hosting legal trainings in November to help prepare more attorneys for the role. Registration is required for the trainings, which will be held in Covington, Lexington and Paducah. As of Friday, there were 61 attorneys registered to attend November’s trainings. 
Since this training became mandatory for guardians ad litem in Kentucky in 2020, the Administrative Office of the Courts has trained 1,050 attorneys, an AOC spokeswoman said.  
Each training will include an overview of the federal and state statutes, state case laws that apply to dependency, neglect and abuse cases and information on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), Lambert said. 



The following trainings are scheduled: 
Nov. 7, 2025
Kenton County Justice Center
230 Madison Ave.
Covington, Ky. 41011
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. EST, subject to change. 
Nov. 14, 2025
Robert F. Stephens Circuit Courthouse
120 North Limestone
Lexington, Ky. 40507
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. EST, subject to change.
 Nov. 21, 2025
Paducah Innovation Hub
500 South 25th Street
Paducah, Ky. 42003
Time: 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. CST, subject to change.



Guardians ad litem fight for a child’s best interest — even if it goes against what the child wants at the moment. 
“What makes that role a little bit different is that the attorney filling that role doesn’t have to do what the client wants or doesn’t have to recommend what the client wants,” Lambert explained. “A child who’s abused may actually want to go back home, depending on the circumstances, or not be removed from the home, but if the guardian ad litem attorney doesn’t believe it’s in that child’s best interest, then they are not bound to advocate for that to the family court or the district court who might be hearing the case.” 
As of Friday, there were 8,538 Kentucky children in foster care, Lambert said. Guardians ad litem “play an important role in ensuring that these children receive fair and expeditious attention from the judicial system and are placed in appropriate homes,” AOC said.  
Many times, these cases involve parental substance use disorder or serious mental health issues, Lambert said, adding that there are often more resources for treating substance use disorder than mental health issues. 
“While that number is a heavy number and a big number, it clearly is not all the children in Kentucky who are abused because we can’t do a perfect job,” she said. “Social workers can’t do a perfect job. There are many more children in Kentucky who live in traumatic circumstances, if you will. So, that is just the number of children who, by court order, have been removed from a home for rather significant amounts of neglect or abuse or even dependency.”
Each of these foster care cases is reviewed by Citizen Foster Care Review Board volunteers who make recommendations to judges about children’s placements, and more. Lambert said getting involved in that work is another way for non-attorneys to make a difference in the lives of Kentucky’s children facing the foster care system. 
“I would just encourage Kentuckians to get involved in some way with making their community better for children and their parents,” she said. “And most people do that through community organizations, church organizations, civic organizations, and that involvement can make us all heal a little bit.” 
A financially ‘thankless’ job 
Guardians ad litem have a fairly financially “thankless” job, Lambert said, with a $500 fee cap for cases that sometimes take hundreds of hours of lawyering. 
“It makes it a real passion project,” she said. “I think our guardian ad litems do a wonderful job for the most part, but they are almost in a volunteer situation. Some of these cases can linger for a long time and require long days at court while you’re waiting for that case to be called.” 
Lambert, who once served as a guardian ad litem, said it would fall to the Kentucky legislature to raise the maximum fee. 
“We have advocated for it to be more, because, obviously, that’s not a very large sum,” she said. “Talks go on every year right before session about raising those fees. And we hope that there will be an organized effort this time to raise the fee.” 
The 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.
“I’m very proud of the attorneys who do this work, because I know how thankless it is in terms of the financial piece, but I do believe that most of the attorneys who work in this area do work for for the good outcomes,” Lambert said.
The job also exposes attorneys to second-hand trauma, which can be mentally challenging. 
“There’s certainly secondhand trauma from so much that we deal with today in the court system,” said Lambert. “I know when I worked in the field, both as a judge and an advocate for either children or parents, I think perhaps the best help, if you will, you could give yourself is to problem solve and make this circumstance better for the family or the child.”

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)This article, Part One of the Mercury’s Pulse Check series, was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s 2025 Impact Fund for Reporting on Health Equity and Health Systems.
In late March of this year the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) was notified that three COVID-19-era grants were being prematurely cancelled. This resulted in a loss of $219 million dollars the state had used to support public health initiatives, the layoff of hundreds of employees around Virginia and the compounding of existing challenges, including a $33 million deficit and burned-out staff. 
VDH is a state agency with several branches of public service, not all of which are as publicly-facing as local health districts were at the height of the pandemic and COVID vaccine rollout in 2020 and 2021. VDH plays many roles in public health; it performs safety inspections of public facilities and long-term care centers, conducts water quality testing, oversees local health districts around the state that operate clinics, and disburses state and federal funding to nonprofit organizations and free clinics. 
For Alexandria’s health district, the sudden cancellation of three federal grants meant 11 people were laid off. 
As he cleared his throat and stared at a note offscreen on a recent Zoom call with The Mercury, district director Dr. David Rose listed out the numerous duties those workers had carried out. 
“I’m just gonna read it because I can’t do it justice,” he said, describing how staff assisted in community immunization clinics, operated IT systems, and connected clients between the VDH district and local community resources. He explained how community health workers conducted public health outreach to various groups in the region as well. 
Alexandria, like much of Northern Virginia, typically has many affluent residents and a sizable portion of federal employees that commute to Washington D.C. for work. But the area is also home to immigrants from many countries like Afghanistan, El Salvador and other South American countries as well as those in East Africa, Rose explained. As such, VDH’s health district there offers information in multiple languages. 
The shock to the system didn’t last too long, he said, as he was able to tap into another federal funding source — the American Rescue Plan Act, a 2021 law that dispensed public health funding to states and localities. Rose said he was able to shift some people’s salaries into ARPA funds and in a Hail Mary, Alexandria’s city council earmarked some funding for the local health district as well. This means that nine of the employees were able to return to work for the time being. 
While Rose’s district has been able to pivot, he emphasized that each local health district around the state has different needs unique to their populations. 
“If you’ve seen one health district, you’ve seen one health district,” Rose said. “You can’t make too many generalizations about what their finances are like, what the politics are like, what the needs are.”
 ‘Billiard balls hitting each other’

Rose likened the grant cancellations and various federal health care changes to “billiard balls hitting each other.” 
This is because he’s also watching for the looming impact of changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid that were outlined in a reconciliation bill that Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed this summer. As thousands of Virginians stand to potentially lose health coverage through Medicaid and hospitals brace for cost increases that may lead to service cuts, staffing issues, or in some cases, closures, patients may rely even more heavily on local health districts, free clinics and nonprofit organizations. 
Additionally, long before state health departments across the country had to grapple with changes in federal funding, Virginia’s already had a grim diagnosis —- staffing issues, low morale and a $33 million dollar deficit in its emergency office, $4 million of which stemmed from fraudulent spending. 
An audit of VDH’s Office of Emergency Medical Services revealed embezzlement by a former department head and lack of accountability among staff. Millions of dollars had gone towards unnecessary spending and the ousted manager has since been convicted. 
Issues upstream meant that trauma centers had received critical funding late and an annual educational symposium for first responders was cancelled last year. A study of VDH at-large conducted by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission in 2024 found high staff turnover and a problematic hiring process alongside low morale, training and procurement issues. 
While the prominent issues plaguing the department came to light last year, they’d been developing for a while. 
“Lack of accountability is contributing to low morale and high turnover,” JLARC analyst Andrew Dickinson told state lawmakers last year while presenting the audit. 
Beyond staffing, financial mismanagement extended beyond the troubled emergency office. Following repeated procurement issues with the Environmental Protection Agency, VDH had to begin fronting its own cash and seek payback through grants later. 
“In 2022 EPA was not happy with the way that we were handling our grants. So we went under a reimbursement system with them,” VDH Commissioner Karen Shelton told The Mercury in an interview. 
As grim as the findings were, they also pointed to pathways for solutions — a healing process VDH has been undertaking for more than a year. 
 VDH’s treatment plan

JLARC outlined 30 recommendations  for VDH to work on in its report, which revealed the range of issues state lawmakers deemed “disturbing.” 
Some, Shelton emphasized, had been underway prior to the publication of the reports, but some “have definitely been concentrations over the last year.”
In restructuring how VDH operated, officials created a chief financial officer position as well as an office of grants applications. 
The EPA grant was moved out of its reimbursement structure this summer, which Shelton pointed to as a benchmark of success.
The department has also worked to retain existing staff and fill vacancies with urgency. 
“As we looked at coming out of (the pandemic), our agency had a lot of needs with employee burnout,” Shelton said. 
She wanted to look at “employee resiliency and what we can do to kind of replenish and nourish from within.” 
The agency created an employee advisory council and hired a workforce development and engagement director, actions Shelton believes have improved staff morale. 
Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsey said that he began implementing monthly operating reviews in late 2022 to start fostering better communication between staff. Those meetings began to bring to light some of what would later come up in the audits, he said. 
Shelton said that the whole agency has gone through training refreshers over the past winter and spring to “make sure we hold people accountable to do their jobs but also to make sure they have what they need.”
Shelton also credited ARPA funding and allocations from Virginia’s state budget with helping the department update its information technology systems. 
VDH now monitors the emergency office more closely with new accountability measures. For example, an online dashboard that allows municipalities to track funding in real time helps ensure that the rescue squad funding indeed goes towards essential equipment and training that emergency responders need. 
A 2022 change in state law also helped VDH broaden its candidate pool to fill local health district director positions in recent years. Previously, only physicians could helm the districts before state lawmakers allowed people with public health degrees to serve in those roles. Now, with all 35 health director positions hired, Shelton said VDH has had regional health directors report to the commissioner of community health service. 
“Having the regional health directors on board has been a wonderful thing to help with our leadership and accountability and span of control,” Shelton said. 
As VDH continues to rehabilitate itself so that it can continue to serve people around Virginia, Rose said district directors are watching how federal changes affect things locally, from regional economies to health care access needs. 
“One thing impacts another and people don’t always see how they are all connected,” he said.
Rose used another analogy to liken VDH to  part of a cork board of pins and strings that connect the agency with social service departments, religious institutions as well as public and private health care institutions. 
“That really is public health,” he said. “We can’t do it alone.”

Part Two of the Virginia Mercury’s Pulse Check series, on how hospitals and free clinics are shoring up ahead of big federal health care changes and what it means for patients, will be published Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Clean Virginia’s “The Energy Bills are Too Damn High” tour of the state stopped in Richmond Thursday night. It was promoted as a way to allow community members to hear from Democratic elected officials and candidates about how they want to address rising utility bills in coming legislative sessions. It ultimately was a rally for Democrats leading into Election Day. 
“I implore the utility companies, elected officials and regulators to maintain electricity rates that every Virginian, regardless of their finances can afford,” said Hope Elliot, a Richmond community advocate. 
The event kicked off with a discussion between Clean Virginia’s Executive Director Brennan Gilmore and state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, about legislation and regulations that have been proposed in the General Assembly. The senator said one of the most pressing issues facing the legislature is how to manage data center growth which is putting a strain on the energy grid. He pointed to gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger’s stance in the Oct. 9 gubernatorial debate that data centers need to pay a fair amount of the energy infrastructure costs.
“They need to pay their fair share. But it needs to be more than that, it needs to be about energy standards and tying them to energy standards so they’re not using so damn much energy,” VanValkenburg said. “I think we really need to be thinking about if we are going to be a home for them. … We need to figure out how we’re going to make up our energy deficit.”
There have been multiple attempts to implement some kind of statewide oversight into the permitting and impacts of the data center industry – as over a third of the entire world’s data centers reside in the commonwealth. One bill vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, House Bill 1601, would have required certain environmental and sound studies in areas where data center companies were applying for zoning permits. 
The Virginia Clean Economy Act calls for the retirement of carbon energy production methods for utilities by 2045. Democrats have pushed to expand solar and wind production, but faced heavy opposition from Republicans. Conservatives believe that renewable energy sources are not reliable and should not be the priority. Gubernatorial candidate and current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earl-Sears said in the debate against Spanberger: “What happens when the sun goes down?”
“Thankfully, battery storage is getting more and more robust by the day,” VanValkenburg told the crowd Thursday night, as if in answer to Earl-Sears. “The governor vetoed a bill on that, which hopefully will pass (next year) and we’ll have more and more battery storage.” 
Also in attendance at the event was state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. She told the Virginia Mercury that while locals can benefit from the tax revenue from data centers, there are statewide implications to the energy use and how it can translate to everyone’s bills going up.
“We need to have some more regulations in place so that we can be more thoughtful in where we site data centers, that we know the actual environmental impact that’s going to happen, that we have full data and appreciation for the impact on our electric consumption,” Hashmi said.
Hashmi sponsored legislation in the 2024 session that focused on energy efficiency programs to help reduce the power being used by utility customers. It failed to pass but VanValkenburg said he plans to bring that bill back in the future.
The speakers denounced the proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center project that is awaiting approval from the State Corporation Commission. The gas peaker plant has been a source of controversy with neighboring communities pushing back against new carbon power. Dominion Energy has said it is a necessary project to meet demand on the hottest and coldest days of the year when the grid is seeing strain.
Proposed Chesterfield gas plant draws community objections, industry support

Republican candidates have frequently echoed the message of an “all of the above” energy profile for Virginia that has been the talking point for Youngkin. They often put more emphasis on small nuclear reactors and gas plants as more reliable sources of energy than solar and wind. They also put the blame of rising costs on the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
“The so-called Virginia Clean Economy Act makes ratepayers foot the bill for energy that doesn’t deliver — solar panels that don’t work at night and wind farms that produce barely 40 percent of what they promise, at best,” said Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, in a statement to the Virginia Mercury in response to questions about the discussions at the event.
Candidates running for the House of Delegates, Kimberly Pope Adams and Leslie Mehta, were invited to briefly speak about key issues in their districts which mostly centered on housing issues and connecting with voters.
Spanberger said in the debate that she supports the buildout of nuclear power as small nuclear reactors are being built in other states and Virginia utilities are asking the SCC to recover funds for future projects.
VanValkenburg said that Democrats in the General Assembly have to be more dedicated to building solar. He said there needs to be votes on allowing more third party companies to have a share in the solar portfolio as well as solar being put on rooftops, landfills, brownfields, and anywhere that is allowed.
“We voted for the Virginia Clean Economy Act, we have to make that real. That means building clean energy,” VanValkenburg said. “So if we want to say we don’t want gas plants, which I think ultimately, should be the goal, we have to build out the clean energy that we want. We have to take the hard votes to do that.” 
There is on-going back and forth around the desire for statewide regulations on solar projects while respecting local authority over siting projects.
“Democrats even tried to strip local governments of their right to decide where massive solar farms can go. That decision belongs to local communities, not Richmond bureaucrats.
The way forward is clear: restore local control, end costly ‘net-zero’ mandates, and put affordability and reliability first,” Taylor said in her statement to the Mercury.
The discussion at the rally also centered on campaign finance reform to not allow utility companies to donate to political campaigns. Some said such donations allow the companies to have unfair sway over legislators.
“We are one of only five states in the country where there are unlimited political contributions from corporations to the folks that represent you all,” Gilmore said in his panel with VanValkenburg. “And this is particularly egregious and acute when it comes to a public utility, a monopoly that you all regulate and are elected to regulate in the general assembly.”
VanValkenburg said he agrees that political campaigns should not be allowed to accept corporate donations from those they are tasked to regulate. Campaign finance reform has been a topic of discussion for years, but little has advanced in the General Assembly.

As rector of George Mason University’s Board of Visitors, he co-authored “Rogue Prosecutors: How Radical Soros Lawyers Are Destroying America’s Communities”— a jeremiad warning that the rule of law collapses when officials disregard their obligations. The irony is unmistakable: Stimson now presides over a rogue Board of Visitors that embodies everything his book condemns.
In his book, Stimson describes how rogue district attorneys adopt a coordinated “playbook”— issuing “remarkably similar ‘Do Not Prosecute’ memoranda” that substitute a partisan template for reasoned judgment. Mason’s rogue Board majority is running its own playbook: circumvent quorum rules, ignore recess requirements, and rush through structural changes under the cover of secrecy.
Stimson’s hastily convened October 15 Executive Committee meeting was his latest rogue maneuver. Back in August, at its last meeting, the Board adjourned — it did not recess. That distinction is decisive under Virginia law. An Executive Committee may act only when the board is in recess or when a special meeting has been called and fails to convene due to lack of quorum. Neither condition was satisfied, yet Stimson convened the committee anyway.  He obviously knows the difference since, at the end of the October 15 meeting, he moved that the Executive Committee recess, not adjourn.
And the agenda was no routine housekeeping. Most disturbingly, the rogue Executive Committee — just five out of sixteen members — approved an affiliation agreement with a separate fundraising foundation for the Antonin Scalia Law School. This unprecedented move fragments oversight and hands disproportionate influence to donors with minimal accountability. Such a consequential matter demands full board deliberation, public transparency and faculty input. Instead, it was jammed through by an improperly constituted, and thus illegitimate, rogue committee.
Excuses not accepted

The parallels to Stimson’s own critique grow sharper still. At one point, his book mocks rogue prosecutors who claim their approach is “backed up by ‘data and science’” despite lacking an empirical foundation. How fitting that Mason’s rogue board now cites self-serving “interpretations” of bylaws and legislative silence to justify actions that violate plain statutory text and basic governance norms.
The pattern of rogue behavior is not confined to bylaws. Just days before the improper Executive Committee meeting, Stimson reposted Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s attack on a political opponent. For a sitting rector of a public university — bound by Mason’s policies of institutional neutrality —  to use his position to amplify partisan attacks was not merely inappropriate. It was yet another example of rogue leadership substituting personal politics for the self-restraint and impartiality required of university governance.
The irony deepens when you consider that one of Stimson’s predecessors as Mason’s rector, Edwin Meese III, now lends his name to Stimson’s own workspace at the Heritage Foundation — the Edwin Meese III Center, where Stimson serves as Deputy Director.  Meese warns in the review of Stimson’s book that “when these officials abdicate their responsibilities and substitute their own ideas for what the law actually provides, the result is …a breakdown of the system … and civic incivility.” Yet under Stimson’s tumultuous leadership, Mason’s rogue board has done precisely that: abdicated the constraints of state law and its own bylaws to substitute tactical convenience for legal obligation.
This is not parliamentary pedantry; it is a breach of fiduciary duty. Trustees of a public university are bound by duties of care, loyalty and obedience to law. Acting ultra vires — beyond legal authority — is not just improper. It is rogue governance, and therefore illegitimate.
In his book, Stimson argued that when prosecutors refuse to enforce the law, communities suffer from lawlessness. The corollary is equally true: when trustees refuse to follow their bylaws and state statutes, the university community suffers from rogue governance without legitimacy. Faculty lose faith. Students see principle subordinated to politics. Donors question stewardship. And Virginia’s taxpayers are left to wonder whether the commonwealth’s largest public university serves the state — or the ideological ambitions of a few well-connected actors.
The dysfunction at Mason reflects a troubling trend across Virginia’s public universities: increasingly partisan board appointments, accelerating board politicization, the sidelining of faculty and student voices, and a concerted effort to subordinate public universities to narrow political agendas. These are precisely the conditions that enable rogue governance. What is at stake is not just one affiliation agreement for one public law school. It is whether a public university will be governed openly, lawfully and with fidelity to its mission — or whether those entrusted with stewardship will place expedience above legality and betray the public trust.
Charles Stimson is right about one thing: When those in power disregard the law, the consequences are grave. The tragedy for Mason is that the rector who wrote the book on rogue actors is presiding over — indeed, has himself created — precisely that: a rogue board. Virginians who care about the integrity of their public universities cannot allow this rogue regime to continue unchecked. The rule of law does not stop at the campus gates.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A superintendent search firm that advised at least one school division in Virginia is now being sued in Iowa for allegedly failing to properly vet an undocumented immigrant before he was hired as the division’s superintendent, creating questions from school board members in the commonwealth. 
Last year, Stafford County School Board hired the same search firm, JG Consulting, which also does business as One-Fourth Consulting LLC, for its search that resulted in the hiring of Daniel Smith, former chief of staff and acting superintendent of Loudoun County Public Schools.
The Des Moines School Board in Iowa filed a lawsuit against JG Consulting, claiming the background check missed former Superintendent Ian Roberts’ lack of work authorization and past criminal charges, which has led to questions of if the firm could have missed details during their vetting process for Stafford and other school divisions.
Des Moines Public Schools declined to comment when asked if it has any advice for other school districts after its dealings with the firm. However, in a response to the lawsuit filing, the board chair said the search firm “failed in their duty to properly vet the candidates” and that Roberts should have not been presented to the board.
“JG Consulting’s contract required them to bring all known information of a positive or negative nature to the board, and since that did not happen the board will pursue aggressive legal action in accordance with the law,” Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris said in an Oct. 3 statement. 
Stafford County Public Schools also declined to comment on whether it plans to work again with JG Consulting/One-Fourth Consulting in the future or take any other actions.
In an earlier statement, Maureen Siegmund, Stafford’s school board chair, spoke highly of Smith, saying he is an “exceptional educator and leader who is clearly focused on preparing students for life after high school.”

The national salary average for a school superintendent, supported by tax dollars, is $169,343, according to a recent study conducted by AASA, The School Superintendents Association, informed by 2,077 respondents including 23 from Virginia. Factors like the types of communities school districts serve such as rural, suburban and urban influence superintendent salaries. 
In a statement to the Mercury, Verjeana McCotter-Jacobs, executive director and CEO of the National School Boards Association, said selecting a superintendent is one of the most “important responsibilities” a school board undertakes and requires the board to keep in my mind the district’s goals and community values.
“School boards should take time to establish strong selection criteria, engage parents and the community in the process, and thoroughly vet candidates to ensure alignment with the district’s vision for student success,” McCotter-Jacobs said. “Equally important is choosing a search firm that understands the significance of comprehensive background checks and is committed to due diligence at every step. Boards must be able to trust that the firm representing them is conducting a thorough, ethical, and transparent process.”
The Mercury contacted JG Consulting, but did not receive a response. 
 Licensing

In addition to having a school board’s approval, a candidate to become a division superintendent in Virginia must have their license approved by the Virginia Board of Education.
Virginia has a set of requirements for candidates to receive a license, but the pathways can vary and have at times come under scrutiny. In some cases, superintendents may already have their state board approved licenses before being hired by a district level school board.
The first three pathways to licensing, “Options 1-3,” are meant for candidates with formal training and experience in education. However, “Option 4,” which is designed for non-educators with significant leadership experience, has been a point of contention. Teaching and administration experience are not required. 
One of the most widely known cases involving a candidate seeking a license under Option 4 involved a former county administrator being considered as a division superintendent in Spotsylvania County. 
In March 2024, the Spotsylvania County School Board hired Mark Taylor as its superintendent. His hiring came as members of the Spotsylvania community expressed concern about his lack of experience in public education and connections to a former board member who was responsible for his hiring. 
Later, the state Board of Education approved Taylor’s license, only reviewing the requirements for him to receive a license, such as having a master’s degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution, a minimum of three years of successful, full-time experience in a senior leadership position, and a recommendation by a Virginia school board.
But less than two years later, Taylor was fired in March 2024 by the newly-elected school board. 
Taylor and the school division were expected to settle on an agreement by the end of the year, according to a judge’s orders.
 Boards’ approaches to finding candidates

While a small group of school boards have used search firms, others have leaned on the Virginia School Board Association (VSBA) for assistance in finding their next chief executive officer. The association often posts vacancies on its website.
“School boards are equipped locally to decide what direction works best for their division when conducting a superintendent search,” said Gina Patterson, VSBA executive director, in a statement to the Mercury. “Each board has access to legal counsel to help navigate and guide them through the process. Candidates often come from across the country, not just Virginia, and the beauty of local control is that each board determines what approach best serves their community.”
As the story of the Iowa case has spread, education leadership groups including the School Board Members Alliance, have jumped in to make sure their Virginia members are protected. Des Moines Public Schools system is now considering a federal system called E-Verify to check a job applicant’s ability to legally work in the U.S., the Iowa Capital Dispatch reports.
In a statement to board members, the alliance told members that one of their most important decisions is hiring a superintendent.
“The choice impacts students, staff, and the community for years to come,” the alliance stated, “but recent events in Pennsylvania and Iowa serve as a serious warning: relying too heavily on search firms without requiring strong safeguards can expose your district to risk, embarrassment, and legal liability.”
The alliance advised boards against accepting “vague assurances” and insisted on obtaining “contract language and procedures” that protect the division and taxpayers.
“School boards often spend tens of thousands of dollars on superintendent search firms to identify candidates they believe will best meet the needs of their divisions,” said Shelly Norden, SBMA executive director, in a statement. “Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of the local school board to ensure that the individual they hire has been thoroughly vetted.”

(Courtesy photo from the University of Rhode Island)Just how unique is the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution?
It’s the question the nation’s preeminent First Amendment attorney is slated to discuss at the University of Rhode Island (URI) next month as part of its upcoming Christiane Amanpour Lecture.
Floyd Abrams will appear at the Kingston campus at 4 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 3, for the event named after the famed CNN host and URI alumna hosted by the university’s Harrington School of Communication and Media. His lecture takes place in the Robert J. Higgins ’67 Welcome Center, 45 Upper College Road.
Abrams has been dubbed by his contemporaries as “the most significant First Amendment lawyer of our age,” having argued 13 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.
That includes being part of the legal team that defended the New York Times’ decision to publish a number of confidential documents containing information about the cost of the Vietnam War known as the “Pentagon Papers.”
In 2010, he was one of the lead attorneys who persuaded a narrow Supreme Court majority that the First Amendment bars the government from limiting corporate spending on political campaigns — the basis of the controversial Citizens United ruling.
“I can’t think of a better person to speak with our community, especially our journalism students, about how press freedoms are interpreted in court,” Daniel S. Hunt, chair of the Harrington School’s journalism and public relations department, said in a statement. “ “First Amendment cases often set the legal precedent for future interpretations of our constitutional rights.”
Abrams’ lecture will be streamed live on YouTube, Facebook, X, and LinkedIn. Those interested in attending in-person must sign up online.

In part, this is due to continuing development, including more parking lots, roads, and other paved areas that are destined for salt treatment in winter. (Getty Images)Every year, more road salt seeps off roads into New Hampshire’s waterways, posing a mounting threat to drinking water and wildlife. While the state has voluntary programs in place to try to keep salt at bay, levels continue to rise — and experts said it may take more to solve the problem, whether that means stricter regulations or a cultural adjustment of the public’s winter salt expectations.
“Things are still getting worse. I think it will be a while before we crest,” said Ted Diers, assistant water division director with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. 
Because the ions that make up road salt don’t evaporate or break down, and plants don’t significantly filter them out of the soil, road salt accumulates in the environment after it is applied. Today, more than 50 water bodies across the state have more chloride — a component of road salt — than is deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, according to NHDES. This threatens aquatic life, because chloride is toxic to fish, Diers said. 
Salt also seeps into aquifers and affects drinking water supplies. According to NHDES, the number of salt-contaminated wells in New Hampshire has risen by 150% over the last 30 years. Salt in drinking water can affect taste and drinkers’ health; by corroding pipes, it can also release dangerous heavy metals like copper and lead into the water supply. 
Removing salt from drinking water is expensive and complicated, Diers said. In extreme cases, seeping road salt can force wells offline. The Merrimack Village District saw this play out in 2023: after documenting a more than 1,000% increase in sodium over 30 years and seeing levels in one of their five wells rise past what the town could afford to treat, the town closed it, increasing demand on their other four to compensate.
The threat of road salt has been apparent to NHDES for some time, said Aubrey Voelker, NHDES salt reduction program coordinator. Before ground was broken on the expansion of the southern portion of Interstate 93 in the early 2000s, routine environmental impact studies revealed high chloride levels in various waterways along the highway corridor, Voelker said.
Calls for a reduction
It became clear from those studies that “a very large reduction (in road salt) was needed,” Voelker said. 
NHDES observed that far more road salt was being used than was required to keep roads and sidewalks safe, she said. When the agency conducted a survey to trace all that salt to its source, they determined that about half of it was applied by contractors that perform winter maintenance at businesses and residential properties. 
In response, NHDES implemented the Voluntary Commercial Salt Applicator Certification Program, or “Green Snow Pro” initiative, which allows commercial applicators to train in safe, efficient salt application, become certified, and receive limited liability protection in return.
Later, the state extended this program to municipalities, another group that contributes significantly to the state’s road salt load.
Voelker said companies responded positively to the program, reporting cost savings and reduced salt usage to NHDES. During the winter of 2023-2024, 177 commercial companies participated, according to a presentation by Diers, Voelker, and NHDES Watershed Assistance Section Supervisor Stephen Landry. 
“Our commercial applicators … one or two years into the program, they come back and say, just by calibrating my equipment better and my crews being trained, we saved up to, like, 40% on our operating budget, because we’re not over-purchasing salt,” Landry said.
Still, salt is on the rise
Despite increasing commercial and municipal participation in the opt-in program, salt levels are continuing to rise in New Hampshire. In part, this is due to continuing development, including more parking lots, roads, and other paved areas that are destined for salt treatment in winter.
“We’re still seeing a lot of buildings being put up, lots of parking lots,” Voelker said. “… More roadways, more salt.” 
Another factor driving up salt levels across the state, said Voelker, are warming winters. It may be counterintuitive, Diers added, but more salt is needed when freeze-thaw cycles allow water to melt, then re-freeze, on traveled areas. 
“On the coldest winters, we apply the least salt,” he said, because “the point of salt application on roads is not to melt the ice. … It is to keep the ice from adhering to the pavement, so you can scrape it off with a plow.”
Municipalities also face funding constraints and high workforce turnover that challenge their ability to invest in salt-efficient equipment and retain individuals trained in safe salt application, Diers said. 
And this season’s drought has further exacerbated the issue, including, potentially, worsening the effects on wildlife, Diers said. As less water is available in the environment while salt levels remain constant, harmful ions become more concentrated. Data collected by NHDES and volunteers working across the state show concerning chloride levels in many waterways this fall, he said.
“This summer, the data has been alarming, to say the least, due to the drought and the concentrated conditions,” Landry said.
It’s not clear how long it takes for a “slug” of salt to wash through a system, Landry said, but often, the process can take years. This means that even once poor salt protocols — like storing salt outside and uncovered — are corrected, the effects will linger.
Routes to change
Andrea LaMoreaux, president and policy advocate at NHLAKES, said she, like the residents who have reached out to her with concerns about salinity, is concerned about the effect of increasing salt levels on New Hampshire’s waterways. 
LaMoreaux said New Hampshire could take steps to address the issue with more force by imposing stricter rules on salt storage and application in addition to the voluntary program.
“The last thing we want to do in New Hampshire is have to legislate something,” she said. “We’d rather people just hear what the right thing to do is, and then just voluntarily go ahead and do it. But we know that sometimes we do need rules and laws.”
NHLAKES was working with Merrimack Rep. Rosemarie Rung on a proposal for legislation to codify some of the existing “best practices” regarding salt storage, LaMoreaux said. As submitted, the proposal calls for NHDES to adopt outdoor road salt storage requirements and penalties for noncompliance, according to a preliminary version shared by Rung.
Diers declined to comment on the specific proposal, but expressed skepticism about the difficulty of enforcing salt regulations generally, especially regarding restrictions on the application of salt to roadways. 
“Most of the programs around the nation focus on incentives to reduce salt use … or training for municipalities,” he said in an email. “… Enforcement (who and how) is always the challenge with any regulatory approach.”
Diers and Voelker said they felt a culture change would be needed to address over-salting in the Northeast. Within the last few decades, Diers said, excess salt has become normalized in a way that has been difficult to overcome.
“People somehow, all of a sudden within the last couple of decades, expected sidewalks to crunch throughout the winter,” he said.
This might make walkers feel safer, but in fact it signals that far more salt has been applied than is useful, he continued. This is because salt must be dissolved in water to be useful against ice, meaning that chunks of rock salt are not actively preventing icing, according to Diers. But while fighting that expectation may prove an important part of reducing statewide salt levels, it presents a tall task for advocates.
“This doesn’t change by people getting trained or improving technology. It changes because people have a different expectation, and that’s what is really, really hard to get across to people: That you can be safe and use less salt,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/salttruck-1024x656.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As the federal shutdown continues, states have been forced to fall back on their own resources to spot disease outbreaks — just as respiratory illness season begins.
The shutdown has halted dashboards and expert analysis from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors indicators such as wastewater to provide early warnings of the spread of COVID-19, influenza, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and other infectious diseases.
The pause leaves states with less early warning on disease outbreaks, potentially endangering lives even as child vaccination rates drop amid increased exemptions and hesitancy fed by misinformation. State and local officials can combat outbreaks with targeted advice to get vaccinated and stay home when sick, but they need to know where to do that first. And residents won’t know to take precautions if they’re unaware when many in their community are falling ill.
Wastewater is particularly crucial to finding outbreaks before people start seeking treatment, said Dr. John T. Brooks, a former chief medical officer for CDC’s Emergency COVID-19 Response who retired last year.
‘This shutdown feels different.’ States might not get repaid when government reopens.

“This is one more piece of information to each American citizen to inform their decision, like, ‘Do I want to get vaccinated, and is now the time?’” Brooks said. “It really helps protect Americans by identifying communities where you may need to ramp up, raise awareness, remind people about hygiene.”
Ericka McGowan, senior director for emerging infectious disease at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the absence of CDC involvement “could be a problem if there’s some major issue [states] miss.” Generally, states and localities gather their own health information, but many rely on the CDC for analysis and public display.
Washington state’s wastewater surveillance program, for instance, uses the CDC’s dashboards to display information to the public. Now, only state officials can see the information, and they would have to rethink the system if the shutdown continues, McGowan said.
Caitlin Rivers, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies infectious disease outbreaks, checked all 50 states for shutdown-related data issues. In a Substack post, Rivers said the result of the shutdown is “DIY surveillance.”
Georgia had to pause its influenza report, which would normally start this month, because of missing CDC data. However, health officials are working on a version using only state information, said Nancy Nydam, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Health. Some hospitals report cases to the state and some directly to the CDC, so there will be some information gaps during the shutdown, she said.
Shutdown forces Medicare patients off popular telehealth and hospital-at-home programs

In the meantime, Georgia has its own data on emergency room visits showing cases of suspected COVID-19, flu and RSV declining between August and early October.
Georgia also has its own wastewater surveillance program, which provides early warning of diseases spreading in the population before confirmed cases show up in hospitals. But some states rely on CDC wastewater surveillance.
Michael Hoerger, an associate professor at Tulane University, had to pause his state-by-state wastewater reports on COVID-19 because of the lack of CDC wastewater data and an unrelated pause in data from a private wastewater reporting collective called Biobot, he said. Biobot did not respond to a request for comment.
“The pause means that we won’t have a good sense of which states are dealing with elevated transmission [of COVID-19] until the data come back online,” Hoerger said. “I can still post useful national estimates and forecasts, but that doesn’t really help with states that are outliers from what’s happening nationally.”
Hoerger’s Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative released a report in August on COVID-19 hot spots in California, and the highest state rates for COVID-19 in late September were in Connecticut, Delaware, Nevada and Utah.











We’re in a bit of a blackout at the moment in terms of real-time rigorous data.


– Michael Hoerger, associate professor at Tulane University



For the time being, all Hoerger can do is rely on past forecasts predicting about 499,000 new COVID-19 infections a day as of Oct. 13, the first time it’s been under 500,000 since July.
“We’re in a bit of a blackout at the moment in terms of real-time rigorous data,” Hoerger said. “Fortunately, at least nationally, we’re in a relative lull in transmission.”
Like Georgia, many states can monitor wastewater on their own to track COVID-19, flu, RSV and other diseases, according to a list compiled by Hoerger’s Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative.
Texas, for example, has not had trouble updating its data during the shutdown, health department spokesperson Chris Van Deusen said. “We do our own surveillance for most metrics,” he said. However, the state no longer gets information on new COVID-19 and RSV deaths from the federal government, he said.
Economists say job losses likely, even as shutdown delays report

North Carolina also gathers its own wastewater data and interprets it with help from the University of North Carolina and local health departments. Normally, the CDC would weigh in with its own guidance and post results on a national dashboard — actions that are paused in the shutdown, said Hannah Jones, a spokesperson for the state health department.
But even if they have their own wastewater data, other state and local health departments may rely on the CDC for analysis and guidance, said McGowan, of the state health officials group.
“Even if you collect the data, you still have to have someone who is an expert to analyze that data to give you some kind of result,” McGowan said. “A lot of localities don’t have that kind of expertise in house and they rely on the CDC for that type of technical expertise and guidance. So there’s a gap there.”
Rivers, the Johns Hopkins associate professor, wrote in her post that she sees “clouds on the horizon” in some states. There are more young children, who are most susceptible to RSV, visiting emergency rooms in Louisiana, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, she wrote, and also more hospitalizations in Texas.

(Courtesy of CVS Health)New England is facing a worsening shortage of primary care providers, and the trend is accelerating at the exact moment demand is rising. Across the region, aging populations, provider retirements, and workforce burnout are converging to create a serious access problem. States across the region will need to pursue new models of care delivery if they hope to protect community health and prevent deeper strain on hospitals and public health systems.
The scale of the challenge is already measurable. With nearly 26% of Rhode Islanders aged 60 or older and a median age approaching 41, demand for care in the Ocean State is only going up. As a former Rhode Island state representative who worked on health care policy and a senior citizen myself, I am acutely aware of this conundrum. Yet physicians are retiring faster than they can be replaced, and there were recently more than 1,300 open nursing positions in Rhode Island alone. Similar patterns are emerging across New England and the country as a whole, where physician shortages are projected to reach double digits by 2035. 
Without strategic interventions, vulnerable populations will wait longer for appointments, and emergency rooms will face pressure to absorb routine cases. This is why emerging hybrid care partnerships deserve close attention. 
One promising model that has taken root in Massachusetts has seen CVS Health’s MinuteClinic partner with Mass General Brigham to expand access to primary care services in underserved areas. Rather than functioning as walk-in clinics alone, these sites are being integrated into a broader care network — allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to deliver routine exams, manage chronic conditions, and coordinate telehealth consults with physicians when needed. 
This approach reduces pressure on hospitals and traditional practices while making preventive care more accessible to patients who would otherwise delay treatment. It is also not without precedent as similar partnerships have already been piloted in nearly a dozen other states across the country.
In Georgia, for example, the Emory Healthcare Network has partnered with MinuteClinic across 35 locations statewide. The collaboration allows shared electronic health records and coordinated referrals, expanding appointment access with same-day and evening hours while preserving continuity of care. Similarly in North Carolina, Novant Health’s affiliation with MinuteClinic integrates medical records, has encouraged better medication adherence, and connects patients back to primary care physicians. These examples – all designed to relieve wait times and prevent unnecessary emergency room use – show that coordinated retail-clinic models can reinforce local health care systems rather than replace them.










Without strategic interventions, vulnerable populations will wait longer for appointments, and emergency rooms will face pressure to absorb routine cases. This is why emerging hybrid care partnerships deserve close attention. 


The Massachusetts partnership between CVS and Mass General Brigham could produce similar benefits. By embedding primary care capabilities within a retail footprint, the program increases the number of accessible entry points for preventive services. It also strengthens referral pathways by plugging walk-in care into established hospital and specialty systems. For patients navigating long wait times or disrupted continuity of care due to provider turnover, these hybrid access points can serve as stabilizers rather than stopgaps.  
The primary care crisis will not be solved by expanding residency slots alone or by waiting for medical school graduates to fill decades of vacancies. As such, our leaders should be proactive in seeking out models that meet patients where they are — through partnerships, telemedicine integration, community-based clinics, and retail health collaborations that have shown results elsewhere.
Massachusetts has provided a timely blueprint with the MinuteClinic–MGB collaboration that should be watched closely. For Rhode Island, the lesson is not to replicate it blindly, but to recognize the urgency of adopting solutions that expand capacity without sacrificing quality and if they are successful, emulate them. That means supporting nontraditional care sites and ensuring regulatory decisions do not choke off innovation. 
New England has long been a leader in health care innovation, but it also faces some of the steepest demographic and workforce headwinds in the country. Elected officials throughout the region should make every effort to lower health care costs and increase access. It is their duty to deliver that to their constituents and those that propose legislation that would have an opposite impact should think twice.
If policymakers stay focused on preserving access rather than unintentionally constraining it, Rhode Island can position itself to strengthen its health care infrastructure before workforce shortages become full-blown crises. The alternative — ignoring successful models and jeopardizing existing access points — is a risk the state can no longer afford.

The $1.09 billion number is higher than the estimated $1.05 billion the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission predicted when it came to the scholarship programs. 
“The thing that we’re concerned about is it seems like the EdChoice voucher program is expanding and skyrocketing with the money that’s being poured into that program, and there aren’t nearly as many students in that program to warrant that kind of infusion of money,” Ohio Education Association President Jeff Wensing said. 
The five private school scholarship programs are the Autism Scholarship Program, the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship Program, the Cleveland Scholarship, the Education Choice Scholarship and the Educational Choice Expansion Scholarship Program. 
Students on the autism spectrum are eligible to receive vouchers up to $32,445 for the Autism Scholarship Program. 
Students who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) from their district are eligible for the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship. 
The Cleveland Scholarship is for all students living in the boundaries of Cleveland Metropolitan School District. 
Students living in the boundaries of a low-performing school district are eligible for Education Choice scholarships. 
Lawmakers expanded the Education Choice-Expansion eligibility to 450% of the poverty line two years ago through the state budget — creating near-universal school vouchers. 
K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship and high schoolers can receive a $8,408 scholarship in state funding under the expansion. 
For the EdChoice Expansion, there were 100,930 scholarships awarded averaging to $4,958 per participant, according to the ODEW data. 
There were 42,602 traditional EdChoice scholarships awarded for a total of $283.1 million — with an average of $6,808 per participant. 
There were 1,652,539 students attending Ohio schools during the 2024-25 school year and 1,465,041 of those students attended public schools (88%), according to ODEW data. 
There were 16,691 less Ohio students enrolled in public schools during the 2024-25 school year compared to 2023-24, according to ODEW data. 
Nonpublic Ohio schools had 181,244 students enrolled in fiscal year 2025 — a 4.6% increase compared to fiscal year 2024. 
Aaron Churchill, Ohio’s research director for the pro-voucher Thomas B. Fordham Institute, was not surprised the private school voucher programs surpassed one billion dollars.
“I think it was understood that it would come to that amount,” he said. 
Churchill expects the total private school voucher program dollar amounts to continue to increase the next couple of years before leveling off a bit. 
“I wouldn’t expect (the total private school voucher program dollar amount) to go up as significantly as it has in the past few years,” he said, adding that the goal of the program is to give Ohio parents the ability to choose where to send their kids for school.
Total payments for the five scholarship programs for the past five fiscal years, according to ODEW data: 

$970.7 million in fiscal year 2024 
$610.2 million in fiscal year 2023 
$554.5 million in fiscal year 2022
$444.5 million in fiscal year 2021
$394.2 million in fiscal year 2020

Remaining scholarships
For the Cleveland scholarship, there were 8,345 scholarships awarded for a total of $55.1 million — with an average of $6,835 per participant. 
There were 6,016 autism scholarships awarded for a total of $159.9 million — with an average of $29,110 per participant. 
For the Jon Peterson Scholarship, there were 8,680 scholarships awarded for a total of $103.9 million — with an average of $12,796 per participant.

State officials want to clone Jonah Richard, an Orange County native who’s building housing at a clip in the town where his family has lived for generations.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.

FAIRLEE – Not so long ago, Jonah Richard spent his days working for a white-collar consulting firm in New York City. Now, he fills his time bopping between construction sites in the corner of Vermont where he grew up. 
On a crisp fall morning, 34-year-old Richard checked in with his crew. They were putting the finishing touches on six apartments carved out of an old barn behind a general store in Fairlee, which has been in Richard’s family since the 19th century and is now owned by his cousins. To fit a bonus apartment in the basement, Richard’s crew had lifted up the barn where his uncle used to run an antique shop. 
“We jacked it up a little bit and then dug it out underneath, poured new foundation – and created extra living space,” Richard said, showing off the unit’s well-equipped kitchen and heat pump system.
This philosophy – trying to squeeze more housing into any possible nook and cranny in a building, and in a town – guides all of the projects that Richard takes on through his small construction company and development business.
“Everything we do is infill development. There’s no…sprawl and subdivisions,” he said. “Maximizing density is a lot of what we try and do.”
And maximizing density he’s doing. Through his dual enterprises – a small-scale development firm called Village Ventures, and two-year-old general contracting outfit Réal Hazen Construction – Richard’s teams have built nearly 20 homes and are in the planning stages for 45 more in Fairlee alone. The Upper Valley town, a summer tourism hub, has a year-round population of about 1,000 residents.

Richard’s work has grabbed the attention of state leaders who want to see more homebuilding concentrated in Vermont’s small towns and villages, where the odds can be stacked against developers: It often costs more to construct new homes than builders can expect to sell or rent them for, public funding streams that can fill that gap often prove complicated for small outfits to navigate, and a dearth of public infrastructure limits where housing can go.
Pair those issues with the community opposition that so often meets new housing projects, and more risk-averse souls would simply walk away. But Richard has surmounted many of those problems, and state officials are desperate to convince more people to follow his lead.
“We need and want a Jonah in every town,” said Alex Farrell, commissioner of Vermont’s Department of Housing and Community Development.
How it started
Richard was raised in nearby Corinth, the son of a luthier and a stained-glass restorer. He eschewed his parents’ artist lifestyle and left home to earn an Ivy League chemical engineering degree. After he pivoted into management consulting in New York, he began to use some of his income to purchase fixer-uppers in Newark, N.J. 
During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, when his grandmother was looking to sell a vacant post office-turned-bank building in Fairlee’s village center, Richard saw an opportunity. He bought it for $100,000 and began dreaming up an eight-unit apartment building with retail on the ground floor. Some neighbors balked.
“There was some pushback – some pushback on the appearance of the building, some pushback on the density of the building,” said Chris Brimmer, Fairlee’s zoning administrator. But Richard managed to work through those reservations, Brimmer said; his personal roots in town likely helped gain trust with wary neighbors, too. “And holy cow, you know, within less than a year there was a three-story building on the site.”

Richard had minimal building know-how when this first Fairlee project kicked off. He waded through the permitting and financing and construction process, learning everything as he went. He showed up to the jobsite each day, apprenticing under a master carpenter he hired. His own sweat equity helped keep the cost of the project astoundingly low: around $170,000 per unit. State grants and energy-efficiency funds helped finance the project, along with Richard’s own investment and money from extended family. Rents range from about $1,000 to $1,600 for studios to one bedrooms.
Fairlee has loosened its zoning rules in recent years in an attempt to encourage more home construction, Brimmer said, and in 2019, town leaders set an ambitious target to add 100 housing units to the town within a decade. Like many rural towns, it struggled to retain staff because of its lack of housing options. 
Richard had thought he’d finish the apartment project and then “flip that experience” into a development job back in New York. But something about it scratched an itch: He liked reviving the town where he’d spent so many childhood summers, and where he’d since watched shops shutter and home prices rise. Plus the work felt less transactional, more relational. Many of the people Richard worked with on the building he knew from growing up, and have remained his business partners. Together, they’ve put a sizable dent in Fairlee’s overall housing need.

Chris Brimmer, Fairlee’s zoning administrator, speaks about Jonah Richard’s housing contributions to the town on Oct. 9, 2025.
“We’re lucky to have him here,” Brimmer said, of Richard. “I don’t think we would get this far along in meeting that goal if it were not for him having come back to town.”
How it’s going 
All along, Richard has sought to teach others what he’s learned. When he began working on that first apartment building in Fairlee, he launched a newsletter, called Brick + Mortar, to document his progress. He’s taken on more and more ambitious developments since the first, like an affordable housing project financed by federal tax credits that’s currently in the planning stages and a 22-unit development with ground floor space for businesses that recently scored town approval.
But he has not shied away from sharing his foibles, either. Richard has catalogued his challenges building out septic systems in Fairlee, which lacks a town sewer. He’s written about the time he got hit with a surprisingly huge tax bill after accepting an affordable housing grant for rehabilitating an apartment building in nearby Bradford – “a cautionary tale” for other would-be small-scale developers, he wrote.
“He’s not thinking of it as competition,” said Farrell, the housing commissioner, of Richard’s ethos. “He’s trying to say – here’s what I’ve learned. Go benefit from my mistakes and my successes. That’s so cool.”
The newsletter isn’t the only way Richard has tried to prompt others to get into the building game. He gave input to state officials as they crafted a textbook for small-scale developers to use across the state, called the Homes for All toolkit. Officials are now gearing up to use that resource for a forthcoming training series, Farrell said.
“We think this could actually be something that has a snowball effect in spinning off more and more developers, more people doing this,” Farrell said.

That’s Richard’s ultimate hope, too. Sometimes he gets calls from people on the opposite side of Vermont asking if he’s interested in taking on a project they’re eyeing. Part of him is flattered, he said.
“But also…you need to develop your own network of developers there that can tackle those projects. And it all comes down to somebody…one, having the time, and two, being willing to take that risk,” Richard said. “The best person to do that is somebody in the community that knows it inside and out.”
There are many easier ways to make money in development than building in this corner of the Upper Valley, Richard said. But for now, that’s where he plans to stay – living on the top floor of that first apartment building he built in Fairlee.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-20 09:00:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Mass. faces grim reality of fewer international students,Jon Marcus,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/mass-faces-grim-reality-of-fewer-international-students/,"Massachusetts’s schools have recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else because of a demographic decline and the comparatively high cost of higher education here. But even before the second Trump administration, there were signs the bottom was falling out.","It was three months into the second presidential administration of Donald Trump when a small group of New England university administrators convened at a 1902 Beaux-Arts mansion owned by Boston University, just a few blocks from the main campus on an unobtrusive treelined side street in Brookline.
They filed into a high-ceilinged conference room in a one-time steel magnate’s estate turned events center, with huge picture windows overlooking the sleepy residential neighborhood. Representatives of the international student recruiting company that was hosting the meeting strategically positioned themselves at the entrances, handing out agendas.  
The peace and quiet were a stark contrast to the growing chaos in the broader world outside. Billions of dollars of federal research funding for many of the universities where these administrators worked was being cut, and investigations and sanctions were being fired at them by the Trump administration. Soon budgets would be slashed, programs shut down, and employees laid off. This day-long event was about a group that seemed to be facing yet another threat — one with equally grave implications for these schools and the larger Massachusetts economy: international students.
Just days earlier, masked agents had arrested a Tufts University doctoral student on a street in Somerville and whisked her to a detention center in Louisiana. Thousands of student visas were being revoked. International students already admitted to US universities faced a slowdown in appointments for required consular interviews and would soon be required to provide their social media histories. The administration would later try blocking Harvard from enrolling international students at all, limit the proportion other elite schools others could admit, restrict the time these students could stay in the country, and increase the cost of the follow-on visas many have historically used to remain and get jobs here.
A succession of speakers broached these topics at the conference, which was sponsored by the Norwegian international student recruiting company Keystone Education Group. Some triggered nervous laughter, and there were anxious whispers between sessions and over the buffet lunch, from which some attendees had to excuse themselves to take phone calls from colleagues helping international students worried they might also be detained or wouldn’t be allowed to return to the US if they went home for the summer. 
I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world. Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president
The message of the gathering was grim. The seemingly ceaseless flow of international students so critical to Massachusetts universities and colleges would almost certainly slow — probably dramatically.
“You cannot pretend that students from X countries are going to be coming us in Y numbers anymore,” Vera Grek, director of graduate and international enrollment at Wentworth Institute of Technology, told the meeting.
That’s a $4 billion-a-year problem for Massachusetts alone, which ranks fourth among states  — after California, New York, and Texas  —  in the number of international students at its universities and colleges. More than 82,000 international students studied here last year, supporting an estimated 35,849 jobs.
But there was something else the officials in this room knew. The institutions that they represented largely had themselves to blame for becoming so financially dependent on international students. Many schools in Massachusetts recruited higher proportions of international students than colleges and universities almost anywhere else, federal data show, increasing their numbers year after year to help fill each successive class. That’s largely because of a demographic decline in the number of domestic students in the Northeast, and the comparatively high cost of higher education here, which makes it less appealing to American applicants from places in the country where the number of 18-year-olds is steady or rising.
While international students comprise less than 5 percent of total enrollment at US universities, they make up 35 percent at Northeastern University, 34 percent at Clark University and Babson College, 31 percent at MIT, 29 percent at Berklee College of Music, 27 percent at Brandeis University, and 26 percent at Harvard. Even onetime commuter schools like the Boston and Lowell campuses of the University of Massachusetts state system have hugely increased their number of international students. International graduate students in particular proved so lucrative that, on one Massachusetts campus — Northeastern — they had come to make up more than two-thirds of graduate enrollment.
Yet as international students became increasingly essential, there were signs that fewer of them were coming, even before the turmoil of Trump’s second term. Global demand for American higher education had already started slipping under pressure from geopolitical tensions, increased competition, and concerns among prospective applicants about cost and safety. Fewer of the international students who were still coming could afford to pay full tuition. While the United States is still where the largest proportion of international students end up, its lead has been eroding, Keystone data show, In the fall before Trump’s reelection, the number of international graduate students and new undergraduates had already started to decline, according to the Institute for International Education, or IIE, threatening Massachusetts colleges’ reliance on them.
“I’ve always worried about Massachusetts being a little too complacent about our position in the academic world,” says Richard Freeland, Northeastern’s former president, who was also state commissioner of higher education from 2009 to 2015. “Massachusetts has a brand internationally, so some of these international students have just come to us because of who we are.”
That complacency now presents a potential multibillion-dollar hit to the economy, if international student flows further decline, as projections suggest they will. The number of international students arriving in the United States in August, before the start of this semester, was down nearly 20 percent compared to the same period last year, new figures show. International students don’t only help universities balance their books and inject dollars into the local economy by patronizing restaurants, buying cars, and renting off-campus apartments. They also create research that fuels business, fill jobs in knowledge industries, and create their own startups.
“The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot,” says JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, an industry group. “People coming here to be educated and staying here has been a foundation of our innovation ecosystem for decades. You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.”

Massachusetts universities and colleges started doubling down on international student recruitment around 2011, when domestic enrollment began a long decline. Since then, the number of students overall has fallen by more than 14 percent, but the number of international undergraduates at Massachusetts colleges and universities jumped by about 20 percent, an analysis of federal data show. The number in graduate programs, which are big money makers for universities, nearly doubled.
University admissions offices employ designated international recruiters who spend months living out of suitcases as they travel across the globe to entice students. Some team up with schools that teach English to prospective applicants and with companies like Keystone, which works with 5,500 institutions in more than 190 countries. These recruiting agents generate leads from online inquiries and help students pick countries and schools, complete their applications, and find places to live. As an indication of how important international students have become, many universities pay commissions to these agents, according to the National Association of College Admissions Counselors.
However they recruit, there were plenty of signs, even before Trump, that it was becoming harder for US universities to enroll international students — especially those who could afford to pay full American tuition. Instead, the market has shifted away from China and the Middle East to students from Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where many need financial aid. This means less revenue than in the past for the US universities they choose.
“The countries where [cost] is not a hurdle are flattening,” Anne Corriveau, BU’s director of international admissions, told the meeting at the mansion.
In 2023, the last year for which the figures are available by country, the number of international students from China fell by four percent after years of increases, the IIE reports. Numbers were also down from other more affluent nations, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Japan, and flat from Europe, but up from places in the world with less wealth, including Mexico, Bangladesh, Colombia, and Ghana.
Meanwhile, there has been intensifying competition from other countries — notably Canada, Australia, and the UK, which last year surpassed the United States as a preferred destination, according to a 2024 Keystone survey. Interest in Italy and Spain is also up. Schools in these countries charge less, on average, than colleges in the United States, and generally make it easier for international students to stay and work when they graduate. Far higher proportions of prospective international students also say they feel more welcome and safe in those places than the United States, another Keystone survey of more than 41,000 students worldwide found in April — though two-thirds said their biggest concern about going to college in the US was the cost.
How vulnerable US universities and colleges were to their reliance on international students was laid bare by the pandemic, federal data show; the number fell by 72 percent in calendar year 2020 alone. The greatest decline was in the Northeast, which saw a drop of nearly 20 percent. Even before Trump returned to office, more than 40 percent of student visa applications to the United States last year were denied under the Biden administration, up from 15 percent 10 years ago.
The impact on enrollment of the Trump administration’s visa revocations and research funding cuts will take time to know conclusively. NAFSA: Association of International Educators, which represents international education professionals worldwide, projects based on available State Department data that the number of international students will decline by 30 percent to 40 percent this year nationwide with an estimated $7 billion economic hit. The association’s numbers suggest the Massachusetts economy will lose nearly $620 million — more than any other state except for California and New York. (Other estimates are less dire, an indication of how hard it is to track this, and of mistrust in federal data.) Even before the election, however, the enrollment of international students declined in two key nationwide measures. The number in graduate programs dropped by 2 percent last fall, or more than 10,000 enrollees, according to IIE, after years of increases and in spite of pent-up demand that accumulated during Covid. The number of first-time international undergraduates also fell by 5 percent.
“We often think about year-to-year enrollment, and really that’s not where we can see change. It’s about the slow erosion of what America represents,” says Chris Glass, a professor of higher education at Boston College who studies international shifts. “There are actually concerning trends that have been happening for years.”
Massachusetts universities prefer not to talk about this. Northeastern, for example, did not respond to repeated requests to for an interview. Most of the international student administrators at that Brookline conference wouldn’t go on the record. Another school, Gordon College, gave a response that has become typical across higher education. It “decided to pause on providing comment due to the deep sensitivity surrounding international students and ongoing current events,” a spokeswoman wrote.
All of this comes at a time when university enrollment overall is projected to decline further starting next year, as the number of 18-year-old prospective first-year students plummets – a product of the low birth rates coming out of the 2008 Great Recession called the “demographic cliff.” US high school graduates have also started going to college at lower rates, questioning the return on the investment.

A mile and a half from the Wightman Mansion, where university officials huddled to discuss international student enrollment, the smell of Korean barbecue wafted through a neighborhood of boba tea cafes, dumpling dives, ramen shops, and restaurants that sell malatang, a particularly spicy kind of hot pot. Young people balancing book bags and backpacks pedaled on Blue Bikes past storefronts advertising rental apartments. Others fidgeted with their phones while waiting for the 57 bus to Boston University. This bustling enclave in the student-packed Allston neighborhood of Boston is increasingly embracing its identity as a reminder of home for some of the tens of thousands of students who pour into Massachusetts from around the globe to go to college.
Upstairs at Stage Karaoke, a sleek space hung with video screens, LED lights, and lyrics projected in various languages, owner Alex Vichienrat says international students make up most of his business. Private, soundproofed VIP rooms encircle a communal main stage, where karaoke brings cultures together. “This is our melting pot space,” Vichienrat said. Without international students, he added, “this entire neighborhood would be gone.”
These more nuanced contributions of international students are often celebrated by advocates of international education. They’re also easy to see, in places such as Allston.
International students broaden the experience on campuses for everyone, says Max Page, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents public college and university faculty and staff.
“This is an increasingly interconnected, global world. We want to train our young people to understand the rest of the world,” Page says. Without international students, “you don’t get exposed to other people and their ideas and it can breed a narrowness of thinking. That would be a real loss, if that kind of thing was to stop.”
The calling card for the Massachusetts economy for decades has always been access to the best talent in the world. That’s our sweet spot.

You can’t help but appreciate how devastating that would be to our economy if they stopped coming.JD Chesloff, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable
Less evident are the long-term economic implications of what could happen here if international students stop coming. 
The preponderance of international students in graduate programs isn’t entirely because of universities trying to meet revenue targets. It’s also because Americans are comparatively less well prepared for science, technology, and other fields. US students score lower than those in 36 other countries in math on the Program for International Student Assessment, a test  that measures how well 15-year-olds can solve real-life challenges using skills they’ve learned. Only one in five college-bound American high school students is equipped to pursue a major in science, technology, engineering, or math, the National Science and Technology Council has found.
International students now earn nearly two-thirds of all master’s degrees from US universities in computer science and more than half in engineering. Two-thirds of graduate students in artificial intelligence at American universities are foreign born.
This portends another grim scenario for Massachusetts if the slide continues or accelerates in the number of international student numbers already under way: There will be fewer of them to work in or help start businesses in increasingly competitive industries. More foreign-born than native-born residents in Massachusetts have graduate degrees, and nearly three in 10 workers here in science, technology, engineering, or math come from other countries, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan nonprofit that supports immigration.

One bright spot — for US universities, if not for students — is that competing destinations have begun to impose their own restrictions. Canada has tightened international student caps. In Australia, the government failed in a proposal to put a limit on international students last year. But it increased visa fees and slowed down processing times. While the UK has a goal of increasing the number of international students, it has restricted most of them from bringing dependents, required them to prove they have enough money to support themselves, and banned them from working until they finish their degrees.
Massachusetts could have an edge with international students who still want to come to the United States but to a place more outwardly accepting of migrants, some experts say. That’s been a concerted approach at BU, for instance, Corriveau said at the April conference in Brookline. “I used to try to sell the US in general, and now I focus more locally,” she said. “I think it’s more important that students understand what it means to be in Boston.” BU even produced a video for prospective international students acknowledging “recent events” but promoting Boston as “remarkably diverse and inclusive.”
Many international students in Massachusetts stuck around for the summer, instead of going home, out of fear they might not be allowed to re-enter the country, university administrators say. Schools including Wentworth helped find them houses and summer jobs, Grek said at the BU meeting. UMass Amherst set up a fund to help them. Bunker Hill Community College canceled summer study abroad programs out of fear that international students wouldn’t be allowed to come back.
Over the longer term, however, the state’s strength in attracting international students makes it more vulnerable than other places in the United States to a continued decline in the number of them, says Chris Slatter, Boston-based managing director at the education consulting firm Huron.
“They rent apartments, they spend in local businesses, they support innovation through research, and in many cases they contribute to the workforce,” Slatter says. “International students are the cornerstone of both institutional strategy and regional economic vitality in Massachusetts.”
If they don’t keep coming, “and, when appropriate stay, and work here, what we’d have is a different economy,” says Tom Dretler, CEO of the Boston-based international student recruitment company Shorelight. “We would be a poorer state.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/intlstudentBU-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C744&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Ohio Republicans have recently ramped up a push to make cryptocurrency more mainstream, coinciding with specific GOP leaders’ wishes.
Mining for new topics to make policy on, many Ohio politicians think they struck gold.
“We chose to lead instead of follow,” Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague said in an interview.
Numerous bills have been introduced to make crypto more accessible, with lawmakers eventually wanting Ohioans to be able to pay their taxes with it.
These online “coins” are stored in a digital database known as a blockchain. Like stocks, they can be traded and sold. One Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fluctuates and is worth about $108,000 as of Thursday.
Ohio Senate Bill 57 would create a Bitcoin reserve fund, allowing Ohioans to pay taxes and fees in Bitcoin. It would also allow residents to donate Bitcoin to the fund.
Ohio House Bill 116 would ensure that crypto owners can use their digital assets to pay for goods and services, as well as protect the currency from certain taxes.
Ohio House Bill 18 would allow the treasurer to invest in “high-value digital assets” in the general or reserve fund.
Ohio House Bill 426 puts regulations in place for “abandoned” currency.
Although digital currency bills were introduced in the last general assembly, the two main pieces of legislation were introduced in late 2024.
Sprague has been a leading voice in the crypto push. Just recently, the treasurer allowed state agencies to soon start collecting payments in digital coins.
“The world is moving rapidly toward digital payments, and we don’t want the state of Ohio to be left behind,” Sprague said.
It’s actually a topic that is bringing the top House Republican and Democratic leaders together.
“I think these kinds of risky things, we need to have a long, hard look at… I’m still scratching my head over cryptocurrency,” House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.






Both Huffman and Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, raised red flags. Crypto spikes and falls rapidly, and bitcoin payments can be hard to calculate.






“We have to be very careful with the crypto industry,” Isaacsohn said. “We’ve seen a lot of abuse; Because of a lack of oversight, we’ve seen a lot of people losing their livelihoods.”
In 2024, the FBI reported $9.3 billion in losses due to cryptocurrency cybercrime.
When I asked the treasurer about possible fraud, Sprague said that the state system would immediately change the currency format once submitted. This is a thorough plan that has taken months to evaluate, he said.
But at one point, the process wasn’t as transparent.
In 2018, WEWS spoke with a Cleveland car salesman named Bernie Moreno — now Ohio’s U.S. senator — who advocated back then for the state to move on this emerging tech.
“By adopting a technology first, and being a leader, you really get an advantage in technology,” Moreno said.
At the time, Moreno became the first person, not only in Ohio, but in the U.S., to pay his taxes with crypto when the state became the first in the country to accept digital currency as payment.
In WEWS’ video of Moreno submitting his payment, then-Treasurer Josh Mandel stood beside him.
Mandel decided in 2018 that Ohioans could pay their taxes in crypto.
Within a year, the program was suspended because Attorney General Dave Yost issued an opinion that Mandel didn’t follow correct protocol in setting up the system.
For the years following, policy remained stagnant, and crypto was mainly ignored by the legislative leaders.
“I don’t know that it is a good idea,” Huffman said. “(A crypto bill) is not a priority.”
Both the House leaders continue to say there is more important policy to tackle — property taxes, education and the cost of living.
Asked who is asking for these changes, and if this should be the focus of the treasurer’s office and lawmakers right now, Sprague pointed to economic uncertainty.
“Actually, I think it’s really important because if we do dip into a recession, we want to be one of the states that is the most advanced,” the treasurer responded.
Businesses have been expressing more interest in crypto, he said, so Ohio accepting the coins could help boost the economy.
Timing
The Trump administration continues to push cryptocurrency, as the president’s own coin and his family’s companies have earned $1 billion from the digital asset.
But another high-profile politician is outspoken in his support.
“Bitcoin and what it represents, more than as a financial asset, also helps fill that void, fill that hunger for a symbol, a reminder of what American greatness was all about,” Vivek Ramaswamy said while speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Institute in March.
Ramaswamy, the GOP-endorsed candidate in the 2026 governor’s race, had long been an advocate for digital currency.
Sprague was asked about his potential as Ramaswamy’s lieutenant governor pick, given his work on the cryptocurrency issue.
“I don’t know about that,” he responded. “But I can say this: I think Vivek is a bold innovator, and he’s looking at the future of the state.”
Strategists believe Sprague is on the shortlist for Ramaswamy’s second in command.
Outside of his official role in government, the treasurer is running for secretary of state. He just announced that he would be the first candidate for a statewide seat to accept crypto.
“We want to be current and we want people to be able to participate in their political campaigns using all the new technology,” Sprague said.
He clarified that the cryptocurrency vendor chosen for state payments is not the same as the one chosen for his campaign.
“Is there any reasoning with crypto being harder to track?” we asked him.
“The way that we’re doing it is we would accept the crypto — we obviously have reporting requirements — we’re actually gonna convert it into United States dollars, and it’ll be put in the campaign and we’ll report everything just like we normally do,” he said.
Sprague said he doesn’t own any digital assets; however, some other politicians pushing for it have confirmed they invest.

Stebbins was arrested in late September on charges of pandering child pornography, according to records at the Franklin County Clerk’s office.
Stebbins, 77, had represented many clients on Ohio’s death row, and supervised more-junior public defenders doing so.
According to a charging document, Stebbins in May transmitted images of a boy engaged in sexual activity. He was arrested in late September and posted bond on Sept. 25. 
His was one of 135 arrests as part of the Operation Next Door crackdown announced by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. Others were charged with compelling prostitution, seeking sex with a minor, or being “johns” seeking sex with a prostitute.

(Illustration by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)While I was off last week writing about Kansas journalists of the past, Kansas journalists of the present had a hell of a story drop in their laps.
Kansas Young Republican leaders were caught exchanging racist, homophobic and white supremacist messages through a group chat with others of their ilk throughout the nation. First reported by Politico, the messages included vice chairman William Hendrix using the words “n–ga” and “n–guh” and saying he admired an adjoining state’s GOP because “Missouri doesn’t like f–s.” Chairman Alex Dwyer used the racist code number “1488,” reacted with a happy face to another Young Republican saying he loved Hitler, and — somewhat perplexingly — wrote that “sex is gay.”
High-profile Kansas Republicans promptly denounced the two men, going out of their way to claim their words didn’t represent the party. Hendrix, who worked in Attorney General Kris Kobach’s office, was fired.
That’s all well and good. But was it enough? Does it actually address the dark clouds of hatred rolling across our state?
If you catch me on a good day, I might say yes. If you catch me on a particularly cranky day, I might say it doesn’t come close. So I wrote two versions of my take, and you can pick the one you prefer. Make sure to read through the end, though, because that’s where we figure out what’s actually happening.
 
The nice version
Kansas Republican leaders have shown that they have more courage and moral fortitude than U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance. 
In quickly and unequivocally denouncing the hate-filled messages from Kansas Young Republicans, party leaders have taken a painful but necessary step. A country with two main political parties can not allow one of them to become a haven for racism, misogyny, homophobia and Nazi sympathizers.
For his part, the vice president claimed last week that too much was made of the messages — that “kids do stupid things, especially young boys.” Never mind that the Young Republicans court those ages 18 to 40. His words might sound hypocritical, given that he just demanded mass punishments against those criticizing the late Charlie Kirk, but he was elected vice president, and you weren’t.
Thankfully, Kansas GOP bigwigs took a more honest and searching look. They even deactivated the state’s Young Republicans chapter. All those who spoke out — Kobach, state party chairwoman Danedri Herbert, Senate President Ty Masterson, former Gov. Jeff Colyer and insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt should be praised for understanding the seriousness of the moment and the necessity of acting quickly and decisively.
 
The mean version
Kansas GOP leaders have turned a blind eye to racism, homophobia and violent rhetoric for years.
Statements from prominent Republicans in the state have proclaimed that these shameful text messages don’t represent the party or what it stands for.
But as someone who has followed and covered Kansas politics for the last decade, I can tell you that these messages absolutely reflect a growing tendency within the party — especially the beliefs and rhetoric of younger staffers and activists.
Party leaders could have stepped in at any point to stop this problem. Kobach, Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins could have said that while they might not support legislation protecting LGBTQ+ Kansas children, they believe that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect — including gay and trans folks. Instead, they strip fellow Kansans of life-saving medical care and persecute them through government agencies.
They could have actually forced Rep. Nick Hoheisel, R-Wichita, to face consequences after clashing with a Rep. Ford Carr, D-Wichita, on the House floor. They could have condemned actions by Reps. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, and Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, after they joked about shooting former Hutchinson Rep. Jason Probst. They could have cautioned Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, that focusing on the hurt feelings of “a little white girl” in learning about racism missed the point. They could have pushed back against transphobic rhetoric from former Rep. Cheryl Helmer, R-Mulvane. They could have condemned racist incidents faced by Rep. Rui Xu, D-Westwood. The GOP-supermajority House couldn’t even bring itself to oppose racism while passing a bill declaring antisemitism against the public policy of Kansas.
For that matter, party leaders could made it clear that they didn’t want to associate with Kobach after accusations that he employed white nationalists. 
But here we are. We’ve lived through years of willful blindness to shameful bias. Kansas GOP leaders were more than happy to continue paying these folks’ salaries and allowing them to serve in government. Until last week, no one paid much of a penalty for racism, homophobia or violent rhetoric. (At least if that person was a Republican. Democrats who point this out can face dire consequences.)
The only reason bigwigs blinked this time was that a story appeared in a national outlet and included clear proof of these activists’ words. That’s it. Other reporting — like the multiple instances I’ve just mentioned — are dismissed as distractions at best and partisan attacks at worst.
Meanwhile, the Kansas Republican Party has leaned into racist trolling during the government shutdown. In social media posts, they put Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in a sombrero and Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard in a Mexican wresting mask. Maybe you find the images funny, maybe you don’t, but I’m not sure how you can square them with Herbert’s claim that “we strive to eliminate racism and we condemn all racist acts and groups.”
Democrats have run people who say terrible things too. The Kansas party has faced its own internal strife. Partisans can lob “whatabouts” until their arms get tired.
But this story is about the Kansas Republican Party and its leaders. Until they clean house and turn their backs on years of winking and nodding at the worst among us, they have no standing to lecture anyone else about morality or good judgment. They have proved that they lack both.
 
The other version
I’m afraid that neither of the preceding versions of this column cover everything. As I thought about the situation more, I came to a conclusion that’s neither nice nor mean.
Kansas Republican leaders have nothing to lose by cutting young idiots loose. The ongoing GOP project in Kansas has one goal, and one goal alone: lowering tax rates for the obscenely wealthy and reducing restrictions on their businesses.
Any other controversy or infighting distracts from those goals.
People like William Hendrix and Alex Dwyer might have seen themselves as important to the state party and its future. Instead, they were pawns being used by entrenched oligarchs to further cement their power in the Sunflower State. The instant that these men became a liability for the state party, they were excommunicated. Masterson went out of his way to “categorically deny any association” with either.
The big-money interests who want to turn Kansas into a zero-tax paradise read the big national newspapers and websites. They don’t want to be embarrassed. A splashy story from Politico threatens their goals in a way that local news stories don’t.
Put succinctly, they can live with racism until it harms their larger project. Then, all those poor suckers who ironically embraced Hitler find themselves on the street.
In Kansas, like a casino, the owner always wins.

For uninsured, low-income, and vulnerable patients in our state who require these treatments to manage their health, federal programs designed to close gaps in access and affordability exist. Yet, many eligible providers in Ohio abuse the country’s largest safety net program.
The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows hospitals serving significant numbers of low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable patients to purchase outpatient drugs at significant discounts from manufacturers.
The goal of the program was to ensure that 340B hospitals reinvest the savings from drug discounts into providing affordable care for those individuals.
However, no such condition in the 340B statute requires participating hospitals to invest these savings in any designated way.
Put simply, 340B savings become 340B hospital profits.
Ohio-based hospital chain said to profiteer from massive charity-care program

Across Ohio, eligible 340B covered entities, hospitals, and clinics authorized to purchase discounted drugs under the federal 340B program reap massive profits without passing savings on to patients.
Providers then turn the equation around and receive higher reimbursements than independent practices like ours, costing Ohio employers, taxpayers, and patients millions more in health care costs.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee found that, from April 2020 to June 2023, Cleveland Clinic generated nearly $1 billion in 340B profits while contributing less than 2% of their revenue towards charity care.
This widespread misuse of the 340B program has resulted in patients being left behind.
Instead of using its savings to expand access for the low-income and uninsured, many hospitals limit in-house infusion services to full paying, privately insured patients, whom the program was not designed for — redirecting those needing financial assistance to clinics like ours, which do not receive 340B discounts and operate with fewer resources.
Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic faces questions over booming subsidies

Despite receiving steep discounts, Ohio 340B hospitals provide less of their operating expenses towards charity care than the national average.
In addition to failing vulnerable patients, misuse of 340B has allowed large health systems to expand their market power.
Today, 340B pads Ohio’s largest health systems’ bottom lines, squeezing out smaller practices and limiting patient options for care.

Despite ongoing calls for federal action aimed at improving transparency and accountability in the federal 340B program, Ohio lawmakers introduced legislation that would enable hospitals to continue exploiting this safety-net program at the expense of patients.
For example, at the Ohio Statehouse, HB 588 and SB 269 would allow covered entities, contract pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to continue generating unchecked 340B profits through a program with little oversight and transparency guardrails.
Our state lawmakers have a responsibility to protect Ohio’s most vulnerable patients, and advancing these bills does exactly the opposite.
The data paints a clear picture: 340B fails to serve Ohio’s most vulnerable patients.
Helping patients access and afford their treatments is part of my passion and why I do what I do, but 340B hospitals need to do their part.
The lack of effective guardrails enables large health systems to exploit the 340B program as a cash cow rather than a safety net, squeezing out independent providers like me and raising patient costs.
Policymakers should fight for regulations that restore the program to its original intent — protecting Ohio’s most vulnerable patients.

(Photo by Elaine S. Povich, Stateline)After years of declining test scores, the Maine Department of Education is introducing a plan to bolster math and literacy skills statewide.
The department is taking a more hands-on approach than it has before, from helping districts identify evidence-based teaching materials and offering professional development for teachers to including families in learning plans. 
While it can’t mandate that districts use the plans developed by expert advisory councils to promote better instruction, teachers and schools across Maine have been looking for guidance, and would benefit from the support the department is now offering, according to several education experts that spoke with Maine Morning Star. 
Maine students in 2024 had the lowest test scores in three decades in both reading and math, according to data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP, pronounced nape), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Although national assessments only offer a snapshot into student achievement, some members of the Maine Legislature and several education experts expressed concerns about the consistent decline in learning outcomes. 
While the department said the work to strengthen math and reading instruction was already underway, the poor test results underscored the importance and timeliness of offering districts additional support, according to Beth Lambert, the department’s chief teaching and learning officer.
“The national assessment results definitely reinforced what we already knew: too many students are struggling with these core skills,” Lambert said. 
The department is hoping this effort will provide more sustained support that will turn the tide, she said, versus a quick response that “fizzles out.” 
Over the past few months, the department formed councils led by school leaders and curriculum experts from across the state to develop plans to improve literacy and numeracy. The plans, which are now public, outline what the department will prioritize. The literacy plan is focused on using learning materials proven to help students read better, while the math plan aims to incorporate the subject more ubiquitously and remove some of the common student fears associated with it. Both plans focus heavily on teacher training and ongoing support. 
The department will start by internally training staff to be coaches sent to districts for curriculum support and professional development, Lambert said. The feedback has already been positive, with many districts asking for resources like these to help them develop better methods to teach literacy and math, she said. 
Maine students score lowest in three decades on nation’s report card

“I feel very hopeful and reassured by the department’s announcement,” said Janet Fairman, a University of Maine professor and co-director of the Maine Education Policy Research Institute (MEPRI,) which conducts legislative research. “That is exactly what’s needed, and I think educators in schools will welcome it.”
Both plans also address some gaps in support that educational experts and district leaders have pointed to as potential reasons for consistently falling scores. Some reasons students weren’t doing as well included the likely failure of schools to use evidence-based literacy and math programs; changing state-level assessments, which resulted in an unclear picture of academic performance over a period of time; and Maine’s strong prioritization of local control, which means the state doesn’t intervene enough, leaving it up to districts to figure out their own academic recovery strategies. 
Evidence-based literacy
A 2023 Maine Education Policy Research Institute report found that the literacy programs used by schools vary widely, and aren’t always evidence-based.
The two most common reading programs Maine teachers were relying on in elementary grades did not meet quality standards, according to EdReports, a national nonprofit that studies and reviews instructional materials that was cited in the report.
Only 20% of administrators who responded to the research institute’s survey were using programs that met the EdReports quality requirements, which are based on the widely accepted Common Core standards.
Fairman, one of the report authors, said that’s because some districts did not have any specified reading curricula, and teachers aren’t sure what to use so they go online, ask their colleagues for ideas and materials, and rarely find resources that align with what’s been proven best for literacy. That’s one of the big reasons why reading scores have not been improving, particularly since the pandemic, Fairman said.
Now, the department plans to align all literacy plans with the science of reading, a vast body of research into what works when teaching students to read. The literacy plan also includes ensuring teacher preparation programs align their reading courses with evidence-based practices and make sure incoming teacher candidates complete a dedicated reading methods course.
The teacher training aspect is critical to improving reading outcomes, according to Sara Flanagan, an associate professor within the University of Southern Maine’s College of Education and Human Development.
Flanagan said professional development is “a critical part of the literacy plan so that teachers receive guidance and feedback on their instruction, and access to training to help implement and evaluate instruction in a way that aligns to evidence-based practices.” 
Research has shown that when teachers have the preparation and support they need to deliver effective reading instruction, their students are more likely to also have positive gains in reading, Flanagan said.
Incorporating math into all instruction
Renita Ward-Downer, director of instruction at the Brewer School Department and a member of the math advisory council, said the new numeracy plan she helped design is focused on building children’s confidence in math at an early age, integrating numeracy into everyday life, and addressing the negative attitudes towards math.
“Our big push is to really think about how we can get it out there that everybody has to do math every day,” she said.“Math has such a negative connotation, but it is all around us. This is about building the culture of thinking in that mathematical format.”
That will start by introducing math into other subjects, particularly at the elementary level, and training elementary school teachers accordingly, Ward-Downer said. The Brewer School Department is already partnering with the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education (called the Rise Center) within the University of Maine to train teachers to adopt that approach this year, she said. She noted that professional development in math is not as widespread as it is for literacy.










Math has such a negative connotation, but it is all around us. This is about building the culture of thinking in that mathematical format.


– Renita Ward-Downer, Brewer School Department


The plan is also focused on demonstrating to students how math can be used in the real world, which will include close partnerships with the career and technical education centers.
“For example, you’re pulling in that construction person and talking about how they’re using math every day to build a house or build a deck,” Ward-Downer said.
At the end of this year, Brewer schools will survey teachers, students and families about their relationship with math to gauge whether they see themselves as problem solvers or mathematical thinkers as a result of the more integrated curriculum, and use the results to adjust instruction and professional development accordingly, she said.
Legislative support
Earlier this year, during a meeting of the Maine Legislature’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,, Republicans and Democrats expressed their disappointment in the national test scores and told Maine Department of Education representatives that their response was “not sufficient.”
“I’m very, very unhappy,” Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York) said during the meeting.
Three members of the committee told the Maine Morning Star hey’re encouraged by the department’s new initiatives.
“Student success depends on so many factors, including family life outside of the classroom, and improving student performance requires a comprehensive approach,” said committee co-chair Rep. Kelly Murphy (D-Scarborough).
“Focusing on evidence-based practices in reading and math and providing teachers with better access to high-quality instructional resources will have a positive impact on students throughout Maine.”
Pointing to the $10 million in literacy grants the DOE awarded to districts last year, Rep. Mike Brennan (D-Portland) said the reading and math plans are “the next step,” but added that there still needs to be accountability to ensure that the curricular support and teacher training is working.
“What I’m going to be looking for and talking DOE about is some further ways that we can measure outcomes and see if some of the training that we’re doing is effective with teachers,” he said. “Ultimately, we want to be able to monitor pretty closely how well students are doing and increase proficiency in both math and reading.”
The national test scores aren’t the best way to measure proficiency, Brennan pointed out, but since Maine has changed its state assessment system frequently over the last decade, it is not yet clear how the state will determine how successful these initiatives are.
Republican Rep. Barbara Bagshaw from Windham partly credited the Trump administration’s focus on “traditional academic learning” and Maine’s compliance with federal executive orders for the learning plans.
“For years, Republicans have been calling on the DOE and the Mills administration to focus on the basics in order to boost student achievement, so this represents a positive step in that direction,” she said. “I can’t help but think that federal support for children’s wellbeing is helping bring this about.”
Brennan disagreed, saying this is the culmination of work the department and the Legislature started five years ago.
While the department is using “back to basics” to describe the initiative, which is a phrase used nationwide by some Republican leaders to signal a shift from social emotional learning to more traditional education, both Brennan and the department emphasized that the label refers to a renewed focus on core learning principles, not a move away from the additional supports schools have added for students over the recent years.
“When we talk about ‘back to basics,’ we’re really talking about going back to what research shows us works, which is explicit and systematic instruction and reading and math,” Lambert said.
“It’s not a shifting of resources or moving of priorities.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)I spent some time Saturday among a couple thousand or so who gathered at the Nebraska State Capitol for the No Kings rally. 
As a journalist, a big part of being at Lincoln’s version of No Kings (one of 15 across Nebraska) — as it is with any similarly-situated event — was to see the numbers, measure the vibe and determine what, if anything, was new or newsy. 
To wit: While the enterprise was peaceful, people did express their considerable displeasure and growing frustration with the country’s current leadership. Call it good trouble with a joyful noise of cheers, chants and a chorus of supportive car horns along Capitol Parkway.
Much of that sentiment was displayed on hundreds of fierce, funny signs, some pointed — and a few profane — but each adding to an undercurrent of commitment that permeated the proceedings. Prominent, too, as was the case in June’s No Kings event, as was the presence of the American flag. Just saying.
While I was there to exercise my rights associated with the press — a Constitutional guarantee under siege in some cities — I also happily exercised my right to be part of a peaceable assembly attempting to petition the government to stop with all its illiberal nonsense. 
One could also argue the signs and voices of thousands fell within the confines of their speech rights, which meant had I fallen to my knees in an unencumbered prayer of my choosing, or intentionally refrained from doing so, I could have made a clean sweep of exercising the First Amendment’s quintet of liberties.
I mention those democratic principles on which we conduct (or are at least supposed to conduct) civic and political discourse, because before the rally, some of official Washington sounded as though the nation was about to be overrun by conquering hordes of subversives, desperadoes bent on destroying all we hold dear. 
Normally, one might attribute such hyperbole (the details of which you’ll find in the next two paragraphs) to political puffery, simple blather or plain gasbaggery. But, as you’ve noticed, we no longer live in normal times.
For the record: I neither hate my country nor support Hamas, ideas trafficked by some Republican leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who went as far as to declare our Lincoln assembly a “terrorist” event. 
While I read no specific comment from Nebraska’s congressional delegation on No Kings events, there is unfortunately more: I am not a Marxist, the appellation I might have trouble defining in terms relevant to modern politics but one Johnson used to describe the millions in the streets on Saturday. I am, however, an unrepentant fan of the Constitution and its principles. 
Oh, and that whole antifa boogeyman shtick, the one Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy used to insist No Kings participants were members? Turns out antifa, as in anti-fascism, is an idea, not an organization of which people can become a member like the YMCA or Young Republicans. Go figure.
Finally, in response to one more charge of those trying to diminish the impact of a gathering of millions of Americans to express their unhappiness with the current administration, no one, including oft-cited bogeyman George Soros, paid me, offered to pay me or even handed me a coupon for a free sub sandwich or discounted car wash for my attendance.
That about covers everything from the let’s-just-make-it-up-and-see-what-happens crowd. To the obvious chagrin of many, the No Kings assemblage was also a diverse lot, a constituency of colors, genders, ages and abilities. The group’s individuals were clearly equal in their rally status, too. 
They were eager to include and encourage friends and strangers alike. All of which meant that if Lincoln’s No Kings rally was a government agency, it would have been unceremoniously closed, lest its DEI energy infect the local body politic.
I saw no masked federal agents, but the faces and nametags of two local police officers riding by on bicycles were in full view. Sprinkled among the crowd were some counter-protestors, others touting personal causes and, I’m guessing, a few professional people watchers and assorted looky-loos there to enjoy the view. 
News reports peg the total number of people at No Kings events at 7 million, a couple million more than showed up in June. Despite the sophomoric, name-calling and lies about who was there and why, that’s a whole lot of dissent. Which, last I checked, is a hallmark of our democratic republic and the right and responsibility of citizens living in one.

Moneywise, WalletHub, Forbes, and Yahoo Finance reported recently that Florida is the second most distressed state in the union in terms of its residents’ debt obligations.
The state saw a 23% increase in the share of people with distressed bank accounts between 2024 and 2025, the data show. In addition, Florida holds the sixth-highest overall share of people with accounts in distress, at 7.3%.
“Measuring the share of residents in financial distress is a good way to take the pulse of a state and see whether people are generally thriving or having trouble making ends meet,” said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst.
“When you combine data about people delaying payments with other metrics like bankruptcy filings and credit score changes, it paints a good picture of the overall economic trends of a state,” he added.
In human terms, this financial distress looks like a sharp increase in bankruptcy filings; residents with accounts in forbearance or deferred payments; America’s lowest average credit scores; and higher prices for groceries, rent, mortgages, gasoline, and health care.
Americans are struggling to pay their bills, even turning to credit to pay for essentials. A recent LendingTree survey found that one-quarter of buy-now-pay-later users have used these loans to buy groceries.
“The last few years have been a whirlwind for Americans’ finances, with inflation, fluctuating unemployment, public health crises and natural disasters making it hard for people across the country to pay their bills,” the WalletHub website says.
In the most recent presidential election, political pundits say, the electorate voted for Donald Trump because of their anxiety and deep frustration with the price of everything.
Electoral implications
According to Clare Goudreau of the Johns Hopkins Hub, “Rising costs were top of mind as voters cast their ballots in the 2024 presidential election. According to exit polls from CBS News, 75% of voters reported that inflation had caused moderate or severe hardship for them over the past year, with 45% saying they were worse off now than they were four years ago. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump vowed to end inflation and strengthen the economy.”
Trump’s promise has fallen flat as inflation has spiraled upwards since he assumed office in January. Corporate greed; Trump’s zig-zag, on-again-off-again tariff folly; and economic factors that most folks don’t understand continue to upend ordinary people’s lives.
A significant swath of Floridians are feeling considerable pain, caught in “working homelessness,” trying to cope with the affordable housing crisis, stagnant wages, medical debt, and student-loan and credit card debt. Meanwhile, wages and salaries fall far short of supporting families.
Meanwhile, economic data show that Florida’s economy ostensibly is strong, with a GDP of $1.76 trillion after years of explosive expansion. While the state is expected to continue outperforming the national average in GDP growth, the rate is expected to slow to more typical, sustainable levels in coming years.
This is not unlike the stock market, which has experienced heady growth for the last several years. The market closed the first half of 2025 at record highs, recovering from an April drop. Some analysts see potential for further gains. Experts see Big Tech, international stocks, and AI-related companies as potential areas of continued outperformance.
The downturn has already begun
But the wealth isn’t trickling down.
A Florida Realtors report notes that, as of mid-2025, a family of four in Florida needs an annual income of $217,651 to live “comfortably,” including savings and discretionary spending. This is significantly higher than the state’s median income.
As deleterious as these circumstances for Florida families, more danger lies ahead.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, says the U.S. economy is standing on shaky ground and, for many states, the downturn has already begun. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia are showing clear signs of recession, marked by economic weakness and job losses that are likely to continue. Another 13 states are “treading water,” he said.
Zandi told MarketWatch, “The economy is still not in recession, but the risks are very high. We’re on the precipice,” as quoted in the report. He warned that the overall U.S. economy is vulnerable and could be pushed into a contraction by even a modest shock.
Much of this weakness stems from economic policy, Zandi said. He noted that Trump’s tariffs on imported goods have created growing uncertainty, disrupted global supply chains, and forced companies to halt plans to expand. A lack of labor-force growth this year has also contributed to the slowdown, he said.
Their problems are driven largely by a mix of slowing immigration, increasing tariffs, and federal job cuts, Zandi argues.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and his MAGA cohort are distracted, however, consolidating political power at the expense of the populace, punishing their enemies and rewarding their friends, and leveraging state and federal funds to bully perceived enemies into compliance. Floridians must organize at the grass roots to fight back.
As the 2024 presidential election showed, in poll after poll, inflation was a major factor in how people voted; now, bubbling anger over the high cost of living can fuel the removal of incumbents.
Floridians concerned about the high cost of living must force government officials to spend more on healthcare, affordable housing, education, higher wages, and support of labor unions so that residents can gain higher incomes.
They have no choice.

Here is Part One.
In the face of current events, depolarizing our politics is imperative now more than ever. 


I attended Johnson & Wales University for culinary arts. I worked in kitchens 12 hours a day between class and my full-time job, and quickly became burnt out. This was at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign when I told myself, “There’s no way Donald Trump becomes President.”
Shortly after, I switched my major to political science. Since then, I have had countless political conversations turn into arguments. Some feel very silly in hindsight, such as when I argued with another student about whether college classes should require attendance. Others feel much more salient, such as my wife and I having different views on abortion.

David McGraw
After many political fights over the years, I knew something needed to change. So I contacted Braver Angels, an organization I was familiar with, but never truly engaged with. Integrating my experiences with what I learned from Braver Angels, the following skills are how I have better political conversations. Some of this advice may be self-evident, others more challenging, but trust the process.
Define your terms; not everyone means the same thing even if we use the same words. Do not go into a political conversation trying to change someone’s mind.  Lastly, we have more to learn from people we disagree with than those we agree with.
Toward the end of my Political Science degree study, I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in New Zealand. One of my roommates and I were up late one night, and politics came up. I do not remember the topic, but what stands out in my memory is that the conversation lasted three hours. Most of the conversation was spent in respectful disagreement until we approached the last hour. This is when I finally asked, “What do you mean when you say . . .” I finally realized that the past two hours had been spent talking around with each other because we had different definitions of the terms we were using. In fact, around 1 a.m., we decided to call it quits because we had actually agreed on the political topic the whole time, not having realized it.
Define your terms. My next principle for better political conversations is much more difficult: Do not try to change people’s minds.
What!? I know what you’re thinking, “Isn’t the point of talking to people about politics to change their minds?” Yes, it is, but how we change minds is more important. Many go into these conversations thinking, “If I just have the right argument, I can logic my opponent into a corner, then they’ll have to take my side! (insert corny maniacal laugh here)” People need to trust you have good intentions to be open to changing their minds. It goes without saying that we aren’t listening when we devote our mental energy to our rebuttal.
Right after college, I joined an AmeriCorps program called City Year.
As someone who believes a life well lived is done in service to others, helping at-risk youth succeed in their education seemed perfect for me. Behind the scenes, I encountered constant political disagreements with my coworkers. At first, we could remain cordial, hoping to convince each other to their side. As time passed, conversations became more tense until the worst of the arguments occurred about halfway through the school year. Looking back on my behavior, I was not listening to them. I thought I could logic my way to getting them on my side, but they did not trust that I had good intentions behind my political beliefs.
Like most of us, I have good intentions; none of the worst stereotypes levied against my side of the political spectrum apply to me. However, I did not earn their trust before expressing why I thought they were wrong. Changing people’s minds about a political position takes time. It stands to reason that few will keep an open mind to admitting they may have been wrong if they are not truly being listened to in the first place.
My frustration at City Year led me to act in ways that cost me friendships. So that your political differences don’t cost you yours, prioritize active listening, and seek to understand your conversation partner’s belief, not some caricature propagated by pundits you agree with. Develop a foundation of trust first, then make the case for your position.
This begs the question, why should we even want friendships across the aisle? After all, aren’t “those people” hateful or bigoted? Not as often as political pundits would have you think.
We have more to learn from those we disagree with than those we agree with. They fill the gaps in our knowledge and point to things we may never have considered. Only by rejecting homogeneous thinking can we gain the whole picture. As people become more geographically segregated by political beliefs, keeping and maintaining relationships across the aisle becomes increasingly tricky. This is where Braver Angels comes in. Many of their virtual events allow us to meet people we would normally never interact with.
I want a future with less political violence. Recently, we have seen quite a lot of it, between the assassination of Melissa Hortman, her husband, and Charlie Kirk. Political violence is unacceptable, no matter who the target, but it will continue if we allow our communication to break down. If you want to keep the conversation going, I hope to see you at a Braver Angels event soon!
Peace be with you.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-20 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The revenge of ‘elderly white hippies’,Viewpoints Contributor and Christine Palm,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/20/the-revenge-of-elderly-white-hippies/,"White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller dismissed the anti-Trump “No Kings” protesters as a bunch of “elderly white hippies.” Let's break that down.,","“We, the People” marched, shouted, sang, honked, hugged and high-fived in more than 2,600 cities and towns across the country on Saturday.
My husband, some friends and I chose to head to Old Saybrook, rather than Hartford, because a small local crowd has a different kind of visibility than does a large urban one. The GOP too often dismisses city protests because, you know, that’s where all the bad people are. Still, we were nearly 2,000 strong in Old Saybrook, a town nationally known more for Katharine Hepburn than anything else.
So, who, exactly, is protesting?
Recently, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller dismissed the anti-Trump “No Kings” protesters as a bunch of “elderly white hippies.” At that same Washington, D.C. press conference he also characterized the preponderance of protesters as “Communists” and “stupid.” And on several occasions, the Trump White House has characterized the resistance as “violent” and “dangerous.”
How accurate is Miller’s characterization? Let’s break it down.
Accusation No. 1: “Elderly.” Depends on where you live. Connecticut skews older (it’s the seventh oldest state, with 18 percent of its population over 65, and a median age of 41). Suburban towns historically skew older than do cities. So, yes, most of the folks I marched with Saturday had gray hair. However, in places where the median age is younger (around 38 in both New York City and Portland, Oregon, for example) the crowd was predominantly young.
And let’s pretend, for a moment, that all the protesters were old. So what? Many of us older folks are willing to take a hit to our reputations, even risking physical assault and arrest, if it means our children can remain safe, and our nation can survive this authoritarian takeover. I have a friend in her 80s who was arrested three times last summer protesting the fossil fuel industry. Stephen Miller, at the tender age of 40, probably can’t imagine being that brave.

And The Alliance for Retired Americans urged its members not to be offended by his remarks, saying, “Don’t let yourself think that he doesn’t understand the power of older Americans getting together and mobilizing.”
On to adjective No. 2: “White.”
Again, this gross characterization is only partially correct. People of color did, in fact, turn out. But the very question of their participation needs to be examined. More than 92 percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris and Black women led the charge across the country in preserving voting rights against orchestrated voter suppression. Have they earned the right to kick back a bit? I think so.
And when ICE agents are clearly targeting Black and brown citizens, one cannot blame people of color for fearing the worst. While it’s too early for definitive demographic data on this weekend’s “No Kings” rallies, historically, Black and brown citizens have protested at disproportionately higher numbers than their slice of their overall population would indicate. 
In 2020, for example, a PEW Research Center survey reported that 17 percent of Blacks protested in race-related campaigns, while they composed just 14 percent of the general public. And 22 percent of people of Hispanic heritage protested in such rallies, despite making up just 19 percent of all American adults. In comparison, while white Americans make up nearly 64 percent of the population, fewer than 46 percent participated in a race-related protest.
Accusation No. 3: “Hippies.” Well, guilty as charged, if by “Hippy” Miller means someone who values peace over violence, justice over injustice, creativity over conformity, environmentalism over destruction of the planet, community over capitalist greed, and the best rock music of all time over whatever drivel plays in his poor tormented head.
No. 4, his broad umbrella of “Communists.” Well, many of the folks marching Saturday were U.S. Veterans. One of them, a Navy guy from Lyme named Pete Lang, said, “I’m here because I fought against everything that’s happening to our country.”
My friend Jane Cavanaugh of Deep River, whose husband is a veteran, unfurled the  enormous American flag given to her by the government upon the death of her father, who fought in WWII. While the White House insists there is a shadowy underground called “Antifa,” they are too stupid to (or deliberately obtuse) to acknowledge the 16 million men and women who served in WWII were the original Anti-Fascists.
And I imagine that the families of the 416,800 soldiers who died fighting the fascists are struggling to understand why those deaths have been officially disrespected by the U.S. government.
No. 5: “Violent and dangerous.” Um, when did we protestors go from “snowflakes,” “woke,” “cat ladies” and other monikers suggesting frailty, to, in Miller’s words, “a vast domestic terror movement?” If he’s afraid of people in frog costumes, a bunch of Portlanders riding nude on bicycles, and American-flag wavers singing “We Shall Overcome,” no wonder elderly white hippies are cause for concern.
Unfortunately for Donald Trump and his staff, once again, the facts don’t support their claim. Following the shooting of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, PBS did an analysis of political violence in America. They said, “Based on our own research and a review of related work, we can confidently say that most domestic terrorists in the U.S. are politically on the right, and right-wing attacks account for the vast majority of fatalities from domestic terrorism.”
Now, let’s look at “stupid.” From the ebulliently zany to the gravely dignified, I’ve met and talked with lots of protesters. I can’t think of one I’d characterize as stupid. Heartbroken? Yes. Indignant, fearful, and furious? Of course. But ignorant of the facts? Nope. Unaware of the fascist takeover and indifferent to the loss of our democracy? Not on your life.
Stephen Miller is a puffed-up little rooster who has forsworn his heritage in order to orchestrate the Trump regime’s anti-immigration stance. He wouldn’t be here had America not opened her Ellis Island gates to Wolf Glosser, Miller’s maternal great-great grandfather on January 7, 1903. Glosser was fleeing anti-semitic Russian pogroms, and followed a path not unlike that of many foreigners who emigrated to America. The difference is, the rest of us are proud of our ancestors, and many of us protest in their name. So while Miller has conveniently forgotten what he owes to immigration, we have not.
Finally, Miller is under the wrong impression that we “elderly white hippies” will “all need to go home and take a nap because  (we’re) all over 90 years old.”
We’ve lived through economic travails, assassinations, wars, illness and hardships he can’t even imagine. We’re not napping, we’re fighting back: loudly, proudly, and without end, for as long as it takes until Trump and his defenders are swept into the history books along all the other dupes and toadies who put the cult of personality over the Constitution.
No, we’re not napping, Stephen Miller. Our eyes are wide open, and we see you.

“People fought and died for us to have the rights we have,” 61-year-old Tracie Benner of Juniata County said outside the state Capitol in Harrisburg, where between 5,000 and 6,000 people gathered. “And now for Trump and the Supreme Court and the Congress to just throw it away, we won’t stand for that.”

Since taking office in January, Trump’s government has slashed federal agencies and congressionally approved funding, indicted political foes and massively ramped up indiscriminate immigration law enforcement. And with a conservative U.S. Supreme Court majority secured by Trump’s three first-term appointments, the high court has repeatedly allowed administration policies to move forward through its shadow docket.

“If you ever look around and think, ‘Am I going mad? Is this really happening?’ You’re not crazy. You’re not alone,” said Justin Douglas, a pastor and Democratic Dauphin County Commissioner at a rally Saturday afternoon in Hershey. “We need moments like this right here where we’re out of social media, we’re in the real world, we’re standing in a park together in our community.”
Similar demonstrations were held in Pittsburgh, State College, the Lehigh Valley and deep red Butler County as part of the national No Kings movement, organized by a coalition of civil rights groups that claimed 7 million people participated nationwide.
An estimated 20,000 people gathered at Philadelphia’s City Hall and marched a mile on Market Street to Independence Hall, where the nation’s foundational documents were drafted, debated and adopted by delegates from the 13 original states. 
Speakers included three of the Philadelphia region’s Democratic U.S. Reps. Brendan Boyle, Madeleine Dean and Mary Gay Scanlon; District Attorney Larry Krasner; and Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes.
On the Montgomery County Courthouse steps, protest leaders in Revolutionary War garb read passages from the Declaration of Independence and listed what they said are the Trump administration’s violations of the U.S. Constitution.
“Americans like their freedom,” Stephanie Vincent, a lead organizer of Community Change for Montgomery County, said. “It’s just getting to the point where people really need to know that they need to come out and stand up against it.”

Many of the estimated 1,500 people who filled the courthouse plaza in Norristown, seat of the commonwealth’s third-most populous county, were protesting for the first time, Vincent said. 
“A big part of these kinds of protests is just people realizing that they’re not alone,” she said. “That there are other people that think like they do and care about the things that they care about.”
In Harrisburg and across the U.S., protesters arrived wearing inflatable dinosaur, cow and shark costumes in order to dial back tension and draw attention to violent police tactics used against protesters elsewhere.

“Honestly, it just feels very American to me,” Amy, the woman wearing the pink axolotl costume, said. She declined to give her last name. “We’re just such a serious bunch, you know? We try our best to just fight for our rights and everything, but we still know how to have fun.”

Don Coleman, 69, said he attended the rally at the Capitol because he’s concerned about subversion of the constitution, especially with a Congress and Supreme Court that he views as beholden to the president. But beyond the actions of the U.S. government, he’s worried about polarization of the American people.

Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive for the shooting in Leland, but the FBI says it may have been “sparked by a disagreement among several individuals.” At least nine people have been arrested, several of them charged with capital murder.
The death of Ebanee Williams was reported Friday by the coroner’s office in Hinds County, which encompasses the state capital, according to a news release Saturday from LaQuesha Watkins, the coroner in Washington County where Leland is located. 
More than a dozen people were wounded in the shooting, and several were taken to other cities for medical care. The violence broke out late in the evening of Oct. 11 as people were gathered in Leland’s tiny downtown to celebrate homecoming weekend. It is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
Leland, on the state’s western edge, is home to fewer than 4,000 people, and the FBI’s Jackson Field Office has been posting pictures of suspects wanted for questioning.

For many Detroiters, shouting and holding up their signs is a way to resist the Republicans’ latest demand for Michigan: Deploy the National Guard to Detroit for what JD Vance called “serious crime problems” during a speech at a manufacturing plant in Howell last month. 
That prompted Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, to say “it’s only a matter of time” before Trump tries to send National Guard troops to cities in the Great Lakes State as he did to other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, and others.
“Good luck with that,” Sandra Therrian, a Detroit resident, who attended Saturday’s rally, said. “No, they’re not going to be allowed in Chicago. They shouldn’t try to come too. We don’t need them. We don’t want them. They can go to their Republican places that have far more crime than we do. We take care of our own here.”
“The people united will never be defeated,” was one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one would continue.
“It is encouraging. I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back,” McMorrow said to the Advance.” We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”
By the end of Saturday, Trump had responded to the No Kings” protests with a 19-second AI-generated video in which he is portrayed as a crown-wearing bomber pilot, in a plane labeled “King Trump”, dropping excrement on protesters. 
A march downtown and an arrest
As the crowd of protesters began a peaceful march from the park, down Michigan Avenue toward the Patrick McNamara Federal building, “No Trump, no troops” was one of the chants the several thousand participants made along the way.

The sole disturbance came from Andre Williams, 24, a MAGA influencer with a megaphone who disrupted the march, circling the crowd of demonstrators in attempts to enter it. He was part of a small number of counter-protesters who also showed up at the No Kings rally and march.
“I came here by myself; I don’t respond to any organization. I am here for my country,” Williams said, while being surrounded by some protesters who tried to pull him away from the crowd. 
“Immigration is killing our country; it is killing Western values. It is taking away my jobs for the American working class,” said Williams.
“I’m unconcerned. He’s looking for views,” said Theoderic Strider, a Florida trans man who recently moved to Detroit to escape that state’s anti-trans and anti-gay legislation. 
“It’s more important to be kind to your neighbors than pretty much anything else right now,” said Strider.
Williams had also shown up at the June’s No Kings protest in Detroit, and as he was then, Williams was confronted by protesters attempting to de-escalate the situation. However, Williams avoided advancing further among the protesters on the road and ran toward those at the entrance of the federal building, where he was blocked by participants. 
Shoving then broke out between those who wanted to throw him out and those demanding that the situation stop. Police arrived and, pulling him by his arms, arrested Williams, and took him into custody. 
A request for comment to Detroit Police about what charges, if any, were filed against Williams was returned Sunday afternoon.
“Adult male was arrested for disorderly conduct. No further information is available regarding the arrest. He was the only one arrested during march,” the email stated.
After listening to final speeches, the protesters returned to Roosevelt Park, ending the No Kings protest with chants still echoing through the streets of Detroit.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-19 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Southern lawmakers say infant mortality rates could worsen with health care cuts,Torrence Banks,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/19/southern-lawmakers-say-infant-mortality-rates-could-worsen-with-health-care-cuts/,"In Mississippi, which has the highest rate of infant mortality, health officials declared a state of emergency this year after the rate increased.","The infant mortality rate, a stat that tracks deaths of infants before their first birthdays, in many Southern states is higher than average for the U.S. — Mississippi’s health department even declared a state of emergency this year after the rate of infant deaths increased.
Lawmakers and medical experts say that health care spending cuts and restrictions on services could make things worse.
“These are states that historically have struggled both with infant mortality and maternal mortality,” Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock told NOTUS. “Medicaid is part of a safety net that impacts overall health. When that safety net is broken, things like infant mortality are impacted as well as chronic disease.”

Democrats warn that a confluence of factors could lead to fewer people accessing care, potentially with dire consequences. The reconciliation bill that became law this summer cuts $1.1 trillion in Medicaid. Enhanced subsidies in the Affordable Care Act will expire in December, resulting in increased premiums in 2026 for millions if not extended — something Democrats have demanded in exchange for their votes to reopen the government — and potentially lowering the rate of people getting care. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2034, the number of people left uninsured could increase to 11.8 million.
States in the South would be disproportionately affected if the enhanced ACA subsidies aren’t extended. According to analysis from the Urban Institute, Louisiana would see the steepest decline in subsidized marketplace enrollment in the country.
Many of these states — including Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina — have traditionally had infant mortality rates on the higher end of the spectrum. Nationwide, the infant mortality was 5.61 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2023; in Mississippi, which has the worst rate of infant mortality, the rate was 8.94 deaths per 1,000 live births. That number climbed in 2024 to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Dr. James Bauerband, a retired OBGYN based in Georgia, told NOTUS that the strain that Medicaid cuts have put on rural hospitals could cause the infant mortality rates in Southern states to increase.
“I understand you don’t want to have to insure people that could get insurance on their own and want to incentivize getting a job and getting good insurance,” Bauerband said. “But, there has to be the safety nets, and I think that making sure Medicaid is well-funded is something they really ought to do.”
Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, recently did a study analyzing the impact that the Dobbs Supreme Court case decision had on infant mortality in states and found that there were “higher than expected” mortality rates “in states after adoption of abortion bans.”
She said the Trump administration’s termination of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System could lead to a lower understanding of infant mortality. The monitoring system collected insights from moms before and after giving birth, asking questions regarding alcohol use and stress during pregnancy, among others.
“Those are all things that we can’t capture in a birth certificate data source,” Gemmill said. “And that was a really important data for people like me to figure out what’s going on with pregnancy health in the nation, in a state over time. And they completely canceled that program.”
“So now it’s like we don’t even have the data to inform strategies on how to improve rates of pre-term birth infant mortality,” she added.
Democrats believe these reforms have lasting consequences.
“Not enough mamas get prenatal care, partly because of cost, and partly because of access,” Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. “Finding places that can treat them can be a real challenge. The Medicaid cuts will impact infant mortality, both for the people who are cut out of health care access, and also for people who depend on rural hospitals and community health centers that can’t survive the cuts and will close.”
Republicans have also raised concerns about infant mortality rates. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican whose state has more than 60 rural hospitals, told NOTUS that he wants to extend the funding for rural hospitals provided under the law from 2026 to 2030.
If changes take effect after that time, cuts to Medicaid could cause infant mortality rates to go up, he said.
“I want to make sure that that doesn’t happen,” he told NOTUS. “Under the president’s reconciliation bill, there’s increased funding for rural hospitals now for the next couple of years. … I want to see that extended.”
Some of the Republicans who voted against the reconciliation bill stopped short of saying its Medicaid cuts could affect infant mortality rates.
“We’ve had an infant mortality rate problem in this country for years,” Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who cited health care as her reason for voting against the reconciliation bill, told NOTUS. “This is not new, and it does warrant research to find out why we also have huge racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.”
North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who also voted against the bill, called the country’s infant mortality rate “unacceptably high,” with root causes including poverty and substance abuse. However, he didn’t see the correlation between Medicaid cuts and infant mortality rates.
“I haven’t seen any data,” Tillis said. “Maybe some people would say that. But they’d have to be statistically, not politically, motivated to catch my attention. I just haven’t studied it.”
Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt called on Democrats to support her legislation to help support women during the prenatal, postpartum and early childhood years of pregnancy. Britt told NOTUS that she will continue to work across the aisle to address it.
“That’s something we’ve got to get to the bottom of … find out what is the root cause,” Britt said.

It’s sunset

Step outside.
The breeze is blowing
wisps of cirrus cloud.
The sky is blue,
the geese are leaving.
Farewell,
we say,
and don’t mean it.
Mean it, please, for once.
The turning leaves will thank you.
The frost has come
quietly along, its hands bound.
Cut it free.
Run your hands through the asters,
the goldenrod…
through the sunlight at the end of the street,
always just around the bend.

This article was originally published by Bolts, a nonprofit newsroom.

On the afternoon of August 1, 1993, the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department got a call to check out the ballfields in Munford, Alabama. When they arrived, they discovered a man’s badly burned body lying underneath an oak tree where spectators would sit to watch softball games. A pair of cinderblocks were nearby, and a charred wooden board was next to him.
Unable to identify the body, the state’s forensic pathologist cut off a hand during the autopsy in order to take fingerprints. They came back as a match for Gregory “New York” Huguley, 32, who lived in Anniston, about 20 minutes north of Munford.
The following month, Maurice Boyd, who was in the third grade at the time, returned home from school to find his mother sitting at the counter frantically trying to track down his older brother, Anthony Boyd. Officers from the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department had visited their house looking to ask him some questions. After Anthony returned home from walking their dog, a rottweiler named Secret, he headed back out to talk with police, as his mother begged him not to go. Maurice remembered Anthony reassuring her that there was nothing to worry about because he didn’t have anything to hide.

“That was the last time he was around,” Maurice, now 42, told me. Soon after, he learned that his brother Anthony, along with three of his friends—Shawn Ingram, Moneek Marcell Ackles, and Dwinaune Quintay Cox—had been arrested for Huguley’s death.
Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Anthony, charging that he didn’t kill Huguley but was equally culpable because he was an accomplice. Anthony maintained that he had no involvement in Huguley’s death.
Facing the threat of the electric chair, one of the men, Cox, struck a deal with prosecutors to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for a sentence that would allow him to eventually walk free on parole. There was no physical evidence tying Anthony to the killing, and so Cox became the star witness at his capital murder trial in March 1995. Prosecutors bolstered their case with witnesses who testified to seeing the men kidnap Huguley, but whose stories clashed in significant ways. When it came time to mount Anthony’s defense, his court-appointed lawyer said that he didn’t have enough time to prepare for the case and failed to call witnesses to corroborate Anthony’s alibi. He was quickly convicted.
Maurice testified during the second part of the trial, when the jury was tasked with deciding whether to sentence his brother to death or spare his life with a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. He spoke about Anthony coaching him in basketball, helping him with his homework, and taking him to the movies and to Six Flags, and asked that the jury let his brother live.
At the end of the trial, which lasted just three days, Anthony was sentenced to death by a jury vote of 10–2. (Alabama and Florida are the only two states that allow death sentences to be handed down even when all jurors don’t agree.) He told The Anniston Star through tears, “I’ll maintain my innocence until the day I die, which I guess will be in the electric chair.”
After Boyd’s trial, his co-defendant Ingram was also sentenced to death, while Ackles was sentenced to life without parole. Cox, who took the stand against all of them, was freed in 2009.
This past August, Maurice was at work when he saw on social media that Alabama had set Anthony’s execution date for Oct. 23. The state is planning to execute him with nitrogen gas, an experimental method that involves suffocating prisoners to death.
“I was thrown,” Maurice said of the news. “Being boxed in a cage for the majority of your life, it kind of sends me spiraling sometimes, and now it’s a little worse to know…there’s a date, and the clock is ticking, and it’s ticking fast.”
America’s death penalty capital 
Anthony Boyd and his co-defendants were tried in Talladega County, in the north central part of the state about an hour’s drive from Birmingham. The rural area is best known for its NASCAR racetrack and access to the Talladega National Forest, but it was also America’s death penalty capital during the 1980s and 90s. The county of around 74,000 was responsible for about 10 percent of Alabama’s death row population, and its juries and judges sentenced more people to die per capita than any other state at the time.
Leading the prosecution was then-District Attorney Robert Rumsey, a former district judge who took office in 1978. By the end of Rumsey’s tenure 20 years later, he had sent 12 people to death row. A 2001 investigation by The Birmingham Post-Herald found that half the people sent to death row from Talladega County were Black, Boyd among them. This mirrored the larger statewide trend; while Black people make up just a quarter of Alabama’s population, nearly half the people on the state’s death row are Black. In 1992, the Alabama Supreme Court found that Rumsey had illegally struck 11 out of 15 potential Black jurors in the capital murder case of a Black woman and ordered a new trial.
Boyd, unable to afford an attorney, was represented by William Willingham, who dabbled in criminal defense, juvenile work, divorce cases, and wrote up power of attorney authorizations and deeds. He’d also previously worked for Rumsey in the DA’s office for four years. In the five capital cases he later tried against Rumsey, Willingham lost all of them. He lauded his old boss in comments to the media on his prowess in death penalty cases. “It was pretty tough against him. As prosecutors go, he was one of the best,” Willingham told The Post-Herald in 2001 for its series “Talladega: Death Row Country.”
Willingham was paid just $1,000 for his work on Boyd’s case, the standard for court appointed lawyers at the time and an imbalance that judges were unsympathetic to. At one pre-trial conference, Willingham said he didn’t want to be appointed to the case because he had to prioritize better paid work. “I just didn’t have any time to prepare for it, plus it gets to be pretty much pro bono work after a certain point,” he told Judge Jerry Fielding, who was overseeing Boyd’s case.

At another hearing, Willingham learned that he would have just over a month to review discovery in the case before going to trial. When he pushed back against the short timeline, Fielding replied, “I think a month is a reasonable length of time for you to get ready.”
Boyd was 23 when the trial got underway. The prosecution said that he and his co-defendants kidnapped Huguley in a blue Astro van in Anniston in the early evening of Saturday, July 31, 1993, then drove him to Munford—where they then duct taped Huguley to a bench, doused him with gasoline, and burned him alive because he had stolen $200 worth of crack cocaine. Prosecutors said that someone else had forced Huguley into the van and lit the match to set him on fire, but argued that Boyd was complicit in Huguley’s death because he was in the van and had duct taped Huguley’s legs and feet to the bench.
Willingham’s lack of preparation was evident from the start. He hadn’t obtained the grand jury testimony a week before the trial, didn’t subpoena four witnesses, hadn’t interviewed any of the prosecutions’ witnesses, and largely relied on notes from Rumsey, his old boss, for his understanding of what they might say on the stand.
Willingham also failed to call witnesses who might have corroborated Boyd’s alibi that he was at a birthday party in Anniston and spent the night at a motel with his girlfriend when Huguley was murdered.
On the first day of the trial, Willingham told the judge that 12 of the witnesses he wanted to call were missing.
The state had its own problems getting witnesses to come to court, but unlike Willingham, it took forceful measures to get them on the stand, including rounding up some under detainers.
In his opening statement, Rumsey explained that he was able to seek the death penalty for Boyd because of the state’s felony murder law, which stipulated that Boyd was responsible for Huguley’s death even if he didn’t light the match that killed him. (Between 2009 and 2017, 83 percent of people charged with felony murder in Alabama were Black.)
“For example, in a bank robbery you’ve got three people in a car and one person sits there and drives the car and two people go in and rob the bank,” Rumsey told jurors. “The guy driving the car is just as guilty as the two that goes in.”
Joseph Embry, the state’s medical examiner and toxicologist who testified about the results of Huguley’s autopsy, said the presence of soot in Huguley’s lungs showed that he was burned alive, and there were traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system and food still in his stomach. Embry said there was evidence of duct tape on Huguley’s face and right forearm, but he didn’t note any such evidence on his legs—where prosecutors said Boyd taped him to the bench. He also said he couldn’t pinpoint Huguley’s time of death, only saying that his body, which was discovered on a Sunday afternoon, was “fresh” and consistent with dying over that weekend.
“And there’s nothing in your examination of the body or any of the findings you made which would link Anthony Boyd to causing the burns on that body is there?” Willingham asked the medical examiner.
“No, sir,” Embry replied.
Police investigators also testified that they’d lifted fingerprints from cans found near Huguley but none of them matched Boyd or his co-defendants.
Without any forensic evidence tying Boyd to the crime, the state relied on the testimony of nine witnesses, whose stories shifted and at times contradicted the facts that prosecutors had laid out.
Cox’s brother, Donique Cox, claimed during his trial testimony that Boyd had told him that “they” shot and killed Huguley, even though there was no evidence that Huguley had been shot. Under cross-examination, Donique, who was 18, said he only talked to police after his brother cut a deal with prosecutors.
Just four of the supposedly dozens of people hanging out near where Huguley was said to be abducted wound up testifying. Each story varied in significant ways—critically, whether they saw Ingram threaten Huguley with a gun or if they even saw Boyd in the van. The one witness who testified to seeing Ingram with a gun and Boyd inside the van was later contradicted by testimony from her aunt, who told jurors that she’d seen her in front of her house all day, miles away from the scene of Huguley’s abduction.
Another witness—who only testified after prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant and police searched five different houses to find and bring her to court—told jurors about hearing Boyd, Ackles, and Ingram discuss Huguley and accuse him of stealing their drugs prior to his death, though she said she couldn’t remember who said what.
During Ingram’s trial, which happened two months after Boyd’s, the same witness admitted to using crack during the time she was testifying about and was now in jail for an assault charge. Ingram’s trial also revealed how witnesses had changed their statements in key ways since first talking to police, like whether they’d even seen Ingram that day—with one man telling police during his initial statement that Ingram wasn’t there when he was shown a picture of him.
Mike McBurnett, the lead investigator on the case for the Talladega County Sheriff’s Department, told me last month that he remembered it well because of how difficult it was to find witnesses. Most were scared to talk or didn’t want to be labeled a snitch. “One of them was on probation, and I think we got his probation officer to find him for us,” he said. “I mean, none of them just jumped up.”
The threat of a death sentence
As police struggled to wrangle witnesses, prosecutors tried to get the co-defendants to testify against each other.
Boyd says he declined their offer of life without parole sentence in exchange for his testimony, because he believed he wouldn’t be convicted. Ingram, who initially struck a deal that would’ve given him a sentence of life with parole eligibility, backed out, even after Fielding, the judge, seemingly tried to convince him to testify. “Do you understand you are deciding your fate?” the judge asked.
When Cox also backed out of the plea deal, Fielding repeatedly reminded him that his decision could lead to him being sentenced to die in the electric chair. Even when Cox told him that he would not testify, Fielding continued to push the issue.
“You have set your life on a course that could very easily lead you to being electrocuted,” the judge said during Boyd’s trial while the jury wasn’t present.
Later that day, Cox decided he would testify after all. Under questioning, he said he’d reassessed his odds of winning his case after meeting with his aunt and grandmother back at the jail.
McBurnett, the investigator, said the threat of a death sentence played a large part in persuading him to talk. “You’re trying to always get somebody to turn against the other one,” he said. “None of them sit down and tell you the truth. You just got to get as much as you can, and then get somebody to cooperate.”
Cox was the only witness to testify about Huguley’s death at Boyd’s trial. He testified that he met up with Boyd, Ingram, and Ackles that Saturday evening, while there was still daylight but it was starting to get dark outside, to look for someone who’d robbed Boyd. After driving around with Ackles in his blue van, Cox said they spotted Huguley, who wasn’t the original target but had also stolen from Boyd. According to Cox, Ingram got out of the passenger side of the van with Cox’s gun, a MAC-11, and told him to get into the van. Cox testified that Huguley replied, “Please, don’t kill me. Just beat me.”
Cox said that Ingram then grabbed Huguley by the arm and pushed him onto the floor of the van. After that, he said that Ackles dropped him off at his car, which he then used to follow the van.
Cox testified that it was “dusk dark” once they arrived at the ballfield. He said Ingram ordered Huguley to lay down on a bench then Ackles taped Huguley’s mouth and hands, while Boyd taped his feet to the bench. According to Cox, Ingram then doused gasoline on Huguley and made a trail around him before lighting it with a match. He said they watched him burn for 10 or 15 minutes before Huguley rolled off the bench and the fire went out. After that, Cox said Boyd got into his car with him and told him, “We all in this together now.” Cox testified that he dropped off Boyd then went back to his aunt’s house, where he stayed the rest of the night.
Under questioning from Willingham, Cox admitted that a significant part of his story had changed between his initial statement to police in October 1993 and the one he gave as part of his plea deal, in late June 1994. In the first statement, for instance, he told investigators that he stayed with Ackles, Ingram, and Boyd in the van after the kidnapping and that they rode as a group to the ballfield. He later changed his story to say that he was dropped off at his car after they picked up Huguley and followed them on his own to the scene of the murder.
“But you weren’t telling the truth back in October, you saying now, when you say you were in the van the whole time?” Willingham asked.
“Right, because then in October I didn’t have an agreement,” replied Cox. “And then when I signed the agreement, [Cox’s lawyer] told me that if I testify falsely and get caught in a lie, that the agreement could be breached. So, that’s when I changed my story.”
Prosecutors said the murder happened between 7:30 and 8 o’clock that Saturday evening, but none of the witnesses who testified to seeing Huguley’s kidnapping could remember what time they saw it happen. Some said it was “dusk dark” outside, while another witness called it mid-dark but had said in his initial statement to police that he saw them after dark. (Sunset that day was at 7:46 pm.)
During Boyd’s defense, Willingham called a witness who was at the ballfields that evening around the time that Cox said Huguley was killed; the witness said that when he left at “dusk dark” there were “a lot of people still there… At least a few hundred anyway.”
The testimony suggested that there would have likely been other witnesses at the fields during the time when Boyd was said to have helped kill Huguley. Willingham did not pursue that discrepancy further, however, and called no other witnesses who were at the field.
Willingham also didn’t call William Mosley, a Munford local who had discovered Huguley’s body on that Sunday afternoon in 1993.
Mosley had told The Anniston Star that he’d discovered Huguley’s body when he got to the field around 3:40 pm on Sunday to assess conditions before the day’s game, and that Huguley was “still bleeding a little out of his head.” That would have been roughly 20 hours after the prosecution’s time of death.
Other witnesses cast doubt on Cox’s testimony, including three people who testified about seeing him and Boyd at a party late that Saturday night, even though he said he spent the entire night at his aunt’s following the murder.
In the years since, Boyd’s post conviction lawyers have said Willingham’s performance fell short of constitutional standards. For instance, they’ve said he never consulted an independent forensic expert to try and pinpoint Huguley’s time of death, which they say could have been done with testing on the cocaine, food and alcohol still in his system.
Boyd’s appellate lawyers also wrote that Willingham had failed to properly interview witnesses who would’ve corroborated Boyd’s alibi or call into question other parts of the prosecution’s narrative; for example, they say other witnesses recalled Ackles being out of town at the time Cox said they killed Huguley. They said Willingham failed to look into another prosecution witness who had a history of mental illness that could have called into question the veracity of her testimony.
And they accused prosecutors of illegally withholding records from Willingham, his original defense lawyer, including those that would have helped corroborate his alibi and showed that witnesses were offered “certain inducements” for their testimony.
In the petitions they’ve filed, Boyd’s lawyers have said the evidence they’d uncovered since their client was sent to death row would show that he couldn’t have been at the ballfields at the time Cox said Huguley was killed. But judges have refused to grant Boyd a hearing that would have given him the chance to present additional evidence, largely on the basis that his claims were either already addressed in other courts or found to be without merit.
When I spoke with Willingham in September, he dismissed the criticism of his performance as boilerplate legal arguments during capital case appeals. He also stressed the structural challenges of defending such cases at the time, saying judges then rarely approved funding for an appointed attorney to hire their own forensic expert—let alone pay them fairly for time spent on their own investigation.
“We had to pay rent, keep the lights on, those kinds of things,” he said. “So we were kind of handcuffed, and as far as resources and how much time we can spend on cases.”
Willingham told me he believes Boyd was sentenced to death because Cox got a plea deal first, which he attributes to Cox’s ability to hire a private attorney.
“It’s sometimes that the first one that can cut a deal [who] gets the benefit of either dodging a death penalty or life without parole, and that’s kind of what happened here,” Willingham said.
“It’s always seemed kind of unfair that one of them or maybe sometimes two of them may get a death sentence, and some of them get a life sentence with the possibility of parole, and some of them may get life without parole,” he said. “It seems unfair that they’re not treated all the same.”
Ingram’s appeal lawyers have continued to fight his case. In one petition they filed in federal court in 2017, Ingram’s lawyers alleged that law enforcement had coerced witnesses to testify, writing “There is also information that most of these eye-witnesses were, in fact, picked up by police during an illicit dice-game and forced to testify against Ingram through threats of prosecution.”
A federal district court denied Ingram’s petition and the witnesses’ credibility was never further investigated.
Ackles, Boyd’s co-defendant who is serving a life without parole sentence, told me he contests Cox’s account. “I have never killed anyone and the lies that were told during Anthony Boyd, Shawn Ingram, myself trials were just that, lies.”
Project Hope
I met Boyd in the summer of 2018, when I was working on a story about Project Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty, an anti-death penalty organization run by prisoners on death row in Alabama. I was interviewing members of the group about how they’d come to join it. Boyd, who was sergeant at arms of Project Hope, told me in a measured southern drawl that, “I didn’t even know Alabama had the death penalty. When they told me it was capital murder, I said ‘What is that? All in capital letters?’”
After joining Project Hope, Boyd says he worked to educate himself about the death penalty, and share what he was learning with the public.
“This justice system is set up for the ones who have and to keep the ones who don’t down,” he told me.
Two prisoners formed the organization in 1989 after an intellectually disabled Black man on death row, thought to be innocent, asked them for help. They put together a five-man committee to raise awareness about rampant problems with the administration of the death penalty in Alabama such as racial discrimination, misconduct, and its disparate application to poor people.
The group still meets weekly in the television room at Holman Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in Atmore that houses the state’s death row. During the meetings, its 15 or so members talk about recent death penalty news and discuss legal strategies for their cases. The organization also publishes a quarterly newsletter, On Wings of Hope, where prisoners write about the death penalty and life on death row.

In 2018, Project Hope members learned that they only had five days to decide whether to choose to die by nitrogen over lethal injection, the method Alabama had been using and which appeared to cause long and painful deaths, drawing legal and media scrutiny. The state promised that nitrogen would be more humane than lethal injections, and that prisoners would fall unconscious within seconds. But the state did not share a protocol for how it’d use nitrogen, or give a timeline for when it expected to employ the method. Members of Project Hope spread the word for prisoners to call their attorneys so they could get advice on how to proceed.
Boyd at the time opted for nitrogen, but he says he wasn’t given enough information and that he later changed his mind. In response, the state has said that Boyd should be locked into using the method regardless.
In mid-July, his lawyers filed a challenge saying that Alabama’s plan to use nitrogen violates the Eighth Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment and that the state’s refusal to allow Boyd to see an unredacted protocol is a breach of his rights to due process. Boyd asked to be executed by either hanging, firing squad, or with drugs used for medical aid in dying.
They cited witness reports from the five nitrogen executions conducted so far in Alabama, which began using the method last year, plus one in Louisiana, which first executed a prisoner with nitrogen in March. During those executions, media, legal, and medical witnesses said that prisoners gasped for air, convulsed, and shook violently against the restraints in their final moments. (When I witnessed Alan Miller’s execution in September 2024, he thrashed and jerked on the gurney as his eyes darted back and forth.) Boyd’s lawyers argued that this showed that prisoners were subjected to “conscious suffocation, terror, and pain.”
In early September, Boyd’s team argued their case at an evidentiary hearing featuring testimony from a dozen witnesses, including journalists (among whom was a reporter with Alabama Reflector), lawyers, and medical experts. Deanna Smith, the wife of Kenneth Smith, the first person in the nation to be executed with nitrogen in January 2024, said that witnessing his death was like “watching somebody drown without water.” Other witnesses testified that prisoners appeared awake as they struggled to breathe for minutes.
In response, Alabama’s lawyers have pointed to Boyd’s critical writings about the nitrogen method in On Wings of Hope, Project Hope’s newsletter, as evidence that Boyd knew what he was agreeing to and is only suing now out of gamesmanship. The state has maintained that the method is working as planned and criticized his lawyers for relying on media accounts to build their case, saying that the courts have ruled they are “unreliable evidence” and “highly questionable hearsay.”
On Oct. 9, Emily Marks, the federal district court judge who heard the case, denied Boyd’s challenge, saying that it was filed too late and it was unlikely that he’d win based on the evidence he’d presented. In her ruling, she wrote that reports of prisoners remaining conscious for up to four minutes during their executions “are largely outside of the ADOC’s control and instead depend on the inmate’s behavior—whether voluntary or involuntary.”
Boyd has appealed his case to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. He’s also filed his own challenges in state and federal courts. In one, he alleges that the state has violated his rights by arbitrarily applying the death penalty while other people charged in murder-kidnapping cases received more lenient sentences.
After the state set his execution date, Boyd says he started working to tie up loose ends with Project Hope to pass on leadership to the group’s vice-chairman, Bart Johnson, and help him take over running the organization. Guards immediately moved him into solitary confinement, a policy the Alabama Department of Corrections adopted for prisoners with execution dates, and he can no longer attend the group’s meetings.
I remained in contact with Boyd after I initially spoke with him in 2018, and over the years he told me about the work he’d been doing with Project Hope, like conducting a study on racial disparities in Alabama’s death row population. He told me that he’d been involved with drugs back in Anniston and had his problems with the cops, but wasn’t involved in Huguley’s death.
In April 2019, Boyd told me that he’d been voted as chairman of Project Hope. It was a cause for celebration, and also an omen: Other members had said that the higher someone advances within the group, the closer they are to death.
Johnson told me that Boyd, who goes by “Ant”, is now “family” to him. “When difficulty arises, I always know he’s got my back,” Johnson said. “And he very much looks out for all of us here as the elder statesman who cares about and for his brothers.”
Esther Brown, Project Hope’s executive director and the only free person in the organization, told me that Boyd “has always taken care of others,” and recounted how he once helped get a prisoner moved to a different cell after he was having problems with people around him. Brown called him “the most effective chairman.”
“People know that he gives a damn about them,” she said.
Brown has protested Boyd’s pending execution since the state set a date this summer, attending demonstrations and a press conference, as well as sending out emails detailing problems with Boyd’s case to raise to Governor Kay Ivey, who will decide whether to grant Boyd clemency.
With each execution, Project Hope organizes a vigil where the men on death row dress in the formal white uniforms they typically wear when they have visitors and share memories of the person who is going to be executed.
Brown has gone through the executions of past Project Hope chairmen before: Brian Baldwin in 1999 and Darrell Grayson in 2007. Both had obtained evidence showing they were likely innocent. She was reticent about discussing the possibility that Boyd could be executed.
“How does one deal with things, you know?” she told me. “The thing is, we’re family. It sounds kind of strange or weird, but that is what we are.”
‘There is no justice system in the state of Alabama’
When I reached Rod Giddens, the lawyer who represented Cox at the time of Boyd’s trial, he was surprised to hear that Cox had gotten out of prison in 2009. Giddens told me that making a deal with prosecutors “was the right thing to do at the time,” and said he believed Cox had an “obligation” to tell police and prosecutors what he saw. “It certainly paid off for Cox when you’re comparing his outcome to the others,” he said. “It is striking.”
When I pointed out that the only evidence of what happened in the ballfields that weekend came from Cox, Giddens responded that prosecutors must have had more to go on. “There had to be some other evidence, because you can’t convict somebody solely on the base testimony of a co-defendant,” he said. “I just don’t remember.”
Cox declined to talk when I reached out to him for this story, telling me via text message, “Tell it like you want to tell it!”
With Boyd’s execution approaching, activists have been working to raise awareness about his case. Last month, the anti-death penalty organization, Execution Intervention Project, unveiled a billboard in Montgomery with the message, “Save Anthony Boyd.” They’ve put up an additional billboard in Talladega.

Despite his isolation, Boyd told me he spends his days as he has for the last 30 years: tackling tasks for Project Hope, working on his case, and talking and laughing with friends who stop by his cell. “This doesn’t change who I am,” he said. “This is something I’m going through.”
He said he hasn’t prepared himself for the possibility of dying by being suffocated with nitrogen gas. “There’s nothing you can do to prepare for something like that,” he said. “You can’t prepare a person for drowning.”
Boyd continues to profess his innocence and insists he wasn’t involved in Huguley’s death. “It’s easy to paint a picture when you got the paint brush in your hands,” he said of the prosecution’s case. “They painted the picture they wanted to paint.”
Though his family visits him at Holman, incarceration has taken a toll. His children have grown up, grandchildren have been born, and his father, grandmother, and great-grandmother have died while he’s been on death row. His execution is scheduled on his daughter’s birthday.
“There is no justice system in the state of Alabama,” he said. “There’s a lot of tyranny, a lot of oppression, a lot of racial profiling, racial discrimination and a lot of underhanded tricks to get what they want. What they have is a politicized injustice system.”
Last week, Boyd penned a letter for the latest edition of Project Hope’s newsletter. “This article has been a long time in the making,” he wrote. “I would love to tell all of you that I believe truth, justicе, and human dignity will prevail, but we’re in Alabama where such things are few and far between.”
Maurice Boyd said he doesn’t plan to witness his brother’s execution, should it happen. “I don’t think I can handle it,” he told me.
“We have an innocent man who has spent the majority of his life behind bars,” Maurice said. “The fight is not over and we’re gonna do everything we can to stop this and hopefully get him home.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Anthony-Boyd-for-Oct-19-2025-story-1024x778.jpeg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s race for its lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives got a little more crowded last month with the entrance of state Sen. Casey Crabtree, a Madison Republican. The seat will be up for grabs next year because Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor.
In making his announcement, Crabtree let people know, in no uncertain terms, that he will be loyal to President Donald Trump. Whether that kind of blind loyalty can get him elected remains to be seen.
“I am the only conservative Republican in the race who has always delivered on an ‘America First,’ ‘South Dakota Always’ agenda,” Crabtree said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “He needs strong allies like myself who will be serving in Congress to make sure he can deliver the America First agenda.”
State senator from Madison formally launches congressional bid, pledges to be Trump ally

In the interview, Crabtree went so far as to back Trump’s tariff policy as well as his handling of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. There are plenty of photos of Trump with his arms wrapped around an American flag. If Trump were a flag, it would be wrapped around Crabtree.
Like the Lloyd Bridges character in the movie “Airplane,” who picked a bad day to give up smoking, Crabtree may have picked a bad year to run for Congress. That’s particularly true if he is going to market himself as a Trump loyalist.
Off-year elections are traditionally tough on the party in power. With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the GOP can expect to take a few hits in the 2026 election.
Something must be up, because South Dakota’s usually candidate-averse Democratic Party already has two announced candidates for the party’s nomination for the U.S. House with another who has filed the paperwork to run. It’s hard to imagine a Democrat getting elected to the U.S. House in South Dakota, but that level of Democratic interest is unprecedented in recent history.
By wrapping himself in Trump, Crabtree is betting that the president’s popularity in South Dakota will help him win a primary against another declared GOP candidate, Attorney General Marty Jackley (a third Republican, James Bialota, of Piedmont, has filed paperwork to run). Crabtree is likely to find that service in the Legislature doesn’t necessarily transform into recognition from the electorate.

In an April poll about gubernatorial hopefuls by South Dakota News Watch, state Rep. Jon Hansen, the only announced Republican candidate at the time, was at the bottom with 2% support from registered Republican voters, despite being the current speaker of the state House. That means Crabtree, a former legislative leader, has his work cut out for him. That’s especially true running against Jackley, a veteran of multiple statewide campaigns.
How Crabtree got to be a “former” majority leader in the Senate may also point to a weakness in his candidacy. He was on the wrong side of the carbon dioxide pipeline law that voters rejected in the 2024 general election. Voter opposition to that law contributed to losses by 14 incumbent Republican legislators in the 2024 primary, and also contributed to the Legislature’s adoption of a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines earlier this year.
Crabtree easily handled “election integrity” advocate Rick Weible in their primary, earning 72% of the vote, and was unopposed in the general election.
But Crabtree was ousted from his post as Senate majority leader last winter when Republican legislators gathered to elect their leadership, and the populist branch of the party is known for having a long memory and a love of primaries. That means a populist candidate for the U.S. House could still emerge and put Crabtree’s cloak of Trump loyalty to the test.

Vermont is in some ways a microcosm of the challenges states across the country are facing when it comes to health care, says political scientist Alex Garlick. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  UVM professor finds link between state-level lobbyists and rising health care costs.","The small scale of Vermont’s population and economy, as well as its aging population, are part of why the state sees such high costs to health care, said UVM political science professor Alex Garlick, in light of the publication of his new book.

In his new book on the role of lobbying in shaping health care policy, University of Vermont political science professor Alex Garlick opens with a scene from his days on Capitol Hill. 
Garlick worked as a congressional staffer for Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., during the intense debates over the 2017 Republican effort to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and he describes the scene just after the failed repeal vote — by a single thumbs-down vote from late Arizona Sen. John McCain — when he saw then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., kick off her shoes and leap for joy on the Capitol lawn.
Eight years later, the publication of “Pre-Existing Conditions: How Lobbying Makes American Health Care More Expensive” comes as Congress is engaged in another battle royale with the same law at its core. Senate Democrats — including Vermont Sens. Peter Welch, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, an independent —  are pushing for the continuation of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in exchange for their votes on a continuing funding resolution that would end the federal government shutdown, now in its third week.
That the continuation of an existing tax credit program for purchasing private insurance is what Democrats are demanding speaks volumes about the influence that industry lobbying has in curbing big health care cost reforms, Garlick said. 
“I think one of the ways you really see the power of the industry is what kind of reform ideas that people will talk about,” he said in an interview on Oct. 10.
Specifically, he said, the tax credits make health insurance more affordable, not the health care itself. As Garlick sees it, the Affordable Care Act, by providing subsidies for the purchase of private insurance, is a more conservative approach to universal health care. 
The cost of health care — to an insurer — ultimately is an issue of supply and demand, Garlick explained. The most effective way to contain costs of care itself is to address those issues systemically. 
Structural Power in Vermont 
In Vermont, the most salient variable in this supply and demand equation is the scale, Garlick said. Namely, the state has a small population, a small economy, one main hospital network and one main in-state insurer. 
“There’s not big competition there, there’s not really any forces trying to push costs downward,” he said.
In “Pre-Existing Conditions,” Garlick develops the idea of “structural power,” explaining the outsized influence large players in a state economy can have on policy. In Vermont, Garlick sees UVM Health Network wielding this kind of structural power, he elaborated in an interview: For instance, in 2024, when the Green Mountain Care Board, a key state health care regulator, set a lower budget than what UVM had proposed, the hospital cut services.
“It probably reminded the care board that they can’t go too far and too fast. They need to tread carefully about how to rein costs in,” Garlick said.
He believes that having a powerful regulator like the Green Mountain Care Board is an important step toward curbing health care costs. “That said,” Garlick added, “limiting marginal growth year over year doesn’t make care more affordable. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube of how costs have gotten high in the first place.” 
How, then, to actually reduce health care costs?  “One way to push back on the structural power of institutions like the UVM Health network is to not rely on them so much,” Garlick said. 
“The legislature could be more proactive about trying to increase the supply of hospitals that exist.”
Garlick also pointed to the $50 billion allocated in the budget reconciliation law Congress passed this summer for “rural health transformation.” He expects Vermont to be well positioned to receive funding through the program. The state is already working on its application for the fund.
Expanding the number of clinics and hospitals, he says, is just one potential way to add more leeway in that supply-demand equation. 
The state would also be well served by thinking more holistically about how the rural health funds can support the health care system, Garlick said. For example, expanding housing options for hospital workers as a key way to ultimately invest in the long-term economic health of the state’s health care system. 
“When it comes to zoning and housing supply, Vermont is coming from a pretty restrictive place. It is difficult to build and difficult for people to find housing,” Garlick said. “When it comes to medical and hospital employees, their inability to find housing is making it difficult for (hospitals) to attract and retain staff.”
It can lead locally trained doctors and nurses to look outside the state for employment and the hospitals to pay high wages for traveling nurses, he added.
Informational Bottlenecks 
In “Pre-Existing Conditions,” Garlick also describes another type of leverage that industry can hold via its control of information. In health policy, especially, equal access to information is particularly challenging, he writes. Often people need medical training to really grasp what is medically necessary, privacy concerns keep many details and statistics protected, and a third-party insurance company can obscure the true cost of services.  
Vermont has relatively open access to information through the Green Mountain Care Board. Annually, the board collects financial data from hospitals and insurers, which it makes public. 
Still, the citizen state Legislature’s capacity to digest that information and act on these complex issues during the short legislative session is itself a type of informational bottleneck, Garlick says. 
“When (lawmakers) lack information, when they lack capacity, that builds a dependence on lobbyists and on the industry to help them make the decisions,” Garlick said. “When you’re depending on information from the industry. It’s hard to expect the industry to issue the recommendations that are going to reduce their own revenues.” 
In his book, Garlick calculates that the state legislatures with the highest presence of lobbyists end up spending the least amount of attention on health care in the agenda and see more expensive health care costs.
Each individual lobbyist in a state ends up costing people roughly $7 per capita in additional health care costs, his research suggests. 
The constraints on setting policy in Vermont, though, are often as much about process constraints, Garlick said. “Because the legislative session is not very long, we have these impasses that develop,” he said. “There are capacity issues of ‘Can we even do this ourselves?’”
Counterintuitively, perhaps, the fact that the cost of health care in Vermont, and in the country, has gotten so unwieldy has made him more optimistic that it will bring a desire for broader systemic change. 
One tool Garlick sees as having potential for creating change is the regional state coalitions emerging as an alternative to confusing — or absent — guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“That type of outside the box thinking is probably something that’s going to be necessary, at least in the near future,” he said. “If a state like Vermont feels like a David versus Goliath taking on some of these well-moneyed interests in the health care industry, states should be working together to solve these issues.” 
Still Garlick also believes that state governments ultimately do have the ability to address the high cost of health care close to home, and that individual voters are capable of demanding more from their state legislatures to tackle these issues more broadly, boldly and holistically. 
“Yes, health care is affected by big, national forces but you also consume health care in a state health care market,” Garlick said. “Don’t overlook what happens at the states’ (level). That is the venue where a lot of key decisions about the health care that Vermonters will actually consume are made.”

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)Republican leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly have made their priorities crystal clear, and the people of this state aren’t one of them. Instead of passing a state budget, repairing our mass teacher shortage, investing in schools, or fixing our crumbling infrastructure, Senate President Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall have announced plans to redraw our congressional districts yet again, this time to help Donald Trump rig the 2026 midterm elections.
It’s a shameful, cynical move that would hand nearly 80% of North Carolina’s congressional seats to Republicans in what is, by every measure, a 50/50 swing state. Under Trump’s direction, GOP leaders are taking a page from Texas’ gerrymandering playbook, aiming to impose an 11-3 map that silences voters and stacks the deck for partisan power.    
This is truly unprecedented
Under the Rucho decision, the U.S. Supreme Court was not considering whether states could redraw maps purely for partisan gain. Normally, districts are redrawn in only two situations: after the census to rebalance populations and uphold the 14th Amendment’s “one person, one vote” principle, or when a court orders changes to fix legal violations.
What’s happening now is neither. Legislative leaders have openly admitted that this redraw isn’t about population balance; it’s about removing voters in North Carolina’s Black Belt to engineer partisan advantage. This is retaliation against voters for how they voted, a deliberate effort to silence communities of color and predetermine outcomes in Congress.
We’ve now seen four congressional map changes in just five years: 2021, 2022, 2024, and now 2025. That’s chaos. If this pattern continues, North Carolinians will live under new maps every election cycle, punished again and again for exercising their right to vote.
Targeting Black voters again
The proposed gerrymanders are not just partisan; they may be racially discriminatory. The target is North Carolina’s historic Black Belt district, Congressional District 1 (CD1). For decades, CD1 has been a vital voice for Black voters across northeastern North Carolina, reflecting our state’s long struggle toward equal representation.
Now, in an effort to rig until red, Senator Berger and Speaker Hall are working to rip that district apart. It’s a direct attack on the political power of Black North Carolinians and a slap in the face to every voter who believes elections should be fair and free.
This is not a democracy. It’s manipulation, plain and simple.
Trump’s priorities, not North Carolina’s
At a time when working families are struggling with high costs, teacher shortages, and crumbling public services, politicians in Raleigh are spending their time on backroom map-drawing. Why? To curry favor with Trump and secure partisan control, not to solve the problems that matter most to the people they represent.
North Carolinians deserve leaders who put our communities first, not a president’s political ambitions.
The people are watching, and they’ve had enough
Voters across North Carolina, Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike, are fed up with gerrymandering. A recent poll found that 84% of voters believe it’s never acceptable for politicians to draw districts to help their own party win more seats, including 78% of Republicans, 87% of Democrats, and 85% of unaffiliated voters.
Our message to Raleigh and Washington couldn’t be clearer: these maps don’t belong to politicians. They belong to the people of North Carolina.
The path forward: fair maps for a fair democracy
Every time politicians rig the maps, they rob North Carolinians of real choices and accountability. Our democracy can’t function when election outcomes are pre-determined by partisan cartography. The only way to end these rigged maps for good is through real reform, independent redistricting commissions to take power out of politicians’ hands, and proportional representation to ensure every voter’s voice truly counts. Fair maps should never depend on who happens to hold power this decade.”

That should not be a surprise since Mississippi has the highest percentage of Black people of any state in the nation.
Despite Missisisppi’s large Black population, without the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the number of African Americans serving in the Mississippi Legislature would be far fewer than it is now. There is no disputing the fact that the Voting Rights Act has resulted in more Black people serving in the Mississippi Legislature and indeed in every level of government in the state – from the local to the national level.
Even with the Voting Rights Act, the number of majority-Black districts in the Mississippi Legislature – about 34% of the 174 seats – is less than the percentage of Black people in Mississippi’s total population – about 38%.
Before the Voting Rights Act, there were no elected Black officials in Mississippi during the 20th century except for those in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou. 
This past week, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the section of the Voting Rights Act that ensures a certain level of minority representation in the drawing of political boundaries, such as for state legislative seats, city council seats and U.S. House seats, should be repealed.
Louisiana, which was forced by the courts to draw a second majority-Black congressional district this decade to meet the requirements of the Voting Rights Act, argued before the court that race should not be a factor in redistricting. Louisiana was assisted by President Donald Trump’s administration in its arguments.
The case before the Supreme Court is a big deal. A decision by the court to gut the Voting Rights Act could provide a monumental boost to the desperate and unprecedented efforts of the Trump administration to convince some states to redraw their congressional districts to provide Republicans more safe seats before the 2026 midterm elections. The effort is part of a strategy by Trump to hold onto the small Republican majority in the U.S. House.
It appears some members of the Supreme Court – perhaps a majority – believe that the protections from racial discrimination provided by the Voting Rights are no longer needed. The nation has moved beyond that, they argue.
No doubt, there has been substantial progress made toward halting racial discrimination since the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson.
But it is worth remembering that in the 2010s, provisions of the Voting Rights Act were used to successfully argue a Mississippi Senate seat that covered 102 miles in various nonsensical directions on the fringes of the Delta was drawn to dilute the Black vote while protecting a white incumbent. Or more recently, the principles of the Voting Rights Act were followed to create three additional majority-Black districts in the Mississippi Legislature.
And it is worth pointing out that state Auditor Shad White, a Republican who aspires to be Mississippi’s next governor, took to social media  to celebrate the possibility of the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. 
“I hope they will rule that the kind (of) gerrymandering that has protected Bennie Thompson for years is out,” White wrote. “If they do, Mississippi should immediately move to create simple districts that are not gerrymandered to protect Bennie Thompson.”
Thompson, first elected to the U.S. House in 1993, is Mississippi’s lone Black congressman. He has been the only Democrat in the state’s delegation in Washington since early 2011, when 22-year Rep. Gene Taylor left office after losing to a Republican in south Mississippi.
Perhaps Auditor White does not know that Thompson lobbied the Mississippi Legislature to draw his district more compact after the 2020 Census. But the Legislature opted to draw Thompson a sprawling district that extends almost the length of the western side of the state – at least in part to protect Republican congressmen by packing as many Black residents as possible into Thompson’s district and keeping the other three districts whiter.
In a 2018 interview with Mississippi Today, Thompson spoke of the impact of the Voting Rights Act.
As a student at Tougaloo College in the 1960s, he was working in the Delta to help register Black people to vote when he had a conversation with his mother, who said, “You know we don’t vote here in Bolton. It was a shock to me that I was up in Sunflower County helping register Black people to vote and even in my hometown they didn’t enjoy the same luxury.”
Thompson said that his father, an auto mechanic who died in 1964 before passage of the Voting Rights Act, never voted. His mother, a school teacher, did and most likely cast her first vote for her son when he ran and was elected in 1969 to the Board of Aldermen in his hometown of Bolton.
Without the Voting Rights Act, that would not have been possible. And without the Voting Rights Act today, it is safe to assume there would be fewer Black people elected to office, not just in Mississippi but throughout the nation.
Some might say that is a good thing. But is it really?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/15182900/AP25288543891896.jpg,,,2025-10-20 07:37:22.964745

Leading 19th-century landscape painter Charles Heyde struggled with financial hardships and personal demons.

The visit was almost more than artist Charles Heyde could have hoped for. One day in the early 1850s, Heyde was called upon at his Brooklyn painting studio by a pair of poets, one in his early 30s, the other in his mid-50s. Heyde must have been particularly excited to meet the older man, William Cullen Bryant.
Though little remembered today, Bryant wrote widely popular poems in which nature often served as a metaphor for spiritual truth. His activism on a range of issues — from opposing slavery to supporting the creation of a large, central park in Manhattan — made him a leading cultural figure in New York City and the nation. 
For a young artist like Heyde (pronounced Hi-dee), the fact that Bryant would take the time to visit his studio, admire his landscape paintings and talk with him, must have felt like a benediction. Perhaps this connection with Bryant was a sign that he too had what it took to be a great artist.
Walt Whitman, right, introduced Charles Heyde to his sister, Hannah, at the Whitman family home in Brooklyn. Charles courted Hannah and the couple soon married and moved to Vermont. Whitman later regretted introducing Heyde to his sister when it became evident that he was abusive to Hannah.

Heyde might have believed this meeting with Bryant would change his life, but it was his connection with the younger poet that proved far more significant. That man’s name was Walt Whitman. Though a virtual unknown at the time, Whitman had recently begun writing some of the poems he would include in “Leaves of Grass,” the poetry collection that would make him a household name. 
Walt liked Heyde enough that he invited him to visit the Whitman homestead. There Heyde met and soon wooed Whitman’s favorite sister, Hannah. The couple married in March 1852. That same year, Charles and Hannah traveled north to Vermont, taking the train to North Dorset.
Like other members of the so-called Hudson River School of landscape painters, Heyde was looking for inspiring views. Named after one of their favorite subjects, the Hudson River School painters were a group of artists who, from roughly 1825 to 1875, strove to depict the natural beauty of their young country. In addition to the Hudson River Valley, many painters made regular pilgrimages to the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
Perhaps seeking something off the artists’ beaten path, Heyde chose Vermont. He would make the state his principal subject, and soon his home, for the final four decades of his life. In the process, he became one of Vermont’s most prominent landscape painters of the 19th  century, along with James Hope of Castleton.
In a letter, Heyde wrote rapturously of the scenery: “Nothing can exceed the wild, bold, natural beauty of this place at present. The hues are incomparable and the artist who in his studio imagines himself a creator or interpreter of nature and her glorious beauties, he finds himself humbled … a child in power, only possessing wonder, admiration and the conviction of his weakness.”
For the next four years, the Heydes divided their time between Brooklyn and Vermont. Visiting Dorset, Rutland, Arlington and Bellows Falls, Charles painted scenes along the Connecticut River, Saxtons River, the Batten Kill and the Black River. During that time, the Heydes moved from boardinghouse to boardinghouse. While Charles found the work stimulating, Hannah wrote home that she felt lonely and found it difficult to form friendships because of their transient lifestyle. 
In 1856, he and Hannah moved to Vermont permanently. They picked the bustling port community of Burlington, an area ripe with scenery that Heyde would paint again and again — the peaks of Mount Mansfield and Camel’s Hump, as well as Lake Champlain backed by the distant Adirondacks. 
Burlington’s comparatively small population posed a challenge for an artist trying to earn a living. While most Hudson River School painters lived in New York, Boston or Philadelphia, Heyde had chosen a town whose population was less than 8,000 when he and Hannah arrived. The population would peak at about 14,000 during their time there, but that was still a small pool of potential buyers.
Heyde was enterprising, selling paintings directly from his studio and arranging to exhibit his work in downtown storefront windows and hotel lobbies, where they might catch the eye of travelers.
Greenville Benedict, editor of the Burlington Daily Free Press, quickly became an admirer and frequently mentioned Heyde’s paintings in his paper. A typical article from 1858, headlined “A Fine Painting,” informed  “Lovers of art and Vermont scenery” that a Heyde landscape could be viewed at James Brinsmaid’s store on Church Street, but warned that it would only be on display for 10 days. Such notices helped attract Heyde’s main collectors, middle- and upper-class Burlingtonians who wished to show hometown pride in how they decorated their homes.
Heyde soon established a studio at the corner of Maple Street and Water (now Battery) Street, in the Rutland and Burlington Railroad depot. The location was extremely convenient for his painting forays. In preparing for a 2001 retrospective of the artist’s work at the University of Vermont’s Fleming Museum, exhibit co-curator Thomas Pierce scouted nearby locations from which Heyde had painted. He found that many of the spots were near the train tracks, leading Pierce to theorize that Heyde took advantage of the rail lines that were fast expanding in his era. 
In his research, Pierce noted how Heyde must have visited the locations many times. Over the years the painter’s canvases recorded changes to the landscape. Early views of Mount Mansfield from across Browns River in Jericho, which would become a classic Heyde composition, show a line of trees along the water. In later canvases, the trees are gone — possibly the result of flooding, Pierce suggests — and a barn, missing in the early pieces, appears in the midground. In that way, surveying Heyde’s works can feel like watching a time-lapse film of Vermont’s development during the second half of the 19th century. 
Unlike many Hudson River School painters, Heyde didn’t erase all evidence of human habitation. His paintings often show signs of expanding settlement, including tree stumps and dirt roads leading into the wilderness, as well as technological advancements: trains dwarfed by the serene scenery and steamboats set upon a luminous Lake Champlain. His paintings suggest he believed that in Vermont modern innovations and awe-inspiring nature were compatible.
Charles Heyde didn’t shy away from depicting signs of human impacts on nature, like these tree stumps in a cleared field in “Shelburne Point at Sunset,” painted circa 1857. Contributed

Heyde’s paintings still resonate today. As William Lipke, a UVM art professor noted in a 2001 essay, many of the views Heyde chose to depict are relatively unchanged today and are “‘places of delight’ that identify the unique topographical and scenic features of the Champlain Valley.”  
In 1862, Heyde won a prestigious commission from the Vermont Legislature to redesign the state coat of arms. Heyde’s version included symbols from the previous coat of arms: a pine tree, sheaves of wheat and a cow. These he set against a backdrop of mountains clearly identifiable as Camel’s Hump and Mount Mansfield.
The Heydes finally found a permanent home in 1864 when they purchased a brick house at 21 Pearl Street, right next to Battery Park, which has a spectacular view of Lake Champlain and the distant Adirondacks. 
The tranquil landscapes Heyde depicted contrasted sharply with life at home. In fact, the Heydes’ marriage was an increasingly rocky one. Hannah wrote regularly to her mother and siblings of her husband’s abusive behavior.  “He does not hurt me much when he gets angry,” she had written her mother in 1856, “he threatened to choke me to death(,) he has struck or pushed me about some, once he bit me a little on the shoulder(,) more to hurt(,) tore or ripped the sleeves of my dress that I wore but all that I care nothing at all about, if he would not talk so to me.”
It would have been easier for Hannah if her husband also treated other people this way but, she wrote, “he can leave my room with the most horrid mouth and be as pleasant as any one you ever saw to any one he meets.”
The Whitmans would sometimes mail Hannah books, or money when the Heydes ran into financial trouble, which she said “Charlie,” as she called her husband, would sometimes take. Heyde made a habit of reading the letters Hannah exchanged with her family.
For his part, Heyde complained about Hannah, or “Han,” as he referred to her, in letters to her family. Writing to Mrs. Whitman and to Walt, who he addressed as “Brother Walter,” Heyde called Hannah lazy and neglectful of her housework; said she often took to her bed, saying she was ill; claimed she would noisily interrupt him in his home studio and rifle through his things; and was suspicious when he returned from outings, sniffing his coat, gloves and handkerchief, accusing him of having an affair.
The Whitmans fully supported Hannah and helped her the best they could. But they lacked the financial resources to extract her from her apparently abusive marriage. If Hannah wanted to leave Charles, she would have found it challenging; married women had few legal rights. Walt Whitman clearly regretted introducing his sister to this man who he now called “a damned lazy scoundrel.”
Meanwhile during this time, Heyde faced a serious professional challenge. The new field of photography was muscling in on the turf that had been painters’ sole domain. 
“Because he was up against photography as competition he had to keep his paintings at a price that was affordable,” explained Pierce. As a result, critics say that Heyde’s later works don’t measure up to his earlier ones. “He couldn’t spend a week doing a painting anymore,” Pierce said, “he had to spend two days, because the more you work it, the more expensive it becomes.”
Some also claim that Heyde’s work started to suffer because he was drinking too much and showing signs of dementia. Pierce thinks that’s not accurate. He pointed to a set of four paintings that recently came up for auction. They are fine examples of the artist’s skill, even though they were painted in the 1880s, late in his career. Heyde hadn’t lost his touch, said Pierce, who suspects the paintings were well-paid commissions, so he didn’t have to rush them.

The only known surviving portrait of Heyde is an etching that appeared as part of a newspaper advertisement for a patent medicine in spring 1892. In the ad, Heyde and a half dozen other prominent Vermonters offered testimonials about the virtues of Paine’s Celery Compound, which had been devised by Windsor druggist Milton K. Paine and was manufactured and sold nationally by a Burlington company. The product claimed to cure a variety of ills, including neuralgia, dyspepsia, constipation and biliousness, as well as liver and kidney ailments.
“I avail myself of the privilege of thanking you — sincerely — for the refreshing sleep I have enjoyed through the efficacy of Paine’s Celery Compound,” Heyde said in the ad. 
(The product’s ingredients included celery and coriander seed, orange and lemon peel, hydrochloric acid, glycerin and simple syrup. An analysis of the compound after passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 revealed that it was also about 20% alcohol.)
Heyde was diagnosed with chronic dementia and admitted to the Vermont State Asylum in Waterbury, where he died on Nov. 3, 1892. He is buried a short distance from the home he shared with Hannah, in Burlington’s Lakeview Cemetery.
Hannah remained in their Pearl Street home for the rest of her life. After she died in 1908, her body was transported back to Brooklyn for burial. The Heydes’ home stood until 1968, when it was demolished as part of an urban renewal project. St. Paul’s Cathedral now stands at the site.
Of course, artists’ work outlives them. 
Like many Charles Heyde paintings, “Lake Champlain and Rock Point,” painted in 1858, is owned by a Burlington-area family. Contributed
The Fleming Museum staged its first Heyde retrospective in 1965, three-quarters of a century after the artist’s death. At the time, 80 paintings were known to exist. For the 2001 show, Pierce and his co-curator Eleazer Durfee tracked down another 74 paintings. Although they found Heyde paintings as far away as Alaska, most had never left the area. They had been passed down through families. Some hung over fireplaces, while a few had been stored and forgotten in attics.
In the quarter century since that show, Pierce received numerous tips about other Heydes held in private collections or being offered for sale. Pierce meticulously logs each newly discovered piece in a digital catalogue he created. By his count, Heydes’ known surviving works now number 226. 
Among the more unusual paintings Pierce has discovered are four from the early 1850s, before the painter had ever visited Vermont. They feature views of New York’s Hudson River. “So now,” said Pierce, “our Hudson River painter has a Hudson River painting.”

Recreationists exploring the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail could be forgiven for bypassing Wolcott, but there’ll soon be no excuse.
There’s a one-room library, an inviting gazebo and parking lot at the trailhead on School Street, but without public bathrooms or much indoor space, the area serves as more of a launch pad for the trail than a destination for people using it.
With 20,253 users in the second half of 2024 and 15,699 in the first half of 2025, Wolcott is the fourth most popular town on the trail, just behind Cambridge and Johnson, despite having a fraction of the accommodations as those towns. The Wolcott Store is half a mile away, over a one-way bridge and along Route 15 with its narrow shoulder.

But for eastbound travelers, some say the best of the rail trail starts in Wolcott. From the parking lot on School Street, riders, runners and walkers typically hang a left toward Hardwick — over the Fisher Bridge, the last covered train bridge to operate in Vermont, and along the Lamoille River to the front gates of the Northeast Kingdom, right now dipped in gold and red for a few more short days.
The stretch of rail trail from Wolcott to Hardwick is one of Michelle Gudorf’s favorite sections, and it’s definitely her husband’s. They live in Wolcott, but they’ve walked the entire length of the rail trail in chunks since it opened last year, and still their home section stands out.
As a resident who works at the town offices just steps away from the rail trail, Michelle is happy to live and work so close to such a beautiful part of the trail. Not everyone is so lucky, and for those who travel to Wolcott to hop on the rail trail, there hasn’t been much of a reason to hang around, post-adventure. But that’s all changing.
For starters, Wolcott is boosting its curb appeal and creating a clear connection to the trail. In addition to clearing overgrown trees and vegetation and planting a new kiosk with fresh maps along the trail, the town received a grant to resurrect the old train depot foundation at the intersection of the rail trail and the connector trail.
When the railroad was operational, the current library operated as a depot on the foundation. The building was later relocated to serve a more useful purpose as a library a few hundred yards away, but the foundation still stands beneath long grass and short trees.
Utilizing a grant, the town has plans to cut back the vegetation and fill the foundation with gravel to create a rest area with picnic tables and two giant outdoor planters, which were hand-painted at a community event. The new kiosk will also have historical information about the depot and its relocation.

Data provided by the Department of Transportation shows that, even if most towns along the rail trail only see the same amount of traffic they saw on their sections of the rail trail as they did the second half of last year, most of them are set to well exceed the previous year’s use. Graph courtesy of the Vermont Agency of Transportation
On the other end of the connector path, the rail trail has helped justify some major community upgrades in Wolcott.
Different town entities are developing a plan to renovate the old schoolhouse on School Street, which is connected to the town offices, and move the library next door into the renovated schoolhouse. The current library would then be leased as a café or restaurant with ice cream, accommodating residents of Wolcott and trail users alike.
A coinciding effort to build a decentralized wastewater system in Wolcott — the first of its kind for the town — would also mean public toilets and running water at the trailhead.
Although the area is removed from businesses on Route 15 in Wolcott, the nexus of the rail trail, library, town offices and a new business would create an important community hub, according to Linda Martin, Wolcott selectboard chair.
“There’s been a lot of interest for years to see something done with the old schoolhouse,” Martin said, saying rail trail momentum has helped the town bring those desires to fruition.
Trust in Wolcott
Reigniting an old effort, a few townspeople earlier this year established the Wolcott Community Trust and began fundraising to pay for the schoolhouse renovation. The project is expected to cost $1 million, and the trust has secured $300,000 through a Village Trust Initiative grant, which should cover the planning and early-construction phases, Martin said, adding she’s confident in various fundraising efforts for the remainder of the cost. In most of those grant applications, the rail trail is listed as a burgeoning community asset.
“We’ve got these big goals we’re working towards as a town, and the rail trail has opened up some good opportunities,” Martin said.
The trust initially considered opening the café in the old schoolhouse, but the library could use more space, and its current building fits an intimate café setting, Martin added.

For gas station purchases, used books, cannabis and smoked fish — all nearby on Route 15 in Wolcott — a renovation to the bridge on School Street will create a safer path to and from the rail trail.
The bridge will be closed from March to September next summer. It will have a pedestrian walkway when it opens again, replacing the current right of way that’s barely large enough for one vehicle.
The bridge has sustained damage over years of floods. It’s been stabilized but needs a permanent fix. Because the town opted to close the bridge during construction, and not build a temporary bridge, the state is covering the cost of the project, save for initial, planning costs of around $80,000, Martin said.

We need a permanent mind shift in how we think about local businesses and how we value their role as economic cornerstones of our communities.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Drew Simmons: It’s time to invest in Vermont’s outdoor businesses.","This commentary is by Drew Simmons, of Waitsfield. He is the president of Pale Morning Media, a public relations and strategic communications agency specializing in the outdoor world. He is a board member of the Vermont Outdoor Business Alliance and a founding steering committee member of the Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative.


​​In late May, as the first wave of tariff impacts seeped into the outdoor industry, The New York Times profiled two Vermont business owners, Carina Hamel and Robby Ringer of BIVO, who detailed how the erratic and weighty new tariffs had fundamentally changed the math of their business. 
“I still feel super optimistic we can make it through this,” said Hamel, explaining how she could only afford 8,000 of 30,000 bottles in an incoming order because of the tariffs. “But I think it’s going to be really freaking hard.”
Tariffs are fees charged to manufacturers the moment a product arrives in the United States. When tariff levels go up or go down, so does the amount of fees charged on arriving shipments. Like a pebble thrown in a pond, every tariff adjustment has a ripple effect, adding a fresh layer of complexity for the manufacturer. 
When dozens of pebbles are thrown? The overlapping ripples can make planning for the most basic business efforts a daunting task. 
Early on, outdoor gearmakers absorbed the new fees in hopes they would vanish by mid-summer. Yet as tariffs have risen and fallen (and risen again), gearmakers understandably began adjusting prices and passing along some of the new costs to their retailers. But along with passed-down costs has come a passed-down dilemma: Raise prices and risk losing customers? Or hold the line and risk losing your business?
Caleb Magoon, owner of Waterbury Sports, recently told me about “nearly daily updates” on price changes, speculations on price changes and changes to existing changes. He likened it to “whack-a-mole” and expressed how huge the challenge has been. Jen Roberts, co-owner of Onion River Outdoors, got more specific with me about the impacts of these retroactive price changes: “Will we trim our fall orders and carry less to meet our budget? If so, will our sales decrease and threaten a death spiral? Will we pass on the price increases in whole or in part to our customers?”
In Vermont, outdoor recreation delivers $2.1 billion of annual economic impact, and retailers make up around 20% of that total number. They hire your family, your friends, your neighbors. They fix your flat tires and give friendly tips on the best place to see peak foliage. They pay local taxes that support local things, and they regularly donate far beyond what’s owed to their communities. 
According to Grassroots Outdoor Alliance, a national organization of independent specialty retailers, 95% of stores give back at least 1% in gross sales to their community, and more than half give back at least 2%.
“People say there are only two expenses you can realistically control in a retail business: inventory and payroll,” Roberts said. “I guess I’m seeing that in action now. With inventory prices going up dramatically due to the tariffs, we have no choice but to cut our payroll expenses. I can’t stomach lowering anyone’s already meager wages or even freezing them at their current level, so we are going to get by with fewer staff.”
Retailers are a resilient bunch, as they’ve endured plenty of uncertainty in the past from rainy summers to Covid-19 shutdowns. But those previous challenges were always external, not eating away at profitability from the inside. They also have not happened during a time of rising inflation and historic drop-off in Canadian visitors. 
The hard truth is that Vermont is not going to be able to bake sale its way out of this. It’s time to do more than make an occasional, feel-good purchase at a local store, and it’s time for a permanent mind shift in how we think about local businesses and how we value their role as economic cornerstones. Who owns a business matters just as much as what that business sells, that money capable of building a future for the local community. 
“People appreciate having local businesses, and for many, I suspect this makes up part of why they live in Vermont,” said Hal Ellms of Pinnacle Outdoor Group, an outdoor industry sales representative who works directly with outdoor retailers throughout Vermont and the region. “But they buy their bikes, shoes, clothing, skis and more from online businesses based thousands of miles away. It’s as if they don’t make the connection between their definition of local Vermont and what their actual actions are.”
This month, Vermont retailers are once again stocking cozy sweaters, hiking boots and wool socks for the fall season; for locals and visitors, it’s a scene as predictable as the changing of the leaves. But as predictability went out the window months ago for those behind the cash register, it is on us to provide some stability of our own. 
We need to think about our dollars in the same way independent retailers do — as money from today that goes toward building the realities of tomorrow. 
These are not just purchases, but investments — investments that fill the shelves for next winter and spring, that build our roads and trails and schools and that support the people and places we need. Because without those investments, that future is in doubt.

Now he sets out just a couple dozen traps, out of curiosity — or force of habit — and he’s lucky to catch 10 lobsters.
“I’ve been doing it all my life. I gotta see for myself,” he said. “But as far as trying to make a living, you can’t do it, not any more.”
Mansi converted his lobster wholesale facility on the dock in Guilford into a restaurant in the early 2000s. In the upstairs office on a sunny September morning, there are a few reminders of the life he used to lead: a “Captain’s Quarters” sign, framed photos from his lobstering heyday, the mast of his son’s fishing boat swaying gently out the window. 
His eyes lit up as he recalled the good days. “We saw a lot of lobsters, a real lot of lobsters,” Mansi said.

In the 1980s and ’90s, Mansi was making a killing, along with the roughly 1,200 commercial lobstermen on Long Island Sound. The Sound was the third most-productive lobster fishery in the country, with 10 million pounds of lobster landings at its peak in 1998, including 3.8 million pounds in Connecticut.
But in the fall of 1999, lobstermen pulled up traps filled with limp, sickly lobsters, and soon after, hardly any lobsters at all. It was an unprecedented mortality event, and the lobster population never recovered. Connecticut saw only 181,000 pounds of lobster landings in 2024, less than 5% of the 1998 peak. Now most seafood restaurants in the state — including Mansi’s — import lobster from Maine or Canada.
The catastrophic die-off is still an emotional subject for Mansi and so many former lobstermen. In addition to the painful memory of losing their livelihoods practically overnight, resentment lingers about how it happened. The scientific consensus is that warming waters, and an epidemic of a crustacean disease called paramoebiasis, were the primary culprits — and that pesticides used to combat West Nile virus may have had an additional effect.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
But the catastrophe was complex and unprecedented, and not all scientists agree on which factors were the most significant. The lobstermen almost unanimously blame the pesticides, and they feel betrayed by the chemical manufacturers, the marine scientists, and the government — whose tightening regulations they resented and whose financial assistance they found inadequate. 
In the early 2000s, as they fought for accountability and answers, the lobstermen had no choice but to adapt to the new reality. Some switched to fishing, clamming or catching conch, but most sold their boats and left the fishing docks behind entirely. 
Now there are no full-time commercial lobstermen left in Connecticut.
But there are still a few part-timers. In the southeasternmost corner of the state, the Stonington port is home to seven active lobster boats. Other than one boat in New London, Stonington is the last bastion of commercial lobstering in Connecticut. Roddy Grimshaw is one of the few in Stonington still at it, a man of 29 who goes lobstering with his dad and a small crew a few days a week.
It’s not just lobstering that’s in decline — all forms of commercial fishing are under threat as luxury development supplants the docks once home to a vibrant blue-collar fishing culture. 
Grimshaw put it this way: “The way I see it, if we don’t stay active … this will become just another yacht club.”

The heyday
Mansi has fond memories of fishing with his family as a kid growing up in East Haven in the late 1960s.
“I just loved being out on the water, the freedom,” he said. At that time, the Connecticut lobster industry was picking up steam after a decades-long lull around the turn of the century. His dad wasn’t a lobsterman, more of a recreational fisherman, but, eyeing the hauls of lobstermen down at the docks, he decided to give it a shot. He started working on a friend’s father’s lobster boat while he was in high school in the 1970s. Then, in 1983, he bought his own boat, the Jani M.— named after his wife — and went into business for himself. And business was good.
“When you left the dock, you knew you were gonna catch lobsters. It was exciting. You’re dying to pull that first trap to see what was in it. And, you know, they were almost always full,” he said.
In the ’80s and ’90s, Mansi was landing up to 100,000 pounds per year on just his boat, over 50% of the state’s entire 2024 haul. At a market price of $3 per pound, he was making a killing. He also started the Guilford Lobster Pound, a wholesaler that bought lobster from other fishermen and sold it to Connecticut retailers and restaurants.

Mansi described a vibrant waterfront community at the Guilford Marina and at fishing docks across the state. He pointed to a newspaper article framed on his wall, which told the story of a fellow Guilford lobsterman who suffered a heart attack. 
“We got six lobstermen all together, and we ended up going out and pulling all his gear. We brought all his lobsters to the pound here, we sold his lobsters, and we gave him a check. We all stuck together,” he said. 
Mansi wasn’t the only one to turn a high school lobstering job into a lucrative career in those years. Some 30 miles down the Sound in Norwalk, Gary Whetmore grew up lobstering with his dad. 
“My father lobstered on a very small scale, and then I got into it on a much bigger scale,” Whetmore said. “I remember swapping lobsters with a gym teacher to get out of classes.”

“It was fun. It wasn’t work. The money was great, but it was the freedom of it. You could make as much or as little as you wanted to make. And if you worked hard enough, you could have anything you want in the world,” he said.
One might think that the accelerating lobster hauls in those days — a roughly six-fold increase in Connecticut from the 1970s to the 1990s — risked depleting the lobster population. Counterintuitively, the reverse was true.
“There were a lot of lobsters,” Whetmore continued, “but it wasn’t natural.” 
Connecticut lobstermen from that era describe their work not as catching lobsters but, rather, “farming”  them. 
“We were feeding them and letting them go,” Whetmore said. Indeed, in the ’80s and ’90s, lobstermen were stuffing millions of pounds of bait fish — pogy, mackerel, and others — into tens of thousands of traps in Long Island Sound. 
The influx of bait represented a huge supplement to the lobsters’ natural food sources, artificially increasing the population to levels never before seen in the Sound. It was great for business, but scientists say the crowded crustacean conditions on the seafloor, combined with the unnaturally young population — lobstermen harvested them as soon as they reached the minimum size required by regulation — likely left them more vulnerable to the disease that decimated the population in the late ’90s. It was the boom before the bust.
“It was not sustainable. Something was going to give,” Whetmore said. “There were no big lobsters here. As soon as they were legal, we harvested them. We’re feeding them, we’re growing them, and we’re harvesting, and whoever worked the hardest harvested the most. And that’s as simple as it was.” 
“It was really, really good, and when it ended, it ended,” Whetmore said.
Mansi spoke of the sudden die-off with a similar sense of finality. “You go out there one day, and that’s it. Overnight, it was done. It was ended,” he said.

The die-off
In the years leading up to the widespread die-off in the fall of 1999, there were early signs of trouble. Two localized lobster mortality events occurred in the western Sound, from Norwalk to Greenwich, in 1997 and 1998.
Whetmore, just a few miles further east, took heed of those early warnings. “I heard about the die-off getting as far up as Greenwich in ’98. And I told my guys that were working for me: If it happens next year, and it comes this way, we’re done. And sure enough, it got here,” he said.
In August 1999, dead lobsters started washing up on beaches along the Sound. On Sept. 16, Tropical Storm Floyd hit the region, dumping up to 12 inches of rain into the Sound in just two days.
By the following week, Long Island Sound’s lobster industry practically collapsed. 
“A week after the storm, when I went out, the lobsters in the pots were nothing but goo. It smelled. It was nothing but lobster parts,” said Tony Carlo, a Darien lobsterman.
The Western Sound was hit the hardest, that fall experiencing a 99% reduction in lobster landings compared to the previous year. Ports in the east of the Sound saw reductions of 64% to 91%.
At first, neither the lobstermen nor marine scientists had a clear understanding of the cause. A New York Times headline on Oct. 18, 1999, read, “Scientists Are Mystified by Deaths Of Lobsters in Long Island.” 
But there was a suspicious coincidence. In August, just a month before the storm, the government began applying pesticides, including resmethrin and methoprene, across Connecticut and New York to curb the spread of West Nile Virus. Because lobsters are related to insects, which the pesticides were designed to kill, many suspected that the runoff from the storm poisoned the lobsters. 
In January 2000, a “commercial fishery failure” was declared in the Sound, and the federal government authorized $13.9 million to provide economic relief for the lobstermen and to fund research into the causes of the disaster. Over 20 research projects across a slew of institutions and agencies were approved. 
When the studies concluded by 2004, a clearer picture emerged. A parasitic amoeba, Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, had infected and killed the lobsters. But it wasn’t just the disease. Researchers referred to a “perfect storm” of contributing factors. Years of above-average water temperatures weakened the immune systems of the lobsters, which are extremely sensitive to temperature increases. The storm may have accelerated the die-off by churning up the waters, bringing warmer temperatures to the already sick lobsters. Furthermore, the unnaturally high and primarily juvenile population was particularly vulnerable to infection.
“When you have a bunch of young animals all together, just like a cold in a classroom at school, the disease spreads through them pretty quickly,” said biologist Nancy Balcom, associate director of Connecticut Sea Grant, who was involved in research after the die-off and published several articles summarizing the findings.
In the decades since 1999, the lobster population would appear to rebound in some years with a new crop of juvenile lobsters. 
“But then a few years later, you didn’t see the adults,” Balcom said. This is consistent with the finding that the water is just getting too warm for the lobsters to tolerate, even though the paramoebiosis epidemic has passed. Long Island Sound has historically been the southernmost tip of the inshore range of the American lobster. With global warming, that map is being redrawn, and their range may soon terminate in Massachusetts.

The pesticides
The role of the pesticides loomed large immediately after the die-off. Toxicology testing and several modeling exercises were conducted, but even the “worst case scenario” model indicated that the concentration of the chemicals never reached lethal levels for the lobsters. The scientific consensus is that the pesticides were not the primary cause of the die-off.
That consensus, however, is not ironclad, and most of the lobstermen don’t buy it.
“The pesticides are what killed them,” Mansi said. “We actually see what’s going on. We were there, and we’re telling you what we saw. They [the scientists] have never been on the water, they just sit in a lab and they make up these models that we have to adhere to.”
The timing of the pesticide application and the storm runoff was uncanny, and the lobstermen observed strange, hyperactive behavior in some living lobsters they caught after the die-off, as well as in certain species of crabs. Mansi helped recruit a biologist the lobstermen considered one of their own, Dr. Robert Bayer of Maine’s Lobster Institute. Bayer came down to Connecticut, performed his own tests, and concluded that the lobsters hauled alive during the 1999 event “showed the behaviors, classic behaviors, of pesticide poisoning — which is hyperactivity.” 
In the months and years that followed, while the government-funded studies were still underway, the lobstermen initiated a class action lawsuit against Cheminova and other pesticide makers, eventually receiving two settlements, for $12.5 million and $3.75 million. The lobstermen see the settlement as a vindication of their hypothesis, while Balcom says the pesticide makers never admitted to causing the die-off and merely settled to make the lawsuit go away. 
“If the pesticides were the primary cause of death, they would have received probably lots more money,” she said.  
Tarsila Seara, a social scientist who studies fishing communities, views the science as less settled, and she understands the animosity Mansi and many other lobstermen still feel towards the biologists, the pesticide companies and the government. In 2019, while a professor at the University of New Haven, she interviewed 20 former lobstermen and published two papers about the social impacts of the die-off.
“There was a dismissal of their experience and the knowledge that the fishermen were trying to bring to the table,” Seara said. “It should have been dealt with differently.”

“The reality is that it was a very complex combination of factors, and the lobstermen really wanted to find the one thing that they could blame, and they were naturally upset because there was no backing of that one culprit,” she said. 
Tony Carlo and Roger Frate, cousins who started lobstering in the 1970s in central Connecticut, were active in the fight against the pesticide companies in the early 2000s. Frate now runs the Darien Seafood Market with Carlo’s help. Alongside tanks with live lobsters (now imported from Maine or Canada), the store has multiple display cases with newspaper articles documenting the die-off and ensuing legal battles. On a warm August afternoon, Carlo wore a red baseball cap with an image of a lobster, and Roger wore a T-shirt with the Darien Seafood Market’s lobster insignia. 
The two cousins are still angry at the chemical makers, politicians and marine scientists they see as responsible for causing — or failing to address — the destruction of their livelihood. 
“We lost everything within a three-week period,” Carlo said.
“We fought in Washington, Hartford, Boston … we fought against some big people at the chemical companies. We kept going for years and years,” Frate said.
Frate and Carlo see the government’s regulatory response in the 2000s — mandating an increase in “gauge” size (a device used to measure the minimum-sized lobsters legal to catch), as well as a 90-day moratorium imposed on lobstering from early September to early December — as harmful and misguided. 
“From beginning to end, it seemed like they were always against us, to slow us down one way or another,” Carlo said.

They argued for years that the real culprit was toxicity from the pesticides, as well as an accumulation of other pollutants from decades of runoff into the Sound. They asked for money to “clean up” the Sound and more financial support for the struggling lobstermen. But their pleas fell on deaf ears. 
Frate and Carlo hold a litany of grudges against the Connecticut and New York politicians of that era. 
“Schumer would never call us back … Blumenthal’s telling lies … Chris Shays, that piece of shit. You got your money. The state got their money. Now the fisheries’ money’s not there,” Frate said. 
Frate and Carlo did eventually collect checks from the pesticide maker settlements. “But it wasn’t about the money,” Carlo said. “We’d give it all back to them if they could give us back Long Island Sound. We want our lobster back.”

A difficult adjustment
Seara, the social scientist, understands the animosity towards the government in the years following the die-off. 
“They were not being supported when they were going through something that was very impactful, very traumatic,” she said. “Some of the programs the government put in place were not well received. They didn’t seem to make sense to a lot of the fishermen.”
Over the years, there were some experiments with lobster trap buyback programs, which paid lobstermen to recover the thousands of abandoned pots littering the seafloor. In September, these programs received a $1.8 million boost of federal funding.
Other programs included various job retraining efforts, which lobstermen like Mansi scoff at to this day.
“They said, ‘We’ll train you.’ Well, there’s no retraining. You don’t take a guy that’s been fishing on the water all his life and retrain him to go work in an office. It’s something that you can’t do,” Mansi said.
What made the prospect of retraining particularly unappealing is that, for so many lobstermen, lobstering is not just a job but a deeply held identity and beloved lifestyle. Seara, along with her mentor, Professor Richard Pollnac, have studied fishing communities across the world, and they’ve found that self-employed fishermen experience some of the highest levels of job satisfaction of any workers. 
“It’s the freedom, being out in the water, being close to nature, and some aspects that are thrilling. It’s a gamble, right? You’re out there, you don’t know what you’re going to get. Every day is different. You have encounters with nature, whales, and beautiful sunsets, and, on top of it, this adventure and this challenge, and this camaraderie,” Seara said. 
“A fisherman once put it to me like this: ‘What other profession in the world do you know that people pay to do over the weekend?’” she said.

Each lobsterman took their own path after the die-off. Some turned to clamming or catching conch, but most couldn’t find a way to support themselves on the water. Many struggled. 
“We had a lot of guys who became alcoholics or drug addicts,” Mansi said. 
“We had to move on,” Mansi said. “I am still bitter about what happened, because not only did they wipe out an industry, they wiped out a way of life,” he said.
Mansi turned his lobster pound on the docks in Guilford into a seasonal restaurant. He considers himself lucky, as he’s still able to work down by the water, and his son runs a fishing boat out of the same port.
Carlo initially got a job doing manual labor down at the docks in Norwalk for $10 an hour, “just to do something and stay near the water,” but it didn’t pay the bills. He was forced to find a new career, so he started a landscaping business, which he still runs. 
“Landscaping, being on land … I hated it. Hated it. I hate it to this day,” Carlo said.
One of the few who seemed to transition smoothly was Whetmore. Immediately after the die-off, he got into marine construction, and he now runs a successful business out of Norwalk, G&C Marine, which primarily builds residential docks. 
Whetmore was included in Seara’s 2019 study; notably, he was the sole lobsterman out of the 20 interviewed who said they believe that warming waters and the disease were to blame for the die-off. Even his own son insists it was the pesticides.
“You can’t argue the numbers. You know, the bottom temperature, it’s there,” Whetmore said. 
He attributes his ability to adapt — and his acceptance of immovable forces like global warming — to a feeling that he is lucky to be alive. In the last two decades, he’s had two kidney transplants, cancer and multiple heart attacks. 
“I’m still here,” he said. “And I think that’s allowed me to bounce back a little bit more than these other guys. Yeah, you lost your lobsters. That’s too bad. Get a life.”

The last lobster fleet
Stonington’s working docks smell like diesel and bait. 
On a sunny September afternoon, a flock of gulls circled the docks as the Lady Lynn cruised into the harbor — 42 feet of scuffed fiberglass, stacked with crusty lobster traps. The Lady Lynn is one of seven lobster boats still operating out of Stonington, the last commercial lobster fleet in Connecticut.
Roddy Grimshaw was on deck with his crew, Ian Crimm and Bubba Dolith, his 10-month-old puppy, Bailey, who ran back and forth excitedly, and his dad, Mike, who bought the Lady Lynn back in the ’70s. They were in a rush to haul out all their traps before Sept. 7, when the season closed for 90 days.
After unloading all the traps into massive stacks on the dock, Grimshaw took a breather. 
“When I’m on the boat, I’m always active, doing something like hauling lobsters, driving the boat, hauling the gear, seeing interesting things. I just, I love it, and I love to tan,” he said, laughing. Grimshaw showed off a new tattoo of a lobster on his very tan forearm.
“It’s been a good year,” he said.

Grimshaw was averaging 160 lobsters (totaling about 200 pounds) each time he pulled traps. Though it’s a far cry from the quadruple digits his dad used to haul back in the ’90s, it’s an improvement from last year. 
“It could last this winter. We could have another great season. But we also could have a really shitty season. Let’s hope,” he said.
It’s not a coincidence that the last remnants of the state’s lobster industry are located in Stonington. Just outside of Long Island Sound, only a few miles from the Rhode Island border, the area has somewhat cooler water, and its fishery wasn’t hit as hard by the die-off in the ’90s. 
These days, Grimshaw lobsters two to three days per week and the rest of the week goes out “dragging” for fish — flounder, whiting, sea bass and others. But lobstering is his true love, and he’d like to dedicate himself to it full-time, though he says the catch is just too variable to rely on. His eyes lit up when he considered the possibility. “It’s a big, big idea, and it would be so great,” he said.
One of his other struggles is fetching a reasonable price for the lobsters he lands. Lobster imported from Maine and Canada for roughly $3 per pound dominate the market, which just isn’t enough to cover his costs. So he sells directly to the public on the docks in addition to selling to wholesalers who are willing to pay about $7 per pound, this year’s going rate for Connecticut lobsters.

His crew members, Crimm, 18 and Dolith, 19, kidded around as they fixed up the engine and organized tools. They’re new to working with Grimshaw, who recently had to replace his entire crew after he discovered that one was drinking on the job, and the other was a registered sex offender.
Crimm and Dolith love the work, even though Grimshaw can give them a hard time. Neither of them has had what they’d consider a “normal” job — they’ve bounced between farming and other forms of manual labor — and they want to keep working on the Lady Lynn as long as there are lobster to be caught. 
“It’s not a normal 9-to-5, which I hate. I can’t do them,” Dolith said while pulling up lobster pots hanging off the side of the Lady Lynn in the harbor.
“I love this. It’s pretty fun shit,” Crimm said while removing and sorting the lobsters. “Who else gets paid to go out on a boat all the time?”
Their boss, Grimshaw, plans to take over his dad’s lobstering license in January. At 29, as the youngest active commercial lobster captain in the state, he’ll represent both the next generation and the last of the line. 
Grimshaw understands the weight of his position.
“There’s not many other people here that does it, that wants to do it,” Grimshaw said. 
He pointed to a seafood restaurant and yacht club visible in the distance. “If this harbor wasn’t here, it wouldn’t make a difference to the tourists and out-of-town people. And I just don’t want to see that,” he said.
“I want to continue,” he said. “I don’t see myself doing something different.”

Whetmore expressed a similar unease with the luxury development and tourism taking over the waterfront that used to be home to so many fishing and working docks. While walking around his construction yard in Norwalk one August afternoon, he pointed to the neighboring lots. 
“There were oil tankers on this river. There were fishermen going down the river. Now it’s condos and rowing clubs. It’s definitely changing. It’s been very gentrified.” 
The Norwalk Planning & Zoning Commission just approved a 59-unit mixed-use complex, with luxury apartments and a boardwalk, on the property adjacent to Whetmore’s construction yard. He said the town government has applied enormous pressure on him to move his business.
In town after town along the Sound, the working waterfront is giving way to luxury housing and recreation. A 2022 mid-Atlantic fisheries briefing flagged “persistent trends toward gentrification of working waterfronts,” noting that the loss of maritime space can upend the cultural identity of fishing communities.
“They don’t want equipment like this. They need us when we build their docks, their yacht clubs, their rowing clubs, and they love us when we’re building them, but they don’t want to see us,” Whetmore said.
“There was a community, a waterfront community, and that’s gone,” he said. “That way of life is gone.”

But now comes Kristi Noem with a 30-second video blaming the current government shutdown on the Democrats, adding an Orwellian overtone to our collective trial by air travel. Many airports — including Eisenhower in Wichita and Kansas City International — have refused to play the video at TSA checkpoints, with most citing policies which forbid the display of political messages.
Other airports, such as Charleston International, are looping the video.
The fact there is any debate over the video is a win for Noem, who directs the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A former governor of South Dakota, Noem transformed herself with a dental upgrade and hair extensions to resemble other women in Trump’s MAGA orbit, and now stars in many of ICE’s action videos of immigration raids.
There’s nothing wrong with dental work and new hair, and a person’s appearance isn’t generally relevant to their job performance. But in Noem’s case, her appearance seems integral to the job. Same with Secretary of Defense (and no, not war) Pete Hegseth. Both had few qualifications and little experience for their cabinet-level jobs, but they look good on camera, in an uncanny valley kind of way.
In other administrations, the Homeland Security secretary would have been broadly mocked and possibly threatened with the Hatch Act for engaging in political activity. But not now.
In the “public service announcement” video, Noem says it is “TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe.”
Then she launches into it.
“However, Democrats in Congress refused to fund the federal government and because of this, many of our operations are impacted and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
This is overtly partisan and dead wrong.
The government shutdown, now almost three weeks long, is the result of Congress failing to fund the government. The House has passed a continuing resolution that would provide funding through Nov. 21, but the Senate has failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to approve a temporary spending bill. The sticking point for Democrats is the end of Affordable Care Act tax credits in the Republican spending bill, which would deny tens of millions of Americans health care.
“We will do all we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel,” Noem says in the video. “Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
While Noem’s video has gotten the most attention recently, other agencies are also plunging into partisanship. The official White House website, for example, has an incomprehensible shutdown clock (you’re left guessing whether the digits are days, hours, or seconds) that blames Democrats. Even more disturbing are partisan auto-generated emails sent from the official accounts of furloughed federal workers.
The top-down erosion of neutrality in the U.S. civil service is an alarm bell of a faltering democracy. Instead of serving the people, such partisanship serves the party — or the man — in power. And the Noem TSA video is uncomfortably close to the tactics employed by strongmen through the ages.
It is propaganda.
“Everything melted into the mist,” Winston Smith reflects in “1984,” the dystopian novel to which all other fictional dystopias are compared. “Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing.”
We are not in 1984 yet, but since Trump’s second inauguration nine months ago we have inched ever closer to it. We now have crossed into burgeoning authoritarianism, where the politics of the leader must necessarily be the politics of a formerly nonpartisan civil service.
You can see it in Noem’s tasteless and disingenuous videos and in a hundred other acts committed weekly, from the landing of helicopters on the roofs of apartment buildings to terrorize residents during an ICE raid to the summary execution by government munitions of boats of “narco-terrorists” at sea.
What the Trump administration is offering, with its “war” on presumed drug traffickers, is the kind of violence that once seemed unthinkable for the United States. Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was indicted by the International Criminal Court, and condemned by the United States, for the thousands killed on his orders for suspicion of dealing in narcotics. Now Trump’s administration appears to be practicing the kind of extra-judicial killings that put Duterte in the dock at the Hague.
With domestic immigration enforcement, ordinary residents — especially in Chicago and other blue cities — are being subjected to harassment, interrogation, and arrest by federal agents in tactical gear wearing balaclavas and other coverings to hide their faces. Some of those detained are American citizens, based on no other suspicion than the color of their skin.
George Orwell, who was writing during and after the rise of fascism in Europe, was keenly aware of his moment in time.
“Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it,” Orwell wrote shortly after the end of the second world war. “It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects.”
It is simply a question, Orwell argues, of which side to take and what approach to follow.
“And the more one is conscious of one’s political bias, the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing one’s aesthetic and intellectual integrity,” he said.
Any writer of some salt will know what Orwell is talking about.
Put pen to paper or fingers to keys and sooner or later you’ll come to the jarring choice of either to scrub your beliefs from your work or let them inform it. Scrubbing pays better, if the scrub benefits the wealthy and doesn’t anger the powerful, but getting your hands dirty is more satisfying. Well, as long as you don’t write schlock and don’t do violence to fact. This is true for essays and even truer for poetry and fiction, and it helps some of us sleep at night.
What will help me to sleep tonight is describing Noem’s video as propaganda. You may have stumbled a bit the first time I used the word, because of its powerful connotations, but now is the time to use powerful words properly.
The Noem video is party propaganda.
Be troubled that your government has shredded some of the last of the norms that defined American democracy and is now engaged in demonizing the opposition party in official government communication.
And it’s not just the other party that is being labeled as the enemy, it’s anyone who engages in dissent or is part of an imagined left-wing conspiracy. A recent National Security Memorandum, ostensibly to counter political violence, prioritizes investigations of a broad swath of culture, including those who hold beliefs that are “anti-American, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity.” Also suspect is “extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”
This executive memorandum, signed shortly after the Charlie Kirk shooting, is a blank check for the Trump administration to criminalize free speech it finds irksome. The overly broad language suggests that any opinion that is inconsistent with Trump-defined patriotism and spirituality is synonymous with domestic terror.
Much of what has been discussed here was anticipated by Timothy Snyder’s 2017 book, “On Tyranny.” In it Snyder gives 20 lessons to resist tyranny, and I find myself returning to those lessons as the second Trump era unfolds.
Of particular interest:
Lesson No. 5, Remember Professional Ethics.
“If lawyers had followed the norm of no execution without trial, if doctors had accepted the rule of no surgery without consent, if businessmen had endorsed the prohibition of slavery, if bureaucrats had refused paperwork involving murder, then the Nazi regime would have been much harder pressed to carry out the atrocities by which we remember it.”
The Trump administration is not the Nazi regime, and we do not yet know what it will be remembered for, but the lesson is apt. By insisting on professional ethics, especially the nonpartisan tradition of civil service, we might slow the collapse of democracy. Will we be able to repair the structural damage to the nation? If we don’t, we’ll soon have another, lesser form of government.
A word is in order here about the origins of the word “propaganda,” which did not have its negative connotation until after the death camps and other horrors of World War II were exposed. The Soviet Cold War-era techniques of falsehood and misdirection cemented the modern concept in our minds. But it was the American Edward Bernays, often called the “father of modern public relations,” who advanced the term in his 1928 book.
Previously, the word had been mostly used to describe the propagation of a particular faith, but Bernays introduced us to lessons learned by World War I’s Creel Commission in promoting the war at home and abroad. Later, Bernays helped American tobacco companies sell cigarettes to women (a previously untapped market) and assisted the CIA in overthrowing the democratically-elected government of Guatemala.
“The intelligent and conscious manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society,” Bernays wrote. “Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of this country.”
Despite the bland language, what Bernays suggested in this and other books was a roadmap to manage public opinion on behalf of governments and business. I’ve written about Bernays before, but his theories are inescapable in modern politics. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, he believed it was necessary for public relations to appeal not to the rational mind, but the sometimes dark corners of our unconscious.
Bernays relied on newspapers and radio to spread his messages. Today, the work is increasingly done through videos and social media. The RAND Corp., the public policy thinktank, has given a name to the kind of rapid-fire partial truths and outright deceits pioneered in 2008 by Russia: the “Firehose of Falsehood.” This has now come to dominate American politics as well, and more than ever professional fact checkers — journalists and scholars and dedicated civil servants at our nations’ airport — are needed to counter the damage.
Journalists have long been the target for many of the Trump administration’s attacks, but what happened Oct. 15 is the clearest sign yet that truth is under attack: Reporters for dozens of outlets left the Pentagon after having their accreditation revoked for refusing new rules that would limit their newsgathering. Under Hegseth’s policy, the journalists would have had to agree to only use authorized information provided to them by officials. Even Fox News left. It was the first time since the Pentagon opened in 1943 that no major news sources were accredited.
The Noem TSA videos are playing in just a few airports now.
But what about next time? Perhaps during the next shutdown a few more will give in, just a bit more propaganda wrapped in patriotism. And what about the shutdown after that? The videos will seem just a normal part of life, like the ever-present visage of Big Brother in “1984.”

In downtown Anchorage, protesters filled Town Square Park, and the crowd spilled over to line W 5th and W 6th avenues, where they waved signs and passing cars honked in support. 
“It’s a matter of we are losing our rights,” said Keri Lord of Anchorage, dressed in a long cape and crown for the no kings theme. “And we are headed towards fascism, and it needs to stop now.”

There were speeches, chants, poetry and songs. The crowd also showed support for the evacuees of the devastating storm in western Alaska, and urged donations and continued aid for relief and recovery efforts. Non-profits and advocacy groups hosted tables along the Atwood Concert Hall with educational materials and hot coffee. 
“It’s great to see so many people come out,” said Karan Gier, matching Lord in a cape and crown, holding a sign reading “No troops in our streets.“ And from all ages. That’s what’s especially wonderful. We’ve seen that all summer, because we’ve been to all of (the protests) all summer long. And  it makes your heart feel good to see this. We’re not a silent majority. We are loud.”
At least 25 communities held events throughout the state for No Kings day, including Kotzebue, Nome, Fairbanks, Talkeetna, Healy, Wasilla, Anchorage, Girdwood, Soldotna, Kenai, Homer, Seward, Dillingham, Kodiak, Valdez, Haines, Gustavus, Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan and others.

More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations were planned across the country, and millions turned out Saturday to protest the Trump administration
Alaskan’s protest signs shared on social media and in Anchorage used humor and satire to mock and condemn President Donald Trump, his cabinet, and recent moves to expand executive powers as authoritarian. Speakers denounced cuts to federal funding and social services such as Medicaid, disregard for the rule of law, and the ongoing government shutdown.
Many protest signs denounced the deployment of U.S. military troops in Democratic-led cities across the country, and the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement violently arresting immigrants and U.S. citizens.
“I love this country, and I think we should be better,” said Kathryn Schild, a life-long Anchorage resident. “I’m appalled at what we are doing to our friends and our neighbors and our loved ones.”
“And this is what we can do, right?” she said. “We have a voice, we can call, we can protest, we can stand up, and we can demand that our government work for us.”

The problem is the rules for bringing your “wheels” are much different depending on your carrier.


METRO-NORTH: You can bring your non-electric-powered bike on the train anytime except rush-hour.  Some cars include wall-mounted racks; check TrainTime for bike-friendly trains and car markings.  If you have a folding bike that can stow in the overhead rack, you can bring it anytime.
But if your bike or scooter is powered, the rules are quite different.
First, you can’t ride your e-whatever at the station, on the platform or in the train. You can only bring your wheels on the train if it folds up, weighs less than 100 pounds and is your property, i.e. not a CitiBike, VEO etc.
You cannot charge your e-bike on the train.  It must have UL-certified batteries and be stored in an area so it doesn’t block other passengers.  Whatever the rules may be, the train conductor or railroad staffer always has the final say and can stop you and your bike from being on the train.
Remember… if your final destination is Grand Central Terminal there are any number of Citi Bike stations just outside on the street.  At New Haven there are bike-shares available through Ride New Haven.
SHORE LINE EAST and HARTFORD LINE: The e-bike rules here are quite similar.  Unlike on Metro-North, regular (non-electric) bicycles are welcome anytime.  On the Harford Line, CT Rail trains welcome bikes anytime for free.  But Amtrak Hartford Line trains accept bikes only with a reservation and a charge of $20.  All e-bikes with lithium-ion batteries are banned on all trains on the line.
At Hartford’s Union Station you can rent a scooter (but no bikes) through VEO.  Bikes may be added in the future.
CT TRANSIT BUSES: Connecticut’s buses were pioneers in allowing bikes… not on the bus, but on racks mounted on the front of the bus.  The racks only hold two bikes, and its first-come, first-carried.


Only standard non-motorized bikes are allowed on racks; e-bikes, scooters, and motorized vehicles are not permitted, regardless of weight.
OTHER BUSES IN CONNECTICUT: All GBTA (Greater Bridgeport) buses are equipped to carry your bicycle… two-bike maximum, first-come first-served.  Norwalk Transit rules aren’t crystal clear.  You might want to consult your carrier’s website or ask the driver before trying to transport your device.
PORT JEFFERSON FERRY: The Port Jefferson Ferry allows bicycles and e-bikes onboard, but according to company policy, they are considered luggage and must be kept with the rider at all times.  Cyclists are required to carry their bikes as well as any baggage up and down staircases to the passenger decks.  If there’s room you can use the elevator.
Whatever your destination, always BYO (and wear) a helmet when operating on two wheels.  And remember:  E-bikes and scooters should use UL-certified batteries and never be charged aboard any vehicle or station.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/loading-bike-on-bus.jpg,,,2025-10-19 01:02:05.051734

Marchers chanted “Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!” and “We are unstoppable! A better world is possible!”
The march started a little before the UW-Madison football team was scheduled to kick off against Ohio State. A Bucky the Badger who came to the march said he wasn’t upset about missing the game for the protest. “The People’s Bucky believes in democracy… Without democracy, there would be no games,” he said.

Candy Neumeier, a former teacher who drove down from outside of Oshkosh for the rally, said she was attending to “stand up for our rights,” which are “being trampled on by this wannabe dictator and his crew.” She wore a trash bag with Jeffrey Epstein’s face and President Donald Trump’s hand drawn on it. “I really believe that we need to release the Epstein files.”
From a stage set up on the Capitol steps, Ali Muldrow, a Madison school board member and activist who emceed the rally, said there are about 20,000 people at the protest in Wisconsin’s capital city.
Dane County Circuit Court Judge Everett Mitchell told the crowd,“Yes, judges are out here, too. I might get in trouble on Monday, but I’m here right now.”

“You’re living in the redefinition of our democracy right now. Our legal systems are being retooled, reconfigured, and realigned to incentivize ultimate power… The war for civil rights is being waged all over again,” Mitchell added.
Ben Wikler, former Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair, tied the protests and pushback against Trump to the crucial state level elections that will take place in Wisconsin in 2026, including the spring state Supreme Court election, the race for an open gubernatorial seat and races that will determine control of the state Senate and Assembly in the fall.

“The only way to break democracy in America is to break it in the states,” Wikler said. “If Trump wants to be king, he’s going to need people in offices like the governorship who certified elections in the state of Wisconsin and offices, like our state Supreme Court, who will be in his back pocket. Wisconsin, are we going to be in Trump’s back pocket next year?”
The crowd shouted, “No!”  
“Are we gonna be on the streets instead and talk to people who maybe never voted before, but are ready to vote now because they understand what is at stake?” Wikler asked to the sound of cheers. “Are we gonna get out of the boat, and are we gonna win elections and are we going to defend democracy?” 
“Let’s fight! No kings! Forward!” Wikler shouted.

Milwaukee tops 18,000
More than 18,000 protesters filled downtown Milwaukee as part of the No Kings day events taking place across Wisconsin and the country Saturday to protest the administration of President Donald Trump.

A large number of people at the protest said they were motivated to come Saturday as a direct response to what they see as heavy handed actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In recent weeks, ICE has increased its presence in Wisconsin, conducting raids of migrant workers in communities including Madison and Manitowoc.

The protest attendance topped the 16,000 that attended the No Kings protest in the city in June — despite sister events taking place in the Milwaukee County suburbs of Cudahy, Greenfield and Shorewood, and additional events in nearby Waukesha County.
The crowd gathered at Cathedral Square Park, just blocks from city hall, before marching on a 1.8 mile course through downtown.
Mirroring protesters that have gained attention for wearing inflatable costumes during confrontations with federal agents in cities such as Chicago and Portland, Ore., attendees in Milwaukee were dressed as dinosaurs, aliens and unicorns.
At the park, Jim Baran, a Brown Deer resident, sported a banana costume and flew an upside down U.S. flag — a maritime code for distress. Baran said he wanted to attend the protest to show he’s “not going to stand for shenanigans” from the Trump administration.
“He’s selling America, he doesn’t care about Americans,” Baran said.

Stephanie Jacks, a New Berlin resident, said she came to the Milwaukee protest so residents of the city know people in the surrounding communities support it.
“There’s no due process,” she said. “There’s no checks and balances.”
A Milwaukee resident who only gave their name as J. and said they were a first generation Mexican-American, was dressed in an inflatable alien costume in an effort to make Trump claims of violent protesters seem silly and “take the wind out of their sails.”
“This alien is anti-ICE,” they said.
Kelly, a Milwaukee resident who declined to give a last name, said she’s a former deputy sheriff who is “appalled” by the actions of ICE agents. “I can’t believe what they’re doing,” she said. “The level of incompetence, no training, no supervision, no rules. It’s just insane.”

Green Bay rebuffs ICE
On Green Bay protestors’ march downtown, one of their chants was “No KKK, no fascist USA, no ICE.”

By the Brown County Courthouse in downtown Green Bay, protestors sang advice for interacting with law enforcement, including “Ask if you’re free to go, ask for a lawyer, protect yourself and neighbors and record, record, record.”
A speaker called for the crowd to go to their sheriffs about sheriffs’ partnerships with ICE, report possible ICE activity to the advocacy group Voces de la Frontera “so we can protect the immigrants who are amongst us,” tell legislators to pass a bill allowing drivers’ licenses for immigrants without legal status and support families they know who have been separated. 
Other speeches included concerns related to public education, trans rights, Israel and Palestine and free speech.

Rick Crosson, candidate for northeast Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District, came to the protest. He told the Examiner that “for us, it’s about getting back what the Constitution had intended. And that is, have the people run the show. No kings, no dictators, no autocrats.”
Green Bay’s Neville Public Museum is looking for donations that reflect people’s experiences with “No Kings.” In a Facebook post, the museum provided a list of items it is specifically looking for, which includes protest or counter-protest signs, photographs, journal entries and digital recordings. 
“It is our responsibility to collect the stories of today to help create understanding in the future,” the museum explained in a statement.

Hayward sees record crowd

A protest in Hayward, Wisconsin, hometown of Sean Duffy,  Secretary of Transportation topped 1,200 participants, the largest protest ever in the small northern Wisconsin city with a population of about 2,500.

Joan Ackerman of Hayward said the protesters are not “un-American,” as some Republican politicians have claimed, but just want to exercise their freedom of speech about things happening in the country that concern them.
Kay, a woman  from Barnes, Wisconsin, who carried a sign that said “fight truth decay,” said she came to the protest in Hayward “because of the current political environment.” She added, “We have become so divisive because of misleading and alternative facts. We need objective news that is non-partisan.”
Natalie of Hayward, who carried a sign that said, “Health care is a right,” said she was at the protest because she doesn’t  like the direction the country is headed. “We need to make it safe for our kids,” she said.
Steve, another Hayward resident who is an Air Force veteran of the Vietnam War, explained that he feels the country is moving away from the core principles of democracy he fought to defend.

Gary Quaderer, Sr., a Vietnam Army vet and spiritual leader of the Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe said this is the first protest he has ever participated in. “I thought it was very important,” he said. “I don’t like where the country is headed. … I just wanted to come out with all these other good people here just to protest what was going on.”
Paul DeMain, editor of the national News from Indian Country newspaper based in Hayward said the gathering was historic, the largest protest Hayward had ever seen.

‘Love of country’ in Janesville
In a downtown park in Janesville, Wisconsin, organizers estimated 1,000 or more people turned out on a warm, sunny Saturday morning. 
In addition to packing the sidewalks at the intersection of Court and Main streets at the corner of Courthouse Park, rally goers milled through the park space. Many sat in the well surrounding the stage, where a handful of speakers made brief remarks.

“There are 93 rallies in Wisconsin,” said U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth). Pocan recalled the words of the Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson a few days ago.
“They’re trying to falsely call this a Hate America rally,” Pocan said. “People who are here today are the ones who love their country. This rally is really showing that love of country over everything else.”
Another speaker was state Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), whose district includes Janesville. 
“We are here to peacefully demonstrate — as the First Amendment gives us the right to do — and to call on our government to do better, to respect our rights, to respect the Constitution, and to do right by the American people,” Spreitzer told the crowd. 
“We’re also here to say that we are a welcoming community, that immigrants make our community stronger, that LGBT people make our community stronger, that people of color make our community stronger, that people with disabilities make our community stronger.,” Spreitzer said. “We are here to stand up for everybody’s right to coexist as part of our community and to get ahead in life.”
Spreitzer acknowledged that for opponents of the president, Saturday’s rally was but one step in a much longer struggle.

“This is not going to be the last time we’re going to have to keep getting together and doing this,” he said. “I know it is going to be a long fight, but we’re going to win that fight. We’re going to take our country back.”
Virtually every speaker made a point of emphasizing the peaceful intentions and means of participants in the protest. 
State Rep. Ann Roe (D-Janesville), offered her mother’s advice for people who may be confronted by supporters of the president. 
“You know what my mom used to say? Kill them with kindness,” Roe said. “Nothing makes them madder.”
In a brief interview, Roe said that as she wandered through the crowd, she encountered a variety of people she has known from various aspects of her life, all taking part.
“I have seen neighbors here. I have seen people I’ve worked with and we’ve never discussed politics,” Roe said.
“It sounds corny, but that’s what gives me hope. We’re back to the old ways — one-on-one conversations. By remaining kind and open as a long-term strategy, That’s what keeps us from devolving into chaos.”

In Kenosha, resistance through building community
Across the state in the city of Kenosha, a crowd of about 2,500 people filled the sidewalks on both sides of Sheridan Road, Downtown Kenosha’s primary north-south thoroughfare, along a four-block stretch.
Signs, the vast majority of them home-made, filled the air. So did the steady honking of passing cars as drivers sounded their horns in support of the demonstrators throughout the three-hour gathering. The sign-waving crowd cheered back in response.
Organizers had envisioned a dance party theme for their afternoon No Kings protest. A Michael Jackson impersonator lip-synched to recordings of Jackson’s biggest hits while effortlessly mimicking Jackson’s trademark dance steps on the concrete walkway of Civic Center Park.

“We couldn’t drag people away from their chanting and cheering,” said Sheila Rawn, one of the principal organizers for Hands Off Kenosha, which put together the local version of the No Kings demonstration.
“We chose to not even try to have speakers because people don’t want to come and hear speeches,” she added. “They want to stand on the street.” 
Rawn and a co-organizer, Jennifer Weinstein, were both dressed in lion costumes. People were invited to “dress as your favorite king or queen that would do better than the wannabe king that we have in the White House,” Rawn explained. “Yeah, so, no kings — but if we did have a king, you know, like a lion king would make a better king. King Kong would make a better king. A monarch butterfly would make a better king.”
It’s part of the group’s philosophy of “tactical frivolity,” Weinstein said. 
“For the record, We were planning costumes before all the Portland stuff,” Rawn said, referring to the national attention that a Portland protester in a frog suit got recently.

Hands Off Kenosha launched in the spring, an outgrowth of the April 5 Hands Off rally. Having gone to Chicago and Milwaukee for large protest events during Trump’s first administration, “it was important to me to be like, ‘No, we’re doing it here,’” Rawn said. “Kenosha is the fourth largest city in Wisconsin. We are big enough to have our own protests.”
Memories of the unrest Kenosha experienced in 2020, when self-styled militia members clashed with protesters and teenager Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, two of them fatally, an act for which he was later acquitted, have lingered, she acknowledged. 
“I have definitely had conversations with lots of people who have said they’re nervous about coming because the community is still grappling with what happened in 2020,” Rawn said. “And so there are some people who are afraid that violence could happen, but we’ve got over a six-month track record of being peaceful and playful and joyful. And we have been really intentional.”
On a table at one end of the park, bags and bags of personal hygiene products overflowed — a collection that the organizers made part of the event. They had a school supply drive at an August protest and have conducted food drives as well. 
“It’s important to us to include mutual aid,” Rawn said. “Building community is its own form of resistance.”

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Thousands of Nevadans took to streets and sidewalks Saturday to peacefully protest President Donald Trump and air myriad grievances against his administration, including but not limited to the ramping up of disappearances by immigration officers, the deployment of troops into U.S. cities, directing the Justice Department to target his political enemies, attempts to strip health care and social service programs, defunding of medical research, and what even federal judges are characterizing as an unprecedented disregard for the rule of law.
An estimated 2,700 “No Kings” protests were scheduled across the country. Nearly a dozen were scheduled around Nevada, including in Reno, Las Vegas, Carson City, Elko, Pahrump, and Mesquite, according to the official “No Kings” website.

Organizers estimated 18,000 people attended a rally in downtown Reno, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. Estimates from Carson City ranged from several hundred to more than a thousand, according to Carson Now.
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department announced an estimated crowd of 2,000 in downtown Las Vegas. That rally was organized by Invisible Las Vegas, which also held the inaugural “No Kings” rally in June attended by an estimated 8,000 people. The midday downtown event was one of four planned in the metro area Saturday.

A gathering outside the New York, New York casino on Las Vegas Strip was held later in the afternoon.
Saturday morning, an estimated 3,000 people lined a stretch of a busy thoroughfare in Henderson, according to organizers there. Motorists blared their horns as demonstrators waved signs and cheered.
“We’re a peaceful crowd,” No Kings volunteer Sheila Humphries told the Nevada Current. “No one here believes in violence.”
The crowd in downtown Las Vegas was similarly peaceful and included people of all ages, ethnicities and abilities. Metro police announced there had been just one arrest for disorderly conduct.
As they have during previous protests in downtown Las Vegas, Metro officers wearing riot helmets lined the middle of numerous streets, which they closed to both vehicular traffic and rallygoers. Indivisible Las Vegas organizer Kathy Blair called it an overreaction from Metro, saying they “just want to flex their muscle.”

Speakers, including all three of Nevada’s Democratic U.S. House members, made remarks in front of the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse. But because of the geographic dispersal of the crowd as a result of Metro confining them to sidewalks on either side of Las Vegas Boulevard, only those in the immediate vicinity could hear them.

“There are actually fewer snipers” compared to the June event, Blair quipped, pointing up to the roof of a nearby federal building where several law enforcement officers sat. “They’re wasting taxpayer dollars up there.”
“I guarantee a lot of people did not come out” because they were scared of law enforcement’s presence, said Blair. “A lot of people didn’t RSVP because they didn’t want to put their name down.”
Myriad reasons motivated participants to attend the rally.
“There’s so much,” responded Mason Loosle of Summerlin when asked why he felt compelled to attend. “I don’t know where to start.”
Loosle, who attended the rally with his new wife of one week, held a sign stating they should be on their honeymoon.
“We feel like we had to come out,” he said. “I think the biggest thing is free speech, the (Jimmy) Kimmel thing, the Pentagon press thing. I can’t believe it.”

Shelly Houston of Henderson, a Democrat who has voted for Republicans, said she isn’t sure the United States will have another election.
“I think (Trump) just wants to stay in power and declare himself a ruler for lifetime,” she said.
Many participants expressed support for the Congressional Democrats, who are currently locked in a federal funding battle that has shuttered the government for nearly three weeks. Democrats are holding fast on demanding renewed credits for Obamacare subsidies. 
“I support what they’re doing,” said Alan Scott of Henderson.

Thousands of Vermonters joined more than 40 planned events on Saturday during the state’s second round of “No Kings” protests, which oppose the Trump administration. Photographers Glenn Russell, Jeb Wallace-Brodeur and Sophia Keshmiri fanned out across the state to capture the action.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)More than 3,000 people gathered in downtown Sioux Falls on Saturday for the latest No Kings protest – making it the city’s largest protest so far this year, according to organizer crowd estimates.
The protest was the 13th in South Dakota for the day, organizer Craig Brown said. Protesters gathered to listen to speakers, display homemade signs and chant “this is what democracy looks like” and “we love America; that’s why we’re here,” and call for President Donald Trump “to go.”
Brown said the turnout is a testament to the movement’s momentum and people’s anger at the Trump administration.
“There’s a sense of commitment in this crowd that we haven’t felt before,” Brown said.

More than 2,600 No Kings rallies with millions in attendance took place across the country on Saturday. The second No Kings day, following the first in June, is in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy and labor organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”
Lexi Pratt, of Sioux Falls, brought her daughter to the No Kings protest in Sioux Falls, saying that she “could not, in good conscience, be a good parent” without standing up when she sees something wrong. She’s concerned about women’s health care and the Trump administration’s “attack on our public education.”
“The Trump administration is violating all the checks and balances that our country was founded on to ensure that we all have the same rights,” Pratt said.
Jody Fleischhacker, of Sioux Falls, wore a frog hat — a symbol of resistance after a Portland protester wearing an inflatable frog costume was sprayed with chemicals through his costume’s air vent by a federal agent earlier this month.
Fleischhacker, who is an Air Force veteran, said she attended both No Kings protests in Sioux Falls this year because she believes Trump is unsuitable for office and should be removed.
“He’s made changes that are hurting his own people,” Fleischhacker said. “He wants to build a big, beautiful ballroom and yet take away our health care and take away food benefits to people who need them.”
The turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations despite a police investigation into a suspicious vehicle that was viewed as a potential explosives threat at the site of the protest the night before. The area was shut down to the public between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. before police determined there were no explosives in the area.
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

A counter protest, dubbed the “Real American Rally,” was held during the same time a block away from the No Kings protest. It drew about 30 people.
John Small, an organizer of the counter protest, said the gathering was intended to be positive and show “love for the country we live in.”
“I understand there are people who don’t like our current president. I understand that they want their voices heard. That’s great. But I don’t know how this is going to help,” Small said, referring to the No Kings protest. “Do they think there is going to be something to come from this?”
Brown said he sees the No Kings movement continuing up until the 2026 elections. That could impact midterm elections and turnout to create “real, sustained pushback against this regime.”
But the real impact of Saturday’s protest is a continued effort to build community, Brown added.
“Maybe I look across the crowd and I see my neighbor who I had no idea they feel like I do. Maybe I go and talk to them and we connect. We decide to go to a city council or county commission meeting we’re concerned about together,” Brown said. “Those are touch points that we’re seeing in real time. This is working.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/591A2067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

See Colorado Newsline’s live coverage of No Kings protests here.


An overflow crowd spilled into Civic Center Park, and multiple streets surrounding the Capitol grounds were shut down as the event began just after noon. Near the state Capitol steps, attendees heard from a lineup of speakers including former state Rep. Joe Salazar, who told the crowd in a fiery speech that Trump’s agenda “threatens to tear the fabric of this country apart.”
“There is no king in America, and we will not be silenced by authoritarians,” Salazar said to cheers. “We will not be painted as domestic terrorists. We are just Coloradans, just Americans, who are calling a spade a spade and a dictator a dictator — because that is our constitutional right to do so.”
Tiffany Weber, founder of the activist group Solidarity Warriors and one of the Denver protest’s organizers, blasted U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s characterization of the nationwide No Kings event this week as a “Hate America” rally.
“He has the gall to say we hate America. We love America,” Weber told the crowd. “We love the loud, beautiful, chaotic streets of Denver. We love the variety of ways that people show up to protests, and we hate the fact that not everyone can safely exercise their American right to free speech.”

Organizers of the Denver protest estimate that more than 25,000 demonstrators were in attendance, Salazar told Newsline. An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Colorado Springs. The nationwide No Kings Coalition, partners of which include liberal and progressive groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the ACLU, estimated 7 million people turned out Saturday to demonstrate against what it called Trump’s “authoritarian actions and power grabs.”
The latest round of protests come as Trump has ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the cities of Chicago and Portland, which he has falsely described as “war ravaged” in spite of recent nonviolent anti-ICE protests that have prominently featured inflatable animal costumes and naked bicycle rides.










I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution.


– Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita, at the No Kings demonstration in Grand Junction


Throughout the day, the atmosphere at Saturday’s demonstration in Denver was similarly peaceful and festive, featuring countless satirical anti-Trump protest signs — “The Only Thing Colorado Likes More Than Hiking on a Saturday Is Our Democratic Rights,” read one — and dozens of protesters clad in inflatable costumes of the kind recently popularized by protesters in Portland.
Gerry Lauer, a demonstrator dressed in an inflatable chicken costume, said he had been inspired by footage of the Portland protests and ordered the costume online before Saturday’s event.
“Portland did a great job of finding a way to eliminate the hostility, (and) kind of create that safe place to be,” Lauer said. “It’s a real serious time, but we don’t need to be creating violence and hostility. We need to figure out how to get it around that.”

‘This insanity has to stop’
Coloradans also turned out for a No Kings protest in Grand Junction, where an organizer with Indivisible said thousands had turned out in the Western Slope city to protest the Trump administration.
One of those participants was Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita.
“I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution,” he said.

Kerri Osterguard traveled from the town of Mesa to attend the No Kings rally in Grand Junction.
“This insanity has to stop. It’s out of control,” she said.
Rick Griffith, Bev Griffith, Bill Shelton and Connie Ellenberger displayed protest signs designed by Shelton. Bev Griffith said the Grand Junction event was their first No Kings rally and that they participated because President Donald Trump is “running our country into the ground” and “he should be behind bars.”

Tensions over immigration enforcement
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Tensions have risen in cities like Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles as ICE enforcement operations have become more expansive and aggressive, drawing protests that Trump administration officials have in turn harshly criticized and sought to meet with further crackdowns by federal law enforcement, as well as troop deployments. Trump told an audience of top U.S. military leaders last month that American cities should be used as “training grounds for our military,” and he has repeatedly spoken of invoking the Insurrection Act to broaden his authority to deploy the military against U.S. citizens.

Trump’s mass deportation program has been bolstered by $45 billion in new ICE funding in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved in July. At least 170 people with U.S. citizenship have been swept up in the agency’s expanded enforcement operations so far this year, ProPublica reported Thursday.
“We can’t treat people like this. We can’t treat anybody like this, let alone immigrants who are minding their own business and doing their work,” said Emily Magner, an Aurora resident who attended Saturday’s protest at the Capitol. “(They say) ‘We’re only after the bad ones.’ Well, then why are you going to meatpacking plants (and) places where you think immigrants would work?”

After hearing from rally speakers, thousands of demonstrators marched away from the Capitol down 15th Street into Denver’s Central Business District. Before the march, Julian Camera of the American Civil Liberties Union spoke to the crowd about their constitutional rights, including the right to free speech and the right to remain silent if detained by law enforcement.
“The reason I share these rights with you today is because it’s rookie hour at the federal government, and if you’re detained by law enforcement, they might try to intimidate you and lie to you about your rights,” Camera said. “We’re not going to let them get away with trying to rewrite the Constitution just because Trump is telling them to.”
Following the march, most demonstrators left the Capitol area by 4 p.m. A much smaller group of protesters later marched to 20th and Chestnut streets, where Denver Police Department officers “dispersed the group to deny access to the highway” and made multiple arrests, according to a DPD social media post.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Thousands of people gathered at 10 events across Louisiana as part of Saturday’s national No Kings movement to protest President Donald Trump. Beyond their criticisms of the administration, organizers and participants shared messages of unity and countered Republicans who labeled their events as “hate rallies.” 
Helping set that lighter tone were several rally participants in costumes. Some were getting a jump start on Halloween while others said they took their inspiration from protestors in Portland, Oregon, who’ve demonstrated while in disguise against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in their city. 
In New Orleans, where little excuse is needed for costuming, thousands showed up for a concert and rally along the Lafitte Parkway. The city hosted a parade through the Marigny neighborhood during the first No Kings day in June.  
Among the participants was Elaine Ravich, 96, who held a sign identifying her as part of the Greatest Generation and an opponent of tyranny.
“We fought in the 1940s, and there are not too many of my generation alive,” Ravich said. “I am representing every single one of them that was here, and we were fighting again for our children, grandchildren and generations to come, and we will not allow this to happen.”

Hundreds took part in the No Kings event at Zemurray Park in Hammond, which featured equal parts protest, parody and picnic. 
Participant Katie Greer of Slidell was part of the crowd, wearing a cap to honor her Navy veteran husband, Paul, who died in August. He would have been alongside her at the protest had he not succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease, she said.
Greer noticed that a sizable portion of the crowd were, like her, senior citizens. She recounted her involvement in comparable protests against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
“We did this once. We’re back to do it again,” Greer said.
On the other end of the age spectrum were the two school-aged children of Daisy and Michael Daigle, also from Slidell. The couple said it was important for them to take part in Saturday’s event as a family to show their son and daughter they don’t agree with the direction of the nation under Trump’s leadership.

Speakers at the Hammond event urged those in attendance to stay active and connected, even though they are greatly outnumbered by Republicans in the Northshore region. The parishes in the area are split between the congressional districts of U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, R-Start.      
Daisy Daigle said the rally provided some encouragement to those who might feel their voices aren’t heard.   
“To be able to come here to see this and have a community and see it is really good, right? Because not everybody can make it to meetings,” she said. “We’re all struggling day to day just to get by. So to have this one day to be able to come out is really important. 
More than 150 people assembled at the edge of Lock Park in downtown Lake Charles for its No Kings event, while a small group of counter-protestors stood across a quiet side street.
Matthew Desormeaux was among the rally participants, holding a sign that read: “Abolish ICE is now the moderate position.” He said he considers immigration an important issue on both a national and state level. 
“This is home. I was born and raised here,” Desormeaux said. “Lake Charles is a conservative area, but we’ve got to let [undocumented] people know that they’re not alone.”

Louisiana has nine ICE detention and staging facilities and is second only to Texas, with 23 ICE detention centers, with nearly 7,500 people in custody according to immigrant rights advocacy groups. Gov. Jeff Landry declared an emergency to expedite the refurbishment of a maximum security section of Louisiana State Penitentiary so it could also house ICE detainees.
“Immigrants are members of our community and should have the right to live and work where they want because they contribute,” Desormeaux added.
Sam McNabb stood with seven other men across the street from the No Kings assembly, flanked by two flags – one U.S. flag in black and another that read “MAGA Trump 45 47.”
“Trump’s not a king. If he were, they’d be in jail, all these cuckoos,” McNabb said, gesturing toward the No Kings rally across the street. 
McNabb said the other men with him were on their lunch break, and that the No Kings rally participants must not have jobs. 
One of the counter-protesters crossed the street to wave a flag in front of the crowd that read “Don’t tread on Trump.” A small rope barricade separated him from No Kings protestors. On his second pass down the block, local No Kings organizer Carolyn Woosley escorted the man..
“He just took my arm and said let’s go,” Woosley told the Illuminator.

Other No Kings events in Louisiana took place in Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Monroe, Ruston, Alexandria and Lafayette. 
In addition, Bradley Hesson, a 15-year-old Leesville High School student, organized what he described as a peaceful protest outside City Hall against Trump, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson “and more of our leaders who don’t want to take accountability,” he said.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-19 00:00:44+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"‘No Kings’ Boston Rally Draws Thousands of Protesters, Few Clashes",Jane Petersen,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/no-kings-boston-rally-draws-thousands-of-protesters-few-clashes/,"“The demonstrations were organized to push back against the Trump administration as it uses federal power to indict critics, deploy troops to Democratic-run cities, and strip funding from universities with policies aimed at fostering diversity.”","On Saturday, a crowd of about 100,000 demonstrators flocked to Boston Common to protest the Trump administration. Organizers of the “No Kings” rally called it a “movement for our collective liberation.” 
Republicans have referred to the series of rallies as “Hate America Day,” although presence from opposition leaders at the event itself was minimal. 
“We are living almost in a police state now where people are being disappeared, taken away with men and women in military gear wearing masks,” said Lisa Mahoney of Beverley, Mass. “I was a human rights activist with Amnesty International for 15 years. I worked for people in many other countries that were in this sort of situation. I never thought I’d see it happen here.” 
The “No Kings” rally in Boston was one of dozens taking place across the state and one of more than 2,000 taking place across the country. The demonstrations were organized by a consortium including several unions, faith leaders, activists, and the American Civil Liberties Union to push back against the Trump administration as it uses federal power to indict critics, deploy troops to Democratic-run cities, and strip funding from universities with policies aimed at fostering diversity. 
Several Massachusetts politicians, including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, made appearances. Protestors brought thousands of signs, deriding the president and his cabinet for policies related to their use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the cutting of scientific research at the federal level, and attacks on freedom of speech. 
Unlike similar protests that have occurred across the country in recent months, there was minimal conflict during the event. There was no major effort to organize counter-protestors, and Boston Police officers remained largely disengaged with the crowd, mostly sticking to their posts near the entrances to the Common. According to the department, no arrests were made in association with the event. 
The mass deportations by ICE and the deployment of the national guard into US cities under the second Trump administration was a major theme of many of the speeches at the event.  
“It’s no surprise that the White House wants to attack us. To seize more power, they need people to believe that this country and our cities are in a state of disaster,” said Wu. “Day after day, this president and his corrupt cabinet mistake cruelty for greatness, and payoffs for power.” 
She also invoked Boston’s historical role in overthrowing autocrats.  
“For the last 250 years and counting in Boston, every day is ‘No Kings day,’” she added 
Wu powered through her speech despite some chants from protestors, calling her a “liar” and “for hire.” Rahsaan Hall, president of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts and emcee for the day’s main stage events, addressed the jeers following her remarks. 
“This is what democracy looks like. It’s not nice and neat, it’s not clean and squeaky. It’s messy. It’s disruptive. It’s uncomfortable,” Hall said. “If we can’t tolerate disruption within the midst of our own disruptive protest, we’re doing it wrong.” 
The response from Republicans across the state was somewhat muted. Mike Kennealy, who is running in the GOP primary for next year’s governor’s race, criticized Gov. Maura Healey’s job performance thus far. “As citizens around Massachusetts are protesting on ‘No Kings Day’, consider this,” he posted to X, “There’s a politician who stood by while migrant children were raped and abused in government-run facilities. A politician who stood by while unemployment rose by 23%, and did nothing.” 
In an interview set to air on Fox News on Sunday, Trump downplayed the rallies. “They’re referring to me as a king,” Trump said. “I’m not a king.” 
Many protestors disagreed, likening the President to an autocrat. 
“I came out here because of the way the Trump administration is oppressing our free speech,” said Boston resident Mary Buonanno. “I felt it was important that they knew, and that we stood strong against having a dictator in the White House.”  
Protestors also called for unity against what they viewed as a growing threat. 
“I’m independent, neither Republican or Democrat,” said Boston resident Paul Finnegan. He said he attended the rally because the lies told by Trump had “just gone too far.” 
“The joke was that he could go to Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and still get elected, but now he’s got a whole chorus of people who are just tearing up the Constitution. That’s enough.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-18-at-7.53.35-PM.png?fit=1024%2C770&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

The event came four months after an innocent bystander, Afa Ah Loo, was shot and killed in Salt Lake City at a No Kings protest planned by a different group.
This time, organizers worried that memories of the tragedy and violence in June were still too fresh and many would still feel too afraid to attend, said Jamie Carter, a volunteer with Salt Lake Indivisible who planned Saturday’s rally.
But afterward, Carter said she hoped the event – fairly relaxed and punctuated by boisterous moments – restored a sense of safety and solidarity for anyone who felt uneasy. 
“It felt like our goals were met, both helping to heal the community, and providing a place for people to express their anger, but to leave with joy,” Carter said. 
Haylee Bowcut, 25, said she had some anxiety about the protest because of the June shooting, but decided Saturday morning to attend and bring a sign saying, “Hate never made a country great.” 
“It just felt like the right thing, to go today,” said Bowcut, of Pleasant View.
Many outside the Capitol chanted, “We are the patriots!,” wore costumes and came with friends or family, listening intently to speakers, a comedian and musical performances during the roughly two-hour event. 
“We’re going to hold every government official accountable, from the highest levels of power, including every ICE agent,” Carter said from a podium on the Capitol steps, to thunderous applause. 
She and other speakers said they want to see compassion inform new immigration laws, along with an end to the nation’s health care “crisis” and stricter gun laws to help protect children. 
Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP’s Salt Lake branch, condemned Trump’s appointment of “anti-civil rights extremists” in roles enforcing the nation’s civil rights laws.






























Many seemed to take inspiration from protesters in Portland, dressing in towering inflatable costumes depicting dinosaurs, axolotls, chickens, and a bumble bee, in a nod to Utah’s moniker, the Beehive State. 
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson last week described No Kings as “pro-Hamas,” and a “Hate American rally.” 
Speaking through a small window in her inflatable unicorn costume, Barbara Scott of Bluffdale rejected that. 
“I’m not paid to be here, I’m not AI, and I’m not a terrorist,” Scott said, showing off signs she made featuring the same messages. 
Scott also reflected on the violence that’s happened at demonstrations and political events like June’s protest and Charlie Kirk’s killing at the campus of Utah Valley University. 
As for her concern about her own safety while protesting, she said, “I have more concern about what’s going to happen to our country if we don’t get it back. At least if we die here, we die trying.” 
Organizers originally planned to follow the Capitol rally with a march to the Salt Lake City and County building, but canceled the march Tuesday when online RSVPs flooded in faster than they’d expected. They worried the crowd size for a march was too big for the few dozen unarmed safety volunteers they trained, Carter said. 
On Saturday, Utah’s Department of Public Safety estimated attendance at 3,500, while Carter said she believed it was much higher, near 10,000. 
Former state Sen. Steve Urquhart, who served in the Utah Legislature as a Republican from 2001-2016, was also in the crowd. He recalled believing years ago that any forces seeking to undercut democracy would come from the political left, but said he now feels differently. 
“Guess I was wrong about that one,” Urquhart said. He added that concerns about safety were on his mind before the rally. 
“Should we go, should we mask up? What should we do?” Urquhart recalled thinking. “When the administration is actively saying it’s targeting its opponents, that’s frightening.” 
Few counterprotesters came to the event. When a group of about three men, one wearing a ‘Trump 2024’ hat arrived at the Capitol lawn and started speaking through a megaphone, dozens in the No Kings group surrounded them, chanting, “No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderThousands of people gathered Saturday in Atlanta as part of the No Kings rallies taking place nationwide, where speakers sounded the alarm against the potential for authoritarian rule under the Trump administration.
Speakers, which included prominent Georgia political figures and leaders of civil rights and advocacy organizations, described the current climate as a move away from democracy. It was a noticeable shift in tone from the No Kings events in June, when organizers warned of some of the administration’s undemocratic behaviors, such as hosting a military parade coinciding with President Donald Trump’s birthday. 
Former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams framed the political battle as a fight over the nation’s direction.
“It used to be that we were all headed to the same destination. We just had different routes,” Abrams said to the crowd. “We may have a different way to get there, but the route we were going to take was democracy … but on the other side, they decided that the route they wanted to take was not democracy, but authoritarianism.”

Organizers say more than 10,000 people turned out Saturday at the Atlanta Civic Center, one of over 40 events held across Georgia, before marching to the state Capitol, but the actual number could be closer to 12,000, said Laura Judge with Indivisible North Metro, which is one of the event’s organizers. Martha Shockey, a convener of the Indivisible Georgia Coalition, said more than 5,000 people registered ahead of the protest. 
Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, told the crowd that the Trump administration has created a two-tiered system of justice where some are “above the law” and others are below.
“We love America too much to give it over to a wannabe king,” Young said. “The Trump regime puts billionaires above the law … at the same time, the Trump regime acts like some of us are below the law.”
In an interview Friday ahead of the rally, Young cited several examples of the current administration’s alleged abuses. She pointed to the administration’s actions on immigrant rights, including the denial of due process for people suspected of living in the country unlawfully and the attempt to abolish the 14th Amendment’s citizenship provision by executive order — a move the ACLU is challenging. She also raised concerns over the deployment of military personnel in American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as the “dismantling” of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and what she called the undermining of “facts and science.”

Abby Tighe, a founding member of Fired but Fighting, a coalition of terminated CDC employees and public health allies, described the latest mass terminations at the agency as “another deliberate attempt to traumatize federal workers and attack the American public.” The CDC workforce has shrunk by about 3,000 this year, with the latest round of layoffs in October affecting about 600 workers.
“Donald Trump continued to spread lies about vaccines, medications, and research. Their lies about vaccines have led to mistrust and violence. Their dehumanization and vitriol is directly responsible for the August attack on CDC that claimed the life of DeKalb County’s officer (David) Rose, while my friends and own child cowered in fear,” Tighe said.
Sen. Raphael Warnock speaks at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Georgia U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock urged the audience to stand up for democracy and fight for their rights. Warnock pointed to the importance of unity and cooperation, regardless of political affiliation, and called for the end of the government shutdown and the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies.
“We don’t have to do one or the other. We can do both at the same time,” he said.
He also warned against the dangers of fascism and the need to fight for the rights of all people, including Palestinians, Israelis, Ukrainian children and American citizens.
“You cannot outsource democracy to anybody. You cannot outsource citizenship. It is all of us. That’s why they’re trying to divide us, because when all of us stand together and raise our voices, we win,” he said.
James Salter said he showed up at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025 to fight fascism because he worries that ignoring the Constitution will lead to a dictatorship run by the rich. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
James Salter said he participated in the rally because he’s “trying to rebuff fascism while we still care,” saying he’s concerned about law and order under Trump.
“If the Constitution is no longer understood and taken seriously, then we slip into a fascist dictatorship that is ruled by the ultra rich. And we lose,” he said.
James Threatt, who also attended the rally in Atlanta, said that the name of the No Kings march spoke for itself.
“This man is setting himself up as the king, and he’s not,” he said. “This is America.”

Threatt also said he was concerned about how the Trump administration was treating immigrants, saying the mass arrests were violating people’s civil rights, which he compared to the struggle for Black civil rights.
“They’re taking civil rights away from people, period,” he said. “Not only Black people but everybody else.”
Lloyd Norman said he hoped to be a “small voice” to help hold power to account.
“Hitler had something called the Big Lie theory, that if I say it long enough and loud enough, people will say it for me,” Norman said. “That’s why I’m here, because we have to say ‘you’re lying.'”
Speakers also called for ongoing, non-violent action and engagement in local elections. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson of Lithonia urged the crowd to embody Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision of the “beloved community,” which King used to describe a society that is free from discrimination and poverty and is based on peace, justice and equality.
“We, the people, are the ones to create the beloved community, and we do it through love, passion, non-violence,” Johnson said before the crowd marched to the Capitol.

Amanda Solberg-Bowen, who lives near Watkinsville, showed up Saturday in a newly acquired inflatable frog costume. She was one of many people who showed up at a No Kings rally Saturday dressed up in inflatable costumes as a nod to the so-called “Portland Freedom Frog.” Earlier this month, a federal agent in Portland shot pepper spray inside of a protester’s inflatable frog costume while demonstrating outside of an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.
“Somebody said a minute ago that it’s a great way to be present but also be obviously nonviolent – a disarming sort of presence,” Solberg-Bowen said of her costume, adding that being there Saturday felt like “the least that we can do.”
Taffy Jo Mayers said her sense of patriotism is what brought her to the rally. She also expressed concerns about how the government is treating immigrants.
“I’ve been an immigrant,” she said. “I’ve lived and worked in foreign countries, and the way that America is treating the people that are coming here is abhorrent. It’s inhumane.”
This was Julie Runk’s second No Kings rally. As she waited for marchers to reach the state Capitol, the Atlanta resident waved to passing cars and held a sign that said “Stop pretending your racism is patriotism. Oh, and release the Epstein files.”

“People ask me, ‘Why are you doing it? It’s not going to change anything,'” Runk said. “I’m just unhappy with what’s happening and I want to do whatever I can. This is a small bit.”
Runk said she relishes the sense of community she finds at the No Kings events, but she also said she believes that speaking out helps to empower others to do the same.
“I also know that this administration doesn’t like to look bad and this makes them look bad,” Runk said of the No Kings rallies. “And when ICE is fighting with people in inflatable frog suits, it makes them look like idiots, and they don’t like to be embarrassed. So, this to me is a good way to get under their skin if nothing else,” she said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)In Queen Anne’s County, where 62% of voters went for President Donald Trump in last year’s election, some of the people who showed up for the No Kings rally said they were pleasantly surprised by Saturday’s turnout.
Several hundred people turned up, many waving hand-drawn signs by the roadside in Centreville’s small historic downtown, while others gathered in the courtyard, where a musician performed at a piano, and organizers opened the mic for testimonials.
“The honks and waves way outnumber the middle fingers,” said Tom Gallagher, 74, of the public response to No Kings in Centreville. The Anne Arundel County resident crossed the Bay Bridge to attend the rally here.
Back across the Bay in Baltimore — where 12.8% of voters backed Trump in 2024 — the challenge was not getting people to turn out, but managing No Kings on the same day as the 25th annual Baltimore Running Festival, when an estimated 10,000 runners were expected to take over downtown to compete in everytingn from a 5K to a full marathon.
Most coped by combining the two events, with runners wearing No Kings gear and No Kings attendees lining the race route with signs playing off the combination of the two events, like the one that said, “You’re running better than the government.”
Jackie Bustos took advantage of the scheduling of the events to accomplish personal goal of completing a half marathon while also protesting Trump policies on immigration and other issues.
“I felt supported,” said Bustos, who ran with a No Kings sign on her back. “Throughout the city, there were tons of signs that were supporting the cause. So I was running, but there were also people saying ‘no fascism, no kings.’”

The Baltimore and Centreville rallies were just two of more than 60 events scheduled in Maryland Saturday, from Ocean City to LaVale and from Northeast to Lexington Park and scores of points in between.
They were in big cities like Baltimore and small towns like Centreville. They were in deep blue counties like Montgomery, which had more than a dozen events scheduled, to deep red counties like Carroll, where one event was scheduled for the County Government Building in Westminster for those willing to brave it.
Nationwide, more than 2,700 events were planned, in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the District of Columbia, where as many as 100,000 were expected to turn out. Events were being held overseas as well, in Australia and across Europe – although events in the United Kingdom were tactfully labeled “No Tyrants” events.
Some estimates said turnout for the weekend’s events could be in the millions.
The latest rallies are a followup to No Kings events in June that were held to counter President Donald Trump’s massive military parade in Washington to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Army – and, some say not coincidentally, Trump’s 79th birthday.
There were about 2,000 events in June. Organizers said they scheduled this weekend’s events because Trump “has doubled down” since the first rallies, ramping up immigration raids and deploying troops to Democratic cities and urging the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies.
A main theme of the events, besides no kings, is peaceful protest. Rallygoers are told to leave weapons at home and are trained in de-escalation techniques. And in Maryland, at least, it seemed to be working, only minimal conflicts reported.
‘What was your tipping point?’
Standing in the courtyard in front of the Queen Anne’s County historic courthouse in Centreville, a bulletin board asked locals: “What was your tipping point?”
No more context was needed.
“The day he was elected — the first time,” read one sticky note. “Musk + DOGE,” read another. “The Apprentice,” one attendee wrote.

“We wanted to know, what was that moment that you felt like you needed to come?” said Elaine McNeil, chair of the Queen Anne’s Democratic Central Committee, which organized Saturday’s event. “Because that’s the feedback that we need to get other people to that tipping point to start standing up.”
Gallagher, the Anne Arundel County resident who traveled to Centreville for the rally, said he has been disturbed by the administration’s decision to attack ships off the coast of Venezuela, killing several people.
“Even if he’s correct that they’re drug dealers, that’s still a legal matter, not a military matter,” said Gallagher, a retired Navy veteran. “You’re being judge, jury and executioner for people out on boats in the water. It’s beyond the pale.”
No Kings protests dotted Maryland’s rural and conservative Eastern Shore, running up U.S. Route 50 from Ocean City and Salisbury to Cambridge and Easton, where protesters lined the busy highway beside a Wawa convenience store, attracting a smattering of honks as cars drove past. A single counter-protester stood in the grass behind them, yelling “We love President Trump.” But he was handily outnumbered, as the assembled group chanted: ““Love, not hate, makes America great.”
Beverly Fox, 75, an Easton resident who is disabled, uses a motorized wheelchair to get around. On Saturday, the back of her wheelchairt sported an image of Trump wearing a crown with the message “No Kings.”
“That man has got to go,” said Fox, who worries about Trump’s attacks on health insurance for vulnerable Americans. “Every day I think I can’t get shocked any more.”
In Easton’s Talbot County, Trump’s victory was far narrower than elsewhere on the Eastern Shore, winning 11,125 votes to 11,119 for Vice President Kamala Harris.
For many attendees on Saturday, it felt difficult to choose just one reason they were drawn to decorate handmade signs and wave them by the roadside.

“I don’t even know where to start,” said Ashley Cromwell, a Queenstown resident who came to Centreville with a “We the People” sign.
“Since Trump first — in 2015 — came on the scene this way, I’ve been against what he stands for, and the hatred and the anger and the division and the way that he wants to take power for himself,” Cromwell said.
Even if it was sometimes hard to articulate, attendees on Saturday were united by a passion to speak up against Trump.
Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident, said she began attending anti-Trump protests for the first time in March.
“I’m out here for the people that can’t be out here,” said Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident. “Because there are people that are either disabled or they’re afraid, or they’ve been fighting forever.”
But, like many at the rallies, she was keeping it light. Leonard wore an inflatable otter costume Saturday and carried a sign that said, “You otter join us!” adding that she was gunning for a “positive, unifying” message.
‘Run like Trump’s behind you’
Positive energy was very much the mood in Baltimore, where the marathon route was lined with people who alternated between those holding anti-Trump protest signs or posterboards offering encouragement from enthusiastic friends and families. Or both.
“That’s one of the things I love about Baltimore,” Bustos said. “It’s really nice to be in Baltimore and see that there’s this energy for the runners and also supporting a very big political cause.”
Brenden Caffey, 30, said that he and his wife had been in other running festivals before, but having a message this time brought a new energy to the challenge. He painted his shirt Friday night with “NO KINGS” in preparation for the run.

“It was nice … I think it was kind of cool that it was able to be combined a little bit,” Caffey said.
Protesters on the sides of the tracks shouted words of encouragement while their signs disparaged the Trump administration.  People like Lior Levy, 28, who stood on the sidelines with a sign declaring “Baltimore says ‘No Kings.’” She said that merging the rally with the marathon provided “a lot of visibility” for the political demonstration.
“Us being here for the runners, it drives them. And them having the signs rallies us — and it’s a good back and forth,” Levy said.
Chris Ryder, 65, a former U.S. Agency for International Development employee who retired during the first Trump administration, said  the recent federal layoffs are just one of the many reasons to come out to the marathon and protest along the track.
“We came out because we think we all need to raise our voices against so much of what’s going on with this administration,” he said.
Laurie Rome, 63, said that while the Baltimore No Kings rally was a little more spread out than other protests, it was still important to show up, “no matter the format.”
“It’s kind of nice to have it sort of pervasive along the route. Not just people clustered in one place,” she said. “There are people everywhere who think that the current level of unkindness, instability and hatred is not okay.”
Protesters lining the roads — and the marathon routes — seemed to be popular venues. In Prince George’s County, sporadic clumps of protesters lined U.S. Route 1 from the Washington, D.C., line to the University of Maryland, College Park, and beyond.
On the Eastern Shore, Denise Perdue of Graysonville stood on the side of the road and talked about her “tipping point” while waving a sign. For Perdue, it was Nov. 5, 2024, when Trump was elected a second time.

“I didn’t think that there was so much hate in the United States as there is, and so much bigotry,” she said, adding that she felt that the electorate scorned Harris, the Democratic nominee, because she is a woman of color.
As Perdue held a sign inviting passersby to “Honk for Humanity,” one driver in a pickup truck flew past: “Sore losers!” he yelled.
Perdue was quick to respond: “Jesus loves you!” she shouted back. It was the same response she’d used all day for the occasional heckler passing through.
“Because, what are you going to say to that?” she joked.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Thousands of Kentuckians turned out under the autumn sun to protest President Donald Trump’s administration, some pointedly refuting Republican claims disparaging their motives.
In Lexington, Gracia O’Brien, 71, said “when folks in Congress said this was going to be a ‘hate America’ rally, I said ‘no, I love America.’ I want my grandchildren to know I stood up. I’m old, and I’ve never been scared for our democracy. I am now.” 
Marsha Bezold of Midway hoisted a sign showing a U.S. flag and the words “Pro-America. Anti-Trump.” She cited multiple reasons for protesting, from “the dismantling of our Constitution” to coming cuts in health care that she said will hurt her family.  She said she thinks Trump’s goal is to intimidate Americans into keeping silent about his unprecedented power grabs. This is not the country I grew up in. I think Ronald Reagan would be rolling over in his grave to see this.”
In Louisville, former Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth greeted a large crowd gathered on the Belvedere:  “Hello all my fellow terrorists. Apparently that’s who the Republicans and the administration think we are: terrorists, antifa, violent criminals.” 
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer recently said Democrats would “rather cater to the pro-terrorist wing of their party than to reopen the government.” House Speaker Mike Johnson described “No Kings” as a “hate America” rally
Yarmuth added that he thought the gathered crowd should show their “antifa membership cards” to Trump.
Protesters also rallied in smaller Kentucky towns. In Pikeville, a small crowd gathered, holding signs that said, among other things, “Hillbillies against Facism,” Mountain Top News reported. The Owensboro Times reported more than 500 people attended a downtown rally in the Daviess County seat. “The scene remained peaceful throughout the event.”

In Morehead, organizers reported “over 300 people and two dinosaurs” gathered for the “No Kings” rally. Speakers in the Rowan County seat included two Democrats running for U.S. Congress: attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who is hoping to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Rep. Hal Rogers, and Logan Forsythe, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell.

In Lexington, police blocked streets as thousands of protesters marched through downtown; observers said it was one of the largest demonstrations they had ever seen in Kentucky’s second-largest city.



































Capitol rally in Frankfort
While the state Capitol is closed amid a renovation project, protesters were able to peacefully gather on its steps. Similar demonstrations have been held at the site since Trump took office earlier this year for the second time. 
Dennis Van Horn, a Frankfort resident and veteran, listened to speakers on the Capitol lawn while holding a sign that said a chant the crowd used throughout the day: “No thrones, no crowns, no kings” — a chant that was heard throughout the day. He said Saturday’s crowd was twice the size of the first“No Kings” rally in June.
Van Horn said he wanted to attend Saturday’s protest “because (of) the anxiety from watching our president trash the Constitution, rule of law and take retribution on his enemies.” 
“And that’s not the way it’s supposed to be,” he added.

Woodford County resident Alyssa Cumming and her dog, Cody, came to the Capitol to stand for her friends and family who are immigrants but are afraid to make their voices heard at this time. Cumming and Cody attended protests earlier this year. 
She raised concerns about the direction of the country, adding that “we’re not moving any closer to greatness right now.” 
“I just feel like everybody can do something,” Cumming said. “I don’t have any political power other than my feet.”
Some politicians also joined the crowd. Speaking through a microphone, Democratic state Rep. Erika Hancock, of Frankfort, addressed the rally and was supportive of the group’s message. 
“This No Kings rally is about reminding everyone in power that they serve the people, not the other way around,” she says to cheers.
John “Drew” Williams, a Democratic candidate challenging Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer in Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District, said the Frankfort rally was his second of the day after another event in Danville. Williams, who is from far West Kentucky, said it was important for him to be in Frankfort because of the town’s importance to the state and because Franklin County was added to the 1st Congressional District during redistricting. In Comer’s district, a thin line of counties along Kentucky’s southern border connects the state’s far western tip and the Mississippi River with Franklin and Boyle counties in Central Kentucky.
“This is what democracy looks like,” Williams said. “This is what the conversation wants to be, not just right now when we feel like there is a set of government overreach, but every year and every day.”

In Louisville, thousands gathered at the Belvedere, a grassy event space next to the Muhammed Ali Center in downtown Louisville, hearing from a range of elected officials and advocates after marching and chanting through the city streets. 
Rebecca Elliott of Louisville watched marchers holding signs, including one that read: “Immigrant Rights Are Citizen’s Rights” — one of many signs that referenced the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. 
“The right of due process applies to all of us. So, if we allow people to start taking that right away from our immigrant neighbors, then we’re also going to end up not having it in the long run, too,” Elliott said. “I think we have to defend the more vulnerable people so that we can maintain our own rights.” 
Other signs by protesters in Louisville referenced Trump’s executive orders, including one that designated antifa, a left-wing anti-facist political movement, as a domestic terrorist organization. Jamie and Brian Reichenbach came to the Louisville protest from Spencer County, holding a sign with the word antifa and an arrow pointing at themselves. 
Jamie Reichenbach said given that the country ought fascism in the past, she wanted to show that “we’re antifa.” 
“We stand for anti-fascism, which is what America was supposed to be,” Reichenbach said.
Brad Ector of Louisville, who sported an inflatable dragon costume that was buffeted by the wind as he marched, said he didn’t “want Portland to have all the fun.” 
“Just all the people in Portland that are there, pointing out the fact that they are not the terrorists that Trump wants us to believe,” Ector said. 
“As far as the dragon goes, someone needs to melt ice,” Ector said, apparently referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. joined in the show of might to advocate for civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests were expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration since he took office this year for a second term.
At Michigan’s Capitol building in Lansing, the show of resistance was palpable.
For over an hour before the official start to the event, people gathered on the Capitol lawn. Several demonstrators greeted their friends and family with hugs while taking pictures with rally signs. Over that hour, the size of the protest grew from a small crowd to a group that nearly reached the edges of the front lawn.

Like other protests against the administration documented earlier this month, many wore costumes, which ranged from various inflatable animal suits to robes from The Handmaid’s Tale. Security for the protest was pronounced, with several Michigan Department of State Police troopers in tactical gear and road patrol uniforms on the lookout for threats.
As the crowd grew, cars and trucks driving by honked in support throughout the event. Some waved flags, held up signs or played loud music, and most were met with cheers and applause from demonstrators along North Capitol Avenue.
Just before a series of speakers began, various songs of resistance played over the loud speakers, including “Holiday” by Green Day, which was met with cheers from the crowd. 
Several signs identified demonstrators as veterans, teachers and union members. Some protestors spoke of their concerns about Trump’s narratives on free speech, including his claim that he has ended free speech over flag burning, and some expressed worries about detentions and deportations by ICE. 
Others, especially older protestors, spoke about their fears for the future for younger generations – wanting their children and grandchildren to live in a country where they were free to protest. 
“We must commit ourselves, each and every one of you, all the way back to the streets to never, ever [give up],” Lansing-based community activist Lorenzo Lopez said in one of several addresses at the event. “We have to continue to resist, and we must never, ever let this country become a dictatorship.”
Speaking directly to the administration’s use of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to terrorize the immigrant community and enact its sweeping mass deportation policies, Lopez said it amounted to human trafficking.
“My fellow Americans, the mass deportations are not deportations at all,” he said. “When people are [detained] without due process, that’s called kidnapping. When they are sent to another country against their will, that’s human trafficking.”

Throughout the speeches, chants of “Release the files” and “Lock him up” permeated the crowd, especially in reference to Trump’s felony convictions in early 2024.
The rally started at 3 p.m. and was scheduled to run until 6 p.m. However, impending poor weather and gloomy skies ended the event early. As one organizer put it in a final speech, those who have been paying attention to the excesses of the Trump administration and its authoritarian tendencies have heard all the complaints before.
Now, however, was a time for action. As the crowd moved away from the Capitol lawn, thousands marched east down Michigan Avenue. They continued to chant, saying: “Donald Trump has got to go.” 
Cars and trucks driving through downtown Lansing continued to honk in support of the demonstrators who took to marching, a line of people that stretched across the bridge into the city’s Stadium District and beyond.
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) attended the rally in their district. They said it was a clear sign of solidarity and community building, and was bigger than the first No Kings rally held in June. With the Trump administration’s actions veering further into autocratic territory, the representative was also reflective on the moment, and the fight to retain the core tenets of the nation’s democratic values.

“If this isn’t a statement as to what we should do next, it is a statement that we have a community and we have resistance that is ready to push back,” Dievendorf said. “This rally was remarkable, in part, because the average person has reason to be afraid and to feel there might be consequences for dissenting right now. And yet we showed up anyway. I think that we’re starting to understand that silence is not going to get us out of this. The only way to fight fascism and to get our democracy back to a stable place is for us to have a united front in favor of rule of law and the Constitution.”
There were very few agitators or those launching counterprotests at the Lansing event, which ran counter to a warning from a GOP official who on Thursday claimed there would be problems from left-wing trouble makers at the event. At least one report of a counterprotester showed a peace keeping unit ushering him out of the crowd with little resistance otherwise.
On Thursday, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick warned in a bizarre statement issued in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan. He specifically called out the Democratic Socialists of America.
The political party was indeed there at the Lansing rally, one of several political party vendors at the event, simply talking to voters about the issues of the day.
A number of political groups and campaigns, including the Democratic Socialists of America, set up tents and tables around the outskirts of the protest at the Michigan State Capitol. | Oct. 18. Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
Among them was Sam Nelson, co-chair of the Greater Lansing DSA. Nelson said the event was certainly about mobilization, but it wasn’t a strike or a show of civil disobedience.
“It’s about putting out the calls. Everyone can come out and stand with hundreds of thousands, even millions, across the country,” Nelson said. “Yes, this is a rally, and rallies are about as peaceful as you can get when it comes to political demonstration.”
Instead of drumming chaos that didn’t exist, Nelson posited that the GOP in Michigan should look inward and denounce the young Republican group chats that were recently unveiled in news reports, which showed young party organizers shared slurs and violent political rhetoric.
“Then they can talk about peaceful discourse,” Nelson said.
Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor and beyond
Rallies in other parts of the state also saw large crowds with thousands willing to exercise their rights to free speech while those rights still remain intact.
Among the larger No Kings rallies was at Roosevelt Park in southwest Detroit, where thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds began arriving just before 3 p.m., holding up signs in Spanish and English as they stepped out of their cars or buses, including “America has no kings,” or “No National Guard in Detroit.”
“The people united will never be defeated,” were one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one will continue
“It is encouraging, I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back. We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”
After rallying at the park, demonstrators then peacefully marched down Michigan Avenue, although there was at least one arrest when a counter-protestor and supporter of President Trump, Andre Williams, 24, was taken into custody by Detroit Police after he followed No Kings marchers and reportedly began to scuffle with demonstrators and force his way into the crowd before being handcuffed and placed in a squad car.

At the Ann Arbor demonstration earlier Saturday, resident Angela Williams, 91, sat among the several hundred demonstrators at Veterans Park and told the Advance that while she had lived through many turbulent times, this felt different.
“I have feared for our democracy before, but I’ve always felt that the three branches of government were independent. And now I’m very disturbed by the lack of independence,” Williams said.

In Flint, among the several thousand demonstrators who turned out to the city’s No Kings rally was former U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint), who told the Advance the crowd itself stood as a rejection of the characterization from Trump and his administration that participants were violent extremists.
“This is dissent. This is a group of people who are just everyday citizens. I’ve run into people that I went to elementary school with, not people that I’ve met along the path of political activism that has defined my work until now, but people that I haven’t seen for years, neighbors, old friends. These are citizens.”

And scattered among the crowds were volunteers with clipboards, collecting signatures for initiative petition campaigns hoping to make the 2026 ballot. 
“We are just out here trying to make sure that the people hold the power and not politicians,” said Drew Amidei, a staff organizer for Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action, at the Jefferson City rally. 
This was the second nationwide No Kings mass gathering, with the first organized in June to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., that commemorated the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Since then, Missourians have found more reasons to organize at the state level, said Sue Rodgers, spokesperson for We Stand United Missouri. The organization led the Jefferson City rally at the State Capitol, where hundreds of protesters turned out despite a rainy afternoon.
Sue Gibson, a volunteer with Respect Missouri Voters, collects signatures during the No Kings demonstration at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City on Saturday. Respect Missouri Voters is the intiative petition campaign for a constitutional amendment that would make it harder for the General Assembly to overturn citizen-led ballot measures (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Rogers pointed to last month’s move by Missouri lawmakers to push forward a gerrymandered congressional map requested by Trump and a ballot measure to make it harder for citizens to amend the state’s constitution.
“There’s more specific issues at this point,” Rodgers told The Independent. “We see more evidence of the authoritarian power grabs and executive overreach.”
Even a thunderstorm in St. Louis wasn’t enough to dampen the spirits of protesters. 
“I know it’s raining. I know it’s a little cool,” former Democratic U.S. Rep. Cori Bush told a crowd of more than a thousand people gathered in downtown St. Louis amid the thunderstorm. “But you all, this is nothing in comparison to the reign that we’ll have to live through if we don’t resist the Donald Trump administration.”
 Jefferson City

Rodgers pointed to organizations with tents surrounding the Missouri State Capitol lawn with volunteers collecting signatures for three petition campaigns.
“We definitely have more of a focus this time on the initiative petitions and redistricting,” she said.
A petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan circulated during the demonstration, with groups like Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action and Respect Missouri Voters collecting signatures.
To them, the citizen-led petitions embody the spirit of No Kings — with voters asserting power and calling out leadership they believe is acting autocratic.
Women dressed as suffragettes wait to present a timeline of women’s contributions to democracy as part of the No Kings demonstration at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City Saturday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
“No Kings is a good time to get this message out because both this referendum and this rally are really about empowering the people of Missouri,” Amidei said. “It’s really about asserting our democratic values.”
He told The Independent there was a “good amount of foot traffic” as he collected signatures for a petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan.
Organizers wanted voters’ rights to be emphasized while creating an uplifting environment.
“We encouraged them to come in costumes, have fun,” Rodgers said. “Everyone needs a little space to let off anxious energy and find out they are not alone.”
Rodgers was one of a handful of women dressed as suffragettes who spoke during the Jefferson City rally about women’s contributions to democracy.
Another speaker, assistant attorney general Greg Barnes, dressed as James Madison to warn demonstrators of threats to the U.S. Constitution. He spoke about Trump’s mentions of a third term.
But not every costume had an obvious nod to democracy. Others dressed as dinosaurs in inflatable costumes, and one organizer wore a Cheeto costume.
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning, dressed in a cow onesie, told the crowd that the costumes are intentional.
“When we’re silly, we expose them as frauds,” she said. “Fascists can’t promote lies about dangerous, left-wing terrorists when we keep showing up unarmed wearing costumes.”
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning leads chants during the No Kings rally in Jefferson City on Saturday. Browning said the organizers encouraged participants to wear costumes to show their intentions for a peaceful, uplifting event (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Unlike in June, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe did not declare a state of emergency ahead of Saturday’s rallies. At the time, Kehoe said his decision to activate the Missouri National Guard was a “precautionary measure” in the case of “events that are occurring or could occur.”
“We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest,” Kehoe said in a statement at the time, “but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state.”
Kehoe is currently being sued by Lucas Cierpiot, a disability-rights activist from Blue Springs, and the son of a Republican state senator, over his decision to activate troops over the summer.
Local news outlets reported that the June protests remained uneventful between demonstrators and police.
 St. Louis 

The crowd at Keiner Plaza in downtown St. Louis brought with it ample American flags, ponchos and an occasional inflatable costume. 
“Fight looks like marching in the streets. Fight looks like collecting signatures,” state Rep. Ray Reed, a Democrat from St. Louis, told the crowd. “ … Fight looks like putting your name on a ballot.”

Brice Bloom-Ellis, 69, of St. Louis, stood several yards away holding a sign demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. But ICE was front of mind. 
“I’m totally opposed to masked federal police snatching people off the street,” said Bloom-Ellis, who works in child welfare. “It’s just unbelievable that that’s happening in this country.” 
He was also appalled by Missouri’s new congressional map, which he called nothing but a “power grab.” 
Bloom-Ellis was far from the only one upset that the governor took the president’s request to redraw the congressional map in favor of Republicans to heart. 
Tullia Hamilton, 77, of St. Louis, said she’s never met Kehoe, but if she did, she knows what she would tell him: 
“I don’t know you, but chances are you’re three times the man Donald Trump is,” said Hamilton, a retired history professor. “Why are you bowing to him? He’s a small person.”

Beside Hamilton stood by her good friend, Dr. Seth Eisen, 84, the director of Washington University’s Clinical Rheumatology Research Program, who brought a sign that read: “hands off science.” 
“It’s really a throw-back for science and also for health care in St. Louis specifically, but in the state and in the nation as well,” said Hamilton, who in recent months has seen NIH funding decreased, studies halted, and colleagues leave academia for the pharmaceutical industry. 
“What’s happening now is going to impact research for 10 years,” he said. “Even if it were to change today.” 
Ryan Maliff, 35, of Webster Groves, who works in health care, is already seeing the impact on Missourians, including his patients who can no longer afford insulin. 
“A lot of what’s been done to gut the protections for Medicare and Medicaid, it’s affecting my work, it’s affecting my patients,” he said.

As the group rounded out its march through downtown, which lasted nearly two hours, Ari Jones-Bradley, 49, said she’s spent the past several months feeling hopeless, alone and terrified for the world her four sons are growing up in.
“We’re headed into extremely dark times, and this is not the country my grandfather fought for,” Jones-Bradley said of her grandfather who served in World War II at the Battle of Iwo Jima. 
But she said Saturday’s demonstration, which she called “electrifying,” shifted something in her. 
“I’m mad,” Jones-Bradley said. “I’m fully energized again and I’m ready to fight.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101825_NoKings7-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-18 19:58:27.450897

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakotans who joined No Kings rallies in 11 cities Saturday pushed back on criticism that the events were anti-American.
“I love America, I love the Constitution, and I love what this country represents,” said Patrick McNally, 36, a dual citizen of Canada and the U.S. who joined a rally outside the North Dakota Capitol. 
Thousands protested Trump administration policies at rallies in Fargo and Bismarck with smaller events held in Grand Forks, Jamestown, Bottineau, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Williston, Minot and Medora. Some communities reported larger crowds than similar events in June, while others said windy weather deterred some participants.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson characterized the No Kings movement held in 2,600 cities as the “hate America rally.” Closer to home, North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer called rally participants “left-wing nut jobs” in a statement last week.

Many North Dakotans who participated raised concerns about health care, including cuts to Medicaid and expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, while others protested tariffs that are hurting farmers or advocated for protecting due process for immigrants.
“I’m very passionate about what’s happening in our country, so that is why I am protesting,” said Jessie Smette of Fargo, who joined a rally outside of City Hall. “Not because I have nothing better to do, and not because I’m getting paid to do it, but because I think it’s important work.” 
Trygve Hammer, a former Democratic-NPL Party U.S. House candidate, highlighted during a speech in Williston comments made by Republican lawmakers criticizing No Kings participants as far-left extremists who don’t value the foundational principles of the country.
“That is exactly wrong,” Hammer said in an interview after the event, which drew about 100 to Williston’s Harmon Park. “That’s exactly what we’re doing is standing up for those foundational truths.”

Bismarck rally participant Ann Mitchell, 57, is worried about the impacts of Trump administration tariffs and trade policies on her family’s farm near Pettibone, North Dakota. Mitchell said her husband’s family has farmed the land for generations, but now fears they could lose everything.
“We can’t sell our soybeans. We can’t sell our corn. Next year we don’t know what we’re gonna do,” Mitchell said. 
Beth Larson-Steckler, a 55-year-old Bismarck resident, said she has two chronically ill children who depend on Medicare for medication that can cost $1,000 a month. She wants the federal government to do more to protect health care and improve the existing system. 
“Congress needs to work together,” Larson-Steckler said. “They’re not working together. They’re pointing fingers. They’re wasting time. They’re not working for us.”
Across the street from the Bismarck protest, a handful of counter-protesters gathered at the North Dakota Republican Party headquarters with a sign stating “Jesus is Our King” and waving an American flag with Trump’s face on it.
Thousands joined the Fargo demonstration, including Clyde Hughes, a veteran who drove about 45 minutes from Wahpeton. He said the Republican Party is taking the country in the wrong direction. 
“We’re cutting social programs just to give billionaires tax cuts,” Hughes said.

He said he is grateful for the health care he gets through Veterans Affairs, though added, “You shouldn’t have to join the service to get decent health care,” he said.
Julie Brummund, an Air Force veteran from Fargo, said she is concerned about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eroding the freedom of the press. 
“I see American citizens justifying that and it just baffles my mind,” said Brummund, whose military service included an assignment in public affairs. 
Rick Loftus of Indivisible Fargo, who was volunteering to help with crowd control, said Fargo had a larger turnout than the No Kings rally in June. But he was also pleased to hear about strong turnouts around the state.
“It’s really these smaller places having events that’s inspiring to me,” Loftus said. 
A Grand Forks event attracted about 600 people, the largest protest since Trump was reelected, said organizer Julie Olson. She described the event as a “pro-America” rally, but said participants objected to Trump “acting with impunity.”
Nikki Tickerhoof, an organizer for the No Kings protest in Minot, said about 400 people attended the event that she said seemed like a block party with people handing out treats and wearing Halloween costumes.

About 150 people joined an event on Main Street in Valley City, with almost all of them emphasizing their love for America, said Vicki Voldal Rosenau, one of the organizers. Gail Pederson, a participant, said attendees also raised concerns about expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and a lack of due process through immigration detentions.
“While that may not be a big thing in our neck of the woods, it certainly can affect us all,” Pederson said.
In Jamestown, organizers estimated about 250 people gathered near Mill Hill. Some who marched with signs had concerns about tariffs and the trade war, said Mike Weatherly, one of the organizers.
“Those things are hurting our farmers and they are finally starting to see it, which is terrible,” Weatherly said.
The demonstration remained peaceful, but one woman told participants to go back where they came from. 
“I’m right here. I’m right where I came from,” Weatherly said.
Approximately 100 people joined a No Kings protest in Devils Lake, organizers said, representing a broad cross section of the community. Veterans, farmers, teachers, clergy and others participated in the event that remained peaceful except for vociferous chants of “USA” that Nancy Lundon said rang out. 
“It wasn’t just Democrats,” Lundon said. “It was just people who are concerned about things as they are and what’s to come.”
About 25 people waved American flags during a rally in Bottineau, including some who traveled from Rolette and Westhope, said organizer Carol Wendel. 
“We’re here because we love America,” Wendel said. “And this is not the America we love.”

Eight residents of Medora decided to hold their own No Kings rally outside Theodore Roosevelt National Park rather than drive to an event in Dickinson. 
“We’re all so sad that our national parks are closed,” said Sandy Baertsch of Medora.
While the park remains open during the federal government shutdown, the visitor center is closed.
“We’ve seen lots of people come and are disappointed by the locked doors,” she said.
Baertsch said the group is calling on North Dakota’s congressional delegation to represent the state’s residents and farmers “instead of just doing whatever Trump asks, no matter what it is.”
Lucas Roy, 24, and Margaret Windingstad, 23, emphasized the need to protect public lands during the Bismarck event. 
“They’re not for sale. They shouldn’t be auctioned off for private uses,” Roy said.

Bob Ferguson addresses a No Kings rally in Everett on Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero for Washington State Standard)Gov. Bob Ferguson struck a defiant tone at the No Kings day rally in Everett, Washington, where thousands of people attended on Saturday.
“As governor, I promise you one thing above all else, we will never, ever under any circumstances, bend the knee to this autocrat,” he said of President Donald Trump.
In Everett, roughly 4,000 people attended the demonstration, according to Snohomish County Indivisible, the event organizers. The gathering remained peaceful, with attendees holding signs saying “defend democracy” and “no kings.”
Ferguson’s speech focused on defending democracy against authoritarian threats and protecting public health.
In his remarks he cited a letter U.S Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to him in August which threatened to withhold federal funding and prosecute elected leaders if they failed to cooperate with immigration enforcement.
“I can sum up the response letter with two words, hell no,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson said democracies die by a slow, steady erosion of civil liberties and free speech, a gradual consolidation of power in one individual, and prosecuting political enemies with criminal charges.
“Despite the challenges we’re facing as a country, no state in the country, no state in the country, is doing more to stand up to this administration and this autocrat than Washington state,” Ferguson said.
He brought up the West Coast Health Alliance, a public health alliance formed by 15 Democratic governors that Washington state joined. This alliance is aimed to protect public health by breaking away from the guidance of the Trump administration and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“Robert, that guy’s a crank, right?” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately, he’s in charge of public health for our country.”

Anita Dietrich, founder of Snohomish County Indivisible, described the actions of Trump as reckless, corrupt and more dangerous than ever.
“They want us silent while they target immigrant families, while they strip our rights, shred our schools, hand our future to billionaire cronies and act like kings above the law,” Dietrich said. “But America has no kings, not now, not ever.”
The first No Kings day was held in June and drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. It was one of the largest protests in Seattle’s history and in Olympia, over 5,000 people attended.
In the demonstration on Saturday, people began to gather around 12 p.m. near the Snohomish county courthouse in Everett. The official event with speakers began around 1 p.m.. and finished shortly after 2 p.m. once it started raining.
In Olympia, meanwhile, an estimated 4,000 people, some in costume and most toting signs emblazoned with personal political messages, attended the rally at the state Capitol.
Seated on the steps of the Capitol and Temple of Justice, they cheered loudly as David Reaves, senior pastor of New Life Baptist Church in Lacey, proclaimed to the “architects of mischief, your time is up.”
“This is a call to the real America. Hold onto hope and protect it fiercely,” he said, imploring attendees to commit to be actively engaged. “Whatever you do, damn it, do something,” he said.
The hour-long event ended with the crowd singing the National Anthem
Throngs of people headed to the grassy area around Tivoli Fountain, visiting information tents of event organizers, churches and political groups. Dozens stood alongside Capitol Way, waving signs as a brigade of cars carrying supporters passed by.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — More than 1,000 protesters gathered around the Nebraska Capitol this weekend to protest against the Trump administration.
Saturday wasn’t the first crop of No Kings protests in the state; there were a dozen similar protests in June. This time around, there are 15. The protesters held anti-Trump signs criticizing the callousness of the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts and cuts to federal services. Some chanted for President Donald Trump “to go.” 
Some protesters, who did not give their names, said they were happy with the turnout, citing frustrations over the president’s deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities and attacks on transgender rights as frustrations. 
The Nebraska protests were part of an estimated 1,900 protests nationally on Saturday, No Kings officials estimated. Organizers said people wanted to speak out against “authoritarian policies” and “reaffirm that America has No Kings, and the power belongs to the people.” 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln told the Examiner that the protests are “what Democracy looks like.” 
“[Democracy] was on my mind as I joined my mom, my son and my neighbors at a peaceful protest … to show love and support for our country and dissent for the current attacks on working families, civil rights, and basic democracy,” she said.

Gov. Jim Pillen shared no details this time around about security preparations, unlike June, when he publicized having activated the National Guard ahead of the first No Kings protests.
“Demonstrations will be actively monitored as they are held across the state and responded to appropriately to ensure the safety and security of the public,” said Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen.
Much like the midsummer protests, the one outside the Capitol was peaceful, with protesters holding signs by the side of the road as cars passed. Some cars honked in support, while one drove by with “Trump” flags. 
One counter-protester carried a sign that read “no queens” with a picture of former Vice President Kamala Harris. The Nebraska Republican Party called the protests across the state “an imagined, astro-turfed performance by Democrats trying to resuscitate a party in chaos through fear and theatrics.”

“Republicans will keep rallying behind a President who actually puts America first and negotiates peace deals in his spare time,” Nebraska GOP chair Mary Jane Truemper said in a statement.
Democratic and Democratic-aligned groups used the protests to reach potential voters. The Lancaster County Democrats, Stand Up Nebraska and the Democratic Socialists of America held booths. 
Local organizers booked musical performances and speakers. Speakers emphasized the importance of next year’s midterm elections. One of them was State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature. A musician sang “This Land Is Your Land.”
 “I know it’s a dark time in our country right now, and in a state like Nebraska it can sometimes feel impossible to beat billionaires, but I want to offer you some hope,” Dungan told the crowd. “I’m talking with people in their communities … and let me tell you. They’re pissed off, too.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Several thousand people gathered outside the South Carolina Statehouse to oppose President Donald Trump and his administration as part of a national No Kings protest.
Most of the rallygoers also marched from the Statehouse to the Governor’s Mansion and back — 1 mile each way — to oppose the Republican governor who was one of Trump’s earliest backers.
The rally drew even more people than the one in June, which coincided with Trump’s birthday and Flag Day, said organizer Sam Gibbons of West Columbia. Similar demonstrations took place in cities across the state, including Greenville, which were among more than 2,600 planned nationwide.
Protesters remained peaceful as they chanted and carried signs down Columbia’s Main Street.
Police blocked off intersections and streets to keep incoming traffic away, but few uniformed officers patrolled the demonstration itself, and no confrontations arose, either at the protest in Columbia or at Falls Park in Greenville.

At issue for protesters was a wide variety of the Trump administration’s policies, including recent waves of deportations, federal cuts to health care research and what they considered moves away from democracy.
Attention turned to statewide issues as well.
Gibbons, a state liaison for national group 50501, urged attendees to vote in every election, including local ones, and show up to meetings at the Statehouse on contentious bills, such as the nearly total abortion ban scheduled for a second hearing next month.
Local demonstrations are also important in continuing to press for change, Gibbons said.
“Protests do matter,” the 34-year-old told the thousands gathered. “They may not immediately change policy or culture, but they can stir something within your soul.”
The crowd stood outside the gate of the Governor’s Mansion for about 15 minutes and chanted, “Henry Mac has got to go,” a shortening of Gov. Henry McMaster’s name.
McMaster was the first statewide official to back Trump ahead of South Carolina’s 2016 first-in-the-South GOP presidential primary. Then the lieutenant governor, McMaster ascended to governor in January 2017 when Trump picked Nikki Haley to be his first United Nations ambassador. McMaster, who went on to win two full terms and can’t run again, has been a staunch Trump supporter ever since.
Gibbons then swapped in names of other Republican politicians, including Attorney General Alan Wilson and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace. Both are among five Republicans who have announced bids to replace McMaster in 2026.
No one came out from the Governor’s Mansion to address the crowd.
Change can come from persistent protests, said the Rev. Susie Smith of Clemson, a former pastor at Peace Congregational Church and a longtime activist.
She pointed to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds as one example. For years, Smith was among those who sat around the flag on Saturdays and called for its removal. Legislators voted to take it down in 2015 after the hate-fueled massacre of nine people at a historic Black church in Charleston, known at Mother Emanuel, including its pastor, Sen. Clementa Pinckney. But Smith attributed its removal at least in part to calls from activists.
“Sometimes, it takes a crowd like you showing up week after week after week,” Smith said, to the cheering of the crowd.
In a red state like South Carolina, showing politicians that many people disagree with them and their policies is especially important, said Libby Davis. The 21-year-old from Columbia, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she hoped the turnout Saturday showed a widespread discontent with Trump. The name of the protest and many of the signs opposed what attendees view as a lack of checks and balances in the federal government, making it akin to a monarchy.

“This crown should be the only crown in America,” Davis said, pointing to the crown on her own head, which mirrored the one atop the statue in New York City.
Dietician Deb Waldron joined thousands at Falls Park in Greenville because she was concerned about Trump’s cuts to the National Institutes of Health, she said.
“(Health Secretary) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is anti-vax, which is dangerous to Americans,” Waldron said. “He’s cutting science and medical research.”
Kennedy’s slogan is Make America Healthy Again, but Waldron contends the opposite is happening.
Thy Nguyen, a 19-year-old whose family moved to Columbia from Vietnam five years ago, said she loved America and hates seeing some of Trump’s changes. In particular, she worries about tariffs causing prices to rise and people getting deported, she said.
Nguyen added she’s not worried about her own presence in the country, but she worries about the country’s future.
“I got my citizenship for a reason,” Nguyen said. “Ain’t no way that (Trump) ruins this.”

Sitting apart from the main body of the Greenville rally in the shade, Connor Roper, 22, a transgender man, and his two friends said they came to the protest to support transgender rights. The three expressed concern about anti-transgender legislation and the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric.
Roper said he had considered leaving the country.
“I grew up here and it’s been scary,” Roper said. “I’m not blind to how transgender people are treated here, but I still love the area. The writing on the wall is pretty plain, but I don’t want to have to emigrate. I don’t want to leave my grandma. I don’t know how much time she has left.”
Several protesters dressed in a variety of costumes, including a unicorn and a hippo. Greenville resident Kelly Foster attended the rally dressed as a nun.
“I don’t think things are going well with this administration and I’m fearful that things will get worse,” she said.
Foster said she chose a nun’s costume to promote peace.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)COTTONWOOD FALLS — Kay Krause was searching for a way to make a difference with so much “craziness happening around us.”
So she meditated.
That’s how she came up with the idea to try to make life better for immigrants who are housed at the Chase County Detention Center a half-mile from her house.
“You don’t have to take a political stand to support people that are imprisoned,” she said. “That’s a love stand.”
Krause has collected more than $5,000 to support the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, providing them with postcards and stamps. The jail can hold about 150 detainees who are in transition to larger facilities elsewhere in the country, with some only there for 48 hours and most gone in two weeks. That’s not enough time for them to be assigned a federal ID number. Without the postcards and stamps, their families wouldn’t know where they are or where they are going, Krause said.
Krause also has organized jail-sanctioned donations of soccer balls, games and other items through an Amazon gift registry, and she is planning a pizza party for detainees during Thanksgiving week.
On Saturday, she expanded her efforts by hosting a “love in action” rally at her house. The gathering of 13 in the rural town of about 800 people was among the smallest of the 42 No Kings events that were planned across the state as part of a nationwide uprising.
Krause’s event was different because it focused on kindness rather than the anger toward the Trump administration that brought the attendees together around a campfire in her backyard. Trump won about 75% of the Chase County votes in last year’s election.
“At some point, this whole mess is going to be over, and then what are we going to do?” she said in an interview earlier in the week. “We’ve got to start building bridges. We’ve got to start seeing our neighbors as neighbors and not enemies. We’ve just got to start reaching out and looking for the good in each other, because it’s there. It’s just covered up with all this craziness.”
The attendees included a couple from Wichita, a local folksinger, a professional musician from Colorado, and a Topeka man who was protesting Trump for a 164th consecutive day.

A tortoiseshell cat and two large dogs listened in as Randall McKinnon, of Fairplay, Colorado, and Rodney Bates, who lives just east of nearby Strong City, played Kris Kristofferson’s “Here Comes This Rainbow Again,” which was inspired by a chapter from “The Grapes of Wrath,” and John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.”
McKinnon was in between gigs in Kansas City and Wichita. He said he appreciated the rally’s focus on “acts of love.”
“There’s enough hatred going on out there,” McKinnon said. “I could have gone to some of the metro area protests, where they have a little different flavor to them, but I left my inflatable frog suit at home.”
His comment was a reference to viral images of protesters dancing in costume outside an ICE office in Portland, Oregon.
Bates, an 80-year-old who arrived with a dobro, said he has been “negative about monarchy” since he was in grade school. He lamented the way politics have “degenerated into gang warfare,” where people wear either a red or blue bandana.
“I think this is more extreme than even the ’60s,” he said. “For a long time, I thought it was kind of like the ’60s all over again, but I think it’s gone farther, more extreme.”
Marcia Freund, of Wichita, said she believes the Trump presidency is different from others because “the power grab is so much worse.”
She said Trump isn’t taking care of America, and she worried about people who are at risk of losing food assistance because of the government shutdown.
“Here we’re having these little protests, and he has an insurrection, but he acts like we’re the hateful ones,” Freund said.
She attended with her husband, Dave, who said: “You can’t print what I want to say.”

Thomas Muther, of Topeka, said he has protested in towns from northwest to southeast Kansas, as well as in Missouri and Arkansas. He plans to continue his streak of 164 consecutive days of protests until Trump leaves office.
Why?
“I’m a fan of democracy,” he said. “I’m not a fan of autocracy.”
“But there are lots and lots of reasons,” Muther added. “I think immigrants should be treated fairly. I think the law should be followed by everybody, especially including the president.”
Krause led the group in meditation. She asked them to take deep breaths, to be aware of the smell of the campfire and the sounds around them, and to try to lift their problems off their shoulders for a moment.
“It’s so easy to fall into the muck pond, where things are hard,” Krause told them. “We get overwhelmed with fear, anger, at things happening around us. We miss those opportunities to be fully present to what is. And in this moment, right here, right now, all is well.”
After the meditation, she walked down the street handing out roses on her way to the Dollar General store, where she paid for a man’s order.
“Just for a moment, people smiled,” she said. “And these days, I’ll take it.”

Debo Powers, on Oct. 18, 2025. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)HAMILTON — DILLON — POLEBRIDGE — Kent Kernahan, of Corvallis, said he’s a Methodist minister’s child, and he demonstrated Saturday at the No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot rally after asking himself what his father would have done.
Kernahan carried a sign that said, “Lord, Please Forgive Trump,” along with an image of the Gadsden “Don’t Tread On Me” image.
Among more than 700 people who lined several blocks of U.S. Highway 93 in downtown Hamilton, Kernahan said the symbol represents opposition to the king of England stepping on the colonies, but it’s misunderstood by some who claim it.
“I don’t think it means what they think it means,” Kernahan said. 
No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot, part of a national No Kings rally and among a couple of dozen planned demonstrations in Montana, took place in Hamilton, a smaller community of roughly 5,000 in the Bitterroot Valley.
Montana supported GOP President Donald Trump with 58% of the vote in 2024, but Ravalli County, a Republican stronghold in the red Bitterroot, backed him with 69%.
Nonetheless, Montanans turned out in traditionally red communities, such as Dillon, with a population of roughly 4,000, and they gathered in tiny outposts such as Polebridge, on the edge of Glacier National Park, which almost saw more demonstrators than full-time residents.
Most of the people who turned out to demonstrate appeared to be those who had already opposed Trump, the brash leader pushing the boundaries of presidential authority in his second term, and before the government shutdown, which has seen 700,000 federal workers furloughed.
But demonstrators said they rallied to show support for democracy, for the U.S. Constitution, for civil liberties, for federal workers, for immigrants, for their own grandchildren, for health care, for the proper use of military troops, and for science and research.
Cherie Garofalo, a local organizer of Indivisible, said the aim of the gathering was to protect liberties in the country for all, for her children, friends and neighbors.
“I really believe this is about freedom,” Garofalo said.
Debo Powers, a Democratic state Representative who organized a rally near the northern entrance of Glacier National Park, said it was the duty of Americans to take to their local streets and make their voices heard.   
“We have got to resist. It’s the patriotic thing to do,” Powers said.

 Bitterrooters rally for freedom, democracy 

Stephen Goheen, of Corvallis, held up a sign that read, “Scientists Save Lives,” not far from a National Institutes of Health biomedical research facility in Hamilton, the Rocky Mountain Laboratories.
“If we don’t fund our scientists, we won’t be ready for the next diseases,” Goheen said.
For example, he said, the mRNA vaccine was based on research that had taken place over many years, and it proved valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The work that scientists do sometimes doesn’t show its value until years down the line,” Goheen said.
The Rocky Mountain Laboratories has employed roughly 500 people in recent years, according to KFF.
The lab, controversial in the Bitterroot, will run on a skeleton crew during the shutdown after roughly a dozen workers lost their jobs in February and other employees opted for early retirements, according to Lee Enterprises.
Not everyone at Saturday’s events was opposed to Trump, though, and Betty Belshe, of Hamilton, said she’s actually opposed to the lab, which studies infectious diseases and is designated a BSL-4 facility, a maximum containment laboratory.
She said she fears people in the Bitterroot might be exposed to biochemical hazards from the lab.
“If it gets out in our air, it’s going to harm us,” Belshe said.
Saturday, Belshe demonstrated to show support for Trump and his bold actions, including cutting government.
“We’ve got way too many government employees,” Belshe said. 
Belshe and her husband, Casey Leedy, both of Hamilton, stood next to a flag that read, “Vote Republican,” but they appeared to be in the minority along the highway.
Brooke Hillyer, wearing a Smokey Bear top, said she dressed to show her support for national parks and the U.S. Forest Service, and the bear is the best representative for that message.
National parks have remained open during the shutdown, and some conservation advocates worry the public resources will be damaged without proper staffing.
“I believe that Trump is ruining our country, what we stand for,” Hillyer said.
Susan Crawford, of Corvallis, said she doesn’t believe she’s being represented by Montana’s federal delegation, politicians who have ceded their power to the president.
“They’re giving up duties that we voted them in to do,” Crawford said.
Nancy Neal of Corvallis, Montana, counted more than 700 participants at the No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot rally in Hamilton on Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. Neal said she’s not using the term “antifa” anymore. She said it’s “anti-fascist.” (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)
She held a sign that read, “The Only White House Thrones ‘R’ Porcelain.”
“We are experiencing someone in the White House who is acting omnipotent, and we’re letting him,” Crawford said. “He does not deserve a throne, and we don’t want him on a throne, except this one.”
Although the theme of the rally was No Kings, Dean Knudsen, of Hamilton, said he had a different idea about a king.
In Montana, 55% of people are Christian, and Knudsen stood on one corner of the highway with a compilation of signs that read, “Jesus is King,” and “Jesus, Our Only Hope.”
“There is a king, and his name is Jesus,” Knudsen said.
On the opposite corner, Megan Kelly, in a puffy chicken costume just for “sh**s and giggles,” held a sign that read, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses …”
She said closing down the government meant shutting people out of the things they need, such as education and health care, the opposite of helping those who are tired and poor. 
“I am letting the government know that the American people are not to be messed with,” Kelly said. 
Ron Osborn, a veteran of the Korean War, held up a sign that said, “The Military Defends Freedom. Don’t Use It To Crush It.”
Osborn, almost 93, said he believes the Trump administration’s approach to the military is “a disgrace.” Montana has a high number of military veterans, roughly 9% of the population. 
He said Pete Hegseth, head of the Department of Defense, or Department of War as the Trump administration has attempted to rebrand it, is “fully unqualified,” and the former Fox News television personality has no business leading the military or lecturing admirals.
Osborn and his wife, Nancy Osburn, took to the streets to show their patriotism.
“We’re proud American citizens, loyal to the flag and the Constitution,” Ron Osborn said.
Alla Brooks said she’s a child of immigrants, “an anchor baby,” and she held a sign with a picture of the Statue of Liberty that read, “I’m with her.”
“She was at the head of our harbor,” Brooks said.
She said her parents grew up in repressive Poland, and they drummed into their children the freedoms of America and the First Amendment.
Doug Hatchimonji’s parents, both Japanese, were interned in camps in the U.S. during World War II, and he said it’s important to protect people’s rights to speak, protest and assemble.
“It’s sad and disappointing that an old story continues to be repeated again and again,” said Hatchimonji, of Hamilton, and spouse of Garofalo. “It’s the same story, blaming people of color for problems that they didn’t create.”
One Trump priority is deporting people who are in the country illegally, but law enforcement authorities under his administration have detained many people who have the right to be in the United States, including Americans and elected officials.
Kandice Gren, in a red gnome dress and pointy hat, said she was concerned about the new reduction in the distribution of power among the three branches of government.
Her sign read, “Gnomes say NO KINGS!”
Montanans are practical people, and Gren explained her getup.
“It’s the only costume I own,” Gren said.

 Frustrated participants convene for Dillon’s largest demonstration

About 200 people showed up to line North Montana Street through Dillon, and they held signs, played guitars and talked with one another. At least one participant told the Daily Montanan it appeared to be the biggest the town has seen.
For Emilee Gates, 26, who helps people navigate the social safety net as part of her job, coming to the event in Dillon was in part born out of frustration. One action the Trump administration has taken is to severely cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, calling it “unnecessary.”
What that means for one person Gates has worked with is that instead of $1,500 to pay for energy, they now have $150.
“That’s one propane fill up,” Gates said, saying that the man was living in a camper — which is legal in Montana she added.
Some people attended the rally from Ennis and Twin Bridges, organizers said, even carpooling to get there.

 Polebridge protest exceeds local population 

More than 60 people gathered to take part in a No Kings Indivisible rally in the hamlet of Polebridge, in the borderlands of Glacier National Park, locally organized by Rep. Powers.
The area surrounding Polebridge is colloquially known as the North Fork, and boasts around 100 year-round residents, including Powers. 
“Almost all of the people here are North Forkers, so they’re my constituents,” Powers told the Daily Montanan. “There were a few tourists who were coming to Glacier Park, saw us, and they joined us. That was fun, but mostly it’s people who are my neighbors.”
An intersection of dirt roads is home to the iconic red Polebridge Mercantile — and its equally iconic huckleberry bear claws — standing sentinel near the northernmost entrance to Glacier.
Armed with signs, flags, and costumes, the ralliers circled up in the dirt intersection, occasionally parting ways to let cars headed into the national park squeeze through, along with one disgruntled carload of tourists who grumbled about not needing to be confronted with politics as they walked into the Mercantile to get coffee and pastries. 
Powers, who served in her first Legislative session as an elected official this year, greeted most people by name and at noon pulled out her megaphone. 
“I swore a sacred oath to protect the Constitution of the United States and the constitution of Montana,” she said. “The problem we have today is we have some people who are ignoring their own sacred oaths of office.”
Focusing on the theme of the nationwide rallies — expected to be among the highest participation protest events in history — Powers reminded those gathered that 250 years ago, residents of what would become the United States made a decision to not have a king. 
“We made that decision already, and we did not unmake it,” she said, to responding cheers of “no kings!” 
Not standing up and making their voices heard could be detrimental to residents of Montana, she continued. 
“If we are silent, we could lose it all. We could lose our public lands. We could lose our public education. We could lose our social security and medicare. We could lose our sacred right to vote in free and fair elections,” Powers said. 
Powers represents House District 3, which encompasses the North Fork border of Glacier Park, as well as half of Whitefish. She told the Daily Montanan she felt it was her duty to host a No Kings rally for her community, especially since the next closest one, in Kalispell, is a nearly two-hour drive away. 
“I just asked for seven people to show up so we would have enough to spell out “N-O K-I-N-G-S,” she said. “It’s important to gather close to home, and it’s important to see people in small villages, in red states, not just in big blue cities. This group would get swallowed up there, but here, we stand out.”

				Republican officials nationwide have branded the No Kings demonstrations as “Hate America” rallies.
Montana’s senior U.S. Sen. Steve Daines echoed those statements in an appearance on Fox Business this week. “As Speaker Johnson correctly said, this is a “We hate America rally” and the bottom line is the Democrats and the far left are very upset at the fact they lost the election last November. President Trump won in a landslide, we reclaimed the United States Senate, and we have the House. They are frustrated. They are angry. But sadly they are expressing their anger and frustration by shutting down the government and hurting the American people.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/No_Kings_polebridge_06-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874

For much of the past year, I’ve been writing a series of issue briefs for CommonWealth Beacon on a variety of controversial policy topics (see below), providing evidence-based arguments pro and con, in contrast to the bumper stickers from the left and right that too often pass for civic discourse. 
There are two main points to the series. 
First, even though almost every policy issue has ethical and philosophical dimensions, there are also complicated practical and technical aspects that make many if not most decisions closer calls, involving real-world trade-offs and unintended consequences. 
Second, when you don’t view the opposing side as morally bankrupt or just plain ignorant, there may actually be opportunities for finding common or higher ground, maybe not to reach a final consensus, but at least to take a step forward together. 
The tendency towards reductionism in most policy debates these days often makes a meeting of the minds next to impossible and compromise equivalent to surrender. 
Should Boston enact rent control? Activists in favor say affordable housing is a fundamental human right, while advocates on the other side say free markets and private property stand between us and big-government tyranny. 
Should the state stop prison construction? The left says prisons are inhumane centers of mass incarceration, while the right says “lock ‘em up.” 
Should Massachusetts adopt voter ID requirements? The right says, “stop the steal,” while the left cries “voter suppression.” 
Should the Commonwealth pay reparations to descendants of slaves? Advocates in favor say it’s a matter of overdue social justice, while opponents claim it’s just a performative “woke” hand out. 
Should school librarians make final decisions about which books to stock on the shelves? The left warns against book bans, while the right defends parents’ rights. 
It turns out in all these controversies the facts aren’t always so clear or one-sided, and reasonable people can disagree.  Even when it seems like there is no common ground at all, we need to have enough self-awareness of our own fallibility and respect for the honestly held beliefs of others, no matter how misguided we may think they are, to hold on loosely to our own positions so we can view the other side as temporary opponents, rather than permanent enemies. 
Deciding which side you’re on should at least require an open-minded consideration of the opposing arguments. 
Think the cost of housing in Boston is outrageously high?  Consider whether price controls would suppress the supply of new rental apartments. 
Think prisons keep our communities safe?  Consider the extent to which former prisoners continue to commit crimes after finishing their sentences. 
Think voter ID laws are inherently discriminatory? Consider the high rates of minority voter turnout in states that already have such requirements. 
Think reparations are unjustified? Consider the enormity of the Black-White wealth gap, 160 years after the end of slavery and 60 years after passage of the Civil Rights Act. 
Think school library book bans are threatening free speech and inclusivity?  Consider how few communities in Massachusetts have actually removed books from the shelves. 
There’s no doubt that these debates are fraught with serious differences in values and world views, and righteous rage (as Billy Joel might say) can indeed prick the conscience and spur action. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t dial down the rhetoric and personal attacks in order to get on with the more prosaic and pragmatic business of policymaking. 
The goal is not to confuse or paralyze, but to acknowledge and clarify the inescapable choices in public policy, while encouraging humility, civility, and even empathy in our public discourse. 
As a matter of long-term self-interest, if nothing else, we need to keep in mind that even if “our side” wins this round, the wheel will inevitably turn, and the balance of forces will no longer be in your favor. Total victory today leads to hard feelings and long memories that can become total defeat tomorrow. As fellow citizens, this is an unsustainable pattern that can only end in calamity, not just for some, but for all. 
As we enter the final days of another polarized election season, let’s look forward to the coming year as a time to get off our high horses and embrace the complexity of the real world in hopes of restoring some semblance of common cause, as well as commonsense.

It wasn’t a traffic jam — from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, a steady stream of cars and trucks were honking their support for a No Kings protest that lined both sides of the divided highway, drawing thousands of demonstrators frustrated with the Trump administration.
The rally was awash with colorful characters — among them the Cookie Monster from the children’s show “Sesame Street,” a pink axolotl, dinosaurs and dragons of many different hues and giant yellow chickens.
Erin Grabau, who came wearing a skeletal unicorn ensemble, said she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland who dressed in inflatable frog costumes — but decided on a less elaborate outfit because, “in this economy, no, I’m sorry.”

“It was making a point of showing we’re not violent,” Grabau said. “We’re not causing violence. You can’t turn the narrative.”
Matt Mercer, spokesperson for the North Carolina Republican Party, condemned the protesters as radicals damaging the country.
“Far-left radical Democrats shut down the federal government to brag at these events they shut down the government to stop President Trump,” Mercer said in a statement. “These manufactured events do nothing but highlight how out of touch the radical left is with the American people and here in North Carolina, thousands of voters every month reject being labeled a Democrat.”
Gary Lucido, a Texas transplant in North Carolina, said he had voted Republican all his life before President Donald Trump came along. He said GOP descriptions of No Kings as “Hate America” protests — as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called them — are a “bunch of crap.”
“We love America. We’re here because we want to preserve America,” Lucido said at the Raleigh No Kings protest. “The ones that hate it are the ones that don’t believe in the Constitution.”
For many protesters, the No Kings rally was a family outing. All along Capital Boulevard, children and toddlers could be seen with their parents, some wearing costumes or face coverings of their own and others resting in strollers.
“They need to know when it’s appropriate to stand and fight, and sometimes standing and fighting is standing in a silly costume on the side of the road with a sign and screaming at the top of your lungs,” Grabau said.
Some also brought their four-legged friends. Jeffrey Cohn, a medical writer from Clayton, brought his dogs Bindi and Obi to the No Kings protest in Raleigh, and despite the honking and cheers, they stayed calm as can be.
Cohn came dressed as President Donald Trump’s error-filled “Liberation Day” tariff information sheet. He said it was a relief to be in the company of so many people just as distressed as he is at the direction America has taken.
“We are a majority, and the folks who are trying to destroy and burn, whether it’s for political reasons, whether it’s for Christian Nationalism, white supremacy reasons — there’s more of us who don’t feel that way than do feel that way,” he said.








The soundtrack at the protest was an eclectic combination, with David Bowie and Bob Dylan bleeding into No Doubt’s “Just a Girl” and Rockwell’s “Somebody’s Watching Me.” Protesters’ costumes and flags called to mind various pop culture icons, with one protester flying the flag of the rebellion from “Star Wars” and others dressed as characters like No Face from the anime film “Spirited Away.”

Top of mind for many of the rally-goers was fair voting maps, with North Carolina set to become the latest state to draw new districts at Trump’s direction to shore up the Republican majority in the House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
“Gerrymandering is cheating!” read one protester’s sign. Another featured QR codes linking to the proposed new congressional map and a submission form for public comment. “Tell the NC General Assembly: Stop gerrymandering,” that sign urged.
Recent polling shows that a vast majority of North Carolinians oppose partisan gerrymandering, including 87% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans.
Donna and Larry Shipman, activists who recently relocated from Pennsylvania, also came to No Kings to fight for their right to vote, pointing to key Voting Rights Act protections under threat at the U.S. Supreme Court.
“We need to stand up and say, ‘No, you’re not going to take this away from us,’” said Donna Shipman. “The Supreme Court, they say racism is over. No, it’s not.”
The Raleigh event was just one of several in the Triangle area. No Kings protests in Cary, Apex, Durham and Carrboro also saw large turnouts. More than 50 events were planned in North Carolina, organizers said, among some 2,600 nationwide.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA184532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874

People told the Reformer they were there to fight for democracy against the threat of what they say is President Donald Trump’s overreach, including deploying the National Guard to cities, deporting immigrants without due process and cutting off federal funds to Democratic states.
Protestors carried signs decrying authoritarianism — “No Kings, No Fascists” — and condemning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — “I like my democracy neat. Hold the ICE.”

The last No Kings rally was June 14, the day of the assassination of Mark and Rep. Melissa Hortman. Thousands of people showed up to the Minnesota State Capitol that day, despite advice from local law enforcement to stay home, to protest against the Trump administration’s slide into tyranny.
Republicans previewed Saturday’s event in recent days by calling it a “hate America” rally associated with a “pro-terrorist” wing of the Democratic Party, claims belied by the peaceful crowd, which was marked by playfulness as much as anger.
Some wore inflatable costumes, inspired by the dinosaurs, frogs and ostriches at Portland, Oregon protests against federal immigration enforcement there.

Alex Kaiser, 29, said that wearing his frog costume helps “deflate the message that we’re terrorists or these awful people. Obviously that’s not the case. We all love our country and are trying to make it a better place.”
Dinosaur-clad Pat Bear, 57, said, “It’s really important that we show that we’re not happy with what’s going on, and we’ll do it peacefully.” Bear decried Trump’s immigration policy and the “graft he has going on with crypto,” referring to Trump and his family making millions from opaque crypto deals even since he’s become president.

Sarah Harding, 35, dressed as a penguin, was at the rally to protest ICE and said she wore the costume to show that “we’re peaceful people” and to “bring ridiculousness to what’s happening.”
Jack Harding, 35, Sarah’s spouse, also in a penguin suit “to show the absurdity of it. America has $40 billion to give to ICE but not enough to make health care affordable.”
Another dinosaur, Nick Robinson, 42, said he was there to “stand up for democracy.”
“Bypassing checks and balances in government is definitely something that upsets me,” Robinson said.
Robinson’s sister, Michelle Wheeler, 33, added, “Donald Trump is playing directly out of the fascist, authoritarian playbook. I’m here to stand up for my family and show my kids what it means to fight for democracy.”

Wheeler said she wants Democrats to feel emboldened by the nationwide rallies. “The shutdown is the bare minimum Democrats should be doing to protect our health care, but it’s by no means going far enough,” Wheeler said. “Minnesota Democrats are playing by the old rules when the game has changed. We need to see them thinking outside the box.”
Among the Minnesota officials present at the rally were U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Attorney General Keith Ellison, who addressed the Commons crowd.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MG_4679-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874

(Photo by Mary Iuvone for New Jersey Monitor)Thousands of New Jersey residents took their rage — and ridicule — to the streets Saturday during the latest national No Kings protests, with some wearing silly costumes to push back on critics’ claims that protesters are violent, anti-American extremists.
Critics of President Donald Trump mobbed more than two dozen towns in the Garden State, from Newton down to Cape May Court House, to accuse his administration of “authoritarianism.”
Critics, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have derided the mass day of action as a “Hate America rally” bound to draw “Antifa types.” The No Kings protesters were happy to nix that notion.
Daniel Buchanan of Union County showed up to a rally outside the Statehouse in Trenton in an inflatable traffic cone costume, while Amy Bruno of Ewing wore an inflatable unicorn outfit and called herself “Aunt Tifa.” In Princeton, a bean bag frog balanced on Susan Steen’s baseball cap carried its own tiny sign declaring: “I AM AMPHIFA.” Nearby, Sarah Schwimmer wore colorful fringe from head to toe in her piñata costume. “Because I  our Democracy (even more than I love candy!),” her sign said.
“We’re just trying to exercise our First Amendment rights and protest, and yet we’re being painted as terrorists and as violent. We’ve been trying different ways to show that that’s silly, and we mean no harm, and we’re not violent, and the whole point is to get a message out,” Buchanan said.
His message: “Those in power only care about themselves and their own agenda. We’re not going to just sit and be quiet and be OK with it. There’s a lot more people than they think that are against this.”

The protests came amid a government shutdown now in its third week, federal deployments of National Guard troops to police several U.S. cities, and immigration agents carrying out Trump’s mass deportation mission. Protesters denounced such actions as an unacceptable, escalating assault on the American people.
“How many sins have they committed against us? How many wounds have they inflicted on us? Too many!” Andrei Camurungan, an organizer with 50501, shouted at the crowd in Trenton.
Laura Hunt of Burlington Township said she was protesting because she feels the U.S. is “in a crisis situation.” She listed several concerns, ranging from Trump’s immigration crackdowns to “his words towards women.”
“He was talking about the leader of Italy, talking about how beautiful she is. What planet is he from? What century is he in?” Hunt said. “He is a horrible, horrible excuse for a human being. I’m disgusted.”
Millions were expected to attend about 2,600 rallies around the nation, making Saturday the largest mass day of action since the start of Trump’s first term, when the largest single-day mobilization included about 750 rallies, national organizers said.
“This is a genuinely nationwide phenomenon. It is occurring in rural places. It is occurring in urban areas. It is occurring in red places and blue places. The public backlash to Donald Trump and his regime of cronies and corruption and attacks on our rights is incredibly widespread,” said Leah Greenberg, a co-founder and co-executive director of the Indivisible Project.



































































































































































































In Princeton, hundreds of people packed the sprawling block-long park in front of the municipal building.
Sandy Landman of East Brunswick was there with a posterboard listing just some of her concerns about Trump — and they filled both sides.
“Terrible things are going on in this country. Your free speech is being limited. He’s taking money from taxpayers, enriching himself. He’s giving it to Argentina, of all places. He’s taking that tunnel project out of New York because he’s punishing Democratic states and cities — it’s ridiculous. ICE, to me, mirrors the Gestapo. He just freed George Santos, who was an admitted criminal. Health care — it should be a right, not something that you have to fight for constantly,” she said. “We have a lot of things that we need to protest this administration about, because they’re not taking care of the people.”
The protests also became a place to politick, with Dale Caldwell, a Democrat who’s running to become New Jersey’s next lieutenant governor on a slate with gubernatorial hopeful Mikie Sherrill, stopping by the Trenton rally. He urged protesters to vote in the Nov. 4 election, saying Trump — who endorsed Sherrill’s Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli — wants them to stay home from the polls.

“Trump has a Supreme Court abdicating their responsibility, has a Republican Congress abdicating responsibility. If Jack Ciattarelli is governor, New Jersey is going to abdicate our responsibility, ICE is going to be roaming the streets, the National Guard is going to be roaming the streets,” Caldwell said.
He added: “All of you here know how important it is to vote, but you’ve got to tell your family, you’ve got to tell your friends, we’re fighting against apathy. We’re fighting against people staying home, not voting. Trump is discouraging people, and he’s winning when he does that.”
Sherrill appeared at the No Kings protest in Montclair after headlining a campaign rally in Paramus with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). State Sen. Holly Schepisi, a Bergen County Republican, told reporters outside the Paramus rally that she finds Sherrill’s appearance at a No Kings rally “ironic” because Gov. Phil Murphy (D) and Whitmer issued myriad directives in 2020 without legislative approval that ordered business closures, lockdowns, and other actions related to the COVID-19 spread.
“To be doing No Kings protests in New Jersey, when her party, her governor, the governor she invited, were directly responsible for taking away all of the civil liberties, doing everything pursuant to executive order, and causing the deaths of our most vulnerable in the state, I find it to be unconscionable,” she said.

About 15 protests were scheduled around Alabama, part of over 2,600 demonstrations scheduled on Saturday that were expected to draw millions of people. Speakers and participants criticized the administration’s seizure of power; its arrest and detention of immigrants and its policies toward health care. Others said Trump administration policies were hurting members of their families.
The protests were largely peaceful, with no major incidents reported.
A similar round of protests were held in June and drew millions of people to 1,500 sites nationwide. About 14 of those protests were held in Alabama that day with thousands of people in attendance.
Crowd sizes varied, from about 40 people in Selma to up to 2,000 in Birmingham. Here are reports from four of the protests on Saturday.
Birmingham: Calls for community and activism

A crowd of approximately 2,000 people gathered in Railroad Park Saturday for Birmingham’s “No Kings” protest, hearing from speakers including former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones before peacefully marching along a seven-block parade route, carrying signs and engaging in call-and-response chants while drivers honked their horns in support.
“We’re here today, like so many more that have come to Birmingham before us, not just for a No Kings rally but for civil rights, for anti-war protests, you name it, to speak out about injustices when they see it,” Jones told the cheering audience that filled the park’s pavilion and spilled onto a hillside beyond it.
“We’re here because, ‘Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never more than a generation away from extinction,’” he continued, quoting Ronald Reagan’s 1967 inaugural address as California’s governor. “Two hundred and fifty years ago, this country was born of one thing that every American generation has reaffirmed: no kings.”
Attendees hailing from Birmingham and surrounding suburbs and towns cited concerns about human rights and vulnerable people, including the poor and immigrants, threats to democracy and freedom of speech, and opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies as reasons they came to the rally.
“I thought it was very important that we come out and that we show, really, as a country, how we feel about what’s going on in our government, how oppressive it is, and that we’re saying, ‘No,’” said DeValerie Williams of Birmingham. “We’re saying, ‘No, we love our country. We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.”

We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.” (Olivia McMurrey for Alabama Reflector)
In her remarks to the crowd, Rev. Julie Conrady of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham said the city redefined freedom and equality in 1965.
“Over and over in the history of our country, we, the people, have been the necessary checks and balances to ensure that our country continues to progress, improve and prosper,” Conrady said.
She encouraged people to get involved in local causes.
“There is not a lot we can do at the federal government right now,” Conrady said. “One party controls all three branches of government, and one despot’s marching orders control them all. Our resistance must focus locally and statewide, where together, we can make meaningful change.”
Quoting the words of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who called the No Kings protests a “hate-America rally,” attendees and speakers at the Birmingham event said they wanted to correct such misunderstandings.
“There’s a lot of people in this country who care passionately about what’s going on with the current administration and all the corruption and all the lies, taking people’s health care away and giving tax breaks to the rich,” said Greg Fuller of Birmingham. “I think it’s un-American. I think it’s not patriotic. And I think this group is full of people who love America, not hate America, as the speaker said.”
Idania Gonzalez with the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, told the crowd to look around them because the rally is what community looks like.
“This is what power looks like when people stand together for the same cause, when people stand together for our neighbors who are scared to come out, for our neighbors who are living in the shadows due to political fighting,” she said.

Comedian Rebecca Rothman gave rally goers a primer on how to contact their U.S. representatives and then demonstrated it by calling Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s office and leaving a message. She gave the crowd time to make their own calls and encouraged them to place five calls a day.
Candra Bethune of Birmingham said she’s going to do that. Attending the rally made her feel better, even though things are bad, she said, because before she didn’t know what she could do as one person to make a difference.
“We’ve got to do something to let them know that we don’t want this,” Bethune said.

Montgomery: Warnings about federal policy changes

More than 600 people gathered in downtown Montgomery for the city’s “No Kings” rally.
“The kind of change that we are trying to achieve is not the kind of change that happens fast,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, who spoke at the rally. “This is the kind of change that requires we keep showing up. The last time we showed up, we were a good, decent crowd, but this time we are bigger. The next time we show up, we will be even bigger.”
The protest, which began at Riverfront Park, featured people dressed in makeshift costumes displaying dinosaurs and squirrels and others who adorned themselves with colors of the rainbow. Many carried cardboard placards replete with crowns that were crossed out with the words “No Kings” on them.
At 9 a.m. the crowd then marched a quarter mile to the Court Square Fountain, a site where enslaved people were bought and sold prior to the Civil War, to hear from speakers who urged them to continue the public outcry, and who criticized nearly every aspect of Trump’s policies, from mass arrest and deportations of immigrants to tariffs on trade, as well as the budget bill that Congress passed at Trump’s urging that cut funding for social service programs.

Valtoria Jackson of the Poor People’s Campaign addresses a “No Kings” rally in Montgomery, Alabama on Oct. 18, 2025. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted,” she told about 600 people at the demonstration. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)
“No king, no crowns, no thrones, only love, because violence is not just bullets and bombs,” said Rev. Valtoria Jackson, Montgomery lead organizer for the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign, said in a speech. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted.”
Jackson has spoken at numerous gatherings before to raise awareness of the budget bill recently passed by Congress and the potential expiration of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans that could drive up insurance costs around the nation. The loss of those credits has been a major reason for the ongoing federal government shutdown. The budget bill also reduced funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food subsidies to lower-income families and individuals. The bill passes more of the cost of maintaining the programs to the states, and advocates had been warning that the bill could reduce the state’s economy by more than $1 billion and eliminate health insurance coverage for almost 200,000 people.
“Our food pantry participation has gone up 200% since he passed this bill,” said Rev. Manuel Williams in an interview following the event, pastor at Resurrection Catholic Church in Montgomery. “These are people who never had to come and get food assistance, but now they are food insecure.”

Others voiced strong opposition to the administration’s efforts to deport large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S.
“One of my biggest things is the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids, the deportation of people who are just trying to live,” said Haley Morgan, who attended the protest. “They are getting deported for a taillight being out, or for speeding. If that is the case, deport me because I have sped and my taillight has been out.”
Many of those who gathered also expressed reservations about Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government.
“I wanted to help protest against all that Trump is doing,” said Judy May, 87, who attended the rally. “He is destroying the constitution. He is trying to take away our right to vote, our rights of free speech. He is firing so many people, taking so many important departments to pieces. He is destroying the Department of Education, he has destroyed the public health department, I just hate everything he is doing.”

Oxford: ‘We are American people who love our country’

Over 200 people gathered along the roads of the Oxford Exchange to protest the Trump administration Saturday under the “No Kings” name.
Protesters of all ages stood along the highway holding signs condemning President Trump for being what they describe as a dictator, demanding the release of the Epstein files and condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“I’m here today to express my displeasure with the current administration. There are many things being done wrong. I couldn’t even name them, it wouldn’t fit on a sign,” Jim Baker, organizer of the demonstration, said. “I hope somebody hears our cries and our anger and does something about it.”
One protestor said she came to stop the government from continuing the way it is now.
“Things are really scary right now, and if somebody doesn’t say something, and if we don’t keep pushing back, then everything is just going to keep moving in the direction it’s moving. And even if it’s stopping things an inch then it’s worth it,” protestor Cami McKenzie said.
Others just want the government to hear them and their opinions.

“Our government isn’t listening to us. The government is meant to serve us, not control us. So I think it’s important that we stand up before we lose our rights,” protestor Pam Howard said.
Baker said he felt like he was alone when it came to standing up for issues such as healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and ICE raids.
“It makes me extremely happy that there are this many people in the state of Alabama with the same mindset that I have,” Baker said. “I’ve lived here for 21 years, and for 21 years I thought I was on an island.”
And some of these issues are personal to the ones protesting.
“I have four biologically born female daughters, and two are gender non-conforming, so I’m really bothered by a lot of the talk about trans individuals and stuff,” said Glenda Reeseg.
Alanna Gregg, another protestor, said these issues affect everyone.
“You should be ashamed of yourself if you don’t care,” she said “It shouldn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you.”
And Baker made it clear that protestors are just regular people who want better for everyone in the country.
“We are not Antifa, we are not insurrectionists. We are American people who love our country and don’t like the direction that it’s going and that’s why we’re here today.
While the overall response from non-protesters was mostly positive with many honking their horns in support of the cause, there were a few that began to heckle the demonstrators.
Halfway through the protest, a small group of Trump supporters stood across the street to heckle the “No Kings” demonstrators. A heated verbal exchange ensued but was quickly settled.
But protesters didn’t let the rude comments from the group dampen their spirits.
“They have every right to be there and we’re fighting for their rights too,” Howard said.
Howard also commended younger people for being at the protest, and not to let anyone deter them from using their voice.
“One thing I want to say to young people is don’t let anybody tell you that your vote doesn’t count. Voter turnout is one of the biggest issues we have in Alabama,” she said. “If you want to see things change, that’s how we change it.”

Selma: ‘We can see each other’

Laurie Kelly and her husband, who live in Chicago, were traveling to the Gulf of Mexico for a beach vacation. Kelly said she asked her husband to find somewhere to stop to protest.
“If we don’t show up, it’s over. This is very important. It’s small, but it’s still here and that does matter,” Kelly said in an interview. “People need to stand up. That’s what I’m trying to do. It’s all I can do.”
The couple joined about 40 people gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge Saturday afternoon for a local No Kings protest.
The Selma protest was the second for some. Jasie Shepard and Dr. Justin Cavanaugh traveled to Selma after the Tuscaloosa No Kings protest ended Saturday morning, about a 90-minute drive.
Nate Bradley and his friends came to Selma after the Montgomery protest ended this morning. He said he is protesting because of President Donald Trump’s disregard of Congress’ power of the purse.

“Now we have a president who says, ‘I’m not going to fund Democrat programs.’ What does that mean?” Bradley said. “He wouldn’t be able to articulate a thought about that. It’s insulting.”
Bradley said the protests in Montgomery and Selma gave him hope.
“I call my representatives, I go to my townhalls,” Bradley said of what he does outside of the No Kings protests. “I just try to stay sane and find a balance between staying sane and keeping up to date with the nonstop deluge of things that this administration is doing or not doing.”
Annie Pearl Avery, a long-time civil rights activist, urged people to protest every day.
“It’s not going to be a lot of show and a lot of talk. There’s going to have to be some action,” Avery said. “You’ve got a purpose. Everyone has a purpose.”
Rev. Leodis Strong, lead pastor at Brown Chapel in Selma, criticized Republicans who claim to be Christian, but do not show it in policies.
“How can you call yourself pro-life when you did not give access to insurance to soon-to-be mothers and soon-to-be children outside the womb? How can you call yourself pro-life when you take away WIC and SNAP?” Strong asked. “That is a polluted religion.”
Jennifer Wright, who recently moved to Selma from Huntsville, criticized Congress for not releasing investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She urged people to write letters and call their representatives. She also wrote a thank you letter to U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, for his petition to release the files.

“Every member of Congress should have happily signed your petition because child sex trafficking should not be considered a partisan issue and should be considered a crime by everyone,” Massie read.
The petition was one vote short of the 218 it needed to pass in September.
Azali Fortier, 18, said the protest gave her a glimpse of hope.
“I know that they can see us because we can see each other,” Fortier said of the Trump administration and Congress. “We’re about to undergo a big change, either for better or for worse.”
The protest wrapped up with Yomi Goodall leading the group singing “America the Beautiful” and “We Shall Overcome,” a Civil Rights Movement anthem.

Dozens of No Kings protests took place across Ohio as part of more than 2,500 nationally. Organizers reported Saturday afternoon that nearly 7 million Americans attended the protests across the country.
“Today, millions of people showed that we, the people, will not be silenced,” said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union.
The events were sponsored by more than 100 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Common Cause, and Indivisible.
In Central Ohio, rallies will took place in communities such as Newark, Reynoldsburg, Marysville, and Grove City earlier Saturday afternoon.
Below is a photo gallery of the protest at the Ohio Statehouse.

(Photo by David Hansen/Rhode Island Current)The parking lot next to the Rhode Island State House is normally filled with lawmakers’ cars, but it was empty Saturday afternoon. 
What was full instead was the south side of the State House, where the lawn and marble steps — often places absent of pageantry, except for the occasional photo shoot during prom season — entertained a crowd of more than 30,000 people, according to the organizers of the No Kings protest.
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

The Providence protest is one of just under a dozen such rallies that took place in Rhode Island Saturday meant to protest President Donald Trump’s administration and its policies. 
“Even if some of these signs are not very Christian, all I see is love,” activist and event emcee Alisha Pina said as she looked out toward the crowd from the State House steps. “Sometimes you gotta tell it like it is.” 
Since the last round of No Kings protests on June 14, the number of local demonstrations has increased, and a new idiom has joined the visual grammar of anti-Trumpism: The inflatable animal suit. The trend originated earlier this month in Portland, Oregon, where a viral video of a man in a frog suit getting pepper sprayed by ICE agents only served to inflame, rather than cauterize, the goofy, fan-powered suits as a symbol of farcical resistance. 
There was a menagerie among the crowd in Providence on Saturday. One could find a bumblebee, a lobster, a monkey, two tyrannosauruses (one green, one blue), a shark, an eagle, a pink unicorn, a polar bear, a brown bear, a white unicorn, and two Rhode Island reds holding up a sign that read “RESIST.” A cow and chicken danced to Beyonce’s 2016 song “Freedom” as it played from a loudspeaker. Across the street, a group of friends assisted Snoopy in getting inflated. Even Squidward, SpongeBob’s irascible neighbor, found it in him to attend.

Beyond the diversity of species represented was a variety of people from all ages and backgrounds on the lawn Saturday. Three teenagers perched at the feet of Nathanael Greene, that most trusted general in George Washington’s army who, in statue form, continues to look over the capital from the base of the State House steps. The Democratic Socialists of America had set up an information booth underneath a tree’s shade. A woman who declined to be interviewed sported an outfit with Beanie Baby cats attached, and a sign that read “Cat ladies against Trump.”
Abigail Pimental, originally from Bristol, wore a “Beetlejuice”-inspired costume and held up a sign that said, “Say it three times: Epstein Files, Epstein Files, Epstein Files.”
“I just think that it’s important we hold all people accountable, no matter what side of the aisle they’re on,” Pimental said, and added about the protests in general, “It’s so meaningful that this is happening in New England, the birthplace of our whole democratic freedom.”
There were also a handful of State Police scattered across the lawn and steps, mostly young men who did not show any visible signs of discomfort despite being dressed in weighty, dark-colored uniforms and standing directly in the sun. The 60-degree heat made the day unseasonably warm for mid-October.

A portion of this crowd formed into a caravan that marched past the mall and into downtown Providence starting a little after 1 p.m. With State Police directing the stalled traffic as the marchers began to move, motorists sounded horns — mostly those waving signs from their vehicle windows as they headed for the demonstration themselves. They began to return around 2 p.m., after which the protest’s speaking portion began.
“Thank you for standing with our immigrant community,” Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat and contender for the capital city’s mayorship, said in his remarks to the crowd. “Thank you for standing with our immigrant neighbors. Together we’re going to demonstrate that Rhode Island is a home for everyone, especially our immigrant brothers, sisters, and non-binary friends.”
Morales was not the only state legislator or local elected official who could be seen in attendance. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, took a moment to chat after weaving her way through the crowd.  
“It’s so heartwarming to know that there are enough people around to care enough about their democracy, about our democracy, to come out and participate,” Tanzi said.
She was handing out stickers and American flags to protestors, and said it was “because we’ve got to take the flag back.”
“The symbolism is for all Americans, and not just for some,” Tanzi said.

“We can no longer view fellow Americans as the enemy,” said 19-year-old college student Django Grace at a rally in Brattleboro. “We need common ground.”

On Saturday morning, a small group of protestors mounted bikes in Barre for “The Rolling Resistance” — a march on wheels to join the main body of “No Kings” demonstrators at the Montpelier Statehouse. 
Barb Schwendtner of Barre Town, the event’s organizer, said her goal was to “combine (her) love of bikes with (her) love of democracy.”
The cyclists rolled into a second round of “No Kings” protests on Saturday, organized in part by the movement 50501, in opposition to the Trump administration’s targeting of immigrants, LGBTQ+ rights, public education, the government shutdown and more, according to the organization’s website. Thousands of Vermonters showed up to more than 40 such events that took place across the state on Saturday, in addition to at least one event organized by Republicans in Chester.
50501, a national movement that opposes “executive overreach” in the federal government, helped organize No Kings rallies nationwide. Indivisible, a national organization with Vermont chapters, was also involved in organizing events across the state.
The event was a reoccurrence of similarly-framed demonstrations against authoritarianism in June, which saw about 42,000 Vermonters take to the streets in protest of the Trump administration’s actions. Millions more attended across the nation.
As the crowd in Barre readied itself for departure, bicycles arrived with a wide, colorful variety of signage draped, taped and attached to their frames. Bruce Seel, a Barre City resident, arrived in an Elvis costume. (“A lot of people call him a king, right?” he said.) 
Seel said he was attending Saturday’s protests in response to “Trump, this administration, and his authoritarian regime.” In Montpelier, he joined one large chapter of a nationwide day of “No Kings” protests. 
At noon, stretching down the Statehouse steps and across the lawn, a crowd of Vermonters gathered with signs, drums and costumes demonstrating displeasure with President Donald Trump’s administration.
Geri Peterson, an event organizer and leader of 50501 Vermont, estimated the crowd on Saturday could have been in excess of 10,000 people.
She said the event was about “defending our democracy” in general, but that at this particular rally, “we were choosing to center trans rights, which in particular have come under attack.”

Several speakers Saturday afternoon addressed the issue of trans rights, as well as health care  and the broader role of government, among other issues. U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. were among the event’s speakers.
“This is about to be the largest political gathering in America’s history,” said Balint in her remarks. “You’re out here because you wanna change the direction of the country.” It was not clear by Saturday afternoon whether the nationwide event had broken records.
Welch’s speech focused in part on the federal government’s shutdown.
“We do not want folks who are working hard to lose health care for themselves and their families,” he said. “We need less Trump and more Vermont values in Washington.”
Protest songs, including Ana Hernández’s “Set It Right Again,” punctuated Saturday’s event.

Howard Russell, 71, said he came to Montpelier from Hinesburg for more reasons than even a large sign could contain. Trump, he said, is “out of control.”
“Congress isn’t doing their job,” he added, and pleaded for democratic leaders to “hold the line” on health care premiums during the government’s shutdown.
Dan Thorington, of Williamstown, held a sign bearing the words “Veterans against Trump.” Having served in the U.S. military himself, he said the president’s rhetoric around veterans, as well as a number of his administration’s policies, were deeply troubling.
“We’re at a crisis,” Thorington said. “This is all I can think of at the moment, is to protest.”
Larz Allen, of Jeffersonville, said he attended Saturday’s rally with the role of money and big business in politics at the forefront of his mind.
“Citizens United is the problem,” Allen said, referring to the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned previous regulations on the role of corporations in political campaign finance. “I believe that a common person should be able to run for office.”
Allen also expressed concern with the federal government’s recent plans to expand public surveillance for immigration enforcement, saying that the country was veering closer to a “police state.”
At the foot of the lawn, a tent bearing the words “Pancakes for the People” was dispensing freshly griddled pancakes for protestors. Poa Mutino, of Barre City, said the organization had begun giving out free pancakes in front of Montpelier’s city hall six years ago.
The project, Mutino said, is “about bringing people together who wouldn’t normally eat together.” The event’s focus on trans rights had been important for the organization’s involvement, he added.
In an interview after her remarks, Balint said that the climate of fear infusing politics in Washington and beyond is “why we have to be out here today.”
“It gives me incredible hope to see not just the sheer number of people, but the different age groups…and that people understand that all hope is not lost,” Balint said.
Burlington
Hundreds of residents across the Queen City showed up with placards, costumes and crowns in a show of solidarity and whimsy. Events in Burlington included a bike ride, a honk and wave and three separate marches to City Hall by 11:30 a.m. Protests also took place in neighboring South Burlington, Winooski and Williston.
Jasmine Lamb, an organizer with Queen City Indivisible, estimated about 10,000 people attended. She led them in songs and chants, while a brass band inserted beats and tunes at the foot of the City Hall steps in the park downtown.

Unlike the June events, there were no speeches planned “to recognize that all of us are leaders in this moment,” Lamb said. 
The crowd sang songs like “We Shall Overcome” and “This Land is Your Land.” They chanted “this is what democracy looks like” and “hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go.”
Many residents held up signs protesting the Trump administration’s crackdown on marginalized communities, calling for the restoration of civil rights and to uphold civility and democracy.
Heidi Smith from South Burlington sported a unicorn headgear and a pink T-shirt with the words “Goodness Exists.”
“I’m here to stand up against Donald Trump  with others who feel the same way – and to do it with joy and love,” she said. “I’m trying to make a difference. It’s time to stand up and speak out.”
Jean Bluto from Winooski said she had to join the protest because she is upset about the cutbacks in federal funding affecting everything from food stamps to hospitals.
“If we were all silent we would still be flying the British flag,” she said, in a reference to colonialism.
University of Vermont student Quyn McCafferty, 22, said she saw first-hand the erosion of rights under the first Trump presidency — from the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 to the policing of protests in cities across the country. All of it makes “an unsafe environment for everyone,” she said.
“We just think a lot of things that Donald Trump stands for are things people are in opposition of,” said her friend Josh Hunt, 22, a recent graduate of UVM, who is particularly upset about cuts to education and scientific research.
They two sat on a wall at the edge of the park as the people dispersed from the protest, which lasted about two hours. They held two small white placards marked with black and red lettering: “Make fascists afraid again” and “Trump is dumb & stupid.”
Attendee Chelsea Alsofrom grew up in the Queen City, but her family emigrated from Eastern Europe.

She said her ancestors echoed what the person in front of them in line at Ellis Island said. That’s how she wound up with the last name Alsofrom. 
“We’re all immigrants,” she said Saturday in City Hall Park. Her two children, also in attendance, wore Spiderman costumes. She held a handmade sign that read ‘Trump, Spiderman is coming for you!’
Susan Caloggero joined the South End march that made its way down Charlotte Street at 11:20 a.m. She walked with her friends holding a sign that read ‘Without due process, it’s kidnapping.’
She was marching “for America, to stand up for people’s basic rights, no matter what background, what race,” she said. 
“We have long been a country that welcomed everybody,” said Caloggero, who recently visited Ellis Island for the first time and felt sad about the attitude and crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration. 
In the North End, Scott Patrick donned a large brown inflatable squirrel costume and waved to people gathering at Roosevelt Park at 10:30 a.m., in a nod to the recent protests in Portland, Oregon where residents wore animal costumes to defy Trump’s description of the city as a “war zone.”
“I love people protesting this way,” he said, adding that he is fed up with the Trump administration vilifying protestors and calling them names when they are all “just regular people.”
A self-described introvert, Patrick said he hasn’t participated in a protest since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. He hoped to counteract a national climate of negativity and discord with tolerance and understanding by showing up to the march in a squirrel suit.
Later, in City Hall Park, he approached a pair dressed as yellow bananas, asking if they could point him to some acorns.
Brattleboro
In Brattleboro, several thousand people gathered at the Common to hear speeches by state officeholders who included local Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Vermont Treasurer Mike Pieciak, who encouraged his hometown to contribute to a new $1 million Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to help asylum seekers and people facing deportation or detention.
“In this moment,” Pieciak said, “we need all of our elected leaders to stand up and clearly say what is right and what is wrong.”

The Brattleboro crowd saved its loudest applause for 19-year-old college student Django Grace, who called for everyone to unite regardless of political differences.
“So many of us have horrible disagreements with the ways that so many people think in this country and in this state and in this community,” Grace said. “We must end this internal war. We can no longer view fellow Americans as the enemy. We need common ground.”

During a speech delivered on the Idaho State Capitol steps, American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho board member Sam Linnet spoke out against what he said is a government that is using fear to divide the American people. 
Linnet called for transforming the political and economic systems of America and rejecting a system where he said billionaires buy elections and corporations write laws. Instead, Linnet called on the crowd to unite, hold the government accountable and support immigrants, women and trans people. 
“Everyone here proves democracy still has a pulse,” Linnet said. 
 Idahoans share why they participated in the No Kings rally in Boise

For Boisean Cyndee Pierce, Saturday’s No Kings rally was her first protest. She carried a homemade sign that read, “I’m not a paid protestor I hate facism for free.” 
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

In an interview at the protest, Pierce said she chose to attend because she wanted to channel the anxiousness she is feeling about the government into something positive.
“I am extremely disappointed in our leaders,” Pierce said. “I am hoping against hope our leaders will try to represent all of us.”
Pierce said she was impressed by the large crowd, which covered the steps of the Idaho State Capitol, filled much of Jefferson Street  between Sixth and Eighth streets and took over much of nearby Cecil D. Andrus Park.
“In very red Idaho, having a crowd of any more than two people is encouraging,” Pierce said with a smile as she gestured toward the large crowd. 
Millie Watkins of Boise said Saturday’s No Kings protest at the Idaho State Capitol marked her fifth such recent protest. She said Saturday’s crowd was the largest she has ever seen. 
Watkins carried a handmade sign calling on the U.S. Congress to do its job.  
“I think (the size of the crowd) says that there are a lot of people in this country who disagree with what is going on,” Watkins said.

Saturday’s Boise No Kings protest coincided with hundreds of other No Kings protests held in cities across the country, States Newsroom reported.  
The Boise No Kings protest was organized by several groups including Idaho 50501, Indivisible and the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho. Idaho 50501 is part of the wider 50501 movement, which originally got its name from 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. 
Saturday’s No Kings protests was the second large-scale No Kings protest in recent months in Boise. In June, thousands of people protested in front of the Idaho State Capitol during an earlier No Kings protest. 
“Our Founding Fathers rejected the idea of a monarchy for a reason,” Idaho 50501 spokesperson Sonya Christensen said in a written statement before the protest. “We say ‘No Kings’ because we believe in America’s founding principles. We are appalled at how our current Idaho representatives are abandoning those principles, and we are here to stand up for the Constitution of the United States of America.”

Demonstrators gathered Tuesday on what would have been Charlie Kirk’s birthday
Saturday’s No Kings protest wasn’t the only rally at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise this week.
On Tuesday, another group of demonstrators gathered at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise to honor conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on what would have been his 32nd birthday.
Organizers of the event, dubbed the God’s Country March, said the gathering would be the inaugural march and that they hope to hold an event in Kirk’s honor each year. 
Kirk was shot and killed while speaking Sept. 10 at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University in Orem.
“We are here for multiple reasons, God glorifying reasons, to be united as a singular people under one confession of Christ and Him crucified,” said Pastor Mike Lewis. “But also to remember the life of Charlie Kirk whose birthday it would be. We must remember where we are and remember who we are.”
Just hours before the Tuesday gathering, U.S. President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest honor for a civilian, at a ceremony at the White House.
Organizers and supporters of the march included the Old State Saloon, Idaho Liberty Dogs, Soldiers of the Cross, Turning Point USA and the Idaho Freedom Foundation.

Kirk was born Oct. 14, 1993, and the gathering was planned to honor Kirk’s birthday.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Organizers and politicians urged the crowd of more than 1,000, gathered Saturday at the Iowa State Capitol as part of the national No Kings protest, to stay engaged and help flip Iowa seats in the 2026 election.
The Des Moines event was one of more than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations planned nationwide, with millions of participants protesting Trump administration actions on issues from cutting funding for public health programs, deploying National Guard troops to cities and mass deportations. It was the second No Kings national protest – the first was held in June in response to Donald Trump’s birthday military parade.
At the event, state lawmakers, union organizers, immigrant advocates and teachers decried Trump’s and Republicans’ policies. Speakers also emphasized Iowa will play a vital role in putting a check on Trump’s power in the 2026 election, and encouraged Iowans to vote and stay politically engaged.

Mike Draper, founder and owner of Raygun, a liberal-leaning shirt and souvenir business headquartered in Des Moines, told the crowd he invited U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn to a town hall Friday, but held up an empty chair with the sign with the sign “Representative Nunn” to show the Iowa 3rd District representative’s response. He criticized Nunn for not holding public town halls and said the Republican “doesn’t work for us,” but for Trump’s agenda.
He told the crowd that if Democrats win three seats in the U.S. House, there will be an effective “check on Trump’s power.”
“And as fate would have it, there are three competitive races in Iowa right now,” Draper said. “If we flip those three seats — all of which have been Democratic at some point in the last decade — Iowa alone will win the House of Representatives.”
In addition to the 3rd District, which is expected to be competitive, the congressional races for Iowa’s 1st and 2nd Districts are also expected to be more competitive than in previous election cycles. All four of Iowa’s congressional seats are currently held by Republicans.
While larger political topics like the federal government shutdown and release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein came up, some speakers said Trump’s trade policies have hurt Iowa in a unique way. Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union and a farmer from Polk County, said Trump’s tariffs and recent federal trade policies have hurt Iowa farmers, pointing to China’s move to buy soybeans from South American producers instead of American farmers.

“I’m telling you, thousands and thousands of Iowa farmers are on the brink of a crisis,” he said. “Chaotic tariffs have devastated the markets for what we grow, and they have raised the cost of our inputs, and they have gotten us no closer to fair trade for farmers and workers.”
Elena Casillas-Hoffman, a communications specialist with Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, said Trump’s immigration policies are also negatively impacting Iowa. She said the only population growth Iowa has seen in recent years is because of immigrants and refugees, who are “revitalizing our communities.”
Members of these Iowa communities are now being detained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, Casillas-Hoffman said. ICE has had a presence in Iowa for years, she said, but since Trump took office, immigration authorities’ tactics have changed, with more individuals being detained and arrested.
“We know that ICE is in six county jails.” Casillas-Hoffman said. “… We know that children are scared to go to school, to leave their homes. People are afraid to be a part of our community if they do not have their paperwork on them at all times. Our communities are beyond terrified, and we should not accept these conditions.”

Some speakers also hit on more local issues, like the campaign to form a nurses’ union at UnityPoint hospitals in Des Moines. One of the nurses involved in the organizing effort, Gail Grimes, spoke about the effort to form a union through Teamsters Local 90 – and how the scheduled unionization vote in early October was delayed indefinitely due to the federal shutdown.
“We will stay strong, and we will stay resolute that the nurses of Des Moines will respond with a resounding ‘yes’ when asked the most important of questions when the federal government reopens and a new election date set,” she said.
Grimes asked for protesters to support the unionization effort, linking it with the larger movement to support health care access and working Iowans.
“The only way the working class can win against the tyrannical shift happening in our beloved nation is through numbers and through our solidarity,” Grimes said.
Protesters came to the event dressed in costumes parodying Trump and other historical figures, carrying American and Palestinian flags, and holding up signs calling for political action.
Toby Kalage, a 19-year-old, carried a sign stating, “I am not the enemy, they are.” Kalage said that as a queer person of color, who recently exited the foster care system, they have been targeted by GOP policies.

Kalage said the protest made them feeling hopeful for Democrats chances in Iowa and nationwide in 2026 and future years.
“I came down because I wanted to be another person who was here, and having that effort made,” Kalage said. “And that adds up, for everyone who showed up here … It’s the same for voting.”
Georgia Rains Traviss, an Urbandale resident, said she was happy to have celebrated her 66th birthday at the No Kings event. She said it was important to have spaces where people can voice their disagreements and opinions without attacking others or engaging in violence.
Rains Traviss also said the event went smoothly as there were not altercations with police, military members or ICE agents, who have been present at some earlier protests in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago.
“I had some friends that were like, ‘Oh, aren’t you worried about (your safety) going down there? Aren’t you scared?'” she said. “But that’s what they want. They’ve been building up fear, they don’t want us to feel like we can come out here. I said, ‘You know, if you’re afraid, that’s what they want.’ … The worst thing you could ever do, is not go, because that’s what they want.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, told a crowd in Hartford that he would continue to “stand up for health care” and that Democrats would not “back down” and be “intimidated” or “bullied” by Republicans. 
U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, condemned the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Connecticut towns. 
“We do not consent to pulling mothers from their children in Newington and in Southington. We stood up and fight against them, because we’re Americans. Because this is the nation that we love,” Larson told the crowd in Hartford.

Immigration detentions and deportations have spiked since Trump took office in January. The administration has paused funding for refugee resettlement programs, and Trump has also expanded the number of immigrant detention centers across the U.S. 
The number of immigrants in the U.S. declined by 1.2 million between January and September of this year. In Connecticut, where ICE arrests have more than doubled from January through July of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, there have been reports of immigrants being detained at courthouses and car washes.
The “No Kings” protests, organized by a coalition of primarily liberal groups including the 50501 Movement, Indivisible and the ACLU, were set to take place in about 40 towns across Connecticut. These demonstrations follow similar “No Kings” protests in June, which drew thousands of protestors in response to a military parade organized in Washington D.C. 
According to the No Kings website, the protests are motivated by the increased actions from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport immigrants with irregular status, cuts to healthcare and education spending, the rolling back of environmental regulations and voting redistricting in states like Texas that are meant to favor Republican lawmakers and candidates.  
“The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don’t have kings and we won’t back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty,” the website reads.  
In New Haven, protestors filled the New Haven Green, carrying signs, wearing costumes and waving American flags.
Gayathri Vijayakumar, 46, said she works for a sustainability company, and says climate change is the biggest issue that drew her to protest.
“For me, it’s all about the sustainability of our environment. He set us so far back by slashing the budget that Biden had put in place,” she said. “It was going to be phenomenal, phenomenal for the efficiency of buildings. We’re so far behind as it is, this is undoing decades of progress.”
But it’s not her only concern.
“I ride the train with my passport now,” she said.
On the outskirts of the green, a group of women with umbrellas painted with words like “No Kings” and “Persist, Resist, Insist” stood in a line. Tina Santoni, 67, said she started workshops for women, teaching them to paint the umbrellas. They’ve grown to about 40 people in total.
“ I had one at the last No Kings March. But after that I started getting, making, creating workshops for people to come and make them. We’re all women,” she said, adding that a few weeks ago, she’d led a group of the women on a walk in downtown New Haven.
“We walk in silence. We let our umbrellas speak for us. We try to put messages on our umbrellas that we really feel strongly about,” she said.
26-year-old Maisy Crews said that as a healthcare provider, she was concerned about the inability to provide healthcare for her patients, particularly as someone who works in addiction medicine.
Several people also talked about the division within the country,
“ Most people are using really controversial issues as a place to divide us, like trans issues and abortion and things like that,” said Victoria Atkin-Dahm, a Guilford resident and student at Southern Connecticut State University. “Their main goal is to divide us so that they can control us, in my opinion. And I think this is the time that we all need to gather and be together like this.
31-year-old Sam Meskill said his biggest concern was ICE detaining immigrants.
“Watching the videos on that is really disturbing,” he said.
77-year-old Carmen Mahone of Branford said she disliked the anger and hatred that she saw, and the way that Trump treated those around him, referring to him as a “lunatic.” She also talked about the need for affordable health care.
“I’m retired and I got a pension plus Medicare. So I’m gifted, but the people that don’t — it’s unconscionable to see people just lose their lives because they can’t get a certain drug anymore,” she said.
75-year-old Susan White of Southbury said she was concerned about benefits for retired people.
“We worked our whole lives so that we’d be safe at this point through Medicare and social security. And if he screws with that, there’s going to be a revolt of old people. And really, what do we have to lose at this point for standing up? Nothing.
State lawmakers Martin Looney and Gary Winfield, both New Haven Democrats, told the crowd that the state legislature needed to step up in light of the federal government’s actions. Looney said he wanted the state legislature to do more to address federal actions.
He said he wanted to see a law passed that would prohibit ICE agents in Connecticut from wearing masks and require them to have body cameras. He said the General assembly planned to return to the Capitol in November to try and use state dollars to fill in places that the federal government had made cuts.
“I’m committed that we will maximize that to the extent we can,” said Looney.

Similar scenes played out across Connecticut. 
In Westport, crowds gathered around Jesup Green and the Westport Library.
“We’re here for humanity, for our decency, and for Mother Earth,” said Maureen Maloney of Fairfield. “We’ve got to take care of her.”
“My passion started back during the Vietnam protests, and I’ve just kept going,” said Donna Kraisman. “It comes from loving our country. That’s where my passion comes from.”
Maloney, an immigrant from Ireland, said her motivation comes from seeing the country change over the years.
“I immigrated here 32 years ago,” she said. “I chose to come to America because of opportunity. I’ve worked hard all my life, but those chances are disappearing. That’s why I’m here.”

“I’m here because I believe in the principle. This is democracy,” said Bernard Perry, a 95-year-old Westport resident. “That’s what I was brought into when I was born.”
He said the health of democracy depends on those in power.
“It’s all about leadership and how that leadership views the Constitution,” Perry said. “Right now, the leadership has really thrown out the Constitution. That’s why we’re in this mess.”
David Brigg Jr. of Bridgeport said he has deep concerns about the state of the country and is particularly critical of the Supreme Court.
“With the Supreme Court backing Trump and giving him full immunity, he could do anything he wants,” he said.
But Brigg said he still encourages civic engagement, emphasizing the importance of voting and political participation.

Michael Greenberg, a 78-year-old Westport resident who said he once met Martin Luther King Jr., emphasized the importance of speaking up against threats to democracy. 
But, he said, the younger generations can drive meaningful change and continue the fight for justice.
“It’s the young ones,” he said. “They’re holding the torch, and they’re the future, and that’s what we’re fighting for.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1018_SR_NoKings_066-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 17:02:53.464059

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Floridians massed throughout the state Saturday for the second national No Kings day demonstrations against the increasingly authoritarian second Trump administration, marked as it is by aggressive immigration enforcement and prosecutions of the president’s enemies.
Events has been planned in nearly 100 Florida cities and towns, according to organizers.
In Miami, an estimated 5,000 people clad in American flags, golden crowns, and frog and Sasquatch costumes flooded Bayfront Park to chant against Trump.
The event, which saw thousands of global demonstrations, drew Miamians of every age. It was held in front of the Torch of Friendship, a 1960 monument built as a beacon to welcome immigrants.
One disruption hit the Miami gathering when Barry Ramey and another member of the white nationalist group the Proud Boys briefly showed up to counter-protest. Ramey was one of the men sentenced for rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. City police quickly formed an escort to safely lead them out, as angry anti-Trump protesters screamed Spanish expletives at them. 
In Tallahassee, a lively crowd packed the lawn in front of the Old Capitol and both sides of Monroe Street, waving signs at passing cars; many of their drivers honked their horns in solidarity. 
A crowd estimated to be several thousand strong gathered along the four street corners in the Tyrone Square area of St. Petersburg. A Pinellas County teacher who wanted to be identified only by her first name of Marissa wore a cape of the American flag.
“I’m pretty worried that we’re losing our democracy, and I think we’re losing our way as Americans,” she said. 










I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.


“I feel like the actions that the Trump administration is taking doesn’t represent our country or what our founders had as a vision for our country. And so I’m here today because of that. I love my country. I’m wearing a flag today because I want us to take back flags. I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.”
Approximately 2,000 gathered in Gainesville on the same day as University of Florida’s homecoming football game. They listened to poems, songs, and calls to action. A Phoenix reporter noticed no counter-protesters or any police.
In Sopchoppy, a small Wakulla County town 35 miles south of Tallahassee, a rally attracted around 30 people.The county is solidly Republican, with Trump winning nearly 72% of the vote in 2024. Gov. Ron DeSantis took 73% of the vote during his 2022 re-election bid.
Despite a small crowd, there was a heavy county sheriff’s presence — at least seven deputies to oversee the demonstrators and no more than 10 counterprotestors.
The protests took place as the federal government shutdown is now in its third week. The dispute revolves around Democrats pushing Republicans to reinstate the enhanced premium tax subsidies for those on the Affordable Care Act scheduled to expire at the end of this year. 
“When Marjorie Taylor Greene starts becoming progressive, we know the GOP has screwed up,” said St. Petersburg resident Gregory Mann, referring to the Georgia Republican’s comments last week that she would go “against everyone on this issue” because the premium hikes would harm “my own adult children” and her constituents in northwest Georgia.

Hitler, Castro
Back in Miami, complaints ranged from mild criticisms of Trump to outright comparisons to Adolf Hitler and Fidel Castro, the long-reigning Cuban dictator whose revolution forced an exodus of millions of Cubans over decades to leave the island nation.
Many ended up in Miami. One is Jorge Cardelle, a 67-year-old Cuban-born U.S. veteran who served four years in the Navy and 16 in the Army.
“I’m here to protest how our government is being run. The abuses, the corruption — I was born in Cuba, and my parents left because of the corruption. What happened there is what’s happening here,” said Cardelle, wrapped in an American flag in front of a towering Ponce De Leon statue.
Other protesters who spoke to the Phoenix included a University of Miami law professor dressed as a frog, a grocer adorned in that Sasquatch costume, a 25-year-old artist, two retired nurses, the president of the University of Miami’s UDems, and a mayoral candidate running as a socialist. 
Their beliefs ran along the same lines. 
“He’s breaking my heart,” said Caroline Mala Corbin, the 57-year-old constitutional law professor at the nearby University of Miami.

“This is Hitler!” said Karen, a 72-year-old retired nurse. A Cuban-born Gen Z artist named Gamal echoed this in a portrait he hastily made the night before. Titled “Ice King,” it depicts a frozen Trump wearing a golden crown, with the Nazi SS symbol to his left.
“I wanted to make sure that the ice kind of resembles the SS symbol from the Nazis because we think he has kind of the same movement, going with the way that it’s going too far to the right,” the 25-year-old said. 
Music played throughout from a booming speaker at the feet of the ever-burning Torch of Friendship, where many danced, sang, chanted, and even played guitar.

‘It feels like you’re not alone’
One attendee in St. Pete was Pinellas Park resident Rachel Parker, a U.S. Army Veteran who says she’s working without pay as a veterans services representative at the VA because of the shutdown. She was dismissive of Republican contentions that protesters are anti-American.
“All of these Republican leaders like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune coming out and saying ‘This is a protest of hate,’” she said. “It’s not a protest of hate. We are just utilizing our First Amendment rights to talk about the things that we have no control over. If Congress wants to abdicate all of its responsibilities right now, then we’re going to have to do it for them.”
A Pinellas County teacher who wanted to be identified only by her first name, Marissa, wore a cape of the American flag.
“I’m pretty worried that we’re losing our democracy, and I think we’re losing our way as Americans,” she said. “I feel like the actions that the Trump administration is taking doesn’t represent our country or what our founders had as a vision for our country. And so I’m here today because of that. I love my country. I’m wearing a flag today because I want us to take back flags. I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.”
Kay, a Jacksonville teacher who didn’t want to disclose her last name, was delighted to be among so many fellow Floridians speaking out against the Trump agenda.
“It feels like you’re not alone,” she said. “Because in the neighborhood that I live in, I feel like I’m a minority. And I feel like I can’t be openly against Trump and the administration. But being here makes me feel a lot more comfortable. And I feel like I have a community where there is still hope.”

‘Very excited, peaceful crowd’
In Gainesville, William Marquardt, a retired archaeologist, said he was reusing his sign from the first No Kings day protests. “I hope it will be obsolete one day.” But, he added, “probably not in my lifetime.”
“This turnout is going to be bigger today across the country. Not just Washington or Chicago, but every place, small towns. I think people are finally realizing, if you don’t stand up and say something, you’ve lost your chance,” Marquardt told the Phoenix. 
Signs at the event at Gainesville’s Cora Roberson Park pointed out Trump’s association with Jeffrey Epstein, condemned fascism, advocated for protecting democracy, and of course, displeasure with Trump and his administration.
Various organizations used the event to provide outreach, such as the Alachua Democrats, the Sierra Club, Badass Feminists of Gainesville, and Gainesville Women for Democracy.
No Kings in north Florida
In Tallahassee, compared to the last No Kings rally in June, this one was “twice the size, said Ellen Davis, attending with a friend who identified herself as Sharon Z. (Police estimated the earlier turnout at 2,000 people – organizers claimed 5,000.)

They sat in lawn chairs with an American flag, flying upside down to signal distress, upon which was written, “The Power of the People is > Than the People in Power.”
Susan Amore, wearing a vest identifying herself as an ACLU legal monitor, described the vibe as “a very excited, peaceful crowd.”
“Make Orwell and Atwell fiction again,” one sign read. Overheard in passing: “My dog’s an idiot. She’s also smarter than Trump.”
No obvious police presence was apparent.
On the other hand, No Kings Sopchoppy event organizer Robert Seidler had reached out to the sheriff’s office after some inflammatory comments were posted about it on a Facebook page. But there were no altercations throughout the three-hour event, which featured protest songs on the banjo, including “This Land is Your Land.” 
 Lt. Will Hudson of the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Seidler’s comments. “And we actually took a proactive approach to it, as well. And just anything that’s going to happen in Wakulla, the sheriff’s office is going to make sure that the safety and security of the people at the event, that it’s taken care of.”
Sue Wallrich told the Florida Phoenix, “I know my neighbors. I’ve lived here for a long time. We all agree behind closed doors. But then, the second, you know, you gotta flash something on Facebook and our algorithms blow up. I think it’s really screwing us all over; like, we are more alike than we think.”
Counter-protester “Wolf” wasn’t aware of the flare-up on social media; he said he heard about the gathering at church and decided to attend. He grabbed his Make America Great Again hat before he left the house, he acknowledged, to “attract some attention.”
“To me it’s dumb because we don’t have kings. They are misguided people. They probably mean well. Most of them mean well, but they are misguided. I came here to say a couple of prayers.”

Marchers chanted a variety of messages as they made their way across the Plaza, including: “No Kings/No ICE” and “This is what democracy looks like.” One man played the David Bowie/Queen song “Under Pressure” repeatedly from a small speaker.

Organizers for Indivisible Santa Fe, one of thousands of chapters formed nationally to oppose President Donald Trump during his first term, estimated that twice as many people showed up Saturday as did in June for the first No Kings protest. They said it shows momentum building against Trump and what they called his authoritarian administration. 
“They work for us, and they need to listen to us,” said Indivisible organizer David Bazell in a brief speech to hundreds gathered. “Our power is much stronger than anybody in this administration.”

The protest featured dozens of people in inflatable costumes—sharks, bees, unicorns, aliens and more—in solidarity to common protest attire Portland protesters have been wearing in demonstrations against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to tamp down on “antifa militants” there. 
“We’re wearing inflatable costumes because we want to support and enhance  what’s happening in Portland and I’m sure everywhere,” Breece Robertson told Source. “We want to just show that we are peaceful, we are loving and we really care about our democracies, so we’re not a threat. We are standing up for our rights in this country.”

In Santa Fe, many protesters embraced the “anti-fascist” label in signs and chants. “My dad was Antifa in WWII. I am Antifa now” one sign read. Sharon Argenbright, a nurse for 40 years, drew laughs when she introduced herself to the crowd with a curtsy and said, “Hi. This is Antifa, also known as Sharon.”

Chris and Sallee Wiseman, also of Santa Fe, donned king and queen costumes. They said Trump’s assault on democracy in numerous forms, along with his seeming indifference to the struggles of working people, compelled them to join thousands of their neighbors Saturday in front of the Roundhouse. 
“I absolutely oppose 99.9% of his policies,” Chris told Source New Mexico, listing off Trump’s mass deportation push, the rising cost of food and health insurance, threats to health care for millions of Americans and Trump’s “re-vengeance” campaign against political enemies.

“We just can’t stand what’s happening,” Sallee added as she and her husband took shade under a tree in the Roundhouse courtyard. 
Former Santa Fe City Councilor Ron Trujillo, currently a candidate in the city’s upcoming mayoral election, said he was heartened to see the thousands of people who turned out for the protest.
“People need to come out, stand up for what they believe is right,” Trujillo told Source NM. “This federal government that’s that’s telling us what they they think is best for us, this isn’t the America we live in.  It’s about the democracy.”

As they have previously, members of Danza Tonantzin de Analco showed up to perform a ceremonial blessing for the event, and were accompanied by Kathy Wan Povi Sanchez (San Ildefonso Pueblo), one of the founders of Tewa Women United.

“It was very, very humbling and honoring for me to be here to acknowledge our ancestors and the connectivity between all the people that are here,” Sanchez told Source. “Because they’re coming from all four directions, like the blessing for the directions calling into energy and the spirit. And we are all energy beings of caring and within us our love, the multi-versal infinity of loving, caring, sharing. So it was important for me to convey my gratitude for each and everyone that is here, young and old and first-timers. Just knowing that we don’t have to carry the anger or the grief and that we can heal immediately from all those that have been put here to keep us oppressed. Breaking the silence, it is very, very empowering for all people here to continue to be blessed in that way.”
Zoey Craft from Youth United for Climate Crisis Action, spoke to the crowd from a stage at the Roundhouse, and urged attendees to take even more action.

“What we’re witnessing isn’t the system breaking or democracy dying,” Craft said. “It’s the illusion fading. It’s an empire built on stolen land and labor extraction and white supremacy revealing itself for what it’s always been. And if that’s what we’re up against, then it’s not enough to just be outraged. We have to be organized, because young people and frontline communities don’t need more allies in name. We need co-conspirators in action.”
In Albuquerque, more than 5,000 people took to the streets in a march that nearly encircled the city’s downtown core.
Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) were among the attendees.
Keller said the city continues to oppose the Trump Administration, telling Source NM that Albuquerque is committed to being “a family-friendly city that fights for immigrant rights.”

“Most recently, we’re working with Chicago and Portland on the legal side to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to be ready and prepared should the [national guard] show up here,” he said. 
Martínez, holding a “No kings, no crowns, we don’t kneel down,” sign, told Source NM that the march “filled his heart,” and was energizing democracy. “The cruelty of the federal government, what they’re seeking to do is to strip us of our humanity, of our compassion, of our sense of ownership of this process and system,” he said.

A menagerie of inflatable costumes also speckled the Albuquerque protest, as people carried signs with slogans such as “Democracy Dies in Silence,” “Only you can prevent fascism” alongside Smokey Bear’s image and “No Trump, No ICE, No Troops.” 
“The best approach to undercutting tyranny is satire and mockery,”’ Paul Szauter, 70, bedecked as an inflatable chicken, told Source NM Saturday morning, after clucking like a chicken.

Szauter said he felt the need to march because he is a “first-generation American and birthright citizen,” and said he needed to protest the administration’s immigration policies, which he called “cruel.” 
Lily Jensen, 27, and her mother, Amberlyn Lopez, 46, said the event was their first-ever participation in a protest or march, saying that while they previously volunteered with their communities, or called elected officials, they felt compelled to do more. 
“It just felt like everything I was doing wasn’t enough,” Jensen, a health care educator, told Source NM. “I need other states to see that everyone here has the same message: We don’t accept a king.”
Lopez added that she’s concerned about a slide into autocracy, saying: “It’s important that we use our voice, while we still can.” 
James Bourguet, 22, was one of the younger participants in a crowd that skewed older. When asked for his reasons for protesting, Bourguet responded “there weren’t enough words.”
“It’s a Watergate everyday, and these are the people that actually want to do something about it,” he said, gesturing to the crowd.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Exactly 250 years to the day after the British attacked what is now Portland, Maine, during the Revolutionary War, thousands gathered in the city and across the state to declare the same thing Americans had been fighting for then: no kings. 
This was the overarching rallying cry of the more than 30 demonstrations across the state and more than 2,600 across the country known as No Kings day in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”   
Saturday marked the second nationwide protest organized under this name. The first, on June 14, coincided with President Donald Trump’s massive military parade on his 79th birthday. This time the demonstrations occurred against the backdrop of a federal government shutdown with no end in sight and as Trump threatens to deploy more federal troops on American cities. 
In Portland, participation nearly doubled, with 3,000 turning out in April and nearly 6,000 on Saturday. New attendees said they decided to show up because they feel the country has reached an untenable state, but speeches at the protests showed continued hope for change.   
Wearing a t-shirt that read “Facism is bad -history,” Katya Fromuth, a high school senior from Yarmouth, told the crowd gathered in Portland’s Deering Oaks Park that she started a youth organizing effort yesterday from her kitchen.
It’s called the Franklin Project, named after Ben Franklin’s reply when asked if the country was a republic or a monarchy: “A democracy — if you can keep it.”

What Mainers are saying 
Many participants said this type of demonstration was important to help them not feel alone in their fear and anger. 
“I think protesting is one very important part of that resistance because it’s visible,” said Madeline Jones of Portland, “and because so much of what Trump is doing to us feels so isolating.” 
Others said this form of political action is helpful — even to those who don’t attend. 
Erin Houghton of Cumberland, 48, and her daughter Penny Houghton, 15, attended the Portland protest together.
“I think we have a lot of privilege, which makes it even more important that we stand up and stand out publicly for other people who may not be able to,” Erin Houghton said, “and that includes people with disabilities, for whom there are major barriers to standing up at a protest, literally and figuratively, as well as people who could be taken [by immigration authorities].” 
Linda Davis, who was visiting Portland from Boston, said attending a protest is a relatively easy, low-lift effort, “but then it gives other people who are maybe more willing to do the scary things,” such as higher education institutions refusing to comply with executive overreach, “it gives them that that support to do that.” 
Many had concerns about the future of education.
Holding an American flag and wearing a shirt that read “protect banned books,” Dawnelle Sullivan, who traveled from Monmouth for Portland’s protest, works in special education and is concerned about the Trump administration’s attempt to gut the special education office. “I need to protect those kids,” she said.
Ann Weber of Portland, sporting a Columbia University hat and Harvard sweatshirt, said she’s concerned about the future of higher education. 
Her youngest son attends Harvard and her older son attends Columbia, both institutions Trump has battled. And her other son works as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, awaiting federal funding for cancer research, which overall has seen cuts under the Trump administration. 
Her husband Bill Weber, who worked as an environmental engineer for 43 years, is part of a group trying to establish a climate action plan in Portland. He said, “I’m afraid municipal leaders will use Trump as an excuse to not do anything.”
An anti-ICE message
The Trump administration’s immigration policies were a focus for many at the first No Kings day in June and again on Saturday, as sweeping and aggressive immigration raids continue. 
Vanessa, who declined to share her last name, is a teacher at Portland High School. She was brought to tears when explaining how she and her colleagues have had to think about how to protect their students if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ever enter their school. In September, a parent was detained by ICE after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
As participants and speakers in Portland raised alarm about ICE raids, others gathered in Wells outside the town’s police station for a recurring protest of their local authorities’ agreement with federal immigration officials.

“I am hopeful that the many standouts in small towns and larger cities will show that there is strong resistance across Maine and across the country to the current policies of the current administration,” said Peg Duddy, who attended the protest in Wells and is a part of the core group that’s been calling for an end to the contract. “We are standing together to help save our democracy.” 
Wells Police Department remains the only agency in the state to enter an agreement under the 287(g) program, which permits local officers to arrest people on immigration violations, an authority otherwise reserved for federal agents. The department is continuing what Police Chief JoAnn Putnam has described as a “wait-and-see approach” to credentialing its officers under the program in light of the pending state legislation that would ban such agreements. 
In Bangor, where roughly 2,000 people gathered Saturday, state Rep. Amy Roeder called on Gov. Janet Mills to sign that legislation and urged all Mainers to not accept the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the status quo. 
“Don’t sleep while democracy dies,” Roeder said.
 Local and national candidates stand out

Speaking in Portland, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chelli Pingree of Maine condemned recent comments made by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, who said No Kings day was a “hate America rally.”  
Pingree told the crowd they’re doing the most American of things: protesting the government. 
She encouraged continued protesting but said only Congress, by taking back the power of the purse, can stop the illegal actions of the president. 
“In November 2026,” Pingree said, “we need a brand new Congress.”
The demonstration in Portland featured speeches from numerous candidates for local and federal offices, including several Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate — David Costello, Jordan Wood, Tucker Favreau — who showed a united front in saying they’re running to stop Trump’s assault on democracy, though each pitching themselves as the best fit for the job.  
Gubernatorial candidates also took the stage, including Hannah Pingree, daughter of Chelli Pingree. She said, “Governors are really leading the way.”
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a candidate for governor, spoke about when she removed Trump from the ballot in 2023 after a citizen challenged his candidacy under the U.S. Constitution because of his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. 
“Doing the right thing even when it is hard is what we must do,” Bellows said, “and this is the secret of righteous resistance.” 
More recently, Bellows twice refused to share sensitive voter information with the Trump administration and was sued over it. 
“What I’ve learned unfortunately over the years is that lack of courage is contagious,” Bellows said. “Someone makes a decision based on fear, they get rewarded for it. Another person or institution catches the disease. But here’s another secret: courage is contagious.” 
The two statewide referendums were also highlighted in speeches, with proponents calling for attendees to vote yes on Question 2 (to create a red flag law) and opponents of Question 1 (which seeks to make changes to election procedures) urging people to vote no.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A thick sea of Hoosiers flooded the Indiana Statehouse’s lawn for hours on Saturday — raising defiant fists and signs as they protested President Donald Trump’s administration.
It was one of about 40 No Kings demonstrations around the state, and one of 2,600 scheduled around the country that organizers said drew millions collectively. The Indianapolis crowd was several thousand and organizers in Fort Wayne said 8,000 attended.
Protesters are “not subjects” or “pawns,” but are citizens and voters, said Danielle Drake, advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.
“We gather not in despair, but in defiance,” she said. “… knowing that together, we can and will hold this unkempt power accountable! We will hold the line.”
Story continues below.































































































Several speakers denounced the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
“We cannot let anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies tear apart the two fabric of our nation, because who are we? We are a nation of immigrants!” shouted the Rev. Felipe Martinez of Columbus Community United Church.
Others targeted Indiana Gov. Mike Braun — along with Republican supermajorities in the state’s House and Senate — who are considering redrawing congressional maps early.
“We might be called back into special session, and if they do (that), I hope that we translate our feelings, our energy, our emotions in action,” called Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis.
He pushed the crowd to call their lawmakers.
“If they cheat and they succeed, what does that mean to you and to Hoosiers across Indiana? It means that they will cement their agenda of cutting Medicaid, of cutting funding for (child care assistance), of shifting wealth and helping with tax cuts for the most ultra-wealthy in our nation,” Qaddoura added, unleashing a chorus of booing from the crowd.
Some critiqued Braun’s overhaul of Indiana University’s board of trustees, the university’s tussle with its own student newspaper, statewide degree program cuts and a crackdown on outspoken state and public education staffers.
Suzanne Swierc, a Ball State University employee who lost her job after she posted about the late conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, emphasized the importance of free speech.

Swierc, who is suing her former employer, said she encountered social media comments saying that freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom from consequences.
“What happened to me has happened and is happening to so many others,” Swierc told the crowd. “There are so many people across our state and our country who are hesitant to speak up, whose speech is being chilled, and that is not okay.
“We should be able to freely express ourselves. We should be able to point out injustices against ourselves and our neighbors. We should be able to advocate for the good of others, and we should be able to do all of this without the government affecting what we can and cannot say,” she added.
Protesters at the Statehouse’s southern steps repeatedly clashed with a Trump supporter wearing a red “Make America Great Again” cap and toting a 2024 campaign sign — even as demonstrators warned each other not to engage with him.
After a shouting match with a blue-vested event security official, an Indiana State Police officer took the man aside for several minutes, before letting him back into the crowd.
Protesters wedged their own signs around his, following his movements. The man, who identified himself only as Hugh, told reporters, “I’m just here to exercise my rights, just like everybody else.”
Attendees chanted and clapped their way through hours of speeches, poems and prayers before flowing out of the lawn to march around the Statehouse.
Families gather outside Indianapolis
Several hundred protesters ringed the Boone County Courthouse Saturday afternoon. They marched, chanted, listened to speakers and broke into cheers every time a passing car honked in approval.

“No hate. No fear. Everyone is welcome here,” they chanted, along with, “This is what democracy looks like.”
Among the issues the crowd focused on was deportation policy, health care cuts and the belief that Trump is an authoritarian.
Cathy VanArsdall said she hasn’t attended a protest since the 1970s but wanted to come out Saturday so that others in the community know they aren’t alone and can speak up.
“We want to show that we do not believe in what’s happening right now,” VanArsdall, a Lebanon resident, said. She accused federal officials of “abducting” people from the streets, violating the U.S. Constitution and lying to the American public.
Melissa, Mike and Liam McMann from Fishers also came to the rally and held signs.
“I came out for my son’s future,” Melissa McMann said. “His rights and liberties and his classmates’ are in jeopardy.”
Liam McMann, 14, said he wants a stable government and to end Trump’s tyranny.
His father, Mike McMann, said, “I served in the Army and this is not what I served for.”
No police were at the event.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Thousands of Virginians gathered at Capitol Square in Richmond, in the shadow of statues of the nation’s founding fathers, to join a nationwide demonstration against President Donald Trump’s administration on Saturday. Organizers said over 10,000 people participated in the event, one of dozens in the state and hundreds across America that drew millions of attendees. 
Families of all ages and backgrounds held signs, donned costumes, and sang pro-America songs at the state Capitol before marching down Broad Street. Speakers from pro-democracy and civil rights organizations shared messages of resistance to the federal government upheaval that has come to define Trump’s second term. 
It was a seemingly peaceful demonstration, with no reported arrests or violence as of 4:30 p.m. Saturday when the event was set to disband.
Ahead of the march, Linda Wicks and Jaclyn White sat with their signs in the shade, having traveled from the city of Petersburg and Prince George County to voice their concerns about the country, which has become so polarized that eight in ten Americans “cannot agree on basic facts” about important issues facing the country, according to Pew Research Center polling published earlier this year.

“I am so worried about the direction that our country is taking and we need to stand up and let everyone know how wonderful this country is. We need to go back to decency and following the law,” Wicks said.
White’s sign read “America is a Democracy. No Kings since 1776,” while Wicks’ read “I’m here because I love America.” They were nervous about speaking with the media, the women said, due to the Trump administration’s censorship and targeting of progressive voices.
Giant letters placed at the steps of the state Capitol read “Tax the Rich” and thousands filled the surrounding area to hear speeches centered on education funding, the necessity of leaders abiding by the county’s laws, and federal targeting of immigrant communities.

“Every event that I go to this year, the crowds have grown more and more. I think that is a really great opportunity for us to capitalize on our own community … because we serve communities, not kings,” said Dougherty, whose head-to-head contest with Coyner is considered one of the most competitive in this fall’s elections where all 100 House of Delegates seats are on the ballot.
A group of attendees who had also participated in the June No Kings rally in Richmond said public turnout at the October event was much higher.
Kevin Perry and his 12-year-old son Dezmond came from Dinwiddie to “fight authoritarianism.” Perry said Dezmond said in his small community it can be hard to find like-minded kids at his school. He finds connection with people online and at events like Saturday’s demonstration.

The fall wave of No King protests in Richmond and elsewhere in the nation came at the end of a second week of a government shutdown, as frustrations continue to mount due to federal worker furloughs, with some employees going weeks without paychecks. 
Richmond speakers also highlighted federal workers’ interrupted paychecks because of the shutdown, as well as the proposed cuts to Medicaid that have brought Congressional deliberations and federal government functioning to a standstill, and their fear of the rise of fascism.

Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson had called the planned protest a “Hate America rally,” claiming without proof it was organized by pro-Hamas and “antifa” groups. 
Deirdre Schiefeling, the Chief Political and Advocacy Officer for the ACLU, said in a press call ahead of the event that the rallies were about protecting free speech, putting a spotlight on the crackdown on immigration, and weighing in on lawmakers’ government funding discussions.
Several protesters at Richmond’s rally rebuked Johnson’s comments, saying that free speech is an integral part of America’s foundation.
“The entire American experience is based on protesting an oppressive government. So why is this un-American? There is no logic in that in any way, shape or form,” said Jason Erbe, of Richmond.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement on X that “Virginians have a fundamental right to free speech and peaceful assembly, but that right does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic, or violence of any kind—for which there will be zero tolerance.”
The governor added that his administration was coordinating with local, state and federal law enforcement, and said he “authorized members of the National Guard to be placed in ‘state active duty’ status to ensure the Guard will be ready to respond alongside our substantially increased police presence to help keep Virginians safe.”

Capitol Police, the Richmond Police Department, and Virginia State Police officers were present at the Richmond rally, helping to direct traffic as protesters closed down both directions of Broad Street in downtown Richmond on their way to Monroe Park, where more speeches took place.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Granite Staters who took to the streets Oct. 18 in Concord said concerns about health care, immigration, racism, disability rights, free speech, and more motivated them to join that day’s No Kings protest.
The Concord demonstration was one of more than 30 official rallies organized across the state by the national coalition No Kings, and one of more than 2,700 planned across the nation. In the capital, the protest filled the State House lawn and spilled out along North Main Street.
“What’s going on in America is intolerable. This administration is trying to eliminate democracy,” said Donald Winchester, of Antrim. “Mayflower pilgrims were immigrants too,” read a sign he carried.
“I’m an eighth generation New Hampshire native. I was raised a Republican, fiscally conservative, socially responsible, protectors of the environment, party of Lincoln, and so now I’m a very active Democrat, because I am just beside myself with what’s going on,” said Meredith resident Sandy Mucci, who cited concerns about the “militarization” of American cities. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Sandy Mucci, of Meredith, said she was concerned about the administration’s use of the military and hoped the protest would help push more lawmakers to take action against what she said was executive branch overreach. 
“I’m an eighth generation New Hampshire native,” she said. “I was raised a Republican, fiscally conservative, socially responsible, protectors of the environment, party of Lincoln, and so now I’m a very active Democrat, because I am just beside myself with what’s going on,” she said. “… I am scared to death.”
Retired Air Force Master Sgt. Mike Scism, of Sanbornton, waved an American flag at passersby. The administration’s management of the military has disturbed him, Scism said.
“When you join (the military), you swear an oath to protect the Constitution, not to uphold a dictator. What (Secretary Pete) Hegseth is doing to the Department of Defense is horrible,” he said, referencing remarks Hegseth has made targeting diversity and equity initiatives in the military. “… Diversity and having people from all walks of life in the military is key to our strength. It’s not a weakness,” Scism said. 
He added that he believed more veterans were in attendance Oct. 18 than had been present at the first No Kings rally in June.
Chris Farrell, a protest organizer and military veteran, also spoke about the importance of diversity to the military. He led attendees in a recitation of the oath of enlistment, a version of which is taken by military and federal officials when they are sworn in to a role.
“I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America,” the oath began. “… As long as there are Americans willing to speak those words, there will be no kings in this nation,” Ferrell said after the oath had concluded.

Other speakers included disability rights advocate Lisa Beaudoin, who criticized federal funding cuts to the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services and health care, and called for more support and respect for disabled Americans. She also criticized New Hampshire Republicans in particular, who she said were “leading the nation in cuts to Medicaid.”
Bob Sanders, of Concord, who recently concluded a cross-country bike trip protesting the war in Gaza, also spoke at the event, calling for a lasting ceasefire. New Hampshire Youth Movement representative Ty Wyman called for more youth involvement in politics. Other speakers discussed topics from vaccines to health care and immigration.
In bright costumes and with signs bearing messages from lighthearted to urgent, protesters in Concord cheered, chanted, and waved at passing cars throughout the afternoon. A crew of 18 “peacekeepers” from New Hampshire Peace Action patrolled the crowd; the team is trained in deescalation, said peacekeeper Lee Anne Tigert.

Many protesters said they hoped the demonstration would lead to change, but others were skeptical. “If protesting changed anything, they’d make it illegal,” read a sign carried by attendee Brett Power. 
“I think a general strike is needed,” Power said, adding that he did not believe demonstrations on their own would effect significant change at the federal level. “The leverage people have is their labor,” he said.
Others said they hoped the protest would catch the attention of legislators and lead to change.
“This is what it’s going to take. Grassroots stuff like this, to get stuff done,” said protester Betty McKay. “Our legislators and congressmen need to be paying attention.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Hundreds of Arkansans marched down Capitol Avenue in downtown Little Rock Saturday morning in a joint effort to protest President Donald Trump’s administration and to celebrate LGBTQ+ Arkansans.
Little Rock’s addition to the nationwide No Kings protest movement, the second this year, coincided with Central Arkansas Pride’s annual march and celebration. The organizations behind both worked together to share resources and advocate for some of the same causes, Central Arkansas Pride Executive Director Dolores Wilk said in an interview.
Wilk said it’s important for Arkansans to challenge the stereotype that southern, Republican-led states are overwhelmingly bigoted against marginalized communities.
Harry Bounds and Bryan Strickland of Little Rock agreed that southerners can be “just as progressive” as non-southerners. Strickland is a lifelong Arkansan while Bounds grew up in Alabama.
“We believe in democracy, we believe in free speech,” Bounds said. “It’s very important that we dispel those [negative] stereotypes.”

Strickland and Bounds have been married for six years and told the Advocate they are concerned that the political right wing will overturn the legal right to same-sex marriage.
“We are here for equality, [so] everyone gets the same playing field,” Strickland said. “That’s not happening now.”
The couple said they also attended the first No Kings rally in June. That event saw thousands of attendees, who marched across the Broadway Bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock.
Saturday’s No Kings rally began at 10 a.m. at the intersection of Broadway and Capitol Avenue in front of the federal courthouse. Five blocks down Capitol Avenue, Pride festivities kicked off at 11 a.m. between Chester and Pulaski streets, where No Kings rallygoers joined the Pride parade.
Central Arkansas Pride has held its annual event on the third Saturday in October for years, and it moved from North Little Rock’s Argenta neighborhood to Capitol Avenue this year because it needed more space to accommodate growing attendance, Wilk said.

Allowing the No Kings organizers to join the parade was an easy decision because of their support for civil rights of all kinds, Wilk said.
“They support queer rights, they support women’s rights, veterans rights, health rights,” Wilk said.
Grace Daugherty of Sherwood pointed out that Pride celebrations originated from a protest in New York City in 1969.
“It’s very important as a queer person, and especially as a white person, to stand up and be loud and fight back against fascism and the unfairness of this regime,” Daugherty told the Advocate.
The People’s Protests and Marches of AR hosted the Little Rock No Kings rally. Central Arkansas Pride, Indivisible LRCA and 50501 Arkansas are also listed as organizers of the Little Rock protest on the No Kings website.
 ‘Right is right and wrong is wrong’

Slogans on protesters’ signs included, “No kings, just drag queens,” “Fight truth decay,” “Jesus had 2 dads and he turned out fine,” and “The only orange monarch America wants is a butterfly.”
Protesters shouted a series of chants, including “The people united will never be divided,” “This is where we should be,” and “Love, not hate, makes America great.” Some attendees wore inflatable animal costumes, a trend that started with Portland, Oregon residents’ protest against National Guard presence in the city.
Portland is among a handful of Democrat-led major cities to which Trump has deployed troops with the stated purpose of fighting crime and maintaining order. One protest sign read, “Wait… we’re invading ourselves?”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become more active under the Trump administration, sometimes detaining and deporting immigrants that are legally present in the country.
Elizabeth Wiggins carried a sign that said “Fight ignorance, not immigrants.”
“I think [Trump] wants us to be silent and not fight back and just take what he wants us to do, and I don’t agree with that,” she said.
Wiggins drove two and a half hours from El Dorado. The protest in Monroe, Louisiana was closer to home, but Wiggins said she wanted to protest with her friends that live in Central Arkansas.
Teana Bailey of Perryville, a 50-minute drive from Little Rock, said she was raised Republican but has been protesting the Trump administration because “right is right and wrong is wrong.”
“Everybody needs to talk now, because there may be a chance where it’s going to be harder and scarier,” Bailey said.

The Little Rock Police Department and Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office both sent officers to monitor Saturday’s events in coordination with the Pride and No Kings organizers. City police were present on the Arkansas Capitol steps, where some protesters came face to face with a small Christian rally that featured live music and calls for people to turn to Jesus.
Organizers planned the second annual Christian event months in advance and did not know until a few days ago that Pride and No Kings rallies were scheduled the same day, attendee Skylar Weidman told the Advocate.

“We almost didn’t do it again this year, but we believe the Lord told us to,” Weidman said.
The National Weather Service forecast severe storms, including lightning and high winds, for Saturday afternoon. Saturday morning saw sunny weather and temperatures in the 70s, and the weather became cloudy but not rainy in the early afternoon.
Wilk said organizers were “watching the weather very closely since the beginning of the week” and had contingency plans in place. Lightning within three miles would require shutting down the entertainment stage, which showcased live music and drag performers. The organizers planned to use the Victory Building near the Capitol as an emergency shelter from severe weather if necessary.
Small amounts of rain would not have deterred Pride festivities, Wilk said.
“Some of my best rainbows I’ve ever seen have been at Pride after rain,” Wilk said.

(Photo by Nate Billings/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — More than 1,000 people joined a No Kings protest Saturday outside City Hall in Oklahoma City, donning ponchos and inflatable costumes in the rain to rally against President Donald Trump. 
The No Kings protests, which took place in hundreds of cities across all 50 states and in the nation’s capital, are intended to denounce the Trump administration and rally against “chaos, corruption, and cruelty.” 
Many protest signs and speakers focused on anger with Trump’s deportation campaign using Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Congress’ failure to release the Epstein files and the conflict in Gaza.

Rosa Valdez said she’s never been involved in politics, but that seeing immigrants removed from their homes without due process brought her to the protest.
“There’s a lot of people that have been around me in my lifetime that have fallen victim to what is going on right now and have, unfortunately, been deported,” she said. “And just the way that everything has gone down, I know that they didn’t get any court (date) or anything like that.”
Duwayne Mills, an Oklahoma native, attended Saturday’s protests wearing a Ghostbusters outfit he altered to instead be a “Trump-busters” jumpsuit. 
He said the outfit was meant to be silly because “tyrants hate to be laughed at.”

“I’ve got two kids at home, and I will not have them brought up in this B.S.,” he said. “Because somebody … has some kind of ego trip going on and no one in that party will stop him because they’re just as corrupt as he is.”
Georgia Williams and Kim Reed said they joined the protest because of the actions of GOP leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson and a dislike of the administration limiting press access at the White House. 
Organizers of the protests held a mock trial for Trump, alleging crimes such as using the military against civilians, obstructing justice, corruption and bribery. Speakers acted as prosecutors and witnesses in the trial, with the crowd of protestors acting as the jury and found Trump “guilty.” 
The protests were peaceful and there was no prominent counter protest or local police presence, but organizers hired security to ensure safety. 
Local organizations like Indivisible Oklahoma and 50501OK were the main organizers in Oklahoma City.
No Kings protests were planned in at least 18 other Oklahoma cities, according to organizers, including Ponca City, Bartlesville, Miami, Enid, Stillwater, Tulsa, Tahlequah, Muskogee, Guthrie, Chandler, Norman, McAlester, Ada, Pauls Valley, Lawton, Ardmore, Durant and Idabel.

Free.,No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-kings-day-brings-millions-us-streets-anti-trump-protests,,"WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans packed streets, parks and town squares across the United States Saturday for No Kings day, according to the organizers of the massive day of demonstrations protesting President Donald Trump’s administration — from his deployment of troops to cities to his targeting of political opponents.Thousands upon thousands showed up for the second organized No Kings day in America’s largest cities like Atlanta, New York City and Chicago, to smaller metro areas and towns including Greensburg, Pennsylvania; Bismarck, North Dakota; and Hammond, Louisiana. More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations were planned.The first No Kings day coincided with Trump’s military parade that occurred on his 79th birthday in June. Demonstrators decried Trump’s dispatch of National Guard troops to several U.S. cities, as well as ongoing immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, the nation’s capital, Portland, Oregon, and Chicago and where U.S. citizens have been swept up in raids.

Ben Grimes, of Northern Virginia, who said he spent two decades in the U.S. Army piloting helicopters and working as a military lawyer, held a sign bearing the message “I Served America Not Autocracy.” Grimes stood among tens of thousands of demonstrators who stretched down several blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue at the Washington, D.C., No Kings day event.“We’re sliding very rapidly into autocracy and lawlessness,” said the 52-year-old veteran, whose career included a deployment to Baghdad. “Just about everything has worried me, but I am particularly concerned about the use of the deployment of military troops in the U.S. and the apparent lawless killing of civilians in the Caribbean,” Grimes said.

JB Pritzker, a Democrat, also called on the crowd to be united and speak out.

Thousands of people gathered in Times Square in Manhattan for New York City’s No Kings day peaceful 1.6-mile march down 7th Avenue.Silas Perez, 21, who lives in the Bronx, said she “wants to fight for our rights while we still have them.” “They want to say ‘Make America Great Again.’ It was better before,” Perez said. “This is worse.” ""Democracy requires your courage, and tyranny requires good people doing nothing … and it fails when ordinary people refuse to cooperate and they say, 'no kings' and mean it,"" Pritzker said. In Lexington, Kentucky, protester Garcia O’Brien, 71, said, “I’m old, and I’ve never been scared for our democracy. I am now.” In Fargo, North Dakota, Ken Opheim showed up in a red hat but with an anti-Trump message: Quid Pro Quo Trump Must Go. ""Everything he does, he gets something back for himself,"" Opheim said.Lawmakers, activists and celebrities spoke at rallies across the country — Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Atlanta, actor John Cusack in Chicago, Bill Nye “the Science Guy” in Washington, D.C. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut also spoke to the massive crowd in the nation’s capital.“He has not won yet, the people still rule in this country,” Murphy, a Democrat, said. “Trump thinks that he’s a king, and he thinks he can act more corruptly when the government is shut down.”

The protesters took to the streets during the ongoing government shutdown to question Trump’s actions since he took office for his second presidential term on Jan. 20.Trump revamped his legally questionable mass firing of federal workers on Oct. 10, this time against the backdrop of the nearly three-week government funding lapse. Amid the shutdown, Trump this past week authorized a $20 billion bailout for Argentina. The administration also continues to amass defense resources along the coast of Venezuela and carry out extrajudicial strikes on alleged drug running boats in the Caribbean Sea, killing dozens.

Repeatedly, Trump has threatened to use the shutdown as an opportunity to permanently cut “Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans” by canceling funding already appropriated by Congress.A member of his own party, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said the Government Accountability Office should sue the for his administration’s illegal impoundment of funds already written into law — something he began to do long before the shutdown.Since January, Trump has canceled billions in foreign aid, medical research, natural disaster assistance, and funding for museums and libraries, early childhood education and energy efficiency programs for K-12 schools.

Trump’s use of power was on full display when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March and defied a federal judge’s order by sending hundreds of immigrants, many without due process, to a mega-prison in El Salvador.

The demonstration was part of the national No Kings protest movement, which had thousands of events scheduled Saturday in all 50 states. In Charleston, the rally was organized by the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, West Virginia Free, the state arm of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Charleston branch of the NAACP, as well as a newly formed grassroots nonprofit organization, West Virginia United.
Around 11 a.m., more than 200 people met at the Robert C. Byrd federal courthouse in downtown Charleston before marching two miles together to the state Capitol, on the city’s east end. There, they were met by about 200 more residents for a rally. Individuals continued to arrive as the event progressed.

Hundreds of people marched 2 miles this morning from the federal courthouse in Charleston, WV to the state capitol as part of the No Kings protests.
Marchers chanted “No kings, no KKK, no fascist USA” as they walked. Dozens of people honked as they drove by and others parked to join the march.

Attendees throughout the crowd wielded protest signs. Some were witty, some were insulting to Trump and other Republicans, while others featured pleas to the federal government to preserve democracy and work for the common good. The ages of the crowd widely ranged — parents pushed babies and toddlers in strollers while older residents, many in their 80s and 90s, sat holding their signs under trees to the side of the Capitol building.
Kathy Stalnaker, 65, said she attended the protest because she’s afraid for her childrens’ and grandchildrens’ futures. A retired teacher, it was far from Stalnaker’s first time protesting the government at the West Virginia state Capitol. She was present at the teacher and school service personnel strikes in 2018 and 2019.
Now, she said, it feels like there’s even more to speak up about.
“My main concern is for my children and grandchildren. I’ve studied history and Hitler and Mussolini — all of those dictators. That’s where we’re headed right now,” Stalnaker said. “Our country can’t go down the toilet this way. We’ve worked so hard and so long to establish this democracy. Now, we’ve got to fight for it.”

Stalknaker said it was a challenge deciding what to write on her protest sign. 
“There were so many things I could say, that I want to say,” Stalnaker said. “All week I’ve just been thinking, ‘I’m so sick of this. I’m sick of this fear and these threats.’”
Generally on Saturday, residents spoke against recent actions and detainments by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as potential federal cuts to health care programs, social safety nets and more that would largely impact already vulnerable people. They also spoke out against threats that have come against people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, journalists and activists, among others.

“It really does feel like people are in danger right now, real danger,” said Cheryl Pinckney, who attended the rally from St. Albans with her husband, Don Pinckney.
The Pinckneys moved to West Virginia more than 28 years ago. In recent years, Don Pinckney said, it feels like things have gotten more challenging. Now, they’re seriously considering leaving the state for the first time since they moved here.
“Politics didn’t feel as polarizing in the past, but honestly now we’re afraid,” Don Pinckney said.
“Things feel more permanent now — this hate, this division, all of these threats [to democracy],” Cheryl Pinckney continued. “I don’t know how we’re going to turn things around, but we’ve got to figure it out.”

The march and protest Saturday was a peaceful affair. People yelled in the crowds and chanted when prompted. Across Kanawha Boulevard, on the edge of the river, several law enforcement officers — from the West Virginia State Police, Charleston Police Department and the State Capitol Police — oversaw the event.

Speakers at the rally included representatives from several nonprofit organizations, including CAG and the ACLU. Del. Mike Pushkin, D-W.Va., played guitar for those in attendance after a speech where he asked all the older people in the crowd — those over 70, 80 or 90 years of age — to clap their hands.
Applause came from throughout the area.
“They’re out here because they know better. They’ve lived through several administrations and they know better,” Pushkin said. “These are the folks who know that democracy does not defend itself. We are not subjects, we are citizens. In America, we have no kings.

Salesianum scored in all three phases of the game to defeat the Jaguars, Friday night.
 
MIDDLETOWN — Salesianum defeated the Appoquinimink Jaguars, 49-0, Friday night earning its fourth win in a row and second straight shutout. Sallies scored all but seven of their points in the first half.
Appoquinimink started its first possession of the game with a trip to the red zone courtesy of a 48-yard pass from senior Desai Drummond to fellow senior Dominic Montebell on a deep crossing route to the right hashmark that Montebell secured with a one-handed grab on the run. Sallies’ defense held the Jaguars out of the endzone on the ensuing set of downs and forced a field goal attempt. 
Salesianum senior Jayvian Burrell rushed around the left side and blocked the attempt. He recovered the loose ball and ran it back down the left side for an 80-yard score to begin the night.
Sallies’ offense — led by quarterback Brady Nabb — scored on their first offensive possession with a 28-yard touchdown grab by receiver Devin Hasan near the front left pylon. Junior Jett Healy scored his first of two touchdowns of the game a possession after on a four yard run out of the wildcat formation. Healy’s other touchdown came on a punt return later in the second quarter.
The Sallies defense contributed a score in the first half on an interception from junior Kevin McConaghy in the late stages of the second quarter. A Jamar Taylor touchdown catch completed Sallies first half scoring on a night where Salesianum executed well in every phase of the game.
The Jaguars offense was able to move the ball down the field by completing a couple of deep passes, but the Salesianum defense held firm as Appoquinimink threatened. It’s the first time this season the Jaguars were held scoreless.  
It’s only Appoquinimink’s second loss of the season, but it breaks a stretch of three straight wins for the Jaguars including a thrilling overtime victory over Caravel on October 10. The Jaguars will remain at home for a matchup against Hodgson next Friday.
Sallies will play at home next week with Middletown coming to Abessinio Stadium next Friday. Salesianum is 5-2 this season and undefeated against in-state competition.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4225-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-10-18 13:58:08.404856
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-18 17:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Reddit AMA recap: How does Mississippi spend its opioid settlement dollars?,Mississippi Today,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/18/mississippi-opioid-settlement-reddit-ama/,Allen Siegler answered your questions about how Mississippi’s elected officials have been managing about $124 million of Mississippi opioid settlement money.,"Mental health reporter Allen Siegler recently published a series of stories investigating how Mississippi’s elected officials have been managing about $124 million of Mississippi opioid settlement money — money that the state is receiving as a result of lawsuits against companies that profited off a devastating overdose crisis.
His findings were staggering.
Most of the money spent so far has been for lawyers’ fees or stuff that isn’t related to addiction, like police cameras and fiber optic cable installations.
And it’s not that the crisis is over — more people are dying now than seven years ago, when the biggest lawsuit was filed. But less than 1% of the Mississippi money has actually been used to stop the problem.
This project took over three months to report and write, and there were plenty of weird things that happened along the way. So Allen answered questions from our readers on Reddit, taking them behind the scenes on what it takes to undertake such an investigation.
You can read the conversation below. This includes guidance on how people can file a Freedom of Information Act request to access public records (with a link to a sample FOIA request you can use) and other actions community members can take to ensure these funds are used to address the problems highlighted in the lawsuits.

Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: What can we do to help pressure whoever is in charge of distribution of the funds?
Click for the answer.
I think it depends on what someone would want to accomplish. At the most direct level, the city/town council members and county supervisors are the people who decide where the local money goes. If your town, city or county is spending the money without the input of those most impacted by the crisis (which, to our knowledge, is every local government besides Hattiesburg), you could call city hall or the your supervisors and let them know what you think of that and where you think the money should go. Most elected officials’ emails are also publicly available, so contacting them that way could be a good strategy as well. 
The contract Attorney General Lynn Fitch made with the local governments is already finalized, so I don’t believe she can change the unrestricted terms of that spending. But other states’ attorneys general have provided guidance for how local governments should spend their money in overdose prevention, regardless of what their contracts say the cities and counties have to do. North Carolina’s former attorney general wrote extensive FAQs about local settlement spending that experts have brought up to me multiple times. If she wanted to/if her constituents made it known that’s something they want to happen, Fitch’s office could write similar guidelines.
To my knowledge, the only state group that can legally change how the towns, cities and counties spend their opioid settlement money is the Mississippi Legislature. And we’ve seen that happen in other states. Similar to Mississippi, Maine didn’t require its local governments to report what they were spending their settlement money on (although Emily Bader with The Maine Monitor did a remarkable job filling those reporting gaps where she could). Then this spring, state lawmakers passed a simple bill to require that from hereon out. If Mississippi lawmakers hear from their voters that they want a bill like this as well (or others that require the money to be spent on addiction-related purposes), they might look to pass similar legislation during the 2026 regular session. 

Q: I see a lot about police funds and even some that explicitly state money was put towards guns. My understanding is that some funds were allotted to counties to be used at their discretion.
Click for the answer.
In Mississippi, Fitch wrote a contract that says all the settlement money flowing to towns, cities and counties (expected to be around $63 million when all is said and done) can be spent for whatever public purpose their town/city council and Board of Supervisors think is appropriate. The settlements allow for up to 30% of spending to be on things that don’t have to do with addiction; because the local governments are getting 15% of the total Mississippi opioid settlement pie, all of their shares can be spent like any other public dollars. 
While this is technically allowed by the national settlements, the lawyers who wrote the settlements explicitly said they didn’t want that to happen. Most states created arrangements that say all the lawsuit money has to go to something related to addiction (even for purposes that have been criticized by the public). But as of right now, that’s not the case here.

Q: Are any of these funds discussed with constituents, or does it seem to entirely be at the whims of the ones in charge? How can we know whether or not they will a) use the remaining funds at all b) use them for anything remotely related to dealing with the supposed target issue?
Click for the answer.
Entirely at the whims of the ones in charge, at least for the local money. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Toby Barker, the mayor of Hattiesburg, created a committee this summer to advise how to spend the city’s settlement money. The committee, made up of locals who have experience addressing addiction, has come up with a few priorities so far, and I heard they’re in the process of moving forward on putting up money for those priorities. 
For questions A and B, it’s going to be hard if the current setup continues. For example, cities and counties have been getting money for three years now, but even those I consider most familiar with the Mississippi overdose crisis (people like James Moore in Hattiesburg) didn’t know anything about the local spending until I requested records and told him about that. But, as you allude to in your next question, anyone can request records from Mississippi governments. And I think we proved that while not ideal, the public record technique is an effective way to bring spending information to light. 

Q: Could you give a rundown of how one goes about requesting (or accessing) these documents?
Click for the answer.
Yep, no problem! First, you need to have an idea about what information you’re looking for and what documents might contain that information. I knew very little about the recordkeeping of these local settlements going into the project, so I asked for “All receipts of dollars received by the [local government name] related to the National Opioids Settlements since June 1,2022,” and “All internal records related to [local government name]’s spending of money received from the National OpioidSettlements since June 1, 2022.”Here’s one I sent to the city of Hattiesburg, which has all the template information to make sure we get the information as quickly and accessibly as possible. I tried to email them to city/town/chancery clerks, and sometimes added in the county administrator/government attorney. When a local government has a specific city portal or form, like Oxford and Long Beach respectively, I put the same information into those forms. I was expecting to receive documents like spending ledgers and city council resolutions from this request, which I sometimes did. But there were tons of other formats clerks and administrators used to provide me the information. I got everything from county budgets mostly unrelated to opioid settlement spending to a handwritten note saying nothing has been spent yet.
Sometimes, helpful public servants would call me to clarify what information I wanted. I nudged some of the clerks a lot, and made sure the Mississippi Ethics Commission knew when the public bodies were breaking state law. It took up most of my summer to do this with all 147 local governments, but I think the importance of this information justifies the work

Q: How are other states handling/distributing funds to address opioid overdoses? Who should the public turn to for recommendations on how best to use these funds to address the problems? Health professionals? Law enforcement officials? Local Politicians? How can the public be more involved?
Click for the answer.
It’s a very mixed bag from state to state. Like I wrote in this story, every other state has used at least $3 million of opioid settlement money to at least try to address their overdose crises. But that certainly doesn’t mean everything’s sunshine and roses everywhere else. 
Christine Minhee has a better national perspective on the settlement distribution than anyone I’ve met, and she created a state opioid settlement guide last December to give folks baseline information about what’s going on in each state. And the guides show that while there are states effectively using their dollars to prevent more deaths, there’s plenty of opportunities for spending that doesn’t address the opioid epidemic across the country. When I was reporting in West Virginia, I wrote a story about county leaders using nearly half a million settlement dollars for a shooting range. I just saw a story from Hawaii that leaders are using some of the state’s money for waterpark and Chuck E. Cheese vouchers. 
For best practice recommendations, there are a lot of national level resources (like Johns Hopkins University’s guide) that provide broad recommendations for how the settlement money can prevent more deaths.The settlements themselves have lists of strategies that are proven ways to curb the crisis. But public health professionals repeatedly told me that for any given town, city or county, the people who make up the community whose lives have been touched by the overdose catastrophe are the best people to share what will and won’t work. 

Q: Why would the crowd that diverted welfare money to a volleyball stadium with little consequences be expected to do the right thing with the settlement money?
Click for the answer.
I sent Anna Wolfe this question, and she said the welfare scandal teaches us that when public money intended to assist the state’s most vulnerable residents has so few guardrails, the likelihood it will be squandered is great (whether straight-up stolen or spent on things that have nothing to do with the intended purpose–both of which yield the same result: people don’t receive help and opportunities for better outcomes are lost). I think she’s completely right.
What I would add about the opioid settlement situation in particular is that the State Legislature, the group that will control as much as $300 million when all the payments come in, hasn’t done much to indicate one way or another how it will spend the money it oversees. We’ll know a lot more about what’s to come when the Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council presents recommendations for which overdose response efforts lawmakers should fund in December, and when the lawmakers act on those non-binding recommendations in the 2026 regular legislative session. I’ll be keeping eyes on what happens there, and I hope the public does too. 

Q: Are there any accountability frameworks that would allow the money to be used in a way that it benefits the actual victims of the opioid crisis?
Click for the answer.
I think so! I think the Maine bill that requires local spending reporting is a great way to encourage city and county leaders to be responsible stewards of the money. I think there could be a lot of ways states can incentivize spending on preventing more deadly overdoses and a lot of people willing to help develop these incentives. I cite many people with a lot of experience in that department in my stories. 

Q: How will the One Big Beautiful Bill impact mental health and those that work in this field in private practice, agency settings and psychiatry hospitals?
Click for the answer.
I won’t pretend to know everything about the health and health care implications of this summer’s federal spending bill. But nearly half of people diagnosed with opioid addiction used Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for vulnerable Americans. 
So, I would guess that if fewer people have health insurance through Medicaid – which is what I understand the spending bill to incentivize in 2027 – that likely means fewer people can get effective opioid addiction treatment, like the medications buprenorphine and methadone.
This Kaiser Family Foundation article was published before the bill was passed, but I think it does a good job laying out the implications of Medicaid cuts on addressing the opioid epidemic.

Q: Has any of the spending been audited so far?
Click for the answer.
I have not come across any audits in my reporting. 

Q: How will the settlement be spent?
Click for the answer.
We mostly don’t know right now. Mississippi has received about $125 million as of this summer, but it’s slated to receive another roughly $300 million over the next 15 years. A lot can change in that time, from who’s making the decisions to what the addiction epidemic looks like. 
This graph I made breaks down what’s broadly happened with the $125 million. The biggest chunk of money is with the Legislature, and it’s unspent as of now. That will very likely change after the 2026 Regular Legislative Session, which begins in January and ends in April. I expect lawmakers to make some decisions for these dollars by April, and the public will know more then. 
The $15.5 million controlled by 147 towns, cities and counties can and is being spent on any public purpose their leaders want. This other graph I made digs into whether the local governments are spending the money on addiction, spending it on something else or not spending it yet. 

Q: A lot of states are using the opioid settlement to purchase equipment like Reassurance Solutions cell monitoring devices; basically vital sign radars that go in county detention centers and jails to monitor for overdoses (which happen most often within the first 24 hours of incarceration). Is tech like that a viable option for Mississippi’s funds?
Click for the answer.
I don’t know anything about that specific device, so I don’t want to comment on that specifically. But the settlement lawyers list initiatives that prevent more overdoses for inmates and former inmates as acceptable ways to address the crisis. They speak about providing “MAT (medication assisted treatment), recovery support, harm reduction, or other appropriate services” to people involved with the criminal justice system. 

Q: Grant decisions will be determined by the legislature. Will there be any opportunity for public comment on the grants recommended to the legislature?
Click for the answer.
I have not heard of any opportunities for public comment, and I don’t see anything in the law state senators and representatives passed in spring that says there will be public comment opportunities. But lawmakers don’t just make laws — they can also change them! So if Mississippians think public comment opportunities for how these dollars get spent are important, a good way to make that known would be to call/email their state senators and representatives. 

Q: Did you find that Mississippi officials resisted sharing records or delayed responses? If so, how did you overcome that and what rights do regular residents have to push back when agencies ignore or stonewall?
Click for the answer.
Oh, absolutely. The most common obstacle I came across was staying in contact with whoever handles the public records in any given town, city or county. I filed almost all of my records requests in mid-June, so I started following-up with local governments I hadn’t heard back from in early July. First, I would ask for an email update and often add the town/city/county attorney. For a lot of governments, that was enough. But going into mid-July, there were still dozens of governments that I hadn’t heard back from. 
From there, it branched out into a lot of phone calls to city halls and county boards of supervisors. Mississippi has laws that say public officials have to fully respond to public records requests by at most 14 business days, and it has a state Ethics Commission to enforce them.So I spent a lot of July reminding city or chancery clerks what the state’s public record act says. My deskmates got a kick out of the number of times I told record keepers I was going to loop in the ethics commissioner Thomas Hood about not receiving these records in a timely manner. But doing that usually worked, so I stand by it. 
For anyone looking to file records requests, feel free to copy and paste the language from my Hattiesburg FOIA where I talk about asking for electronic copies and other things of that nature. I would also recommend reading the public records act I linked above and the state’s model law so they know what you are and aren’t entitled to. If a government is looking to charge 50 cents a page for emailed copies of documents (as happened to me multiple times), that’s a problem. Tom Hood successfully mediated a number of these disagreements between public officials and me. If you run into any issues, you can loop him into the email thread (thood@ethics.state.ms.us), and he might be able to clear up any disagreements. If not, you can file an ethics complaint with his office. 

Q: Who is responsible for making sure this money is spent on addiction treatment instead of unrelated projects?
Click for the answer.
For the local Mississippi money, no one right now. There’s very few reporting requirements the settlements themselves actually require, and Attorney General Fitch’s agreement with cities and counties doesn’t require it either. But the state Legislature could pass a law to change that, if lawmakers think that’s an important priority. 
For the state’s money, Fitch has designated a small chunk of its share (“small chunk” is relative as it’s still expected to be over $60 million in total) for purposes that don’t have to address addiction. The settlements say the remaining pot of money, set to be around $300 million by 2040, has to be spent on addressing addiction. 
The law the Legislature passed this spring says the Attorney General’s Office is in charge of making sure the money is spent legally. So, unless the Legislature changes something, the person responsible is Fitch or whoever is attorney general in the future. 

Q: When you filed 147 records requests, how many governments actually complied fully and how many gave partial or no responses?
Click for the answer.
For 141 governments, I believe public officials gave me their best estimates of how much money they’ve received and how they’ve been spending the funds. That doesn’t mean I think they got all the information right. For instance, Gulfport wrote me a letter that they hadn’t spent any of their money despite meeting minutes showing that they spent $4,000 for a holiday feeding program in 2023. There could be other governments that did similar things that my editor and I didn’t catch. 
Three governments — Byram, Tunica County and Kosciusko — found some but not all of the payments they’ve received. So their numbers are likely underestimates of the total money they’ve received. 
Moss Point and Rankin County never told me how they’re spending their dollars, and we noted that in the various charts and graphs. Mound Bayou was the only government to provide no information, which led me to file this ethics complaint against the city in August. 

Q: Were there clear reporting requirements for these funds, or is it left up to local officials to decide what to disclose?
Click for the answer.
The only reporting requirements I’m familiar with in the settlements is for a chunk of the money that is allowed to be spent for purposes other than addiction. My understanding is this provision was added for tax purposes for the pharmaceutical companies paying the settlements. 
That money is supposed to be reported here. My understanding is that if/when the Legislature spends some of its settlement money without the recommendations of the advisory committee, that spending will have to show up here. But I don’t know if there’s an enforcer of this reporting.


Q: From your experience, what is the most effective way for everyday citizens to get attention on financial mismanagement of public records, media coverage, state agencies, or something else?
Click for the answer.
I think reaching out to the local public officials making decisions is a good first step. Now that MT has published our database, there’s hopefully less room for elected officials to say they don’t know what’s going on with the opioid settlements they oversee. I came across many local officials who said they wanted this money to be spent appropriately — they just didn’t exactly know how to do that. So a nudge/recommendation from a helpful constituent could go a long way. 
If that doesn’t work, and state senators and representatives don’t respond to calls and emails, I think going to the media might be a good idea. It’s a story I’d be interested in trying to write, and it looks like Gulf States Newsroom’s Drew Hawkins (whose opioid settlement work I really admire) is looking to produce stories like that as well.  

Q: If Mississippi is spending less than 1% of opioid settlement money on the crisis itself, what avenues are there for residents to push for change? Lawsuits? Federal oversight? Public campaigns?
Click for the answer.
I’m not sure. The general local spending is allowed by both the law and the settlements (although the lawyers say non-addiction spending is “disfavored”), so it’s not illegal. One of the biggest issues I’ve seen in Mississippi’s opioid settlement distribution is because so little information was made public, most people aren’t familiar with the spending or the settlements themselves. 
At large, it just hasn’t been on the Mississippi media and public’s radar.
I hope that starts to change with this “Black Box” series, but I don’t know what will happen. In my experience, nearly everyone I’ve talked with says overdoses are bad and the government should do whatever it can to prevent them. 
Attorney General Fitch and Jackson Mayor John Horhn held a press conference yesterday to say just that. So, if the public continues to connect those dots to the opioid settlement money, I would hope that decision makers see that spending the money for overdose response and prevention is aligned with their priorities. 
In other states, citizens dismayed by opioid settlement spending on things other than addiction have been able to draw a lot of public attention with protests and editorials. I don’t know if that solves all the problems, but it would certainly make this general spending more visible. 

Q: How were local needs assessed, what outcomes will be measured to determine program effectiveness due to funding, and how are programs or intervention evaluated & will the results be shared publicly? 
Click for the answer.
Because Attorney General Fitch didn’t require local governments to spend the money they oversee on addiction, I found little evidence that there’s been many needs assessments or program evaluation. That could change if Mississippi’s laws and resources change, but for now Hattiesburg is the only government I could find using citizen input to assess how this local money can be spent to best prevent more overdoses.

Q: Can you let me know if ANYONE/ ANYWHERE has purchased or contemplated purchasing Fentanyl test strips?
Click for the answer.
Anecdotally, I know people who use test strips to verify what’s in their drug supply. But I haven’t asked them if they purchased the strips or were given them by a mutual aid group.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/17143758/IMG_6416-1.jpg,,,2025-10-18 13:58:08.404856

The events were part of a national “No Kings” day of protest, the second one since President Donald Trump took office in January.

Key Events







Grandson of immigrants worries about economy, due process
Mike Ondek of Nashville wore an inflatable chicken suit to attend the capital city’s protest, held on the grounds of the Tennessee Capitol. His parents immigrated to the U.S. from Slovakia and he said he’s concerned about the Trump administration’s immigration policies, deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and a lack of due process for those being deported.
But the economy is also on his mind.
“I don’t like what’s going on and I’m supposed to be retiring this year and I have no idea what’s going on with Medicaid, the economy,” Ondek said. “I lost so much last time the economy tanked with my 401(k) and built it back up but there’s so much uncertainty.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/201e6f9f-a4cb-4878-bd0c-90b54d8849d7-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 12:03:35.819744

Piscitelli,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/18/no-child-should-come-home-to-an-empty-house/,We do not want our neighborhoods turned into staging grounds for immigration crackdowns aimed to stroke the right-wing base. .,"Last Wednesday, October 15, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents stormed the Optimo Car Wash on Dixwell Avenue in Hamden. Mid-morning, eight people had been detained, including both employees and customers. 
At 10:23 a.m., I witnessed dozens of tactical gear-clad agents as they held eight of our neighbors in vehicles on Pine Rock Avenue, a stone’s throw from Eli Whitney Technical High School and Southern Connecticut State University. Some of our neighbors were parents of young children who were still in school, unaware that mom or dad would not be there when school was dismissed. How is this ok?
This was not law enforcement done responsibly; it was just another example of a show of force from an administration that seeks to pit neighbors against neighbors in a calculated and continued effort to divide the American public and consolidate power.
I don’t dispute that Homeland Security and ICE have the authority to enforce immigration law, but authority without compassion erodes legitimacy. The Hamden raid was not targeting dangerous criminals or fugitives. It targeted our neighbors who were washing cars to earn a paycheck, trying to make ends meet and provide for their loved ones.
Similar ICE raids have been reported in New Britain, Southington and Newington in recent months. Each time, ICE has acted unilaterally, disregarding the work of local leaders who strive to balance enforcement with compassion. We do not want our neighborhoods turned into staging grounds for immigration crackdowns aimed to stroke the right-wing base. When federal agents act as if our communities are the battlefield, they undermine the very democratic values they claim to protect.
ICE raids don’t happen in a vacuum. Raids lead to community fear and fear keeps people from reporting crimes or cooperating with police. How can local police department build trust when residents worry that any knock on the door might be ICE in disguise? Effective law enforcement relies on relationships; heavy-handed raids by masked law enforcement agents destroy them.

ICE must coordinate with local governments when operations could affect families or children. Schools and social services must have emergency protocols to identify and assist minors whose parents are suddenly detained. And above all, our elected officials should reaffirm that Connecticut stands for dignity, due process, and decency. 
At a press conference following the raid, State Sen. Jorge Cabrera said, “Give people a path to citizenship. That’s what American’s support. But don’t arrest hardworking, taxpaying immigrants.” Gallup’s July 2025 data supports Cabrera’s statement. According to Gallup, “support for allowing undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens has risen to 78%, up from 70% last year.”
After a couple of days, the story is beginning to fade on local news stations, but for the families torn apart, the trauma will last far longer. We are overwhelmed with story after story, and too many of us have become numb to the callousness of the Trump administration. We can’t allow this to become the new normal. 
More than three quarters of us agree that a pathway to citizenship is the answer; more of us must believe that no child should come home from school to find their parents gone without a trace.

Stephen C. “Steve” Cawood, an Eastern Kentucky lawyer who championed coal miners, clean water and better schools, died Oct. 17, three days after his 82nd birthday. 
Grandson to both a county sheriff and a circuit judge, Cawood worked to alleviate Appalachia’s poverty as a volunteer and activist. He was unafraid to challenge the region’s powerful coal industry as an attorney and one-term state legislator. 
He died at Baptist Health Hospital in Lexington after a lengthy battle with bladder cancer. 
“The loss of Steve Cawood will be felt throughout our commonwealth, but especially in Eastern Kentucky,” said Gov. Andy Beshear. “From protecting our state resources to increasing education access, Steve dedicated himself to work that helped build a brighter future for Kentuckians. Britainy and I are praying for his family. He will be missed.”
Environmental lawyer Tom FitzGerald of the Kentucky Resources Council said Cawood “embodied a rich tradition in Eastern Kentucky of progressive people who could have gone anywhere and been successful but decided to stay home and work with the cards dealt them to make the lives of their neighbors better.”
Pineville days
Cawood was born in Pineville on Oct. 14, 1943, to Murrell and Sophia Gilbert Cawood. His father ran a hardware store. Cawood’s maternal grandfather was Circuit Judge James M. Gilbert, who presided in Bell and Harlan counties. His paternal grandfather had been a sheriff of Harlan County. He was predeceased by his sister, Janie Cawood Brooking and brother Tom Cawood.
Cawood said in an oral history interview that his family’s social and economic position, as well as living in town, insulated him from the poverty in the surrounding countryside and coal camps.
“I grew up in the small town of Pineville and it’s a funny, peculiar kind of town to the extent that it is a very cohesive community that revolves around one little high school,” he said. “It has a very leveling effect on the children who are raised here. It did then and it does today to the extent that it was not unusual to find myself on a given summer day as a child lying on the river bank with kids from the poor section of town and kids from the wealthier section of town. Or playing in the woods or in a Scout troop or in a football game.” 
“I knew there were coal miners,” Cawood said of growing up in Pineville. “There were six or eight kids in my class who were left fatherless by the Fourmile mine explosion in 1945. But I knew nothing of the life they lived at home. I had not ever been exposed to the anger. I was not raised in poverty.” 
Kid from Eastern Kentucky
As a student at Eastern Kentucky University, Cawood became involved in the initial planning of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 War On Poverty. 
“Shortly after the death of President Kennedy and the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, there was a think tank established in Berea, Kentucky,” Cawood recalled in a 1991 interview. The group met to talk about “how to go about designing a program to have socio-economic change in Appalachia, ” he said, and “basically designed” the Economic Opportunity Act, the 1964 law that was the centerpiece of the Johnson era War on Poverty. The Berea confab pieced together what became the Appalachian Volunteers, a kind of domestic Peace Corps. 
“I got involved because they (those organizing the War On Poverty) wanted kids from Eastern Kentucky to advise them,” Cawood recalled. “They were looking for ideas. They didn’t pretend to have all the answers.” 
The impetus for this effort came from President John F. Kennedy’s tour of West Virginia during his 1960 primary campaign. Kennedy “was shocked by what he saw in West Virginia,” Cawood said.

In his senior year at EKU, Cawood joined the Appalachian Volunteers, which he described as a “ragtag bunch of bright, caring people.”
Initially under the Council of the Southern Mountains, the Appalachian Volunteers, or AVs, took on community projects such as repairing schools, winterizing homes and leading recreation programs. The group split off in 1966 and took a more activist stance, helping organize local citizens groups, pushing for poor people to have more say in anti-poverty programs and supporting protests against surface mining, according to “Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since 1945” by Ronald D. Eller and The Kentucky Encyclopedia.
Politicians in Appalachia came to regard the AVs as a threat to local power structures. The federal government cut funds and the program closed in 1970, though many members stayed on and continued their advocacy.
Cawood later said the AVs’ most lasting contribution was giving individuals like Eula Hall the courage to speak up and gain support. Hall was an Appalachian activist and health care pioneer who founded the Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel in Floyd County.
In his second year of law school at the University of Kentucky, Cawood married Jeanette “Sissy” McCauley, the daughter of a Middlesboro mayor, who was starting her junior year of college. They would have two daughters: Beth (Bill) Overman of Lexington and Mandy (JD) Hickey of Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, and five grandchildren.
He was in a group of law students who went to Bell County one summer to find out what legal services were needed. The “raw anger” and tremendous poverty he encountered made a permanent impression on him, he said, in part because he had grown up in Bell County oblivious to the conditions.
In 1968, Cawood helped coordinate Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign tour of Eastern Kentucky. He rode in the car with Kennedy. “I was getting ready to join (the campaign) when Bobby was killed (June 5, 1968),” said Cawood.
Working with coal miners
On Dec. 30, 1970 an explosion at the non-union Finley Mine at Hurricane Creek near Hyden killed 38 men, bringing attention to lax enforcement of federal mine safety laws. Cawood represented survivor A.T. Collins who was blown out of the mine by the explosion.
Phil Primack, who had started working as a reporter at The Mountain Eagle a few months earlier, first met Cawood when he covered the disaster. Cawood “became an invaluable guide to mine safety laws, multiple violations of which led to the explosion, as well as the failures of state and federal regulators to enforce them,” Primack said.
“When he represented A.T. Collins, the disaster’s sole survivor, Steve was more than just the attorney for an individual — he stood for all coal miners and their families and communities,” Primack said. “He was a caring and passionate advocate, a great storyteller, and a good friend.”
Cawood represented striking miners at the Brookside mine in Harlan County in 1973-74 and traveled with them on tours of the country.
Cawood also represented opponents of strip mining in a group called Save Our Kentucky. 
Cawood helped spotlight the plight of coal miners suffering from black lung, an incurable occupational disease caused by breathing coal dust. He completed a legal services survey identifying injustices facing black lung victims. He recalled that some of those involved in the survey later became instrumental in the Black Lung Movement, demanding recognition and compensation for health damage and better dust control in mines.

Working for the Presbyterian Board of Missions, he helped launch the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund or AppalReD, which still provides legal services to low-income people across the region.
In Pineville, Cawood, a Presbyterian, became city attorney, president of the Pineville Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Salvation Army Board. He was a member of the Sierra Club and Masons and served on the Governor’s Task Force on Floods and the Pineville Flood Evacuation board. 
Stephen Ford, then a reporter for the Courier Journal in Louisville, covered widespread flooding in Eastern Kentucky in 1977. “Pineville was inundated by the Cumberland River,” he recalled. “Most of the town was under water, and it was completely inaccessible by road. I was able to get to Pineville on a boat operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Cawoods’ house was on dry ground on a hillside, and Steve and Sissy immediately offered their home as a makeshift news bureau. Local reporters and I were able to work there.
“I suppose as an activist lawyer and someone with modest political aspirations, Steve felt comfortable working with the press. But I also think he deeply loved Pineville and Bell County, and he truly wanted people elsewhere to understand the grave crisis and destruction his community faced.
“That was characteristic of Steve. He stood ready whenever called upon to make contributions, large and small.”
Courier Journal reporters and editors began jokingly referring to Cawood’s office as the “Pineville bureau,” a place where reporters could write, make calls or just collect their wits and some good stories. 
Like many in Pineville, the Cawoods were involved in putting on the annual Mountain Laurel Festival at Pine Mountain State Park. His wife has a photo of Steve at age 5 serving as a train bearer for the festival’s queen with the late Gov. Earle Clements in the background.
Recovery
Sissy Cawood said her husband “would want others to know there is a good life in sobriety” and that he “earned” a chip for 29 years of sobriety in August. Her husband, she said, was grateful to Alcoholics Anonymous and his sponsor, Al Smith, the founding host of Kentucky Educational Television’s “Comment on Kentucky.” 
From right, Steve Cawood, Sissy Cawood and Neale Bennett, past president of the Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival. (. (Facebook)
Smith’s sponsorship “was not an easy job,” Sissy Cawood said, “as Steve dealt with feelings of anger, frustration and whatever else alcohol does to your brain after a lifetime of drinking.”
Smith’s wife, Martha Helen Smith, asked Cawood to speak at Smith’s memorial service in 2021. “Al thought the world of Steve,” she said.
Frankfort
In 1980, Cawood, a Democrat, was elected to the state House of Representatives and quickly made a name for himself.
House Speaker Bill Kenton appointed Cawood to chair the House subcommittee on strip mining, which overhauled Kentucky’s law to meet tougher federal standards enacted by Congress in 1977. 
“Add his black-lung efforts and other legal work for miners, and you have one of the greatest bodies of work of any Kentuckian to protect people in the mountains from the adverse effects of what was their major industry. I am proud to have been his friend,” said Al Cross, emeritus journalism professor at the University of Kentucky.
Former House Speaker Greg Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, entered the House in 1980 with Cawood.
“Steve Cawood had a good moral compass. Everything he did was for the right reasons — whether it be for the environment or the people of Eastern Kentucky,” said Stumbo. “He had to walk a tightrope sometimes in his political battles, and he failed, like all of us, sometimes. But he represented the kind of person in government that we need more of today. He was willing to reach across the aisle to work with his political opponents if he knew that was the right thing to do for the people.”
Rocky Adkins, Beshear’s senior adviser and a longtime friend of Cawood, said, “Steve Cawood was a true and trusted friend, and I was lucky to know and work with him for years. We were focused on making our state a better place for families — especially in our home of Eastern Kentucky. This is a tough loss, but I know his legacy will continue on. Leah and I are praying for Steve’s family.” 
Former state representative and chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party Jerry Lundergan, of Lexington, was also in the House’s freshman class of 1980. 
“You didn’t have to talk to Steve Cawood very long to tell where his interests were. They were in Eastern Kentucky,” said Lundergan. “At an early meeting with Greg and me, Steve wanted us to be sure to know how important the severance tax on coal was to Eastern Kentucky. He was a model citizen-legislator.”
Cawood lost his bid for reelection to another Democrat, Pearl Ray Lefevers, but remained a citizen activist.
Advocacy
He was one of the early members of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence which advocated for the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990. He took the challenge of reform seriously and ran for the Pineville Independent school board. He became its chair, hired a new superintendent and worked to create a space between the old and new schools called the Commons that became a community venue in Pineville as well as a place for students. 
Cawood worked to protect his region’s water and forests. He collaborated on successful legal efforts to protect the watersheds that supply Pineville and Middlesboro from the effects of mining. He was a supporter of the Kentucky Natural Lands Trust, especially its efforts to preserve Blanton Forest in Harlan County. 
In his later years, Cawood, a railroad buff, worked on moving archives of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad from a basement in Bowling Green to the Tennessee Rail Museum in Chattanooga where they are now housed.He did the legal work and negotiations at no charge because of his lifelong love of trains, Sissy Cawood said.
He also assisted Dr. John Fox, a Lexington surgeon, in identifying pioneer Daniel Boone’s actual steps through Kentucky.
For fun, Cawood amassed a large collection of scrip, currency used to pay coal miners that was redeemable only at stores owned by the coal company that employed them. 
James Branscome, a journalist and retired managing director of Standard & Poor’s, has known Cawood since 1971.
“Of all the mountain advocates for miners and others in Eastern Kentucky, I don’t know of anyone who has been the source of more information for journalists, congressional staffers, fellow attorneys, organized black lung groups, and labor leaders like the United Mine Workers Association,” said Branscome.
“Steve was a highly respected source for the latest news on topics related to coal and miners, coal history, and virtually any topic related to Appalachia, and especially black lung and black lung regulation and compensation. 
“He was a frequent visitor with friends for trout fishing and camping in the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee. He and Sissy vacationed on Pawley’s Island, South Carolina, almost every year.”
Funeral arrangements are pending.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump has endorsed an opponent to challenge Northern Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie. 
In a lengthy Friday evening post to Truth Social, Trump said he hoped Ed Gallrein “gets into the Race against Massie” and was highly critical of the incumbent congressman, calling him “a Weak and Pathetic RINO from the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky, a place I love, and won big SIX TIMES” who “must be thrown out of office, ASAP!” 
Ed Gallrein
A a former Navy Seal from Shelby County, Gallrein has not formally announced a run in the 4th Congressional District, but the president’s “Complete and Total Endorsement” makes the case for why he should. Shelby County is in the southern part of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. 
Gallrein lost a competitive Republican primary to state Sen. Aaron Reed in the 7th Senate District last year. Former state Sen. Adrienne Southworth lost the race amid tension within her caucus. Gallrein was seen as the establishment candidate in the primary, having a donation from Republican Senate President Robert Stivers and an endorsement from the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. 
Reed’s name had been floated as a possible challenger to Massie this summer, but he told reporters in August that he was “happy being a senator right now” and was preparing for the 2026 legislative session.
Massie recently toured the congressional district with ally U.S. Sen. Rand Paul for a mix of official and campaign events. During that, Paul, a leader of Tea Party Republicans, said he was ready to endorse Massie and if someone asked about waiting to see who could run against the congressman, “I can’t imagine that they’d even try it.”
In his post, Trump said “the Great People of Kentucky are wise to” Massie’s positions — which are sometimes at odds with the president. Trump said Massie “only votes against the Republican Party, making life very easy for the Radical Left.”  
“Unlike ‘lightweight’ Massie, a totally ineffective LOSER who has failed us so badly, CAPTAIN ED GALLREIN IS A WINNER WHO WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN,” Trump said. “Should he decide to challenge Massie, Captain Ed Gallrein has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, ED, RUN — MAGA!” 
Massie, whose brand of Republican politics has drawn a loyal base of Libertarian supporters in the congressional district, has been leading the charge to release the federal investigation files on convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein. Though the president campaigned on declassifying the files, Trump has more recently opposed releasing them.
Earlier this year, Massie also drew the president’s wrath for opposing Trump’s bombing of Iran and voting against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Trump has previously vowed to oust Massie from office. A super PAC tied to the president spent more than $1 million on ads against the congressman — without a clear challenger named yet. 
After Trump’s endorsement of Gallrein was issued, Massie pushed a fundraising link on X, saying “I can beat this candidate if I have your support.” Earlier this week, the congressman posted the best fundraising numbers of his career, including bringing in nearly $768,000 in contributions from July to September.
Massie told Politico that Gallrein is a “failed candidate and establishment hack” following Trump’s endorsement.
“After having been rejected by every elected official in the 4th District, Trump’s consultants clearly pushed the panic button with their choice of failed candidate and establishment hack Ed Gallrein,” Massie said. “Ed’s been begging them to pick him for over three months now.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2204622175-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 10:00:18.284436

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s two largest airports aren’t airing a video by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that blames Democrats for the government shutdown.  
Officials with the biggest airport in the state — Omaha-based airport Eppley Airfield — aren’t playing the video because DHS and the Transportation Security Administration have not requested to show the video at the Omaha airport or on its screens or systems, an Eppley Airfield spokesperson said. The airport in Lincoln lacks video monitors in its TSA screening area, so the video can’t be played. 
Omaha and Lincoln join airports in Atlanta, Buffalo, N.Y., Charlotte, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Jersey, Phoenix, Portland, Ore., and Seattle that have confirmed not playing the Noem video. Airport officials in those states point to local policies and state laws restricting politicking in those spaces for the reason, according to NPR. Texas airports are refusing to play the video for similar reasons.
Airports typically run most videos from the Homeland Security head on screens at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, but these generally relate to safety information and don’t get political.

The video posted by White House shows Noem saying it’s “​​TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” but “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
With the federal government shut down and no end in sight, the Trump administration has used government websites and agencies  — which are supposed to avoid politicking — in a messaging battle over who is to blame for Congress not funding the federal government, for the shutdown. 
For example, websites for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development posted messages blaming the “Radical Left” in Congress. The Trump administration is also inserting language in some automated email responses blaming Democrats for the impasse. 
Democratic senators now allege that the Department of Homeland Security violated the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that prohibits political activities of federal employees to ensure government programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, by asking airports to play the video blaming Democrats for the shutdown. It’s unlikely Noem would face any consequences, according to legal experts.

Taxpayers will be on the hook for reprint costs after Dearborn, Michigan, printed and mailed out thousands of ballots that listed an incorrect candidate. But it’s unclear whether paying the bill will be the responsibility of the city or Wayne County.
City officials estimate that Dearborn printed about 10,000 ballots that incorrectly listed Mohammed Shegara as a candidate for City Council even though he dropped out of the race in April. Roughly 9,000 of those went out to voters, City Clerk George Darany told Votebeat.
To reprint and resend corrected ballots cost about $3,600, Darany said. The postage part of that, 21.3 cents per ballot, came out of the city’s account already, but no one has been billed yet for the reprint part, which is about 15 cents a ballot.
Darany said the error involved officials in both the city and county clerk’s offices — the county is responsible for designing the ballot — so the city may ask the county to shoulder part of the cost. County officials, for their part, say the cost should fall squarely on Dearborn.
When his office submitted the lists of candidates to the county in the spring, Darany said, officials noted multiple times that Shegara had dropped out of the race by the city’s deadline.
“Unfortunately, when we received the proof ballot (from the county), his name was still on it,” Darany said. His staff found and pointed out other errors, he said, but “we didn’t notice that person’s name.” (Shegara told the Detroit Free Press that he was confused when he saw his name on the ballot.)
Several people in the Dearborn Clerk’s office review the ballot, including the deputy clerk and the elections supervisor, but Darany is the final signoff.
While Wayne County officials designed the ballot, they said Dearborn should pay for the reprint, particularly as the ballot contains only local races: Dearborn’s mayor is up for reelection, as is Darany. The entire City Council is also on the ballot, alongside a proposal to expand the council and divide the city into wards for council representation.
“In this case, the Dearborn City Clerk and the Dearborn City Election Commission failed to correct the error on the ballot proof prior to approval,” Dorian Tyus, spokesperson for Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett, wrote in an email Wednesday.
The city clerk’s office and the city’s election commission “will be responsible for the cost of reprinting the ballots in this case,” Tyus wrote.
Genya Coulter, election systems analyst at the Open Source Election Technology Institute, said such issues with ballots are more common than people realize, particularly in places like Michigan where so many communities run their own elections.
In Owosso last summer, a misplaced decimal point meant a heading in a millage question was different from the question itself. No one caught the error until a few weeks before the election, “despite multiple rounds of proofreading,” City Clerk Amy Kohagen said at the time. (In an interview with Votebeat, she recalled the time years ago when a county ballot had the word “public” misspelled as “pubic.”) Reprints have also been required after candidates were incorrectly left off the ballot or after incorrect color coding meant voters got the wrong ballot for their precinct.
Coulter said Dearborn officials did the right thing after discovering the error by publicizing the problem early and immediately implementing a solution
That quick acknowledgement meant that only a small number of residents — about 5% of absentee voters — had actually returned the incorrect ballots before the problem was noticed, Darany said. Voters should have their new ballots, marked with a bright green sticker, in their hands already.
If voters return both ballots, the original ballot will be spoiled and the correct one will be processed. For voters who return the initial ballot but not the corrected one, poll workers will have to copy their choices onto a corrected ballot and process that one. Only one ballot will ultimately be counted for each voter.
That’s already a familiar procedure for the city, Darany said. Last year, the city had to process about 350 ballots that way because overseas and military voters’ ballots “come back on a form,” and the choices have to be copied onto a ballot for counting, he said.
This year, he expects that even with the error, that number of ballots that need to be copied over will be the same or lower. The city will have extra people on standby to help.
As for the cost, Darany figures the city is still ahead of the game.
“One thing people don’t know is that we were planning at the end of the November to give the City Council a report letting them know how much we saved this year on elections because we did some consolidations, which means fewer workers, fewer tabulators to test and so on,” Darany said. “We were prepared to give the council a letter saying we had saved $27,000 this year amid our effort to make our elections more efficient. Now it just might be $27,000 minus that $3,600.”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Demonstrators will gather in dozens of Colorado cities and towns on Saturday as part of a nationwide No Kings protest in opposition to President Donald Trump’s administration.
It’s expected to be the largest day of anti-Trump demonstrations since June, when an estimated 5 million Americans attended No Kings events held in at least 2,000 cities around the country. The No Kings movement’s organizers include a long list of liberal and progressive groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the ACLU.
Events are planned in Colorado communities as far-flung as Lamar, Fort Morgan, Steamboat Springs and Cortez, according to a map shared by organizers. They include a protest on the steps of the state Capitol in Denver, scheduled for noon, as well as one planned for 10:30 a.m. on Main Street in the Costilla County town of San Luis, population 628.

Organizers say they’re demonstrating against Trump’s “authoritarian actions and power grabs.” Since taking office in January, Trump has drawn widespread criticism and countless legal challenges to a series of attempted executive actions that run contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution, including the mass firings of federal workers and the freezing or cancellation of congressionally-authorized spending.
Trump has also invoked centuries-old wartime powers to justify an unprecedented immigration crackdown as he seeks to fulfill his promise to deport 12 million people living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. The latest No Kings protests come as Trump has ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the cities of Chicago and Portland, which he has falsely described as “war ravaged” in spite of recent nonviolent anti-ICE protests that have prominently featured inflatable animal costumes and naked bicycle rides.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, is among those who have encouraged Coloradans to demonstrate peacefully at Saturday’s protests. As attorney general, Weiser has sued the Trump administration at least 37 times since January on matters ranging from withheld funding and federal worker layoffs to tariffs and the administration’s attempt to end birthright citizenship.
“Show up at the No Kings rally on Oct. 18 at the Capitol — as many people as possible, and be as peaceful as possible,” Weiser told 9News in an interview last week. “Don’t be afraid to show up, but also, we’ve got to be peaceful.”

(Photo by Christina Lords/Idaho Capital Sun)America was born in protest. In fact, we might never have separated from Great Britain, were it not for a list of grievances written into our Declaration of Independence 249 years ago. The 13 British colonies had had enough of the arbitrary actions of King George III and peaceably advised him so in that treasured document. 
Several years later, with those grievances in mind and in hopes of preventing a recurrence of lawless actions by America’s new government, our ancestors wrote up a Constitution and Bill of Rights. Our First Amendment, guaranteed “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” The First Amendment stands out as a principal protection against arbitrary king-like rule.
Why this former Republican is going to a No Kings protest in Idaho

Ever since he took office in January, we have witnessed a growing contempt for the constitutional order, including free-speech rights, by Donald Trump and his MAGA crowd. If wide swaths of Americans object to his arbitrary, unconstitutional orders and actions, he and his minions don’t write it off as Americans exercising their constitutional rights. He sees it as a threat to his royal eminence. Those who protest are labeled as “domestic terrorists, agitators, anarchists” and even worse. 
Many who fear the path Trump is taking toward despotic rule have gathered in communities across the country to hold “No Kings” rallies. The purpose is to speak out against despotic words and unconstitutional action by the Trump regime. I spoke at a rally held on April 5 in Twin Falls by the local chapter of Indivisible. It was a well-attended patriotic rally of good, decent folks spanning the political spectrum.
The No Kings rallies across America on June 14 protested Trump’s lavish military parade in Washington that was timed to celebrate his kingly birth. The protest also called him out for his repeated and deliberate transgressions of the U.S. Constitution. The Indivisible patriots had to step forward because the cowardly GOP members of Congress don’t have the courage to stand up for the Constitution. Idaho’s U.S. House and U.S. Senate members – Sens. Risch and Crapo and Reps. Simpson and Fulcher – know Trump is trampling over the Constitution, but they don’t have the courage to protest, being much more interested in maintaining their political offices. Thank Heaven for the First Amendment. 
Another Indivisible rally is scheduled for 2,200 communities throughout America on Oct. 18, including Boise, Idaho Falls, Hailey, Moscow, Pocatello, and Twin Falls. I’ll be speaking at the one in Twin Falls. Many concerned, civic-minded folks will attend.
Trump’s obedient sycophants, like U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, have condemned those who are concerned by Trump’s march to despotism. Johnson called the upcoming rally a “hate America rally” of the “antifa, pro-Hamas crowd and the Marxists.” 
That’s quite a mix and match of ideologies and dead wrong on all counts.
It is interesting how antifa, an ideology that opposes fascism, always manages to get woven into the MAGA worldview as the root of all evil. It is not an organization and does not hold meetings or carry out sinister actions. Even if it were an actual group, the idea of opposing fascism is not really obnoxious, unless you happen to be a fascist. Mussolini would have tried to stamp them out.
Nevertheless, Donald Trump has had it in for antifa for many years. During his first term, Trump said he would be “designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization” for allegedly inciting violence during Black Lives Matter protests. A June 2020 protest in Spokane sparked a panic in Coeur d’Alene when false rumors spread about an antifa invasion of North Idaho. 
Armed citizens lined the streets to fight off the ideology. Not a single antifan materialized.  As far as anyone knows, Trump has not yet been able to produce a picture of an antifan or antifa gathering, making them as elusive as the Northern Sasquatch.
But, even if antifa were not more than just a way of thinking, why shouldn’t those who hate fascism have the right to think and speak their beliefs under the First Amendment? Trump seems to think they should be rounded up and punished. What could be a more clearcut violation of free speech rights?
The idea that America should not return to rule by a king, be it Trump or some other wannabe monarch, will be revisited on the 250th commemoration of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2025. I pray that he will not have managed, with his 10,000 more ICE agents funded by the Big Beautiful Billionaires Bill, to impose his vision of a kingship on our beloved democratic republic. 
With the good work of Indivisible and other American patriotic organizations, we might well survive as a free nation.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, said he would largely side with Democratic leaders in the current partisan dispute that has the federal government shut down and has pitted Senate Democrats against President Donald Trump. 
While campaigning in Jackson on Oct. 11 at Jackson State University’s homecoming game, Colom told Mississippi Today that if he were a U.S. senator from Mississippi, he would pressure congressional leaders to reach a deal on health insurance costs alongside an agreement to fund the government. 
At the heart of the government shutdown fight is a dispute over extending expiring subsidies that help people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Colom said this is “common sense policy” for Mississippi. 
Hyde-Smith, Mississippi’s former agriculture commissioner and a former state senator, has voted with the Republican leadership in favor of funding the government, but punts the issues of the health insurance subsidies.  
She wrote on social media that Democratic senators were putting on a “political show” by not agreeing to pass a bill to fund the government without promised protections for the subsidies. 

If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the cost of insurance will go up on average $480 annually for an estimated 285,000 Mississippians on the federal health exchange, according to KFF, a national nonprofit health care research organization. The premiums would increase significantly for some Mississippians.

Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF, and Mississippi has one of the highest percentages of residents who don’t have health insurance. 
Some Republicans argue that Congress should debate the subsidies once the government is funded, but most Democratic senators have said they should act urgently to extend them because they will expire in the coming months. 
Colom, like most of the current Democratic senators, said the deal on funding the government should happen concurrently with an agreement over the subsidies because less affluent Mississippians would suffer without the extra government assistance.
“It has to be at the same time,” Colom said. “We have to do it at the same time.” 
Colom, the current district attorney in the Golden Triangle area, also criticized Hyde-Smith for not using her close relationship with Trump to negotiate a deal on the subsidies or the shutdown.

“Why do we have a senator who is constantly giving away her voice?” Colom said of Hyde-Smith. “Why isn’t she in the negotiating room?” 

“Democrats have repeatedly refused a clean, bipartisan bill to reopen the government,” Hyde-Smith said. “Everyday Americans are beginning to feel the pain, and it will only get worse as this unnecessary Democratic shutdown continues. This did not have to happen.” 
The U.S. government shut down on Oct. 1, and federal lawmakers have been unable to reach an agreement for three weeks now on how to fund and reopen it.

There are almost 1.1 million licensed physicians in the United States. That may sound like a lot, but the country has struggled for decades to train enough physicians to meet its needs – and, in particular, to provide care in rural and underserved communities.
Foreign-born physicians have long filled that gap, reducing the overall national shortage and signing up to practice in often overlooked regions and specialties. Today, 1 in 5 doctors licensed to practice in the U.S. were born and trained in another country.
But the ability of physicians from other countries to obtain work in the U.S. may be threatened by the Trump administration’s aims of limiting foreign workers. In September, Trump issued a proclamation requiring employers sponsoring foreign-born workers through a type of work visa called an H-1B to pay a fee of US$100,000 to the government. The White House has signaled doctors may be exempt but has not clarified its position.
As a physician and professor who studies the intersection of business and medicine, I believe increasing restrictions on H-1B visas for physicians may exacerbate the physician shortage. To grasp why that is, it’s important to understand how foreign-trained doctors became such an integral part of U.S. health care – and the role they play today.
 
The roots of today’s physician shortage

	The Association of American Medical Colleges, a trade association representing U.S. medical schools, estimates there will be a deficit of about 86,000 physicians in the country by 2036.
The roots of this shortage stretch back more than a century. In 1910, a landmark study called the Flexner Report detailed significant inconsistencies in the quality of education at American medical schools. The report resulted in the closure of over half the country’s medical schools, winnowing their numbers down from 148 to 66 over two decades.
As a result, the number of doctors in the U.S. declined until new training programs emerged. Between 1960 and 1980, 40 new medical schools launched with the help of federal funding. In 1980, a congressionally mandated assessment deemed the problem solved, but by the early 2000s, a physician shortage emerged once more. In 2006, the American Association of Medical Colleges called for raising medical school enrollment by 30%.
Growth in medical school enrollment hit that target in the late 2010s, but even so, the U.S. still lacks enough medical graduates to fill yearslong training programs, called residencies, that early-career physicians must complete to become fully qualified to practice.
Especially lacking are primary care physicians – particularly in rural areas, where there are one-third as many physicians per capita as in urban areas.
 
Opportunities for foreign-born doctors

	Even as the U.S. built up medical school enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, the government joined other countries such as the U.K. and Canada in creating immigration policies that drew physicians from developing countries to practice in underserved areas. Between 1970 and 1980, their numbers grew sharply, from 57,000 to 97,000.
Foreign-born and -trained physicians have remained a key pillar of the U.S. medical system. In recent years, the majority of those physicians have come from India and Pakistan. Citizens of Canada and Middle Eastern countries have added significantly to that count, as well. Most arrive in the U.S. as trainees in residency programs through one of two main visa programs.
The majority come on J-1 visas, which allow physicians to enter the U.S. for training but require them to return to their home country for at least two years when their training is complete. Those who wish to remain in the U.S. to practice must transition to an H-1B visa.
A small percentage of physicians come to the U.S. on H-1Bs from the start.
H-1B visas are employer-sponsored temporary work permits that allow foreign-born, highly skilled workers to obtain U.S. employment. Employers directly petition the government on behalf of visa applicants, certifying that a foreign worker will be paid a similar wage to U.S. workers and will not adversely affect the working conditions of Americans.
Several programs sponsor H-1B visas for physicians, though the most common requires a three-year commitment to work in an underserved area after completing their training.
 
Foreign physicians fill a crucial need

	In 2025, foreign-trained medical graduates filled 9,700 of the nearly 40,000 training positions. Of those, roughly one-third were actually U.S. citizens who attended medical schools in other countries, with the remainder being foreign citizens seeking more training in the U.S.
After residency, these doctors frequently practice in precisely the geographic areas where the physician shortage is most severe. A nationwide survey of international medical graduates found that two-thirds practice in regions that the federal government has designated as lacking sufficient access to health care.
These doctors also occupy a disproportionate number of primary care positions. In a sample of 15,000 physicians who accepted new jobs in one year, foreign-born doctors were nine times more likely to enter primary care specialties. In 2025, 33.3% of internal medicine, 20.4% of pediatric and 17.6% of family medicine training positions were filled by physicians trained in other countries.
 
Who will pay?
Approximately 8,000 foreign-born physicians received H-1B visas in 2024. The new requirement of a $100,000 sponsorship fee would hit hardest for hospitals, health systems and clinics in areas of the country most significantly affected by the physician shortage.
These organizations are already under economic strain due to increasing labor costs and Medicare payments that have not kept pace with inflation. Dozens of these hospitals have closed in recent years, and many currently do not make enough money to support their operations.
On Sept. 25, 2025, 57 physician organizations cosigned a letter petitioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to waive the new application fee for physicians.
Already, however, the new rule may be having a chilling effect. Despite years of annual growth in the number of foreign-born applicants to U.S. physician training programs, 2025 has seen a nearly 10% drop. If the new H-1B fee is applied to physicians, the number is likely to keep falling.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Five years ago, on the second floor of Teachers College Hall at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, my wife and I took turns rocking our 1-year-old son while we pored over our laptops. My doctoral studies in the Department of Educational Administration were in full swing.
Amid the chaos of dissertation drafts and grant proposals, Educational Administration faculty didn’t just teach — they became family. Without them, I wouldn’t have had the support to graduate and become a professor of educational leadership at North Dakota State University.
Yet Nebraska’s Educational Administration department — the only Ph.D.-granting educational leadership program in the state — faces dire cuts that would hurt not just Ph.D. students, but also schools and students throughout the state.
On Sept. 12, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett announced a $27.5 million budget cut to address a $21 million deficit, plus $6.5 million in proactive cuts. This proposal would eliminate the Educational Administration Department entirely, resulting in the loss of 17 faculty and staff positions and the termination of key doctoral programs, including the Ph.D./Ed.D. in educational studies and the Ed.D. in educational administration.
Cutting the department accounts for $1.95 million of those savings. But it would come at a great cost. The department serves over 300 graduate students each year, delivering thousands of credit hours of instruction last academic year alone. It has strong retention and completion rates that outpace broader higher ed trends. These hours net the university $383 per credit hour from in-state students — a sizable contribution to UNL, in addition to grants that faculty obtain.
Alums like me — a lifelong Husker and four-time alum — fan out across Nebraska and beyond. Many serve in leadership roles for their school districts as principals and superintendents. Others pursue careers in higher education as faculty, impacting policy and research.
One such person, a close friend and recent graduate of the program, is a rural principal in Nebraska. When we talked about the department being closed, he explained that the biggest issue he saw would be the lack of understanding of the importance of research in driving practice in schools. Many school practices rely on experience rather than new ideas. Strong research programs help schools use more innovative approaches that better prepare students for careers.
Zoom out, and the ripple effects worsen. The U.S. faces a dire shortage of school leaders. Qualified principals can boost student achievement by up to 25%, reduce teacher turnover in high-need areas and champion policies that break down barriers for students to ensure everyone can succeed.
In Nebraska’s rural areas, where districts already struggle to attract talent, the Educational Administration Department has been a homegrown solution, producing leaders who understand Cornhusker State realities from small school mergers to choice in curricula. Without the department, students will lose out on leaders who learned how to make difficult choices and enhance the lives of students and teachers.
To be clear, budgets often involve difficult decisions. Over the past five years, UNL has already trimmed $75 million from its budget amid stagnant state funding and enrollment pressures. But targeting the Educational Administration Department is a quick fix that will backfire. Its metrics, vibrant enrollment and high-impact research demonstrate its value to taxpayers and the community.
Rather than cut the department, the budget committee might explore other alternatives in the plan, such as using some of the projected $17.25 million saved from administrative reorganizations and voluntary resignations to maintain the Educational Administration Department, leaving a surplus of $15.35 million.
Nebraska deserves the opportunity for every aspiring educator to enroll in a program that has high standards and high involvement. If the goal is to increase tuition revenue and state appropriations, cutting a department as pivotal as this one won’t work.
Even the threat of eliminating the department is detrimental to future success, as future students are significantly less likely to enroll in a program they believe might be eliminated.
Moreover, as a land-grant, flagship university, UNL’s mandate is to enhance Nebraska’s public good, with a focus on education at the forefront. Seen in that light, maintaining the Educational Administration Department is mission-critical.
Erasing the department that trains leaders and educators sends the wrong message: When times get tight, we turn our backs on the very systems that help hold our communities together.

(Photo provided by the Alaska National Guard)After the latest catastrophic storm hit Western Alaska, displacing more than 1,500 people, killing at least one and leaving villages in ruins, residents face an existential crisis. 
Will the wide delta that fans out between the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers and has supported one of the circumpolar north’s largest Indigenous populations for millennia continue to be a place where Alaska’s Yupik people can live?
One elder has his doubts.
“We’re not going to be well. Storms are going to get worse, and it’s not going to be livable,” said Mike Williams Sr., a tribal leader from the Kuskokwim River village of Akiak. “We’re past the tipping point, maybe.”
Fairbanks-based scientist Torre Jorgenson, who has studied the region for decades, has doubts as well.
Intertwined climate change forces make long-term prospects grim in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, according to a wide-ranging scientific study he led. The study was published in mid-August, just two months before the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit on Oct. 12. 
Coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, sea-level rise, intrusion of saltwater into freshwater systems – are combining with storm surges to dramatically transform the coastal area, damaging communities and the food resources that have sustained Yup’ik people for centuries, the study said.
Of the 18 villages on the outer coastal area of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, at least 10 will likely have to be relocated, said Jorgenson, who is affiliated with the University of Alaska Fairbanks while operating an independent science consulting company.
The at-risk villages sit atop permafrost that, when intact, is a platform a meter or two above the region’s salt marshes, Jorgenson said. That permafrost is no longer intact, and it will likely disappear in the next two to three decades, he said.
“So the ground is going down, and the water is coming up, and they’ll be unlivable,” he said
If those villages move, they will follow the lead of Newtok. The village of about 350 escaped erosion and flooding by moving farther inland to a site called Mertarvik, but the effort took decades and is still challenged by infrastructure problems.
Williams, of Akiak, said it is not easy for coastal villages to find suitable relocation spots. “Even though they head toward higher ground, there’s a lot of wind in the higher ground,” he said.

	But some residents of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok are determined to stay and rebuild, and others who evacuated to return. 
“We will go back, because it’s our home,” said Missy Chuckwuk of Kipnuk, waiting in line to board an evacuation flight in Bethel on Wednesday, with her husband and their three children. Once freeze-up hits, the community will begin to move homes back that floated away, she said.
An estimated 50 to 100 people stayed and did not evacuate from Kipnuk, according to a representative with the Alaska National Guard, and 200 to 300 people in Kwigillingok. 
Jorgenson said necessary action in the most at-risk villages will be expensive.
“They can do kind of short-term adaptation, but over the period of decades, they are going to be looking at having to relocate, and there’s going to be a huge, enormous cost to that,” he said. Newtok’s relocation cost hundreds of millions of dollars, he noted. “And if you’re looking at 10 or more villages that have to move, who’s going to come up with the money for that?”
Combined climate change forces amplify each other
For the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the connected climate change forces include sea ice retreat. It erases the frozen barrier that prevented waves from reaching shore during late-fall and winter storms. By the end of the century, Jorgenson said, the ice-free season in the Bering Sea will last approximately 8.5 months, with ice forming two months later in the fall and melting a month earlier in the spring, he said.
Bering Sea residents already got a taste of the future in 2018, he said, when winter ice was scarcer than at any time in the past 150 years of records.
Storm surges and floods enhance permafrost thaw, Jorgenson said. Saltwater pushed ashore kills tundra plants that make up an insulating mat, thus allowing more heat to penetrate the surface and thaw yet more permafrost.
Beyond damaging homes and villages, the changes hurt people’s ability to gather wild food in their traditional ways, Jorgensen said.
Earlier sea ice melt exposes coastal regions to more flooding in the critical spring nesting season time for migratory birds that are residents’ sources of eggs and meat, Jorgenson said. Saltwater intrusion is changing habitat for migrating birds that use the region, which is a major nesting and breeding site for several species. Saltwater intrusion also contaminates drinking water supplies. Permafrost thaw undermines the once-stable areas that have been long used for traditional hunting camps and that have produced wild food, he said.

	“These permafrost plateaus are really very rich areas,” he said. “Those have been really important berry picking areas, and those are going to disappear pretty soon.”
The origins of this fall’s storm, like Merbok three years ago, lie far to the west, in the North Pacific Ocean. There, water has become hotter; a new marine heatwave is currently underway. The ocean heat amplifies seasonal storms that reach Alaska, like Typhoon Halong and the Typhoon Merbok, which sent destructive floods and high winds across the region in 2022.
While Merbok formed in a part of the ocean that is normally too cool to produce typhoons and Halong formed in a more standard ocean spot, both storms picked up intensity from unusual North Pacific heat, said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“Passing over near or at-record warm sea surface temperatures outside of the tropics, that’s something that both of those storms have in common,” Thoman said.
Such ocean heat will not always be present, but it is likely to be more frequent, he said. “The trend is going only one way,” he said.
People of the Yukon-Kuskokwim recognize the trend.
Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Ana Hoffman, in her opening address at the organization’s annual convention on Thursday, spoke directly to her fellow Yup’ik people about it, hundreds of whom had been evacuated by then to Anchorage.
“You were at the forefront of this recent storm and endured what is now becoming a new reality here: typhoons in the Arctic,” she said.
Climate change threats in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and other parts of rural Alaska have long been recognized by state and federal government agencies and by state and regional organizations like the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Subsistence Regional Advisory Council.
Wiliams said there have been warnings for several decades. Speaking during a break Tuesday in this week’s Elders and Youth Conference in Anchorage, he said he remembers listening to elders talk 50 years ago about the big changes to come.
“They said, ‘The weather is going to be changing, and we’re going to have more frequent storms, and it’s going to get warmer,’” he said,

	Those predictions come true, Williams said.
“We used to have seven feet of ice on the river; now it’s three feet. And the permafrost is going away pretty fast. Tundra communities are sinking,” he said.
State Sen. Lyman Hoffman, who has represented Western Alaska for four decades, attested to similar observations.
“There has been more and more warming that is disrupting lives in the Y-K Delta,” the Bethel Democrat said at a Monday news conference held by Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said the latest storm should be seen as a call to action.
“We know this is not going to be, unfortunately, the last typhoon,” Edgmon said in his address Friday at the Alaska Federation of Natives Conference. “We need to be very conscious about living in a  state with a changing climate.” That is necessary for “a future that doesn’t involve waking up in the middle of the night and having water come up from your floor and 100-mile-an-hour winds and your house floating off somewhere,” he said.
Trump administration cuts
The Trump administration, however, does not share that perspective.
The administration canceled previously awarded grants intended to prevent damages in rural Alaska from disasters that have been exacerbated by climate change – including a $20 million grant for coastal erosion control in Kipnuk, a village of about 700 that was one of the communities hardest hit by ex-typhoon Halong.
The Kipnuk grant was among several awarded during the Biden administration to rural Alaska communities under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Community Change Grant Program. The grants were for work like permafrost and shoreline protection, renewable energy development and permafrost protection.
Trump administration officials characterized those projects as unnecessary projects. In a post on the social media site X, EPA Administrator Lee Zelden called them “wasteful DEI and Environmental Justice grants.”
EPA officials defended the cut.
“The ‘environmental justice’ funding cancelled by EPA would not have prevented or safeguarded the community from the mass destruction and tragedy caused by such a large and devastating typhoon,” Brigit Hirsch, the agency’s press secretary, said by email on Friday.

	Administration cuts to the National Weather Service, part of broader cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, likely had an effect on the weather forecast and interfered with  preparations for ex-Typhoon Halong’s impacts in Alaska.
Thoman said predictions for Halong’s path into Alaska, made after Trump administration cuts forced reductions in rural Alaska weather staff and monitoring, were not as accurate as those for Merbok in 2022. Atmospheric observations from weather balloons have been cut in Kotzebue, Bethel, St. Paul and Cold Bay, and technical problems prevented the normal launches in Nome, he noted. “It’s almost inconceivable that that lack of upper-air observations had no effect,” he said.
The Government Accounting Office has already identified National Weather Service cuts as a problem. The shortage of meteorologists has created a need for “urgent action” to protect aviation safety, said a GAO report issued on Aug. 28.
Also axed by the Trump administration was a Federal Emergency Management Agency program aimed at preventing disaster damage; a statement from the agency called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program “wasteful and ineffective,” even though earlier analysis found it saved $6 in response cost for every $1 in preparation spending.
Overall, Trump administration cuts to FEMA have undermined the agency’s ability to respond to disasters that are increasing in frequency, according to a Sept. 2 GAO report. FEMA has lost about a tenth of its staff, compromising its capabilities, and there are similar concerns about disaster responses at the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the GAO said.
In the short term, Alaska Native organizations were waiting this week for FEMA assistance. Resolutions passed by the Association of Village Council Presidents, a group of Yup’ik tribal governments, and the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corp., the largest tribal health provider for the region, and other groups have requested a presidential disaster declaration and the aid that comes with it.
Gov. Dunleavy on Thursday sent a formal request for a presidential declaration, not just for the Yukon-Kuskokwim area but also for northwestern Alaska, which was lashed days earlier by remnants of the typhoon.
As of Friday, the disaster response was being led by the state, according to a FEMA statement. But opportunities for immediate action beyond evacuations and temporary shelter were limited.
“There is very little time to do anything, like even dry stuff out at this point,” Thoman said. “Winter is nigh.”

Dan Sullivan during his address on Friday to the Alaska Federation of Natives.
Several demonstrators stood and turned their backs to the senator as he spoke, and some held signs reading “Medicaid matters” and “Public radio saves lives.”

Sullivan did not acknowledge the protesters or stop speaking during a roughly half hour of remarks to the ballroom of attendees. The three-day conference in Anchorage is the largest representative gathering of Native peoples in the state, drawing roughly 6,000 people each year. 
Protesters stood on behalf of a variety of issues. Some were residents of the community of Ambler, some advocates and supporters, all opposing the proposed Ambler Road, a 211-mile road to a mining district, recently advanced by the Trump administration with the support of Sullivan.
“Crossing hundreds of streams, it will affect everything,” said Teresa Clarke, executive director of the Yukon River Inter-tribal Watershed Council, a coalition representing 74 tribes and First Nations from Canada, opposing the proposed development, saying it risks environmental degradation.
“We’re already affected by extreme weather events, as we’ve realized this past week, and those types of events will probably speed up more extreme events and then degradation, melting of more permafrost, it will affect the animals, and everything,” she said, referring to severe storms that have devastated coastal communities.

Following the event, Amanda Coynce, a spokesperson for Sullivan, responded to the protest repeating the senators positions on Medicaid and public radio, and saying “Senator Sullivan welcomes respectful debate. He listens to all Alaskans on Ambler.”
Aubrey Weber, executive director of the non-profit advocacy group 907 Initiative, criticized Sullivan’s refusal to hold public events or town halls this year after his support of the Trump administration. 
“​​Well, this is the only public event he’s done all year, and the public has been routinely, repeatedly asking him to show up and hear from constituents,” Weber said. “And he’s pretty quick to go to a private event with donors, you know, something that’s maybe $500 a plate, but he’s not coming and talking to Alaskans. And so this is one of the very few opportunities that we had to voice our opinions.”
Weber was among those who stood to protest Sullivan’s support of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the Trump administration’s landmark legislation advancing the conservative blueprint for government known as Project 2025 that passed this summer. It included tax cuts as well as cuts to social services like Medicaid and funding for public media.

“The simple fact of the matter, standing up here and saying nobody’s getting cut from Medicaid is a lie, because you cannot take a trillion dollars from the federal Medicaid budget, give those to millionaires and billionaires in the form of tax cuts and then open up this $50 billion rural health care fund. You know, one of those numbers is much bigger than the other,” he said.
Weber said the proposed cuts to Medicaid — and health insurance premium tax credits being bitterly debated during the federal government shutdown — will hurt Alaskans and the health care system, and he urged the senator to support funding and re-opening the federal government.
“Listen to Alaskans. Do what’s right for Alaskans,” he said. “Stop being a yes man for party bosses and stand up for your constituents.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSCF8622-scaled-e1760759733717-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-10-17 23:57:00.995874

(Photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Department of Transportation showed an alarming disregard for the nation’s security a few weeks ago by clawing back a $47.3 million grant intended to launch a new era of steel production at Sparrows Point.
Members of our union, the United Steelworkers (USW), are profoundly disappointed by the Trump administration’s abandonment of a project primed to create jobs, boost manufacturing capacity and meet our country’s growing energy needs.
But it’s important to emphasize that the government’s turnabout represents only a setback, not the end of this forward-looking initiative.
The USW and our partner, US Wind, remain committed to bringing steel back to Baltimore and injecting new life into Sparrows Point. We’re confident that this site, once the home of the largest steel mill in the world, has yet another pivotal role to play in America’s future.
The USW and US Wind joined forces about four years ago. We intend to use a portion of the mill property to build monopiles — the huge foundations sunk into the seabed to support wind turbines — through a new company called Sparrows Point Steel.

Over the full scope of US Wind’s offshore projects, the company will consume more than 330,000 metric tons of steel plate, a huge boon to the steel industry. This is directly in line with the Trump administration’s stated goal of building more in America — and makes the administration’s cancellation of the grant all the more puzzling.
Current projections call for Sparrows Point Steel to employ more than 500 USW members in production, maintenance and a variety of other roles. We’re talking about good-paying, middle-class jobs that enable workers to support their families and lift up the entire community.
Our commitment to building out the wind energy supply chain means sourcing not only our steel plate but many other kinds of materials and supplies from domestic producers. In all, workers from nearly 50 companies across Maryland will benefit from vendor relationships with Sparrows Point Steel.
On top of that, US Wind intends to establish an operations and maintenance center at the harbor in West Ocean City. This facility will coordinate turbine and substation maintenance for offshore wind developments, creating still more jobs in the manufacturing, maritime and energy sectors.
But there’s more. While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.
Our work will help to position America as the leader in a global, evolving industry. It will also help to deliver a more reliable energy supply at a time of growing demand and more frequent disruptions in the power grid resulting from climate change.
Marylanders get this.
A recent poll found that seven out of 10 respondents support the construction of wind projects off the Maryland coast because of their potential to stabilize energy prices, enhance the nation’s energy supply and reduce pollution.
The respondents’ support cut across political lines, underscoring the high stakes. What’s more, 81% opposed the reversal of offshore wind projects already underway out of concern for job losses, according to the survey, conducted by Turn Forward, a nonprofit supporting wind energy.
Sparrows Point is hallowed ground for the USW.
At one time, tens of thousands of union members worked here, producing the steel that built the middle class, fueled prosperity and made America a superpower.
We now have an opportunity to build on that legacy — to harness manufacturing and energy for a stronger future.
With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do. Alongside our partners at US Wind, we’ll get the job done.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210803_104844-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 05:56:22.755405

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland will not be able to enforce part of a 2021 law that allowed it to obscure the costs of a digital ad tax from consumers who were paying it.
The order — which will not be appealed by the state — strikes down one portion of the first-of-its-kind tax on digital advertising within the state. That provision prohibited online companies from alerting consumers to the tax, by passing it on to them as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills.
Opponents of the law had said that it required them to collect the tax but prohibited them from telling customers where the tax came from — shielding lawmakers who approved the tax from criticism, and violating the businesses’ free speech rights, they said.
U.S. District Court Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, in a one-page order Wednesday, issued a declaratory judgement in favor of the tech industry that had sued to block the tax, saying the targeted provision of the law “facially violates the First Amendment.”
Griggsby permanently barred the state from enforcing that provision, but left the digital advertising tax in place, for now.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore), a sponsor of the 2021 bill, did not respond to a request for comment Friday. A spokesperson for the Office of the Comptroller said the office has Griggsby’s final order under review.
Appeals court rules provision of digital ad tax violates First Amendment protections

The case is just one of several challenges brought by NetChoice, a trade group representing large technology and social media companies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA).
A challenge to the tax itself remains open in Maryland Tax Court. The case was filed by big tech firms, including Apple and Meta. The state has collected nearly $419 million from the tax since 2022, according to the Office of the Comptroller.
An official with the NetChoice Litigation Center called Griggsby’s order “a victory for free speech, political discourse and internet freedom.”
“The Fourth Circuit was clear: states cannot shield themselves from criticism by preventing companies from highlighting the consequences of a new policy,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement.
“Businesses will finally be able to see that Maryland’s policies are directly impacting their bottom line. And Maryland will have to reckon with that,” Taske said.
Griggsby’s order comes two months after a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the provision violated the First Amendment. The panel sent the case back to Griggsby, who in 2024 had sided with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. Even so, she allowed the law to stand because the offending provision had “many constitutional applications.”
The 2021 law targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta, and Google.
Under the law, companies reporting gross global annual revenue of at least $100 million are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.
The state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the state’s education reform program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The sharply worded July ruling invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act. Circuit Judge Julius Richardson, in that ruling, wrote “complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.”
The questioned provision in the tax bill was intended to shield lawmakers from public criticism. The provision went too far, Richardson wrote.
“Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,” Richardson wrote for the court. “Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.”
The court’s ruling noted that elected officials might have a reason for such a provision, but “keeping out of hot water with voters” cannot be a justification.
“If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,” he wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Greenbelt-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 04:56:41.237867

(File photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)The University System of Maryland Board of Regents held a special, closed-door meeting Friday afternoon to review “an athletics-related contract under consideration,” an apparent reference to a $2 billion offer to buy a stake in the Big Ten athletic conference.
The board immediately went into a closed session to discuss “confidential commercial and financial information” with its attorneys, according to the board agenda. It met for about an hour before leaving without taking any public action.
The 4 p.m. meting was called on short notice.
“The board has been informed that the Big Ten Conference member institutions, which include the University of Maryland, will be voting in the next few days on a proposal that may have board implications,” Board Chair Linda Gooden said a few minutes before the closed session. “Given the short notice, we have requested to meet and seek legal advice and legal counsel on the board’s role and authority regarding this matter.”
The board is responsible for overseeing academic and financial operations and crafting policy for the 12 institutions and three regional higher education centers in the university system. That includes the College Park campus, the state’s flagship institution.
According to published reports, officials at the Big Ten Conference are negotiating a more than $2 billion deal with UC Investments, which manages the University of California Pension System investment fund, for a 10% stake in the conference over the next 20 years. The conference’s athletic departments would each get a share of the money from UC Investments, which would get 10% of conference revenues in return.
Universities told they should brace for the coming year’s 7% budget cut

Money generated would include sponsorships, media rights and league revenue streams for the 18 schools in the conference, which stretches from Maryland and Rutgers on the East Coast to the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Washington on the West Coast, with traditional heartland rivals in between.
But not everyone is on board with the idea.
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) sent a letter to the conference’s school presidents, including an Oct. 10 letter to University of Maryland, College Park, President Darryll J. Pines, warning that a deal with a private investor may require the sale of university assets and affect the schools’  tax-exempt statuses.
“The primary goal of these companies is to make money for the firm, which is unlikely to align with the academic goals of your university or its obligations as a not-for-profit organization,” Cantwell wrote. “These investors will be focused on maximizing their investment, not on preserving and growing athletic and academic opportunities for student athletes.”
A spokesperson with the College Park campus said in an email Friday evening the school would need more time to comment on the negotiations.
Higher education officials from at least one state, the Michigan Board of Regents, reject the idea of a private equity firm dippinng not in college sports, according to the Detroit Free Press.
On that same day that  Michigan officials discussed the proposal Thursday, the Big Ten Conference released a statement on behalf of the league’s presidents and chancellors defending the negotiations.
“Over a year ago, we instructed the conference to undertake a comprehensive process, alongside our members, to innovate for the future and extend the conference’s legacy of academic and athletic excellence,” according to the statement. “The Big Ten remains committed to modernizing the operations of our conference, strengthening conference stability, preserving Olympic and women’s sports, and enhancing the student-athlete experience.”
The statement noted that UC Investments would be “a non-profit partner – not private equity.”
“Ultimately, it is the decision of the Big Ten member institutions’ presidents and chancellors to decide if it’s the right opportunity and those conversations are ongoing,” the statement said.

Wes Moore on Friday added free rides on commuter buses and MARC trains for federal workers during the shutdown.","Gov. Wes Moore speaks at a federal government shutdown resource fair in Howard County on Friday. (Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)On day 17 of the government shutdown, furloughed Defense Department contractor Glenda Lassiter found herself at a federal government shutdown resource fair in Howard County, looking through loan and insurance information offered to affected federal workers.
“I am here in the event that I do need it [resources] — hopefully I don’t,” she said. “I extend prayers to those that do.”
Lassiter is among the 200,000 federal contractors and 260,000 federal workers in Maryland who are facing the burdens and the uncertainty of a government shutdown. Most workers were sent home after Congress could not agree on a budget by Oct. 1, when fiscal year 2026 started, while others have to continue showing up for work, but aren’t getting paid.
State and local governments have been offering services and resources to help residents affected by the shutdown, including Gov. Wes Moore’s announcement Friday that the Maryland Transit Administration would offer federal workers free rides on commuter buses and MARC trtains for the duration of the shutdown.
“You are not going to have to worry about your transportation because this [Trump] administration can’t figure it out,” said Moore, who visited tables at the fair and talked to workers.

The state had previously offered protections on housing and utilities, such as gas and electric, for furloughed workers, and Moore said Friday that utility companies are “holding to their pledge” of pausing shutoffs for federal workers during the shutdown.
The resource fair had tables with unemployment insurance and loan information from both the state and from banks like Truist and Fulton. Resume reviews and critique stations were offered to support workers looking for new jobs.
Health care assistance was present through United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield, stationed next to tables for Maryland agencies like the Department of Human Services, the Department of Veterans and Military Families and the Department of Labor.
“You see so many people working here because they are afraid of how they’re going to put food on their tables, how they’re going to keep a roof over their heads, how they’re going to care for their families,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said at the fair.
Ball assured the community that Maryland officials will continue to “fight for what’s right” among the challenges and negativity during the shutdown.
The governor said more than 2,000 people have applied for unemployment insurance because of the shutdown, and more than 1,000 have applied to the Federal Shutdown Loan Program, a $700 no-interest loan for excepted federal workers — those who work without pay during the shutdown.
Moore and Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) called on Congress to end the shutdown, with Moore saying he wants Washington to “see what we’re seeing and the real pain that it is causing.”
The House passed a stopgap budget in September to keep the government open until Nov. 21, while fuller budget discussions continued. But the bill stalled in the Senate, were Democrats are pushing their own bill that would retain subsidies for health insurance coverage that are set to expire at the end of the year — which could cause millions to lose health care, the Democrats argue.
Since then, neither side in the Senate has budged.
Elfreth said she is pushing for the government to come to an agreement that reopens the government and “does not risk health care for tens of millions of Americans.” She emphasized the importance of restoring citizen’s faith in government institutions and the idea that Congress is able to make progress.
“I have been … demanding that Democrats and Republicans do something radical, which is actually sit down at the table and come up with a bipartisan budget deal,” she said.

Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) Friday for his kindness and humor, his knowledge on agricultural issues and his passionate advocacy for the Eastern Shore during his 14 years in the House. Otto died Friday at age 61.","Republican Del. Charles Otto represented the Lower Shore since taking office in 2011 and had just filed for reelection when he died this week. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Colleagues from both sides of the aisle remembered Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) Friday for his kindness and humor, his knowledge on agricultural issues and his passionate advocacy for the Eastern Shore during his 14 years in the House of Delegates. It was announced Friday that Otto had died at age 61. No cause of death has been given.
Otto, who represented parts of Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties since he was first sworn in to the House of Delegates in 2011, had just filed for reelection to a fifth term on Tuesday, said Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Upper Shore).
“It’s a real shocker,” Jacobs said Friday. “He was a good friend of mine, I was lucky to be friends with him all these years – and I’ll miss him and I know that members of the legislature will miss him.”

Jacobs said he and Otto were “almost inseparable” in the General Assembly, both starting in the House in 2011 and representing parts of the Eastern Shore. The two were put on the same committee, Environment and Transportation, shared office space and worked on various agricultural issues during the last 14 years, Jacobs said.
“Everyone liked him, he was a likeable guy,” Jacobs said. “He had always had a good sense of humor. Never saw him get angry about anything – unless it had something to do with his district.”
Jacobs admitted that he and Otto were some of the more reserved members on the House floor, but spoke up in matters that were important to them and the Eastern Shore.
“We were quiet … If we stood up, which we did occasionally, I can tell you people paid attention because we didn’t do it very often,” Jacobs said. “If we did, you knew it was serious.”
House Republicans said in a joint statement that they were “devastated by the loss” of Otto.
“He was, in many ways, the heart of our Caucus,” the statement said. “A rarity in politics, Delegate Otto was never someone who was in love with his own voice. But when he spoke, he did so with heartfelt wisdom, and members listened, no matter their political party. He was unceasingly generous and hilariously funny.”
Senate Republicans called him a “steadfast voice for Maryland’s farmers, rural communities and small businesses.”
“Charles brought common sense and integrity to every discussion in Annapolis,” Senate Republicans said in a statement. “He worked across party lines to ensure that rural Maryland’s needs were heard and respected, and his leadership and friendship will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege to serve alongside him.”
Otto was born in Salisbury on Feb. 15, 1964. He attended University of Maryland Eastern Shore and graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with a degree in animal Science in 1986.
He was a field representative for the Maryland Farm Bureau from 1987 through 1995 and continued other agricultural work throughout the years.
“As a farmer himself, he was firmly rooted in the agricultural community and faithfully served his lower shore constituents in the House of Delegates since 2011,” the Maryland Farm Bureau said in a statement Friday. “Delegate Otto was a steadfast champion for Maryland agriculture and will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues throughout the state.”

He was elected to the House of Delegates in 2010, where he continued to push for agricultural issues on the Environment and Transportation committee, as well as various subcommittees.
“He served the Maryland House of Delegates with integrity and an unwavering dedication to the people of District 38A,” House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said in a statement posted to social media. “I extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, loved ones, constituents, and staff. He will be sorely missed by all.”
Otto’s legislative seat will be filled by appointment: The three county Republican central committees in his district will meet to select a nominee, whose name will be forwarded to the governor, who makes the final decision.
In a statement, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that Otto had “a fidelity to our state that could never waver, and a commitment to our people that could never fade.”
“This was a man who loved Maryland to his core,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a statement, “fighting every day for his constituents and moving in good faith with partners in the General Assembly to deliver results.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_2060-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 23:02:05.418921
