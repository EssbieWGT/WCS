The weather system has slammed much of the country. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)I am despondent about the weather. No, I’m not writing about the slaying of another person in Minneapolis.
I am despondent about the cold and snow that have locked me into my home for a long weekend. No, I’m not writing about the presence of armed federal forces on the streets of U.S. cities turning their vast firepower on protesters protecting their neighbors.
And yet, I know that as much as the cold and snow trouble me, they will pass.
I know that warmer weather will come and the snow and cold and ice will melt. Please understand I am not using any metaphor here. I am not writing about our current administration in Washington, D.C., or outrage toward American immigration enforcement policies.
I’m writing about the weather caused by a nationwide storm, one that meteorologists call unprecedented.
And the weather will change.
It can be tempting over a long weekend like this — with days of subfreezing temperatures behind you and days of subfreezing temperatures ahead — to believe otherwise. We suspect the chill will never retreat. Our fingers will always stiffen in the biting cold air outside. We will remain inside our homes wrapped in blankets and avoiding slippery roads. The world will spin as a we remain locked inside.
I’m definitely not saying that this works as a metaphor for our current political situation, when authoritarians in waiting stalk the hallways of the White House. I’m not saying it applies to vile lies spread about people including Renee Good and Alex Pretti by officials who yearn to crush political dissent and silence opposing voices.
I’m not saying either of those things. I’m dealing with the weather, and the irrational fear that bad weather will never change.
Even in the coldest temperatures, that’s not true.
The sun will come. It will shine. The snow will melt in into water and flow into drains and make its way to the river. The ice will retreat and disappear in water vapor that floats up into the atmosphere to create clouds. 
No season lasts forever. Spring will come and the air will warm and the flowers bloom and the wheel turn. The rains will come and nourish green grass and trees, and world around us will flourish once again. No one who bets on winter lasting forever will win his or her wager. 
Change always prevails.
I write this knowing that words have limits. Thoughts from one opinion editor in Kansas can only do so much, even in this interconnected age. My fulminations and broadsides — against the weather of course, not anything else going on right now — might shift attitudes a percentage point or two. At most.
On the other hand, concrete actions help. Hardy souls can plow the roads and shovel sidewalks, check on elderly friends and family, help dig cars out of snow drifts. That helps. That clears the way for the next season, whenever it inevitably arrives.
If we learn anything from the weekend, let it be this.
Change will come. Seasons will shift. Warmness will replace the chill. But we can also learn from the repetition. We can prepare ourselves for the inevitable changes. Knowing now how much cold, how much ice, how much snow can warp an entire region, we can be on watch in years to come.
For so long, many of us suggested that it can’t happen here. I refer to winter weather. Now we know better. Now we can pass that knowledge to the generations who follow.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-25 23:54:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,Two Mississippi prisons temporarily lose power amid freezing temps from winter storm,"Leonardo Bevilacqua, Jerry Mitchell and Michael Goldberg",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/25/two-mississippi-prisons-lose-power-winter-storm/,The winter storm that pushed through the state Saturday and Sunday temporarily knocked out power at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman and Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood.,"The winter storm that pushed through the state Saturday and Sunday temporarily knocked out power at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman and Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood, even as temperatures plunged below freezing.
This photo taken by an inmate in Unit 29 of the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman shows a fire set by another inmate down the hall from his cell at around 3 a.m. on Sunday, January 25, 2026.
“At Parchman, we had a limb fall on a line,” Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain told Mississippi Today on Sunday afternoon. “The power is coming back on.”
Entergy workers spent about three hours fixing the problem, he said.
Parchman is in rural Sunflower County near Tutwiler and has about 1,900 inmates. Delta Correctional is in Greenwood and houses about 300 women. Both are in areas that received snow and ice.
Generators were supplying power Sunday at Delta Correctional, Cain said. “The only place we’ve had a problem is at Parchman.”
“I just had a mama tell me that the inmates were banging on the wall all night, that they were cold and hungry,” Cain said. “All that’s bullshit.”
Inmates had sack lunches Sunday, Cain said, “and we should be able to cook supper. We have water and everything.”
House Corrections Committee Chairwoman Becky Currie said Sunday that she asked prison officials if they had checked generators at Parchman before the ice storm.
“They said no,” Currie said. “I’m raising hell, but it is an emergency. This is another major mistake for the Department of Corrections.”
Currie told Mississippi Today that she spoke to a staff member at Delta Correctional on Sunday afternoon who told her the generator was working but was only keeping some lights on. It was not sufficiently heating the building, the staff member told her.
“I can’t imagine being in a tin can with no heat,” Currie said. “We all plan for storms in Mississippi. That’s why there is not a loaf of bread on the shelf (in the grocery store). They are responsible for thousands of lives. There are hospice patients, dialysis patients. And they can’t make sure the generators are going to work in time of need?”
Temperatures at Parchman fell to 19 degrees Sunday.


An inmate in Parchman’s Unit 29, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said he awoke at 1 a.m. Sunday to the lights flickering on and off. He said that at 3 a.m., a fire was set down the hall from his cell. He said inmates were trying to get the attention of correctional officers after the power went out, and the temperature inside the block got “too damn cold.”
The only light visible was coming through the windows, he said. “The officers aren’t doing anything, they’re not checking to see if inmates are cold or anything.”
This photo taken by an inmate at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman shows the view out a window on Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026.
Inmates were hollering for warmer clothes after the temperature dropped, he said. A warden later announced to inmates that “nothing could be done,” he said.
Mississippi Today was able to review photos of both the inmate’s icy window and the fire that was set in his block. Dark cells and hallways can be seen in an additional photograph obtained. Parchman’s fields are blanketed with white snow in another.
At around noon Sunday, the inmate said he was given a cold breakfast. It’s unclear, he said, when the next meal could be served. Security checks that usually happen every half hour had ceased since early Sunday morning, he added. Besides breakfast at noon and a nurse making a medication drop at a nearby cell, he said no guard or other person had come by his cell Sunday.
Stephen C. McCraney, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday he received a phone call about three to four days ago that three generators at the Delta Correctional Facility were “iffy.” He said he sent three extra generators to the prison.
Parchman is a new problem, he said. When power went out there, it became a priority, he said.
 “Sometimes things break in the middle of the night. Those customers within those facilities, they can’t go home for the weekend, they can’t go to the neighbor’s house and we realize that,” McCraney said of the prisoners in Parchman and Delta Correctional.
Mississippi Today obtained text messages from a Parchman guard, who wrote: “Most of their stuff doesn’t work. What does work is rigged up. They don’t have a maintenance team that actually knows what they are doing.
“And our heaters work well,” the guard wrote. “They just aren’t turned all the way up because we don’t want to burn them up and then be without them all together. They are set at 65 or 68 I can’t remember. So inmates probably still want a blanket to keep comfortable but they definitely are not freezing.”
At a Sunday news conference, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said he was “aware” of the prison problems. “I’m confident that we will get that back online via a generator if not already, then very soon,” Reeves said.
Facebook entries by people concerned about prison conditions alleged that Parchman inmates were suffering without heat or food. 
When someone made a joke on Facebook about inmates freezing to death, Drea LaSha responded that they are “still human beings that breathe the same air we do. They are not dead but will be in such conditions and you joke about it … Could be you.”
Terell Harris added, “These are humans and not animals, and let’s be honest, the animals get protected in these conditions. Everyone in prison don’t deserve to be there, and some are actually innocent. Either way, these are humans, and we all have family that has been to prison.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073847/Parchman-front-gate.jpg,,,2026-01-25 18:56:39.627178

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The assault of a Florida congressman at a Sundance party is being investigated as a possible hate crime after police say a man sneaked in, made racially charged remarks, and punched the lawmaker in the face.
Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said in a social media post that the man who assaulted him late Friday “told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face. He was heard screaming racist remarks as he drunkenly ran off.” 
In a statement, the Sundance Film Festival condemned the assault and said it abhors “any form of violence, harassment, and hate speech.”
“The safety and security of our festival attendees is always our chief concern, and our thoughts are with Congressman Frost and his continued well-being. We encourage anyone with additional information on this matter to contact the Park City Police Department,” the statement said.
According to a police affidavit, Christian Joel Young, 28, had approached Frost and a friend at a private party at High West Distillery in Park City, Utah, and began “making weird conversations and comments referring to their race.” When they went to step away, the affidavit says, Young put his arms around their necks like he was hugging them and pulled them in close, saying “we are going to deport you and your kind.”

Shocked, the two pushed Young away, who then yelled a racial slur and punched Frost in the face before running into the crowd, the affidavit says.
The affidavit says Young then approached a woman and her friend by the bar, but when the two stopped engaging with him as the conversation became “inappropriate and racially charged,” Young grabbed her shoulder, pushed her against the bar and yelled “You are the kind we are going to deport. You’re being deported.”
A man who witnessed the encounter caught Young and held him until event security arrived. Security members told police Young had been denied entry to the bar, then was seen jumping a fence set up for the private event. When security approached, he jumped back out and ran away. Security members didn’t know how he sneaked back in. 
Police who questioned Young said he told them he didn’t remember what happened and that he didn’t know his name, but when officers called him by his name he responded, “indicating his answers were intentionally evasive and not due to impairment,” according to the affidavit. Staff at the bar told police Young had ordered only two drinks before they stopped serving him due to erratic behavior.
Police also confiscated a Sundance Film Festival administrative access pass in someone else’s name from Young.
Young was booked into Summit County Jail under investigation of assaulting a government official and assault of the woman at the party, with both “racially charged” incidents being screened for a hate crime enhancement, according to the affidavit. Young is also being investigated for aggravated burglary for allegedly entering the bar unlawfully.
An attorney for Young was not listed. He is being held without an option to post bail.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A crowd of over a thousand demonstrators gathered at the Colorado Capitol and marched through downtown Denver on Sunday to protest the Trump administration after another fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minnesota.
“Again we gather to express our outrage over a lawless regime terrorizing communities,” activist Darlene Rivera told protesters from the Capitol steps. “It is clear that this regime is waging war against the people that do not agree with their racist policies and actions.”
The demonstration came one day after Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot and killed by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, just two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents. The two killings have sparked nationwide outrage, even as President Donald Trump’s top advisers have rushed to spread false information about Pretti and Good, both of whom were smeared as “domestic terrorists” by the administration within hours of being killed.

Multiple videos that surfaced Saturday showed federal agents opening fire on Pretti while he was restrained and on the ground. Pretti was lawfully carrying a handgun, which had already been secured by agents before the shots were fired. While Trump officials baselessly called him a “would-be assassin” who intended to harm immigration agents, videos show the encounter began with Pretti filming the agents with his cell phone.
“Renee Good and Alex Pretti were murdered in broad daylight while being filmed by numerous people,” Rivera told the crowd. “The videos we have all seen make it clear that Renee and Alex were murdered.”
Joining protesters on the Capitol grounds were a handful of Colorado Democratic elected officials, including state Sen. Jessie Danielson of Wheat Ridge and Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is a 2026 candidate for governor.

Carol Wiemann, a demonstrator from Boulder, stood on a street corner west of the Capitol and waved an American flag at passing cars, many of which offered supportive honks throughout the protest.
“Tears. Tears,” she said of her reaction to hearing of Pretti’s death. “I’ve had enough. This is the fourth or fifth time I’ve been down here. Trump is evil — he’s evil, and we’ve lost our democracy.”
Pretti’s parents, Michael and Susan Pretti, are Colorado residents. They released a statement Saturday calling him “a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends.”
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” their statement said. “Alex (was) clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs.”
“Alex wanted to make a difference in this world,” they said. “Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact.
The federal presence in Minneapolis is part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
Colorado reaction
Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, called the shooting “tragic and unacceptable” in a statement Saturday afternoon. He called for an impartial investigation into the incident and affirmed people’s right to protest.
“To anyone peacefully exercising your First Amendment rights, Colorado stands with you. Americans are experiencing violence and intimidation by our own government. It is unacceptable and must end. Americans are not blind and can see the dangers of the current approach and tactics from ICE,” he said.

The six Democrats in Colorado’s congressional delegation condemned the shooting online. As of Sunday afternoon, the four Republicans who represent Colorado in Congress had not spoken or issued statements about the shooting.
In a social media post, Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, called ICE a “rogue agency” out of control, and said ICE needs to be “dismantled” and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.
Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, said in a statement that she grieves the “senseless loss of life and the terrifying leadership that has created this reality.”
“Our country is at a breaking point because of the illegal and fascist actions of this administration. The American people have had enough. Some Republicans have started to call for ICE oversight, but we need more,” she said.

Sen. John Hickenlooper wrote in a post that he will vote against an upcoming bill in the Senate to fund Homeland Security. The bill which includes $10 billion for ICE. It is expected that Senate Democrats will not provide the votes necessary to advance the bill, which passed the House last week.
“ICE is out of control,” Hickenlooper wrote. “Killing people, separating families and terrorizing communities.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of a massive winter storm that rolled across Tennessee, covering the state with a glaze of ice and leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without power, President Donald Trump approved on Saturday a request for emergency aid. 
Gov. Bill Lee issued a state of emergency for all 95 counties on Friday, ahead of the storm, and on Sunday, Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell declared one, urging people to stay home if possible. 
“Try to shelter in place, help neighbors who are in walking distance, be careful if you do have to go outside,” said O’Connell.

As of Sunday afternoon, more than 225,000 Nashville households lack electricity, according to the Nashville Electric Service and O’Connell. Middle Tennessee Electric Corporation, which covers portions of Middle Tennessee, reported 13,000 outages. Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation, which serves portions of northern Middle Tennessee, including Montgomery, Stewart, Sumner and Robertson counties, reports 35,000 of its 110,000 members are without electricity. 
Memphis, which in 2022 had long term outages after a major winter storm, escaped the worst of the ice. 
Activation of an emergency declaration gives state and local government agencies access to federal support for emergency protective measures, direct federal assistance and coordination of federal resources.
Trump’s quick approval of the request for emergency support contrasts the much slower response from the federal government after severe storms battered West Tennessee in the spring. 
This is the third time in less than two years Tennessee has had to access federal emergency funds for climate disasters. Prior to the spring tornadoes and flooding in 2025, in September 2024, flooding caused by Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage to parts of East Tennessee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The federal killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis this month, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, kicked off a dizzying day here and in Washington. Democratic politicians and ordinary Americans reacted with a mix of outrage and incredulousness, backfooting the Trump administration as the federal operation Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has called an “occupation” approached its third month.
By late Saturday, a Trump-appointed Minnesota federal judge appointed had ordered the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence.” 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his party would block a must-pass government appropriations package — and partially shut down the government next week — if it contained additional funding for the Homeland Security Department. 
As it did earlier this month after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, senior Trump administration officials worked swiftly on Saturday to blame the incident on the victim. 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on the federal agents assembled near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street Saturday morning. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor, called Pretti an “assassin.” 
Videos taken at the scene — as well as what’s known about Pretti’s background — belie the Trump administration’s claims. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara. 
Moments before he was shot, Pretti could be seen on video with his phone — not a gun — recording federal officers, as has become standard practice among anti-ICE activists. 
A cell phone video shows a gaggle of Border Patrol agents wrestling him to the ground and beating him; an agent removes Pretti’s holstered gun, and Pretti appears to pose no threat to the officers surrounding him. Moments later, about 10 shots ring out. 
In a sworn affidavit filed Saturday evening, a physician who lives nearby said Pretti had no pulse when they arrived at the scene. The physician, whose name and identity were not made public, said agents did not appear to be rendering lifesaving aid and initially refused the physician’s offer to help. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.
Pretti’s name had emerged in media reports by early afternoon. It’s unclear whether federal, state or local officials attempted to notify his next of kin beforehand. Michael Pretti, his father, said he first learned of the shooting from an Associated Press reporter.
“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti told the AP, detailing a runaround with the Border Patrol, local police and area hospitals. He said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner eventually confirmed they had Alex Preti’s body.
“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” Pretti’s parents said in a statement released later on Saturday that described Pretti as a “hero” who “wanted to make a difference in this world.”
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said. “Please get the truth out about our son.”
Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS officials blocked their investigators from the crime scene even after they returned with a judicial warrant. The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts. Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.
The names of the agents involved in the shooting have not been released. Bovino told CNN on Sunday that he did not know whether more than one agent fired shots.
Minnesota officials questioned Homeland Security’s handling of the shooting’s aftermath and indicated they did not trust the department to conduct a fair investigation.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections unveiled a new website this weekend to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security. In a lengthy statement on Saturday, the department called into question Bovino’s initial explanation for the operation that led to Pretti’s death. The statement said the individual named by Bovino as the target of the operation did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.
A recent article by Stateline, which is a States Newsroom outlet like the Reformer, found that eyewitness testimony and other evidence often contradicts DHS’ initial description of incidents involving its agents.
On Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he expects Homeland Security to heed Saturday’s court order to preserve evidence to support the state’s own investigation.
“We’ve had to threaten them with contempt a few times, but open defiance of court orders is not something that we’ve experienced,” Ellison told the Star Tribune.
Signs had emerged by Sunday that at least some elected Republicans and gun rights groups were uncomfortable with the official line that Pretti posed a clear and present danger before his death. Few elected Republicans wholeheartedly endorsed the administration’s narrative, and even some right-wing influencers who typically hew to the party line recoiled.
Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right this year, called Saturday’s shooting “incredibly disturbing.”
“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” he said on Sunday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.”
The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus also issued a statement calling for an independent investigation.
“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said.
Kevin Stitt, the outgoing Republican governor of Oklahoma, hinted in a Sunday interview with CNN that the administration should rethink its immigration enforcement efforts.

“And so what’s the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want,” he said. “We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”
Dozens of Minnesota business leaders released an open letter that gently called for a change in approach by the federal government, risking the ire of Trump, who is known for his retribution against those who oppose him. 
“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the CEOs wrote. 
Among them were top officers of Medtronic, 3M, Target and the sports franchises. This is notable because as the Reformer previously reported, the state’s biggest companies had been publicly silent until now. Business leaders, the chamber letter asserts, have been “working behind the scenes” since the federal siege began. 
Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms.  On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Minnesota could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies and turned over its voter rolls to the federal government. (Minnesota is not a “sanctuary state”; an effort to pass a sanctuary law the last time Democrats controlled the Legislature went nowhere.)

That Bondi made such an offer at all is notable. But it’s unlikely to lead to a resolution. On Sunday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon brushed off the idea of providing state voter information to the federal government in a caustic statement.
“The answer to Attorney General Bondi’s request is no. Her letter is an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,” Simon said.
False claims of voter fraud have become a staple of the Trumpist political movement. A group of right-wing activists led by Mike Lindell — the pillow mogul currently running for governor as a Republican — claimed widespread voter fraud after the 2020 election. But as part of the state’s usual election auditing process, a random group of precincts in every congressional district were chosen for review, totaling roughly 440,000 votes after the 2020 election, spanning more than 200 precincts. The hand tallies were virtually identical to the machine tallies.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0763-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795

Local […]","Masked federal agents on the scene near where a federal officer shot a Minnesotan for the third time in as many weeks. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Following the killing of Minnesota nurse Alex Pretti at the hands of a Border Patrol officer on Saturday, Michigan’s U.S. Senate candidates are now laying out their plans on how to deal with increasingly violent federal immigration enforcement actions that have resulted in three shootings in three weeks, with two now ending in death.
Local and state Democratic officials in Minnesota immediately condemned Saturday’s shooting as protests ramped up, while Republican President Donald Trump threatened again to send military forces to Minnesota, according to reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, Minnesota Reformer.
In Michigan, the three Democrats in the Senate race followed suit, but they each have slightly different policy contemplations to either rein in, curb or abolish the executive branch’s increasingly troubling immigration force.
Former health official and Bernie Sanders-wing progressive Abdul El-Sayed has called for the outright dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a position he’s held since 2018, a message he has amplified in the wake of the government killings of Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7.
“The murderers of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were eight-year and ten-year agents — training isn’t the issue,” El-Sayed said in a statement issued Sunday. “ICE is a paramilitary force deployed against and our Constitutional order for the service of one would-be dictator. How many more people do they need to shoot? Ask the families of Renee Good or Alex Pretti — both American Citizens — if ICE is protecting us. There can be no justification for lawlessness in the name of the law. And now is not the time to put political convenience. Trump is trying to normalize military force on peaceful streets, tearing apart our constitutional rights one by one. Our tax dollars are being used to kill Americans on our streets rather than save lives in our hospitals like Alex did.”
El-Sayed added that the U.S. must work to secure its border and work toward comprehensive immigration reform through legislation, and not through continued executive action. ICE, in that regard, has been shown to be “irredeemable,” he said.
“Retraining won’t fix it,” El-Sayed said. “And the only reason to deny this is political cowardice. … Rather than protecting us, it has become the thing from which we need to be protected. Abolishing this agency is the only safe path forward.”

While El-Sayed stated his belief that this stance sets him apart from his opponents, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) has called for denying further funding for ICE and has demanded the immediate and sweeping overhaul of the agency. She says the upcoming vote in the U.S. Senate would be a good place to start for Democrats to assert leverage.
“Another person was killed by ICE in Minneapolis, after state leaders told them to leave, local officials told them to leave, and local law enforcement told them to leave,” McMorrow said in a statement on Saturday. “But Trump’s ICE continues on its collision course making our communities LESS safe — not more. Congress: not one more penny until we get the same oversight and accountability we demand from every law enforcement agency.”
McMorrow and her Democratic colleagues in the Michigan Senate are working on a game plan to respond to ICE tactics in the Great Lakes state, and that includes legislation prohibiting officers from being masked on operations with full identification. News that ICE has been distributing memos indicating that the agency does not need a judicial warrant — but rather a Fourth Amendment-bucking administrative warrant signed by an ICE official — has also led state Democrats to consider banning entry by law enforcement without a warrant.
McMorrow has also called for strict, codified use-of-force policies on the federal level to give courts a clear line for when an officer has abused their station if it ends in a preventable violent encounter. Vetting of recruits and vigorous training is part of McMorrow’s plan, as well as a demand that ICE stop detaining American citizens.
“Continuing to provide funding to this agency without a complete overhaul to return it to its duty will be a failure to meet the moment,” McMorrow said in a statement released prior to the death of Pretti this weekend. “The leverage is there. And Democrats should force Republicans to the table to demand that Congress use its power of the purse to end this nightmare and restore the community safety that Americans are demanding.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Sunday said she was joining as a co-sponsor for H.R. 7163, which would divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund, created with the passage of last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to state and local law enforcement agencies.
The bill would hire and train an estimated 200,000 local police officers across the nation, reverting funds to what Stevens called “proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.”
“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control — this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” Stevens said in a statement. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”
Other aspects of the bill include:

Reallocating $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions); and
Reallocating $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens voted against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which did pass in the U.S. House last week, and last year co-sponsored the VISIBLE Act to ban ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities. Stevens has also called for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to be removed from office and co-sponsored articles for Noem’s impeachment.

What about Republicans?
The main Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, as of Sunday afternoon, had not issued a direct statement on the killing of Pretti. Rogers, who is endorsed by Trump, did issue several statements following the killing of Good, saying Democrats, and more specifically his Democratic opponents in the race, were persistently supporting “criminals over cops and America’s safety.”
“The Left’s never-ending war against law enforcement is an assault on Americans’ safety,” Rogers said in a statement issued Jan. 22. “These brave men and women protect our streets so that Michigan families can drive to work and walk to school without fear. But when you have Democrats releasing violent offenders onto the streets, and siding with criminals over cops, that all goes out the window.”
The only other Republican in the race, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Bernadette Smith, has not issued any public statement on either Pretti or Good’s deaths.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7744-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795
,DC,2026-01-25 21:13:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Deadly shooting in Minneapolis could lead to partial government shutdown over ICE funding,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deadly-shooting-minneapolis-could-lead-partial-government-shutdown-over-ice-funding,,"A partial federal government shutdown appeared Sunday to unexpectedly be on the horizon, after another fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis led key U.S. Senate Democrats to say they will oppose a spending package that includes immigration enforcement funds.Senators have until a Friday deadline to clear a package of six House-passed funding measures, including the $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill that includes funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol.Republicans hold a majority in the chamber but would need at least seven Democrats to join them in voting for the package in order to clear the chamber’s 60-vote threshold to advance legislation. The agreement had appeared to be on track for easy passage by the Senate by Friday, when a stopgap spending law expires. But after Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, the second by Homeland Security Department officers in Minneapolis this month, key moderate Democrats, appropriators and leaders said they would not support the package if it includes the Homeland Security legislation in its current form. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also said his caucus would not provide the votes needed, citing the killings of Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, and called for the DHS bill to be split from the five spending bills with broad bipartisan support.“Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,” Schumer said in a Sunday statement. “The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public. People should be safe from abuse by their own government.“Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,” he added. “This is (the) best course of action, and the American people are on our side.”A complicating factor is the DHS bill also includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, even as a major winter storm swept through a large swath of the nation Saturday and Sunday, triggering disaster declarations in multiple states.President Donald Trump and key administration officials committed to a robust media strategy over the weekend, defending the officers involved and smearing Pretti, despite contradictory evidence in available video.Some elected Republicans backed the administration's account, but an unusual number of GOP members of Congress and at least one governor called for accountability.Latest shooting a turning pointFive of the eight Democrats and independents who voted with Republicans to end a shutdown in November have said they will not support the package if it includes DHS funding.Maine independent Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats, said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that he would vote against the package.“I hate shutdowns,” King said in a video interview on the Sunday morning show. “I’m one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the end of the last shutdown, but I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.”Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former federal prosecutor, criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and called for blocking the funding package.“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” she said. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants. I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill.”Cortez Masto called for the DHS bill to be split off from the rest of the package. “We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget. We’ve already passed six funding bills,” she said. “Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe.” Fellow Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen, who also voted to end the shutdown in November, said “enough is enough” and that she would oppose a funding package that did not “rein in ICE’s out-of-control conduct.”“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” she said. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.“My personal guiding principle has always been ‘agree where you can and fight where you must,’” she added. “And I believe this is a time when we must fight back.”Virginia’s Tim Kaine said in a Friday statement — before Pretti’s killing — that he would oppose the package for several reasons, including as a check on ICE.“We are not living in normal times,” he said. “The President is acting chaotically and unlawfully and we shouldn’t give his deranged decisions the imprimatur of congressional approval by passing this legislation without significant amendment.”Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois also said after Pretti’s killing early Saturday — the third shooting by immigration officers in Minneapolis in three weeks — that he would vote against the package. Durbin is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.DHS fundingThe House last week passed the DHS funding bill, with seven Democrats voting to approve it, and a separate package of three other appropriations bills that passed with broad bipartisan support. House members passed two other funding bills the week before.The fiscal 2026 Homeland Security spending bill cuts funding for Customs and Border Protection by $1.3 billion, and maintains flat funding for ICE at $10 billion.The bill attempts to put guardrails around immigration enforcement by allocating $20 million for body cameras for ICE and CBP officers. But even if the funding bill doesn’t pass or gets held up, the immigration enforcement agencies are still flush with cash after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Republicans passed last year allocated $190 billion for DHS. ICE is slated to receive about $75 billion over four years, or $18.7 billion a year.Path forwardAny Senate amendment to the House-passed package would require another House vote. The House is scheduled to be out this week and the chamber, narrowly controlled by Republicans, may be unwilling to cooperate with Senate changes.Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, a Maine Republican up for reelection this year in one of the nation’s most closely watched races, did not dismiss the possibility of changes in the spending bill package, telling The New York Times on Saturday she was “exploring all options” for passage.The major winter storm also hit Washington, D.C., and could further complicate the Senate vote or potential House consideration. All flights into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport were canceled Sunday as snow and sleet covered the region. A handful of GOP officials, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called for more scrutiny into Pretti’s killing and ICE’s conduct more generally. “There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on social media.“For this specific incident, that requires cooperation and transparency between federal, state, and local law enforcement. Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”Cassidy posted on social media: “The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on social media he was “troubled by the events that have unfolded in Minneapolis.”“As an attorney and former federal prosecutor, I believe a thorough investigation is necessary—both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system,” he said.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, was among those who said he was troubled by the shooting.“I think the death of Americans, what we’re seeing on TV, it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Stitt said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.”Administration, some allies defend shooting Many others, including Republican senators and Trump administration officials speaking on Sunday talk shows — Noem, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche — defended the agents involved and blamed Pretti and state and local Democrats in Minneapolis. “Democrats are now backing out of a bipartisan agreement to fund DHS, which makes sure our border is secure and our immigration laws are enforced,” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote on social media.“This is reckless and quite frankly, very disappointing. It appears that Democrats are so wedded to supporting people carrying guns trying to interfere with a lawful arrest that they will shut down the government.”Patel, on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News, said DHS is investigating the shooting but the FBI is processing physical evidence. “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up in a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines,” Patel said, referring to reports that Pretti was carrying a handgun for which he had a concealed carry license, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.Spokespeople for Collins, Schumer and Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return messages seeking comment Sunday. Senate Democrats were set to meet virtually on Sunday night, according to multiple media reports.",,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795

Jeff Landry at a news conference Sept. 13, 2024, on the recovery from Hurricane Francine at Signature Aviation in Kenner. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said “sanctuary city” policies and a lack of cooperation from local authorities in Minnesota created the situation that led to Saturday’s shooting death of Alex Pretti, after a confrontation with federal immigration officers.
Scalise appeared on the CBS program “Face the Nation” Sunday morning, where host Margaret Brennan sought his reaction to the third shooting by federal officials in Minneapolis in three weeks and the second death.
Multiple video accounts show Pretti, 37, an ICU nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital, intervening after a Border Patrol agent shoved a woman to the street. A group of agents then forced Pretti to the ground, after which he was shot multiple times. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was in possession of a handgun and two clips when he encountered federal agents. Noem told reporters Saturday it appeared Pretti “arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”
Some 3,000 federal agents have carried out sweeps in the Minneapolis area over the past two months. Grassroots organizers have tracked their efforts in an attempt to warn targeted immigrants, and the two sides have clashed on several occasions. 
Scalise, a Republican, said officers with Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have seen far greater cooperation from local police in other states, including Louisiana. Operation “Catahoula Crunch” from Homeland Security, which focused on the New Orleans region, totaled 370 arrests as of early January before Border Patrol Director Greg Bovino redirected the 200 agents to Minneapolis.
Violent criminals are being apprehended where ICE and Border Patrol agents work in collaboration in local authorities, according to the majority leader.    
“You’re seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don’t have sanctuary city policies,” Scalise said, “and where you don’t see, by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.”


Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that Pretti held a permit to carry a concealed firearm, and videos from Saturday’s confrontation show Pretti holding only his cellphone to record video. 
O’Hara and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the 2nd Amendment allows Pretti to have his weapon with him at Saturday’s demonstration, but Scalise said that right is effectively revoked if a permit holder is in the act of committing a crime. Federal officials have said grassroots efforts in Minnesota to monitor and disrupt immigration enforcement efforts are unlawful.    
Scalise noted that, as a state lawmaker, he authored the Louisiana law to create concealed-carry permits.
“You are not allowed to carry a gun while you’re committing another crime, and interfering with law enforcement is a felony,” said Scalise, who prefaced his statement by saying he wasn’t familiar with Minnesota’s concealed-carry permit law. 
As in Louisiana, concealed weapon permit holders in Minnesota can face additional charges if they have their firearm in their possession during a criminal act. Louisiana has since approved the concealed carrying of a firearm without a permit, eliminating the need for training to possess a firearm.

Soon after Pretti’s fatal shooting, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-Lafayette, posted social media comments similar to those Scalise would make Sunday morning. Cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities in other cities has prevented the “encroaching, interference and provocation” seen in the “sanctuary city” of Minneapolis, he said.
“This sanctuary city BS raises stress levels in ways that it’s difficult to explain, but I can tell you that pulling the trigger will happen more frequently when things go FUBAR, and sanctuary city policies most definitely create FUBAR situations,” Higgins wrote, citing the military slang acronym for “f—ed up beyond all recognition.” 
In contrast to his fellow GOP members in the Louisiana delegation, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy made a measured call for accountability after Pretti’s death in a social media post Saturday night. 
“The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,” Cassidy said in an X post. “The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”
This is Cassidy’s first public statement out of sync with the Trump administration since the president urged U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Baton Rouge, last weekend to run for his seat this fall. Letlow announced her candidacy Tuesday.  
O’Hara, who appeared on “Face the Nation” right before Scalise, said federal officials have yet to share complete details of what led to Pretti’s death with his agency. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates all police-involved shootings in the state, was denied access to Saturday’s shooting scene by federal authorities, despite having a warrant from U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee.     
The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was also turned away from the scene of the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.
U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, was more pointed in his reaction to Saturday’s incident, saying in an X post it took place less than a month after Good’s death. 
“This violence we’re seeing is sanctioned by the dangerous rhetoric and reckless policies of Donald Trump and Kristi Noem,” Carter said.

Snow and ice left widespread damage across northern Mississippi as a massive storm moved across large parts of the U.S., creating dangerous travel conditions. Trees split open and dropped heavy branches, and power lines crashed down in some areas.
Though the biggest damage was in the northern part of the state, areas as far south as Natchez saw icy conditions.

About 10% of Mississippi customers were without electrical service at midday Sunday, and the hardest-hit areas were in the northern part of the state, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. 
“The situation is expected to get worse before it gets better,” Gov. Tate Reeves said, warning that restoring power could take days.
Like many other Oxford residents, Lee Ragland said he and his wife, Jana, were without power Sunday. He said some trees and large limbs fell in their yard, but luckily none had hit their house.
“Laid in bed last night listening to transformers blow and trees snapping and falling up and down street,” Lee Ragland said in a text message. “Not a good feeling. Now need to find a chainsaw crew to clear my driveway.”

Holly Springs resident Pat Stubbs said his home lost power Saturday night, and trees were down all around his neighborhood.
“I’ve got gas logs and a gas stove and oven. I’m better off than most,” Stubbs said Sunday. “Looks like it’s gonna be a few days before all this melts.”
In Clarksdale, Shawn Thomas-Erving said Sunday he helped six people who were stuck in the storm Saturday evening, including law enforcement. He said he used a shovel to get tires out of areas thickly blanketed with snow and ice. 
Thomas-Erving said afterward that he was tired, but “I felt like it was my duty.”
He said wintry conditions haven’t been this bad in Clarksdale since the early 2000s. He described the situation Sunday as “unbearable,” with cars still sliding and getting stuck.

Lafayette County, home to Oxford, had about 20,000 customers without electricity at midday Sunday, about 75% of the customers in that county.
Lee County, home to Tupelo, had nearly 13,000 customers without electricity, about 35%.
Reeves said power outages were expected to increase as ice accumulates and trees continue to fall.
Tippah Electric Power Association reported that TVA, one of the largest power providers in northeast Mississippi, had “catastrophic damage” to one of its main distribution lines “and because of that, it could be a lengthy time before they are able to get power to every customer,” Reeves said.

Jackson firefighters extinguished flames Saturday night at what was supposed to be a vacant building at Chapel Ridge apartments. The Jackson Fire Department’s chief investigator, Charles Felton, said the building was being used by people “without permanent housing.”
Oxford Mayor Robbyn Tannehill said on social media Sunday that crews were working to clear streets for emergency vehicles. She implored people to remain home and to stay away from downed power lines.
“It looks dire right now, I know, but Oxford’s a community that takes care of each other and comes together when things are most challenging,” Tannehill said. “And this challenge will be no different.”

The Legislative Research Commission announced on social media that lawmakers will now convene Tuesday at 4 p.m. in Frankfort. The capitol annex will be closed Monday, but most LRC employees will telework and can be reached by email. 
Communities across the commonwealth have been blanketed with snow and ice over the weekend, making roads hazardous and causing power outages. In a Sunday morning press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said more snow, sleet and ice is expected throughout the evening. 
Beshear said that the state had no reports of deaths or significant injuries because most Kentuckians were prepared and had stayed off roads Saturday. 
“To the people of Kentucky, thank you. You’re helping everybody out there do their very best in responding. You’re protecting one another and yourself,” he said. “But snow and ice totals are expected to increase today and tonight, so we still have a long road ahead of us.” 
At the time of the press conference, Kentucky had more than 50,000 outages reported with more expected. The state has set up 113 warming centers, and local information can be found on the Kentucky Emergency Management’s website. Eighteen state parks have set up warming centers. 
The governor and emergency management officials strongly urged Kentuckians to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary. Beshear also emphasized that when shoveling snow, take breaks, as the activity can increase risk of heart attacks. Last year, six Kentuckians died while shoveling snow. 
President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Saturday for several states, including Kentucky, due to the weather. A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) press release said the declaration allows for federal assistance to aid response efforts. 
Beshear declared a state of emergency for Kentucky Friday. 
Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office is taking reports of suspected price gouging at its hotline, 1-888-432-9257, or online. 
Beshear also reminded Kentuckians to call 911 in emergencies or life-threatening situations. If someone has immediate needs that aren’t life-threatening, like little to no heat or phone issues, they can complete the online Rapid Needs Assessment Form or call 502-607-6665.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota regularly disenrolled one of the highest percentages of Medicaid patients in the country each month last year, contributing to one of the largest yearly decreases in the state’s Medicaid enrollment in the last decade.
The state often switched places with Oklahoma last year for the first and second highest-percentage of disenrollments in the nation, according to national Medicaid data, with disenrollment rates regularly over one-third of patients up for renewal. Medicaid, which is funded jointly by the federal government and states, provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Overall, South Dakota Medicaid enrollment dropped by about 9,000 people from February to November last year, primarily among traditional Medicaid for adults and children, and has since stabilized around 141,000. That number includes expanded-eligibility Medicaid for adults ages 19 through 64, approved by South Dakota voters in 2022, which has stayed relatively stable at around 30,000 people enrolled.
Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff spoke to South Dakota Searchlight after he presented Medicaid enrollment information to the legislative budget committee on Wednesday at the Capitol in Pierre. He said the reason for the higher disenrollments was a combination of South Dakota’s use of an automatic renewal process known as ex parte, and the lingering impact of post-COVID pandemic removals.


Althoff told lawmakers that while Medicaid is a “big spend” in the department’s budget, it is “super impactful in our efforts to lift people who are downtrodden and facing bad times up.
“Without our ability to work pain free or feel confident that ‘I’m not going to die’ or ‘I’m having my personal health in good order,’ we don’t go forward ambitiously, we don’t take risks, we don’t find jobs that we need,” Althoff said.
The decrease could also be due to a healthy economy, said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured for KFF. The nonprofit health policy organization researches and reports on major health issues in the United States. South Dakota reported one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation over the last year. 
The decrease in enrollment throughout the year matches nationwide decreased enrollment, Tolbert added.
State predicted enrollment decrease
A year ago, Althoff told lawmakers there would be a decrease in enrollment as the department implemented ex parte, or automated renewals, to identify enrollees no longer eligible for the program. At the same time, the process allows states to simplify Medicaid renewals, eliminating the need for people to resubmit eligibility information to the state.
SD Medicaid officials say enrollments will decline as they cross-reference for eligibility

South Dakota was not able to use ex parte until it upgraded to a new online enrollment system, Althoff told lawmakers at the time. He said that once the state was able to use ex parte in late 2024, it used external databases to reference and remove South Dakotans who were “no longer eligible” for enrollment, for reasons such as finding a job that put them outside income limits.
The state is required by law to first attempt to renew patients by crosschecking with other data sources, within the state or through a third party. If a state identifies an ineligible patient on the rolls, patients are sent notification and paperwork to prove otherwise.
But an average of 9% of patients up for renewal were terminated because they were no longer eligible, according to state data. The majority of disenrollments were “procedural terminations,” due to missing and improper paperwork.
Tolbert said for a majority of people who lose Medicaid access, it’s not because they are no longer eligible or because their income exceeds the limit, but rather because they “weren’t able to navigate the renewal process.”
Procedural disenrollment can be due to unreliable mail, and the disenrollment often leads to confusion and a lack of insurance for people who need health care, said Shelly Ten Napel, CEO of Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas.
Increases in automatic renewals prevent “time consuming” paperwork for patients and the state, and it means fewer people are “showing up for care who have unknowingly lost coverage,” Ten Napel said.
Althoff predicted that fiscal year 2025 average monthly Medicaid enrollees would drop to just under 140,000 by June of last year, a drop of about 8,000 enrollees, before climbing back up. 
Medicaid enrollment in reality dropped to 144,310 by June of last year and continued to decrease through September, to 141,012 average monthly enrollees. Enrollment has since plateaued, with 141,151 average monthly enrollees in November, according to the latest Medicaid enrollment report.
Change in ex parte could ‘stabilize’ enrollment
South Dakota’s high disenrollment rate changed after the state Department of Social Services changed its automatic renewal labeling and process, due to modernized enrollment software. The latest national Medicaid report dropped South Dakota’s disenrollment standing to 22nd highest in the nation, at a disenrollment rate of about 20%.
Since July, the state’s number of terminated Medicaid recipients due to procedural disenrollment — often due to failing to fill out required renewal, financial or residential documents — dropped to an average of 17%.


Althoff told Searchlight that the department recognized its comparatively high procedural disenrollment rate and made changes.
Starting in July, the department started retaining “categorically eligible recipients” in the Medicaid program, which includes children in Child Protective Services custody or adults who are older or disabled who receive supplemental security income from the Social Security Administration.
“We changed how we define those administrative functions, and that’s what led to the radical change,” Althoff said.
Many Medicaid cases up for renewal in the first half of 2025 weren’t able to go through the ex parte process as well, according to a state Department of Services spokesperson, because of the modernization of the state’s Medicaid enrollment software. The state continued its standard practice of mailing renewal forms, which historically result in higher procedural disenrollment rates.

It wasn’t until September of last year that all Medicaid cases were in a “ready state” for ex parte with the state’s new enrollment software, according to the department. Department officials expect Medicaid enrollment to stabilize over the next year, due in part to the ex parte process and changes regarding the “categorically eligible recipients.”
More than half of Medicaid recipients up for renewal since July were automatically renewed — over 60% in September and October.
Between ex parte reapproval and approvals through submitted renewal forms in the last three months of reports, over three-fourths of recipients due for renewal are being renewed.

Our state must act now, guided by data, employers and long-term planning.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Amy Spear and Megan Sullivan: Vermont trails the nation.","This commentary is by Amy Spear, president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, and Megan Sullivan, vice president of government affairs for the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.



Each year, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce sets legislative priorities grounded in one core objective: advancing the Vermont economy. As we enter the 2026 session, Vermont stands at a defining moment. 
Affordability pressures, demographic decline and rising operating costs are converging just as our state needs more workers, more housing and greater predictability to sustain economic growth.
Our work toward long-range strategy began with the Vermont Economic Action Plan, a statewide blueprint shaped in consultation with more than 5,000 Vermonters. 
The plan established a clear vision for a stronger and more affordable future, grounded in data, pairing community insight and measurable targets. 
It also signaled a pivotal shift in how Vermont approaches economic decision-making. Instead of reacting to problems as they arise, we now have a long-term framework that can guide policy choices and align efforts across the public and private sectors.
This alignment is urgently needed. The Vermont Futures Project’s new competitiveness dashboard shows Vermont trailing most states in economic performance. 
Vermont ranks 51st out of 51 in economic momentum, 49th out of 50 in economic outlook, 51st out of 51 for effective business tax rates, 43rd out of 51 for cost of living, and 50th out of 51 for residents aged 25 to 44 as a percentage of the population. 
This means we have a small and shrinking tax base, shouldering an ever-increasing cost burden, and our ability to improve affordability through growth is hampered by a policy environment that is not conducive to expanding economic opportunity relative to other states. 
Without a substantial immediate commitment to economic stewardship and growth, the data point toward a future of higher costs or significant cuts to critical services.
Results from this year’s Business Climate Survey reinforce this landscape, too. Employers identified taxes, regulations, labor shortages, health care costs and housing challenges as the most significant barriers to growth. 
Many employers consulted in the survey voiced concern that the state’s policy direction is disconnected from Vermont’s economic reality and said they do not feel heard in Montpelier. 
When employers were asked how confident or concerned they were with elected officials’ understanding of economic pressures facing businesses, about 85% said they were either somewhat concerned or very concerned.
Business leaders shared with us examples of policy decisions advanced without a clear understanding of operational impacts. This sentiment reflects a growing disconnect at the precise moment Vermont needs alignment around affordability, stability, and long-term economic strategy. 
It also underscores the essential role the Vermont Chamber plays in bringing employer perspectives to the policy and regulatory tables and ensuring economic policy aligns with economic reality. Addressing Vermont’s challenges requires sustained commitment to coordinated, data-informed action.
While there is difficult work ahead, progress was made last year on housing infrastructure, workforce programming and slowing the growth of health care costs. These advances were important, but they are not enough on their own. 
Vermont must shift from episodic decision-making to a consistent, long-range economic strategy. The Economic Action Plan provides that roadmap. Paired with disciplined and transparent leadership, it offers a path toward measurable improvements for both families and employers.
Our 2026 legislative agenda reflects this approach and focuses on four core areas aligned with statewide priorities and employer needs. 
With state spending up more than three billion dollars in five years, Vermont must adopt predictable fiscal practices that control cost growth and strengthen affordability for families and employers.
A modernized regulatory system must support timely housing and economic development. Streamlined permitting and clearer rules will reduce costs, shorten timelines and restore Vermont’s competitiveness. 
Employers report that workforce pressures and housing shortages remain among their highest concerns. Strengthening recruitment and retention requires connecting training strategies, talent attraction and coordinated housing solutions. 
Finally, manufacturing, tourism, health care, technology and small businesses all face rising pressures. Strategic investments in infrastructure, innovation, and cost containment will strengthen these key sectors.
As we begin the 2026 session, Vermont faces a choice. The path forward requires courage, collaboration, and a commitment to measurable progress. Employers are ready to be partners in this work. Policymakers must be equally ready to align decisions with long-term strategy and economic reality.
Vermont’s future is not predetermined. It is shaped by the choices we make — together.

It is also a moment to underscore what defines our profession: a commitment to truth, transparency and patient safety.
Physician anesthesiologists do far more than “put patients to sleep.” We are responsible for managing pain, vital functions and life-threatening complications before, during and after surgery. That level of responsibility demands trust, and trust is built on honest communication and informed consent. At the Michigan Society of Anesthesiologists (MSA), which represents nearly 1,000 anesthesiologists statewide, these principles guide everything we do.
That’s why MSA is proud to advocate for Michigan Senate Bills 475 and 476, which prohibit pelvic, prostate and other intimate exams on patients under anesthesia without their explicit, informed consent, except in emergencies. This legislation sends a clear message: patients have the right to know what will happen to their bodies and to say yes or no beforehand. There is no room for ambiguity when it comes to consent.
Transparency also means being clear about who is providing medical care. MSA has been a strong supporter of medical title transparency so patients understand the training and credentials of the professionals who are treating them. This is not about professional labels; it is about honesty and patient confidence.
Throughout the past year, MSA has also become a leader in educating Michiganders about emerging safety issues. We have warned patients about hospitals replacing anesthesiologists with other clinicians for certain procedures without clearly explaining the change. We have urged patients to tell their anesthesiologist about recreational marijuana or psychedelic mushroom use, which can significantly affect anesthesia and surgical outcomes. We have helped raise awareness about the warning signs of cardiac arrest and the importance of knowing CPR, skills that save lives long before an ambulance arrives.
In addition, MSA has supported efforts to curb the recreational misuse of nitrous oxide while preserving its appropriate medical use. This is another example of how anesthesiologists look beyond the operating room to protect patients and communities.
Physician Anesthesiologists Week (Jan. 25-31) focuses on recognition as well as accountability. Michigan’s anesthesiologists take seriously the trust patients place in us. Through advocacy, education, research, innovation and daily patient care, MSA will continue to put truth and transparency first this week and every week.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
While Speaker Jason White said he did not pressure House members for their support to garner the narrow 61-59 margin to pass his massive school choice/voucher bill, he at the least had a laser-like understanding of how representatives were going to vote.
Normally, during final passage of a bill in the House, the speaker opens the voting machine and then asks three times “has everyone voted” before closing the machine.
When it came time to vote on the controversial school choice/voucher bill, White opened the machine, which displays on two giant boards on the House floor how members are voting, and asked twice “has everyone voted?” Before he repeated that phrase the third and final time, he took the unusual move of interjecting, “waiting on the gentleman from Grenada,” presumably Republican Kevin Horan.
White then asked, “anyone else?”
Without the momentarily delayed vote of the gentleman from Grenada, the bill would have passed by a one-vote margin instead of the two-vote difference. A tie vote would have been a rejection of the bill.
The bottom line is that White can say he did not apply pressure, as he told reporters after the vote earlier this month, but it was obvious he had a clear understanding of the members’ votes he needed to pass his signature bill for the 2026 session.
Being able to see the members vote on the giant screens can be a powerful influencer. Former House Speaker Billy McCoy used to say he lost only one vote as Education Committee chair. It was on a bill that allowed public schools to offer preschool classes. He said he lost the vote because then-Speaker Tim Ford held the machine open an unusual length of time and a handful of members got cold feet and changed their votes before Ford closed the machines. It is not likely that Ford was intentionally trying to sabotage the bill from McCoy, a fellow Democrat. After all, Ford voted for it.

After the closeness of the recent vote on the school choice/voucher proposal, it became questionable whether the bill would ever leave the House and advance to the Senate, where opposition to sending public funds to private schools seems even more intense.
The Mississippi Constitution gives any member the authority to hold a bill – after a final vote – on a procedural move called a motion to reconsider. The voucher bill was held on a motion, meaning it would require another majority vote to pass and advance to the Senate.
There was at least a little uncertainty on whether the bill could garner another majority. After all, two Republicans did not vote. One of them, Rep. Price Wallace of Mendenhall, said he was absent because of commitments on his family farm, but if he had been there he would have voted no. The other – Rep. Clay Deweese of Oxford – was apparently in the Capitol or close by, but did not vote.
It is not known for certain how he would have voted. But Bradley Roberson, the school superintendent in Deweese’s hometown of Oxford, has been a vocal opponent of spending public funds on private schools.
In the end, though, the motion to reconsider was disposed of on an anticlimactic voice vote and the bill was sent to the Senate.
It was a bit surprising to many that the opponents of the bill – all of the Democrats and 17 of White’s Republicans – did not demand a recorded vote that would have been visible on the two giant boards in the House chamber.
But, perhaps the thought was that at this point it was better to keep the coalition opposing the bill publicly together and not give someone, though White says it would not be him, the opportunity to twist arms to get additional votes for the bill.
The bottom line is if the bill passes the Senate there will be at least one other vote – perhaps multiple votes – on the bill in the House, and members already have taken a tough vote on the measure.
It is likely that if the Senate does kill the bill, White and his allies will attempt to amend another bill and reintroduce the school choice effort. Knowing that, perhaps members thought there was no need to have another tough vote this early in the session. Additional tough votes would come later.
And White says he will not be pressuring members – just reminding the gentleman from Grenada to vote.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15143800/3X0A7629.jpg,,,2026-01-25 07:56:33.484350

Ask Julia Kern about her upcoming trip to Italy and she’ll talk up the appetizers and savory scenery. Then comes the main course — the one where she’ll compete alongside more than a dozen other athletes with Vermont ties at the 2026 Winter Olympics.
Like a majority of the state’s qualifying skiers for Alpine, biathlon, cross-country and freestyle events, Kern has attended the games before. But this time, the 28-year-old member of Stratton’s SMS T2 elite Nordic training team will be able to partake of the host country more easily than in the past.
“The last one was in lockdown during Covid,” Kern recently told VTDigger about her 2022 Olympic debut in Beijing, China. “All of us agree that wasn’t a normal experience.”

Alpine skiing will offer Vermonters the best chance to see a familiar face ascend a podium at the games Feb. 6-22 in the Italian competition centers of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo:

Mikaela Shiffrin, a 30-year-old graduate of Burke Mountain Academy, is aiming for a comeback after winning slalom gold in Sochi, Russia, in 2014 and giant slalom gold and alpine combined silver in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, only to fail to medal in 2022 and fall during the 2024 Killington World Cup.

Shiffrin has told the press she won’t compete in all six Olympic races like she did four years ago, but instead will focus on her current strongpoints: going down and around the gates in the slalom, giant slalom and team combined events.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, 33, of Starksboro — whose mother, Barbara Ann Cochran of Richmond’s Cochran’s Ski Area, won slalom gold in 1972 — is returning to his third Olympics after scoring silver in the super-G (super giant slalom) in 2022.


Paula Moltzan, 31, a former University of Vermont NCAA champion, will be competing in her second Olympics, having just purchased her first house in Waitsfield.


Nina O’Brien, 28, a graduate of Burke Mountain Academy, will return to the games after scoring the sixth-fastest time in the first round of the 2022 giant slalom, only to crash and break her leg in the second run.


And Mary Bocock, a 22-year-old Dartmouth College graduate, will be making her Olympic debut as the daughter of a member of the Sullivan family of skiers from the Mount Snow region.

In cross-country skiing, Kern will be joined by four other athletes with state connections:

Jessie Diggins, a 34-year-old SMS T2 team member, is seeking to add to her medal count — she won U.S. Nordic’s first-ever gold in 2018 and a silver and bronze in 2022 — before wrapping up her racing career this March.

Diggins is expected to compete in all six Olympic cross-country events, which will require her to ski as little as 7.5 kilometers in one race and as many as 50 in another.

Ben Ogden, a 25-year-old University of Vermont graduate, will be representing his Bennington County hometown of Landgrove, population 177, for his second games. He’s expected to focus on his sport’s shorter sprint races.


Jack Young, 23, of Jay, will ski as part of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project.


And Lauren Jortberg, a 28-year-old Dartmouth College graduate, will participate as a member of the Mansfield Nordic Pro Team.

Biathlon — a sport mixing skiing and shooting — will see the most Vermont representation, with four of the team’s eight racers connected to the state, including three who belong to its Army National Guard:

Deedra Irwin, a 33-year-old guard staff sergeant from Jericho, placed seventh in the 15-kilometer race during her first Olympics in 2022 — the best-ever finish for an American in an individual biathlon event.


Sean Doherty, a 30-year-old guard member, will be attending his fourth Olympics.

Two biathlon teammates will be making their Olympic debuts:

Margie Freed, a 28-year-old University of Vermont graduate, is a member of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project.


And Maxime Germain, 24, is a guard aviation operations specialist.

(Biathlon alternates are Jake Brown, 33, of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project, and Chloe Levins, 27, of Rutland.)
And in freestyle skiing:

Mac Forehand, a 24-year-old Stratton Mountain School graduate from Winhall, is set to offer acrobatic tricks, flips and spins in his second Olympics.


And Olivia Giaccio, 25, will hit the moguls course, having grown up skiing at Killington.

After the Covid-confined 2022 games, many Vermont athletes are planning to travel to Italy with family and friends. Kern is ready to show them her top speed.
“Then I’ll make sure to slow down,” she said, “to appreciate and share this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

In one Franklin County community, “everyone's got a story” about child care, a parent said.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Nicole Streeter thought she’d had it tough when she found only minimal child care options for her daughter while living in North Hero. Then, she and her husband moved to Franklin County.
“There were no openings,” she said of child care operations around her new home in St. Albans Town. “We actually had to keep (our daughter enrolled) in Grand Isle County, so we were commuting over half an hour every day.”

To her, it seemed like word of mouth was now the only way to snag a decent spot for her child — and the place she finally found was a long time coming. Now, at 28, she’s expecting again, and options continue to be sparse. Toward the end of last year, she decided to quit her job (a decision also influenced by both care costs and return-to-office mandates for state employees, she said) and stay home with her daughter in preparation for the new baby. 
Streeter’s experience is far from unique, according to a study released this month by Vermont First Children’s Finance. While the state as a whole is showing clear progress in closing the gap between supply and demand when it comes to child care, a few counties — particularly in more rural areas — are lagging substantially. 
Since the passage of Act 76 expanded the state’s child care tuition assistance program in 2023, 50% more families are making use of its aid, according to a recent monitoring report from Building Bright Futures. Experts also told lawmakers this week that Vermont has seen 100 new child care programs open in the past three years, and 1,700 new child care slots have become available.
But Franklin and Essex counties, in Vermont’s rural Northeast Kingdom, show outstanding need more than double that of counties further south; both show that demand is over three times higher than the supply of child care slots. Orange County is also an outlier at more than 2.5 kids per available slot, compared with Chittenden or Bennington counties with less than 1.5.
In keeping with past reports from Let’s Grow Kids, the advocacy nonprofit that closed its doors this fall, First Children’s Finance sought data that focused on the gap between supply and demand in child care with a focus on workforce implications. The count of care slots only included full-time, year-round programs that would allow their parents to remain in the workforce. The team calculated need in each county based on the number of children in the appropriate age range who do not have a stay-at-home guardian.
Erin Roche, who leads Vermont First Children’s Finance, acknowledged the scale of regional imbalance was “a little surprising,” and said the causes may be complex. It’s something her office has been specifically working to solve recently, she said, as it distributes development grants to individual providers on behalf of the state.
“We have prioritized counties that have larger gaps than others in terms of funding,” she said. 
Her team also plans to begin more targeted promotion of those opportunities in areas like Franklin County.
For parents like Chris Carter, 42, such efforts are welcome.
Both of Carter’s children experienced issues with the quality of their care after moving from center to suboptimal center in the St. Albans-Fairfax area as infants, he said. A yearslong search he called “a nightmare” involved the Colchester-based Little Saplings being shut down by the state amid fraud allegations in late 2024, as was reported by Seven Days.
“I think a big part of the problem here is staff — finding quality staff,” Carter said. 
Earlier this week, advocates expressed similar concerns in Montpelier, and pushed lawmakers to pass a bill that would change the state’s approach to licensing individual child care workers.
Carter’s younger child, 2, still commutes to Chittenden County for care. In his community, Carter said, “everyone’s got a story” about child care.

‘Very slim to none’
Providers in Franklin County are feeling the strain — long waitlists weigh against a dearth of qualified employees.
Paulette Fedorishen, longtime director of Little Shepherd Child Care in St. Albans, said she has a waitlist of about 30 families looking for infant care alone. Parents commonly call before the child is born, she said, because otherwise, “the odds of you getting a spot are very slim to none.”
Several care providers told VTDigger about a bottleneck around care of very young children stemming from particular restrictions on in-home providers, as well as tighter rules in general surrounding staff-to-child ratios and group size.
Preschool slots, Fedorishen said, are much more widely available due to opportunities created by the state’s universal pre-K program. Her enrollments in that age group are “stagnant” by comparison, she added.
Fedorishen operates her center with 38 full-time slots, well under its licensed capacity, but said she has to turn parents away “all the time.” She needs to hedge her bets, she said, due to “never knowing if (we’re) going to have enough staff.”
Population density is also an important factor in determining pressure on or opportunity for particular businesses, some providers said. Franklin County’s relative concentration of child care facilities near St. Albans, its largest city, is a pattern that has appeared elsewhere in the state, with some educators moving away from rural areas to improve enrollment and make ends meet.
Suzy’s Little Peanuts, a small chain of child care centers, recently closed locations in Brookline and Bellows Falls due to rising costs and lower demand.
“Brookline was kind of in the middle of nowhere, so we didn’t have as high of enrollment that we wanted,” said Kayla Gralia, the Springfield location director.
The business’ new location in Brattleboro opened on Monday, and though enrollments are starting slowly, Gralia said she expects the center to be at capacity soon.
“Brattleboro will probably be one of our most successful sites,” she said.
While Windham County appears better placed in Roche’s study than Franklin and other counties further north, demand for care slots still exceeds supply by over 100%.
Roche said child care in Vermont may be entering a new phase in which advocates and grant administrators should look to solve particular deficits in particular communities.
“We’re not quite there,” she said of developing such a county or town-specific strategy, but “I think that’s where we’re going.”
It might not just be about investment, Roche said — some communities use alternatives to full-time child care more often based on their particular demands. Essex County in particular has an unusually large proportion of part-time care providers.
“Every family is different, and every child has different needs,” she said.

The vote, which was held after 30% of union members brought a petition, was 73-38 to maintain the union, a slightly wider margin of support than the initial vote to form the union in 2024.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Jan. 22, 2026.
Just over a year after they first voted to form a labor union, Copley Hospital workers voted to continue the union in a rare decertification vote, which, if successful, would have led to its dissolution.
The Copley support staff voted last Wednesday 73-38 to maintain the union, in a secret ballot election supervised by the National Labor Review Board. The vote showed a slightly wider margin of support than the initial vote to form a union in November 2024, where support for organizing was 68-44.

The vote was held after 30% of union members brought a petition to force another vote on the matter. This came following a year of slow-moving contract negotiations and a pay increase offer from hospital administration for non-union employees.
“Our coworkers spoke clearly today. We voted to stay organized, to fight for a livable wage and fight for a fair contract so we can provide the best care to our patients and the community,” Sarah Bray, a member of the support staff at Mansfield Orthopedics in Waterbury, said in a statement after the vote results were announced last Thursday, Jan. 15.
“We respect the democratic process that played out and the decision employees made against decertification of their union,” Wayne Stockbridge, chief of administration and human resources at Copley, said in a statement following the vote. “While we had hoped to return to a direct working relationship, we accept the outcome of the vote. Our priority now is to move forward constructively and collaboratively.”
Though Copley officials have emphasized in public statements that this push for a new referendum was enacted on unionized employees’ “own accord” and that a year of contract negotiations with the support staff union was done “in good faith,” internal and public communications leading up to the vote indicated hospital administration would strongly prefer the employees not be unionized.
Following the successful union drive at the end of 2024 — the vote was held after a year of organizing by staff and the Northeast Nurses Union to address issues around growing disparity and benefits, and seeing the protections enjoyed by their nursing colleagues, who have been unionized since 1997 — support staff entered into contract negotiations with hospital administration.
For eight months, these negotiations proceeded slowly, with much time spent constructing a fair wage scale, something Bray said the hospital did not have in place for support staff.
Then, in an Aug. 11 internal memo, Copley CEO Joe Woodin put additional pressure on contract negotiations by announcing a 5% raise for hospital staff, but not for union employees, as “union members follow the guidelines outlined in the contract or are subject to union agreements with current negotiations.”
Woodin did not comment for this story.
Bray said she believed frustration around the length of the contract negotiations and the timing of the announcement that support staff were not receiving a 5% raise led to the decertification petition.
“The staff, I think in general, are frustrated with the fact that it’s hard enough to survive on what we make already, given the rising cost of living,” Bray said. “That 5% makes a big difference for people over the years, and we want to make sure that that’s something we get every year, at least.”
While nearly a third of Copley support staff were required to hold a decertification vote, hospital administration did not shy away from voicing their support for their staff hoping to return to business as usual.
After the initial unionization effort, the Northeast Nurses Association submitted multiple complaints to the National Labor Review Board, alleging that Copley administration had violated the National Labor Relations Act and unlawfully fired two employees for engaging in unionization activities.
Woodin said at the time that he had resolved these complaints with the NLRB. A request for comment from the board was directed to the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, which did not return a request for comment.
On Dec. 30, Stockbridge sent out a memo emphasizing that not including union staff in the 5% raise was “not a punishment but a legal requirement.”
He added that first contract negotiations often take well over a year and would likely continue to drag on if the union was not decertified.
He also emphasized the cost of union dues to employees as the downsides of a seniority-based promotion system favored by unions, as opposed to Copley’s focus on “individual performance and the ability to work flexibly with our team.”
“We believe the relationship Copley has with our employees is stronger, more productive, and more responsive without a union,” Stockbridge wrote in the Dec. 30 memo, noting benefits employees were previously offered, like gift cards for local businesses during the holiday.
“We strive to treat our employees fairly without the need for a third party,” he wrote.
On the eve of the decertification vote, the hospital published a public letter from interim Chief Operating Officer Carol Ferrante that encouraged support staff to “make your decision based on what is best for your own personal interest and your family,” claiming again that unions privilege seniority, not merit, when it comes to promotions.
“I feel very strongly that promotions and opportunities should be based on merit. If we are bound by rigid union rules regarding seniority, we lose the flexibility to reward the individuals who are working the hardest to make Copley great,” she wrote.
Most of the hospital’s support staff were apparently not convinced.
“The outcome reinforces what support staff have said consistently since organizing: They are seeking a contract that delivers fair wages, transparency, and the resources necessary to provide quality patient care,” Katie Doodie, a regional organizer for the Northeast Nurses Association, wrote in a statement following the vote. “Workers say today’s election result is a clear signal to management to come to the table promptly and negotiate in good faith to reach agreement.”

Smile
Jordan Kramer, 15, Hinesburg
The last thing that brought a smile to my lips was a school hallway interaction. A girl I’d never seen before passed by me, and gave me the biggest smile. It quite literally felt like sunlight seeping into my core. Even after she had passed me, there was still a trace of a smile on my face. And that reminded me of something.
When I was little, I used to play a game with my sister where we would take our bicycles around
Burlington. The game went like this: Each person who smiled back at us on the bike path was worth one point, and we would compete to get the most points. We would smile hugely until our face muscles felt tight.
I remember how much my own smile and my sister’s would tint my day with joy. What a beautiful time.

Josh Shapiro addressed mounting fear about immigration enforcement tactics Saturday hours after federal agents shot and killed another person in Minneapolis amid escalating confrontations with the city’s residents, government and public safety officials. 
“What we are seeing in Minnesota is absolutely unacceptable,” Shapiro said. “It is so dangerous, not just for Minnesota, but for the entire country. … What’s happening in Minneapolis could happen here in Philadelphia, or in Pittsburgh, or in Lancaster, or in other communities across our commonwealth. And I will just tell you this: We are prepared for that.”
Shapiro spoke in response to a submitted question about what he’s doing to keep Pennsylvanians safe from Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a book signing at Parkway Central Library in Philadelphia.  Just outside, on a historically cold afternoon, hundreds of people rallied in protest of ICE’s surge in several states in recent months – and what they’ve said has been silence and inaction from the governor as he launches a re-election campaign.  Shapiro is also mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for president.

Andrew Lefkowitz, of Montgomery County, came into the city for the event organized by advocacy groups including the Pennsylvania Immigration Coalition and Council on Islamic Relations.
Lefkowitz, 32, said he wanted to protest test the governor “not really doing much about ICE in Pennsylvania.” Although, the inaction isn’t limited to Shapiro, he added. 
“Democratic leadership … they’re throwing up their hands and saying, ‘Oh, well, you know, not much we can do. We’re doing our best,’” said Lefkowitz, an activist who’s been helping people and their families find legal assistance and other support when they’re arrested by ICE. “They’re trying to play by the rules. And Trump is throwing the rules out the window.”
Lefkowitz said he felt a particular sense of urgency Saturday after learning a U.S. Border Patrol officer had shot and killed 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. It was the second fatal shooting since the Department of Homeland Security started deploying thousands of immigration officers last month to the Twin Cities region and beyond. 
Last week, the death of 37-year-old Renee Good was ruled a homicide. And details emerged about the DHS memo laying out a legal argument to justify warrantless forced entry to people’s homes.  
Shapiro said Saturday his administration is doing “tabletop exercises” and planning.

“We are working with our partners at the local level and where we can at the federal level to ensure their safety, and to ensure that we can continue to keep and build bonds and trust that exist, … and not have it eroded by the federal government sending in ICE against the wishes of the mayor or against the wishes of the governor,” he said.
Shapiro also said “we do not do ICE’s work for them here in Pennsylvania.”
“Our state police [don’t] ask for people’s status and we do not share any of that information with the federal government,” he said. 
Advocates, however, have flagged a couple loopholes in the Pennsylvania State Police’s civil immigration law enforcement policy that they say need to be closed, which would all but sever communication with ICE. It’s one in a list of executive actions they say the governor should take to protect immigrants and the general public amid the Trump administration’s enforcement surge. 
Meanwhile, dozens of the commonwealth’s other law enforcement agencies – local police, constables and county jails and sheriffs departments – have contracts formalizing ICE cooperation. 
Known as 287(g) agreements, they delegate to local law enforcement ICE tasks and responsibilities that differ depending on the type of agreement in place. The most common one among Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies, by far, is a task force model. It affords the most authority of three 287(g) types, empowering trained officers to carry out enforcement actions such as making civil immigration arrests, collecting evidence for deportation cases and issuing requests to other agencies to detain people for suspected immigration violations. 
Those agreements would be banned or restricted by proposals being developed in the state legislature modeled after laws already in place in some other states.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Lawmakers lodging complaints to Arkansas’ colleges and universities isn’t necessarily anything new. Legislators have no qualms telling school leaders when they or their constituents are displeased.
In recent years, it’s likely had more to do with football coaches than law school deans.
But the swiftness by which the University of Arkansas withdrew its offer to incoming Law School Dean Emily Suski is a sign of the new reality for higher education in the state. And it signals to lawmakers how quickly schools could bow to pressure.
The UA’s about-face has become the latest flashpoint over academic freedom as schools around the country face increased Republican scrutiny, from President Donald Trump down to state officials. 
The backlash over the school’s decision to withdraw Suski’s offer has created unwanted headlines nationally for the UA. Closer to home, the decision prompted a walkout by students and sparked fears from professors about their own freedom of speech.
An Arkansas Supreme Court decision last year that could open the door to the Legislature taking further control over higher education and direct say over hiring and firing officials.
The court unanimously ruled last year that the Legislature has the authority to scale back constitutional amendments that were proposed and approved by the people. 
Most of the attention following that decision was on progressive measures the state had approved because of citizen initiatives, including the 2016 amendment that legalized medical marijuana. The ruling raised concern among groups that have been trying to put proposals on the ballot dealing with redistricting and reproductive rights. 
But it might also mean the Legislature can revisit the constitutional amendment that was aimed at giving higher education the kind of independence that Suski’s defenders say is now at risk.
That amendment, also known as Amendment 33, was ratified in 1942 in response to a different kind of political meddling. The University of Arkansas back then faced the ire of Democratic Gov. Homer Adkins and his efforts to fire then-president and eventual U.S. senator J. William Fulbright.
In a bit of irony, it was another law school dean who took center stage in that fight over higher education’s independence. Then, it was Robert Leflar.
Even before the court’s ruling on constitutional amendments last year, the Legislature had a political advantage that was clear. 
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has made targeting “indoctrination” at all levels of education a clear priority. That line of attack has found favor with legislators, especially those facing primary fights in March. 
The UA’s flagship school had already taken steps that appeared to be in response to higher ed’s role as a culture war battleground. That includes the school’s decision to close its diversity, equity and inclusion office in 2023. Late last year, the school removed the head of its Middle East Studies office over comments made about Israel.
The school’s posting of Ten Commandments displays on the Fayetteville campus — in compliance with a 2025 state law — led an alumnus to pull two scholarships he had funded.
Republicans hold an overwhelming majority that could turn the normal holds on budgets that are a headache for schools and other state agencies into an outright nightmare when the fiscal session begins in April.
The challenge facing UA leaders is how they can reassure nervous faculty and students that they’re not effectively handing over every administrative decision to lawmakers. Or that faculty’s curriculum vitae won’t be scoured for any material politically unpopular in a deeply Republican state.
At the same time, they’ll have to provide that reassurance in a way that doesn’t threaten opening up a deeper fight with the Legislature over who controls the higher education system. 
It’s a difficult if not impossible balancing act that could define not just the Fayetteville campus’ future but that of higher education overall in Arkansas.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260120_LawSchoolProtest6_Grajeda-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-25 06:57:30.954770

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/25/susan-keane-ct-retires/,"Keane, the recently retired senior administrator of the Appropriations Committee, leaves a legacy as a fierce advocate for public access.","For the past four decades, Susan Keane has helped to shape Connecticut’s schools and communities, health care and social programs, transportation systems and environment.
Few people noticed.
In many ways the behind-the-scenes chief architect of the state’s budget adoption process, Keane has piloted dozens of legislatures through the labyrinthine task of crafting the multibillion plans that guide so much of life here.
Whether shepherding hundreds of bills, overseeing months of public hearings, arranging research or preserving records, Keane has been the one constant in a process in perpetual flux.
But when the General Assembly convenes its next regular session on Feb. 4, Keane — for the first time in 43 years — won’t be there.
The recently retired senior administrator of the Appropriations Committee leaves an overarching legacy as the model of nonpartisan support that drives democracy, as a fierce advocate for public access and as a trainer to countless staff, legislators and lobbyists.
I feel I have an obligation to make that process as open to the general public as the joint rules will allow.Susan Keane
Keane, 69, who stepped down in late November due to health issues, will be missed for her sharp Irish wit and fiery red hair — not to mention a deep appreciation for music and dance.
“The genuine calmness under pressure, being precise without being rigid, and being deeply respectful to people at every level,” Taylor Aitken of Lebanon, who succeeds Keane, said of her mentor. “She made people feel, whatever question you came to her with, that you mattered. You don’t replace someone like Susan. You carry forward what she’s built.”
“She will be missed by people who never even experienced her,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat and veteran member of the Appropriations Committee. “Her role wasn’t just the committee administrator. Her role was the thread who ties through everything.”
Open, accessible government comes first
The “everything” that Keane tried to preserve was nothing less than Connecticut’s legislative process, from the smallest proposal to the $27.2 billion spending plan lawmakers approved last June for the current fiscal year.
“My philosophy was always to be the ultimate facilitator of moving bills properly,” Keane said. “That’s the bottom line. That’s my north star, the process of good government.”
By far the most grueling of legislative committees, Appropriations has 12 subcommittees and, at any given time, several other affiliated working groups or task forces.
In the final weeks of the legislative session, leaders negotiate a budget with the governor’s staff, a process that can take weeks or months, marked by days that start mid-morning and end well after midnight.
Sue Keane [was] the person who operated the nuclear power plant and never allowed it to melt down.Spencer Cain, state fiscal analyst
Proposals offered in the middle of the night often must be ready for a vote within a day.
“Many people likened Sue Keane to the person who kept the trains running on time,” said Spencer Cain, a state fiscal analyst for three decades prior to his retirement in 2009. “But I likened Sue Keane to the person who operated the nuclear power plant and never allowed it to melt down.”
For Keane, “good government” goes way beyond keeping good records and facilitating legislators’ research. It involves linking residents with their government.
That means given people access to public records — even if state officials prefer otherwise, said Betty Gallo, a lobbyist for more than 40 years who retired in 2018.
“If she could possibly give [a budget document] to me, she gave it to me,” Gallo said. “She never said ‘I don’t have time,’ or ‘I’m not going to get that, it’s too much trouble.’”
But Keane was better known for making face-to-face connections happen.
That means everyone gets a chance to testify before legislators. If special technology, unconventional hours or other adjustments must be made, so be it.
People with mental illness might not be able to stay long in a crowded hearing room. And if so, others — including state officials — might have to wait for their chance to speak with the committee.
“I feel I have an obligation to make that process as open to the general public as the joint rules will allow,” Keane said. “And that’s one of the things that I’m most proud of.”
Regardless of the logistics, “she always made it work,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, a New Haven Democrat and current House chair of the Appropriations Committee who said Keane clearly loved the challenge. “And you could see her wheels turning. Her right hand would start going like she was pounding out a beat in her mind.”
Never one to shrink from a challenge
Not shrinking from a challenge was a virtue instilled in Keane by some of her earliest mentors.
Born Susan Ann Keane in June 1959 on Capitol Avenue in Hartford, just a few minutes from gold-domed building that would dominate her career, she would learn from her father, John, that a polite joke and a smile can turn back many aggressive people.
“I can dish as well as I can be served,” she said.
She spent most of her childhood just east of the Connecticut River, graduating from Manchester High School before attending the University of Hartford, where she learned about a Capitol internship.
Not intending to work in government but thinking it could be interesting, she decided to try.
Her compassion and empathy transcended the legislative process.Vincent J. Candelora, House Minority Leader
After two years of assisting Rep. Thom Serrani of Stamford, then co-chair of the Transportation Committee, he asked her to remain on as clerk. Keane accepted but had no interest in “the money committees” because they “used to kill all of the transportation bills.”
That changed in 1983 term when “my legislative godmother,” Secretary of the State Julia Tashjian, insisted Keane drop her grudge and interview to clerk the Appropriations Committee.
After five minutes with that group’s House chair, Waterford Democrat Janet Polinsky, Keane was hooked for life.
“Janet and I clicked immediately, like a bolt of lightning struck, and I don’t say that lightly,” she said.
Keane loved Polinsky’s insistence on inclusiveness, respect for the governor down to the most obscure staffer, and zero tolerance for those disrespectful to rank-and-file workers.
If lobbyists or politicians sought a meeting with Polinsky, Keane said, “She would look at me and say: ‘Do we like them?’ And that was Janet’s code for, ‘Are they good to you?’”
Though also protective of staff, Keane shies away from confrontations.
Though she likes being called “Susan” and “cherishes” being named after her grandmother, Keane says nothing when many at the Capitol call her “Sue” because “I’m uncomfortable correcting people.”
Her desk is the building’s unofficial “therapy room,” Aitken said. Gallo occasionally found excuses to visit the Appropriations Committee office, just to run into Keane. “She was one of those people, when you have a bad day, you would just drop by,” Gallo said. “You’d feel better when you left. And that’s not a small skill.”
‘Lucy and Ethel’ of the General Assembly
Still, there was one type of friction Keane always relished: between Appropriations and its opposite number, the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. One group figures out how government spends money, the other how it raises it.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who spent most of his career on Finance said Appropriations — which hears countless impassioned pleas from program advocates seeking funding — is often called the “feeling committee.” Those on Finance, though, are members of the “thinking committee.”
But Candelora says no one is held in higher respect than Keane. 
“Her compassion and empathy transcended the legislative process,” he added.
Keane appreciated Candelora’s praise but said he’s wrong about the two committees.
“Despite what Finance thinks, Appropriations is the most unique committee in the legislature,” she said. “That’s gospel, my friend.”
Ironically, Keane’s closest friend during her legislative career was Mary Finnegan of South Windsor, senior administrator of the Finance Committee for most of her 37-year career until her retirement in 2014.
“For a good year, I felt like I was missing a piece of me” after Finnegan left, Keane said.
She made sure that [the governor’s staff] and the committee were able to work through all our differences and learn to respect one another.Ben Barnes, budget director for former Gov. Dannel P. Malloy
Both hold the legislative process and public access in the highest regard. Neither suffer fools gladly.
For decades, legislative leaders called upon both senior administrators to train new staff, new legislators and lobbyists, a job for which Keane was perfect.
“She was definitely a feeler,” Finnegan said. “She was very supportive of people. She formed relationships.”
In the 1980s and ’90s, when the legislature hosted huge parties in the Capitol shortly after the session’s midnight adjournment, Keane and Finnegan were the chief organizers.
“We were like the hostess with the most-est,” Finnegan said, adding that Keane, an accomplished Irish step dancer, “could cut a rug.”
But none, Finnegan added, could match Keane’s encyclopedic knowledge of music, whether classical, big band, jazz, pop, rock or hip-hop.
The duo, because of their camaraderie and similar passions, became known as “Lucy and Ethel,” though it never was entirely clear who was who.
Keane shared Lucille Ball’s red hair, but modestly insists Finnegan, like Lucy, “was the alpha.”
It mattered little. Both women insist the other was the consummate friend and public servant. And no challenge was so great it could withstand their combined efforts.
“Do you have time to meet me at the railing?” was code, Keane said, for meeting on an upper floor of the Legislative Office Building, “consoling one another, solving the world’s problems.”
Avoiding partisanship – but not laughter
But despite her passion for work, Keane found time to enjoy the Capitol’s lighter moments.
Former House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero, a Norwalk Republican who retired in 2016, recalled at least one time Keane allowed a huge break in her focused demeanor during a committee meeting. But it took a highly atypical topic: whether to fund a new state ranger to monitor flocks of free-range chickens.
“I think I blurted out, ‘There’s a post you don’t see at the job fair in high school,’” Cafero told the Connecticut Mirror. “She just lost it. She had to literally excuse herself from the room. When she came back, she sat down — and lost it again.”
Superior Court Judge Robert Genuario, a Norwalk Republican who spent a more than a decade in the Senate and on Appropriations in the 1990s and 2000s, credits Keane’s sense of humor with averting a budget crisis in 1995.
With Republicans holding the Senate for the first time in a decade and Democrats the House, both entered the final days of the session agreeing on spending for health care, education and other core programs while lowering taxes one year down the road.
But they couldn’t decide which chamber and party would get to adopt the new budget first.
It’s critical that we maintain that sense of objectivity, which sometimes flies in the face of being human.Susan Keane
Keane, whose committee staffed those negotiations, “just started laughing like it was nobody’s business,” Genuario said. “All of these weighty issues that impact people in their daily lives, and we got stuck on … inside baseball.”
But it was her laughter that showed legislators their stubbornness, Genuario said, adding the House got the first vote and Connecticut got its tax break.
 “It strikes me as indicative of her ability to respect all people … not to take sides, but pave the way for a good working environment,” he said.
Keane also refused to be adversarial with the Executive Branch, said Ben Barnes, who was Gov. Dannel P. Malloy’s budget director from 2011 through 2018.
“As much as anyone, she made sure that [the governor’s staff] and the committee were able to work through all our differences and learn to respect one another,” he said.
Keane could work with anyone who respected her allegiance to an open and fair legislative process, said New Haven Democrat Bill Dyson, who served 32 years in the legislature through 2008 and co-chaired the Appropriations Committee for much of that time.
She was the glue that sort of held everything together.Former Sen. Toni Harp, D-New Haven
“She had a certain aura about her work that was beneficial,” he said. “Once you knew she was serious, she was easy to get along with. You do what you’re supposed to do.”
But there was one time Keane found it hard to remain silent as others debated issues.
Her son, Daniel, is on the autism spectrum, and Keane recalled a debate in the early 2010s over whether to increase funding for mental health supports.
At the urging of Sen. Toni Harp, a New Haven Democrat and co-chairwoman of Appropriations at the time, Keane agreed to share with legislators the challenges, “the journey” her son and family faced. But that was it.
“That was the hardest thing for me,” she said, but as a nonpartisan staffer, “it’s critical that we maintain that sense of objectivity, which sometimes flies in the face of being human.”
Harp said Keane’s dedication to her role was unmatched. “She just knew all the rules,” Harp said. “She was the glue that sort of held everything together.”
COVID presented the ultimate test
Keane faced one of her greatest challenges in March 2020 when the General Assembly closed its regular session two months early with the coronavirus’ arrival. Although leaders planned to reconvene the 2021 session on time the following January, it soon became clear that most residents wouldn’t be vaccinated by then.
Legislators needed safe access to their constituents and to each other, but the heart of committee work — public hearings, orderly debate and voting — had to be preserved.
Keane, who says she was cursed with “lousy gene pools” and has battled Bell’s palsy, heart disease, and sleep apnea, feared for herself, other legislative staffers and for their family members who might be infected through second-hand exposure.
But when legislative leaders tasked her with developing new procedures for all committees, she also saw an opportunity to deliver a more open government long after the COVID outbreak slowed.
“This idea of expanding access to people has been percolating in my head for decades,” she added.
Remote online hearings, once considered unwieldy at best and unworkable at worst, became possible.
The legislature increased its reliance on The Connecticut Network, its 24-hour cable television and internet news service that records countless events at the Capitol and Legislative Office Building. Meanwhile, Keane created numerous YouTube channels to serve the committees.
Procedures were created to allow remote constituent testimony. And the voting process was deliberately slowed to allow each legislator in remote attendance to first show their face on camera, state their name, and then cast their vote.
Her legacy is woven into the building.Taylor Aitken, incoming senior administrator of appropriations committee
Lawmakers often forgot one step or another at first in a voting process that already could get complicated quickly by amendments and other special rules.
Keane steered them back gently but relentlessly, part operatic conductor, part Simon Says leader.
“Are you on [camera] yet?” was a common response to lawmakers who tried to vote remotely with sound on but camera off. “I know you’re trying.”
When Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, once got confused and addressed Keane as the “chairwoman” of the committee, the senior administrator smiled and said, “Why thank you, madame” for the promotion.
But those changes took hold, and now most committees operate in hybrid fashion, allowing remote or in-person attendance, something Walker said has greatly improved attendance and facilitated scheduling.
Finnegan said only Keane could have developed that new system — and kept legislators from rejecting it. “She is incredibly creative,” Finnegan said. “I kept watching it on TV saying, ‘I would kill myself.’ That was a tremendous load of work. … She was the go-to person.”
Finding time for family, leaving a legacy
Finnegan also marveled that Keane, despite carrying a weekly workload that often exceeded 70 or 80 hours, found time for family.
Keane met her husband, Vincent Mazzotta, when he represented Portland and Cromwell in the House of Representatives in the late 1980s. They married in 1993, years after he had left General Assembly. Besides their son, they also have a daughter.
And though Keane lives in nearby East Hartford, she said her family sometimes sacrificed because she couldn’t get home soon enough.
“There were concerts and plays that were missed,” she said. “They went to bed without being tucked in by their mom, having a story read or getting a good night kiss. And that took a toll.”
But when the legislative session was over, Keane said, everything took a back seat to family.
There were frequent vacations to Cape Cod, “which is our favorite place on earth,” and lots of “unstructured time” that was just about being together.  “There were days we didn’t get out of our pajamas,” she said. “There were times we had what we called a ‘totally chocolate dinner.'”
“You can never recapture what was lost, but you can find a way to make memories, and I worked very hard to do that for my children.”
Legislators knew how many priorities Keane juggled for years, Candelora said, adding they couldn’t resent their workloads when they saw how she handled hers, day after day.
“She always set the tone with a smile,” he said.
Keane’s example and dedication, Aitken added, is as much her legacy as the knowledge she shared with so many, or the budgets and countless other bills she helped legislators produce.
“Her legacy is woven into the building,” she added. “If you worked in the legislature or adjacent, there’s a very good chance you learned something from Susan.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_SusanKeane_085-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-25 05:57:50.481675

As costs rise, residents need flexible, affordable options that support their daily lives.","For most of us, the phone in our pocket has quietly become the center of daily life. It’s how we manage work schedules, school updates, medical appointments, transportation, and the constant stream of communication that keeps a household running. In Connecticut, where communities range from dense suburban neighborhoods to more rural stretches, staying reliably connected isn’t just convenient, it’s essential.
Yet the cost of that connection has steadily climbed. Families are stretching budgets to cover multiple lines. Young adults entering the workforce are navigating rising living expenses with little room for unexpected bills. Seniors, many of whom now rely on mobile devices for telehealth and staying in touch with loved ones, are finding that dependable service can feel like a luxury rather than a given. And in areas where coverage is inconsistent, even the most basic tasks (confirming an appointment, checking a bus schedule, receiving a school alert) can become unexpectedly difficult.
These challenges don’t always make headlines, but they shape the rhythm of everyday life. More households are relying on mobile service as their primary connection to work, school, and healthcare, even as costs continue to rise. When mobile service becomes too expensive or unreliable, the effects ripple outward, a missed job opportunity, a delayed message from a child’s teacher, a dropped telehealth call. The small disruptions add up.

That’s why the conversation around mobile affordability matters so much right now. Residents need options that reflect the realities of modern life: plans that don’t force them into paying for more than they use, coverage that supports them whether they’re at home or on the go, and service that adapts to the needs of families, singles, seniors, and everyone in between.
Cox Mobile is one of the providers working to meet those needs by rethinking how mobile service can fit into people’s lives. Instead of one‑size‑fits‑all plans, Cox Mobile offers flexible options that allow residents to choose what works for them, whether that’s a predictable monthly rate for a busy household or a lower‑usage plan for someone who simply needs reliable connectivity without the financial strain. For many, it’s the ability to stay connected without paying for data they don’t use. For others, it’s the reassurance that their mobile service will support virtual appointments, job applications, or school communication without interruption.

These kinds of choices matter. They give residents more control over their budgets and their connectivity, and they help ensure that staying connected doesn’t become another source of stress. As Connecticut continues to evolve and the demand for connectivity increases, the importance of accessible, dependable mobile service will only grow. It supports workforce participation, strengthens family communication, and helps residents navigate the demands of a fast‑moving world.

When people can stay connected without financial strain, the benefits extend far beyond the device itself. It’s about stability, opportunity, and the ability to participate fully in daily life, no matter where you live or what stage of life you’re in.

And of time, memory, and knowing when to let go.
On the last long trip in our old Jeep I topped a hill west of Meade in southwest Kansas one evening and was buffeted by the wake of a double tractor-trailer going the opposite direction. Trucks on that stretch of U.S. 54 Highway don’t dawdle, and the turbulence rattled my hood so hard that the exterior latch on the passenger’s side came loose. I cursed and pulled the Jeep over at a wide spot on the shoulder, put the gearshift in neutral, and set the parking brake. Then I got out to inspect the damage.
Owners of older Jeeps might know the weird hood flutter endemic to the vehicle. There’s a center latch underneath that keeps the hood from flying up and smacking the windshield, but there are two outside latches that keep the corners of the hood more or less secure.
On this particular model of Jeep, a 2010 Wrangler JK, the straps of the stock hood latches are made of rubber, which stretch as they age and make the hood flutter more severe. After a few years, the rubber breaks, which makes for an unpleasant highway experience, and you also lose some hardware. During the life of the Jeep, I had replaced the latch-strap combination at least three times.
I finally tried an aftermarket all-aluminum latch, which took an hour in the driveway and resulted in skinned knuckles from jamming wrenches inside the fender to reach some of the nuts, but I hadn’t gotten the tension right, which put me on the side of the road dealing with the problem. I didn’t have the right hex wrenches, or enough daylight left, for a permanent fix. So I resorted to a temporary repair.

In past years, I’d used an assortment of bits and bobs to secure broken hood latches while on the road, including once using an old fishing stringer. I had since learned to keep a small roll of baling wire in the back. As I finished up the temporary repair and snipped off the excess wire with the cutter on a pair of needle nose pliers, I looked back down the highway toward Meade and saw the all-but-full moon just above the lonely horizon.
In the other direction, the setting sun was a blazing beacon.
It was Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.
The juxtaposition of sun and moon seemed significant.
I was on my way to the Oklahoma panhandle to research a forthcoming book, and even before I left home, I was having jitters about the fitness of the 15-year-old Jeep to make the journey.
The engine was still good, but the clutch was beginning to slip after nearly 180,000 miles. The passenger side headlight sometimes winked out, but thumping it usually brought it back. There was a Christmas tree of warning lights on the dash from an ABS module that had failed, and I had spent much of the last month haunting dealerships in various towns across eastern Kansas in a vain attempt to find one in stock. The part appeared to be on permanent backorder. The brakes still worked, but I didn’t have any of the fancy stuff like traction control. The factory CD player in the dash had stopped working about a decade ago, the passenger’s side heater didn’t work, and a rear main engine seal was leaking, requiring me to add a quart of 5W-20 every couple of thousand miles.
Perhaps worst of all, a driver in a Dodge truck had failed to yield at an intersection during a September trip to Texas and struck us a glancing blow, creasing the driver’s side rear quarter panel and shattering the plastic fender flare. I had gotten a replacement fender from eBay and attached it with fasteners from Harbor Freight, but there was still the smear of green paint from the Durango on the Jeep’s silver panel.
It was the only mishap in the Jeep, and it scared me and Kim badly. The Dodge had come from behind a semi into our lane, and although I steered far enough over to prevent tragedy, there was still contact, accompanied by a loud bang and flying debris. Nobody was hurt in the collision, but it was a lesson in mortality. If my reaction had been a split-second later, if the point of contact with the Durango had only been a few inches ahead, it would have been grim.
For years we’d had a sense of safety in the Wrangler, but the cold equations of physics had allowed us a glimpse of the catastrophe possible in meeting a bad driver at the wrong time. I developed a fear of passing semis because you never can tell what’s lurking on the other side, but that feeling eventually passed. The Wrangler was old and battered, but it had kept us safe in the only accident we’d had in 14 years of marriage.
But as I stood at the side of the road, at the crest of the hill outside Meade, I finally admitted to myself that the silver Jeep had likely reached the end of its useful life as a highway vehicle. It was a realization I had been resisting because the Jeep wasn’t just a vehicle. It had become a four-wheel-drive icon of freedom to roam. I’ve driven Jeeps daily since 1999. If you’d like to know the story of the first military Jeep sold to civilians after World War II, you can find it here. Jeeps are noisy, finicky, and sometimes just plain trouble, but there’s no substitute for authenticity or trail-worthiness. I’d had the silver Jeep, the 2010, the longest of any, and it took us from Sacramento to upstate New York and just about everywhere in between.
There’s not a corner of Kansas we didn’t visit in the silver Jeep from home base in east central Kansas, and the towns we explored were a lesson in state history: Arkansas City, Atchison, Cherryvale, Colby, Coffeyville, Cottonwood Falls, Council Grove, Dodge City, Elkhart, Fort Scott, Garden City, Greensburg, Hays, Iola, Lawrence, Leavenworth, Lecompton, Liberal, Lucas, Lyons, Manhattan, Marion, Newton, Peabody, Kansas City, Osawatomie, Shawnee Mission, Topeka, Wamego, Wichita and many others.

I know the Jeep was not a living thing, but an object. Yet those two round headlights reminded me so much of a horse it was easy to forget. I sometimes found myself patting a fender of the Wrangler in the way you would an animal. Kim tells me that I tend to get along better with machines than people — automobiles, guitars and amplifiers, ham radios, old stereos — and that is true enough. It isn’t the machines themselves I am fascinated with, but in the way these machines are connected with the world we know. Whenever we fall in love with a family car, it’s not the car we cherish, but the memories of our lives in that car. Take Kim out of the equation and the silver Jeep becomes just another vehicle.
It wasn’t a particularly valuable car otherwise.
It was a bog standard Wrangler Sport S with a black hard top and alloy wheels. They were produced in the tens of thousands. It was already a year old when I bought it, with a loan from the credit union, and the price seemed high at the time — around $16,000. Looking back, I realize it was among the last of a breed, with no touch screen in the middle of the dash and a mostly analog driving experience, including manual transmission.
Even when it was 15 years old, I still thought of it as the “new” Jeep. It always seemed that way, even when it was beginning to fail. Cars changed dramatically during the time I owned the Jeep, something I was confronted with every time I had to rent a car for business. Everything seemed to be controlled by a menu instead of a switch or a button. Are cars better now? Absolutely. They are safer, faster, more sure-footed. But I think I’ll always miss the silver Jeep.
Among the memories I’ll hold tight to is loading the back of the Jeep with personal things from my office in Plumb Hall after I was among more than 30 faculty members fired at Emporia State University. You can read about the purge in this column from 2022, but what you need to know is that our termination wasn’t our fault. I filled the Jeep with crates of my books, boxes of research, mementos from students. When I swung the tailgate shut, it marked the end of 17 years of teaching journalism, including the anxiety and chaos of the pandemic. The future was uncertain, but damned if I didn’t feel I was ready for anything with that gearshift under my right hand and Kim waiting at home on Constitution Street.
The next couple of years were tougher than we could have imagined.
The one thing that didn’t let us down was the Jeep.
It got us to the other side of a bad stretch. Yeah, it had a few problems, but it never left us stranded. It took us anywhere we asked of it. We did have a bad few minutes in Yellowstone National Park when a snowstorm was blowing in and the electrical system went dead, but a quick brushing of a corroded battery post got us rolling again.
We said farewell to the silver Jeep on Dec. 13, 2025, when we traded it in at a dealership. It had taken a day to clean out all the stuff that had accumulated over more than a decade. The glovebox was a time capsule of registrations, insurance cards, oil change receipts, assorted pens and business cards from people I didn’t remember. Beneath the passenger seat, I found a favorite pocketknife I’d lost three years before. From a plastic bag beneath the hood, zip-tied to the fender, was a spare car and house key to be used in case we locked ourselves out.
We had taken the back seat out so there would be more space for gear. There was camping equipment to get us through a night or two if needed, including sleeping bags and butane cook stoves; there was fishing equipment consisting of fishing rods in cases, a soft-sided tackle box, and a net and a stringer; a tackle box turned into a first aid kit with bandages and pain relievers and anti-itch ointments and other things that might be needed in a pinch; tools, including a tow strap, fuses, jumper cables, a flashlight and a full set of socket and open-end wrenches; a pair of my old boots stuck in a corner of the hard top, along with a clean pair of wool socks; a grey plastic bus bin used as a catch-all for maps, brochures, bandanas, Nalgene bottles, cups, trash bags, paper towels, snacks, a camera tripod and two pairs of flip-flops; and a badly scuffed orange utility box, with assorted outdoor gear, that had been in the back of every Jeep I’d owned over the past quarter century. All three had been daily drivers.
At the dealership, Kim made a final search of the Jeep, just to be sure.
From deep beneath the driver’s seat she pulled, fittingly enough, a reporter’s notebook. It was the last thing the old friend gave up.
I had been reluctant to trade in the Jeep. Even at the dealership, I tried to talk myself into keeping it, lied to myself there wasn’t all that much wrong with it, and thought wouldn’t it be nice to keep just to drive around town? But Kim said it was time, and I knew she was right. Still, we nearly left the dealership — in a different and newer Wrangler — with the keys to the old Jeep in my pocket.
I went back inside and tossed the keys to the service manager, who made a fine catch. And in that moment it was done.
Cheers to open roads and new chapters.

But if you must...,"I hate winter.  And winter hates transportation.
Growing up in The Great White North (Canada, eh?), winter seemed to last about six months.  This winter in Connecticut seems even longer.  But feet of snow and sub-freezing temperatures don’t have to stop you if you follow some tried and true travel hacks.



Traveling by car:
If a storm is coming, get your car off the street and into a garage.  That way the trucks can plow and you don’t have to dig out your ride.  
If you do have to clean off your car after a storm, include the roof in your efforts. Otherwise your car may start launching “ice missiles” at unsuspecting targets as you’re driving down I-84.  That can mean a fine and possible injury to others.
Keep your gas tank full.  Your windshield washer tank, too… with ice-melting fluids, not water.  Replace worn wipers before winter storms.  Frozen, shredded rubber on dirty glass turns night driving into roulette.


When you start your engine, let it idle for at least 20 to 30 seconds before driving to ensure adequate oil distribution.  Don’t race the engine.  This isn’t Daytona, and cold oil doesn’t respond well to your enthusiasm.
Drive with your traction control turned on and proceed with caution.  Just because you’re in a SUV, don’t assume that because your car is bigger it’s safer.
Check your tires.  For every 10 degree drop in temperature you lose one PSI in tire pressure.  Under-inflated tires mean longer stopping distances (before factoring in the ice), lower fuel economy and higher risk of blowouts.
If you’re in an EV anticipate that your car won’t charge as well in the cold.  And expect to lose 20-40% of your normal driving range.  Pre-conditioning the battery while plugged in can claw back some of that mileage.
Without sounding like a scolding parent, just assume the worst because winter always does. Keeping an emergency kit handy: a blanket, flashlight, phone charger, and gloves in the car isn’t paranoia, it’s planning.
Traveling by train:
While train travel is much safer in bad weather, it’s not immune to physics.  Sub-zero temperatures are the enemy of all things mechanical.
To their credit, Connecticut’s railroads have a much better record of performance in winter than in years past when service was pre-emptively cancelled to avoid stranding passengers.  But remember… parts of this railroad are 100+ years old and centenarians don’t like playing in the snow.
While apps like TrainTime have vastly improved communications, they’re not perfect.  Trust your eyes and crowd-source any mistake you see to the Twitter account @CTRailCommuters to advise your fellow riders.
If your station’s waiting room is locked or the platform is not shoveled / sanded, document it and call your town hall.  Commuters deserve heat and a safe path to their train.
Grabbing the first train in the morning darkness turns you into a guinea pig as it encounters frozen switches and doors so later trains don’t have to.  Overhead power lines can snap and strand you without heat, so opt for diesel powered trains if they’re an option.
And don’t forget to download and activate your ticket before boarding; this in case cell service is lost and you’re hit with an $8 fine under Metro-North’s new rules.
Keep your cell phone (and its winter-hating battery) fully charged and close to your body heat to preserve its power.  Stashing your phone in a bag or outside pocket will drain your power quickly.
Finally, ask yourself “Is this trip really necessary?”  Sometimes the smartest winter travel decision is deciding not to travel at all.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plowing-1.jpg,,,2026-01-25 04:56:12.636841

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Over a thousand people gathered for a vigil and rally Saturday night at Whittier Park in Minneapolis to mourn Alex Pretti, the man who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent. After the vigil, demonstrators marched in subzero temperatures to the site where Pretti was killed on Nicollet Avenue, south of 26th Street.
The site of the shooting has been turned into a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers, less than 2 miles away from the memorial in the Powderhorn neighborhood made for Renee Good on January 7, the day she was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.
Since Pretti’s killing, which drew hundreds of protestors in the immediate aftermath, people have built barricades out of dumpsters, trash cans and picnic tables to block off traffic from the surrounding streets. Before a swell of demonstrators arrived from the Whittier Park vigil, the area was mostly quiet, with hundreds huddled around his memorial.
Isabelle Atem, a nurse who drove in from Woodbury, cried as she said: “I thought it was just a dream, but… I’m here now. It feels real. It really happened. You know, in a movie, when you shoot people, I know it’s fake. I never knew it (could be) real.”
Atem said she felt bad when she found out Pretti was also a nurse. In a statement to multiple news outlets, Pretti’s parents said he was an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.
“Nurses are out there to help people. Why are they killing? Why are they shooting?” Atem said.
Atem, an immigrant from Cameroon, said that despite being a U.S. citizen, she has been afraid to go outside amid the surge of over 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minnesota, who have detained residents regardless of their citizenship status.

People were handing out warm drinks and food — fried rice, hummus — from local restaurants at tables at Pretti’s memorial. Glam Doll Donuts, across the street from where the Border Patrol agent shot Pretti, was open after hours and filled with people looking to stay warm.
As demonstrators from the nearby vigil filtered onto Nicollet, chanting, Jake Anderson handed out the last of the three gallons of chicken wild rice soup he had made that day.
Anderson, who lives in the Whittier neighborhood where Pretti was killed, said that he came to support everyone marching “a brutal takeover of our city by totalitarian ICE members and people who don’t actually care about safety in our community.”
“I think there’s a lot of outrage and rage clearly, but there’s also just a sense of community,” he said, as a man complimented his soup.
Some demonstrators banged on dumpsters with hammers and their hands as people chanted: “No Justice, No Peace” and “F*ck ICE.”
The parents of Alex Pretti, Michael and Susan Pretti, released a statement Saturday, castigating the Trump administration for slandering their son with “sickening lies” that they called “reprehensible and disgusting.”
They defended their son’s conduct, saying he was protecting a woman who had been pushed down by federal agents. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man. Thank you.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0729-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 22:56:50.623254

Family members identified the man who was killed as Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who had protested President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in his city. After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and protesters clashed with federal immigration officers, who wielded batons and deployed flash bangs.
The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, officials said. Guard troops were sent to both the shooting site and to a federal building where officials have squared off with protesters daily.
Information about what led up to the shooting was limited, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.
But Connecticut officials, including Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, quickly denounced the federal agents’ actions.
“It’s just f***ing awful, the inhumanity of this,” Murphy said in a video posted to social medial. “We cannot fund ICE as it is constituted today.”

Pam Bondi just sent a letter to Minnesota officials saying ICE will leave if the state turns over its voter database to Trump. Guess what? This has never been about safety or immigration. It’s a pretext for Trump to take over elections in swing states. pic.twitter.com/BHrQJUECJY— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 25, 2026

Sen. Richard Blumenthal criticized the Department of Homeland Security’s plan to investigate the shooting itself and called for an independent investigation.

Coverup in real time—if DHS investigates its own potential illegality. Congress must demand an independent investigation—immediately. A bipartisan call for justice—now. https://t.co/vgCHB6TJnR— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 24, 2026

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, joined the call for an independent investigation.
“The second fatal shooting by DHS agents in Minneapolis this month demands a thorough, professional homicide investigation by local and state authorities who are actually qualified to carry out that task,” Courtney said in a statement. “DHS leaders and agents have shown they are more interested in politically spinning the facts to escape accountability, which is one of many reasons why tensions in Minnesota and across the country are dangerously on edge. The DHS spending bill, which I opposed along with the entire Connecticut House Delegation this past week, will simply perpetuate the status quo rather than rein in DHS rogue behavior. The Senate still has a chance to vote to restore civilized norms in law enforcement, and for the sake of the country, they should act accordingly.”
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, called the shooting “sickening.”

The images coming from MN are absolutely horrifying. ICE agents have killed someone else.This must be investigated and ICE must leave MN.Residents should not have to fear the federal government. This is sickening.— Jahana Hayes (@RepJahanaHayes) January 24, 2026

Democratic state Rep. Farley Santos represents Danbury, where a number of ICE arrests took place last year.
“What we are witnessing should stop this country in its tracks,” Santos said in a press release. “We have seen children used as leverage, toddlers detained, kindergartners turned into bait, and now another human being killed. … What we are seeing is the result of unchecked power and reckless tactics … This is violence carried out under the color of authority. If we remain silent, it will only spread. What is happening is un-American, and it cannot continue.”
And a coalition of Connecticut immigration organizations released a statement to the media calling for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to be abolished.
“We are heartbroken,” reads the statement, signed by CT Students for a Dream, Danbury Unites for Immigrants, Colectivo de Defensa/Hartford Deportation Defense, Make the Road CT, New Haven Immigrants Coalition, Stamford Norwalk United For Immigrants and Unidad Latina en Acción.
“We stand with Minnesotans as they continue to face the terror of state violence and illegal actions by federal agents,” it continues. “We have seen first-hand ICE’s increasingly more violent tactics and the escalating number of detentions in CT and across the Northeast. … Our CT elected officials must ensure that Connecticut is not complicit in the federal government’s abusive immigration enforcement tactics or its creeping authoritarianism. We call on our state legislators to protect our privacy by regulating private companies’ ability to capture our personal information and ensure the national guard is not used for immigration enforcement.”
Trump lashes out
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation and fired “defensive shots” after a man with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him.
In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.
O’Hara said police believe the man was a “lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Pretti had shown up to “impede a law enforcement operation.” She questioned why he was armed but did not offer detail about whether Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.
The officer who shot the man is an eight-year Border Patrol veteran, federal officials said.
Trump weighed in on social media by lashing out at Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.
Trump shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: “What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers?”
Trump, a Republican, said the Democratic governor and mayor are “are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”
Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7, sparking widespread protests.
Pretti’s family released a statement Saturday evening saying they are “heartbroken but also very angry,” and calling him a kindhearted soul who wanted to make a difference in the world through his work as a nurse.
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,” the family statement said. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.”
Video shows officers, man who was shot
In a bystander video of Saturday’s shooting obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on Nicollet Avenue.
The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.
The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.
The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.
Soon at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man’s back and another who appears to have a canister in his hand strikes a blow to the man’s chest. Several officers try to bring the man’s arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.
A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it’s not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.
The police chief appealed for calm, both from the public and from federal law enforcement.
“Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,” the chief said. “We urge everyone to remain peaceful.”
Gregory Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration’s big-city immigration campaign, said the officer who shot the man had extensive training as a range safety officer and in using less-lethal force.
“This is only the latest attack on law enforcement. Across the country, the men and women of DHS have been attacked, shot at,” he said.
Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and that the state would lead the investigation into the latest fatal shooting.
But Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the shooting scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.
Amid the unrest, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will not vote for a spending package that includes money for DHS. Schumer’s statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down on Jan. 30 when funding runs out.
Protests continue in Minneapolis
Protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather.
At midday Saturday, the worst of an extreme cold wave was over, but the temperature was still -6 degrees (-21 Celsius).
After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car. Protesters dragged garbage dumpsters from alleyways to block the streets, and people who gathered chanted, “ICE out now” and “Observing ICE is not a crime.”
As dark fell, hundreds of people gathered quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting. Some carried signs saying “Justice for Alex Pretti.” Others chanted Pretti’s and Good’s names. A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.
Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration. “It feels like every day something crazier happens,” he said. “What’s happening in our community is wrong, it’s sickening, it’s disgusting.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26025029988353-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 21:56:35.553078

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin says she will vote against funding the Department of Homeland Security after federal immigration officers fatally shot a second American citizen in Minneapolis Saturday.
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said federal agents killed a 37-year-old man who was an American citizen and a lawful gun owner. The Associated Press identified the man as Alex Pretti.
Graphic video filmed by bystanders and posted to social media shows federal agents wrestling Pretti to the ground and hitting him with a firearm before multiple shots can be heard.
It is the second time this month U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have killed an American citizen in Minnesota. Federal agents previously shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7.
Slotkin, a Democrat from Holly, said the killings are “part of a continued, coordinated assault on our Constitutional rights — with specific focus on individuals and groups who disagree with this President.”
“As all Americans can see with their own eyes, ICE and those under their command are not acting as responsible law enforcement agencies,” Slotkin said. “They are recklessly inciting violence at the whims of the president. And they must be reined in before there is more killing.”

The appropriations package that Slotkin plans to vote against includes $64.4 billion in DHS funding for fiscal year 2026. It would reduce funding for Customs and Border Patrol by $1.3 billion but would continue funding ICE at current levels.
The package includes $20 million for officer-worn body cameras for ICE agents but stops short of additional guardrails that Democrats, including Slotkin, have demanded.
Republican leaders in the Senate plan to bring the DHS funding up as a single vote with funding for other government programs that have more support among Democrats.
The funding package would need to earn 60 votes in the Senate by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
Even if DHS funding lapses, federal agencies could tap into $170 billion of one-time funding for immigration enforcement that was included in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
All but seven Democrats in the U.S. House voted against the DHS funding. Michigan’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with every Republican voting to pass it and every Democrat voting against it.
Retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) has not indicated how he plans to vote on the funding package.
Federal agent shoots and kills man in Minneapolis, rousing more demonstrations

But he has called for a “full and impartial investigation by local police” into the fatal shootings of Pretti and Good.
In both cases, federal officials stonewalled state and local police from investigating and quickly began spreading a narrative that is not supported by videos shared by witnesses and reviewed by experts.
An F.B.I. agent investigating the shooting of Good resigned after the Trump administration pressured her to drop the civil rights inquiry, The New York Times reported.
While Michigan’s congressional Republicans have been largely silent on the killing, Democrats have been outspoken.
U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) echoed the calls for a “thorough, independent investigation.”
“Our communities deserve public safety and accountability — not a militarized presence that escalates fear, trauma, and loss of life,” Scholten said. “What we’re seeing isn’t how a world leader runs its immigration system. It’s evidence of chaos, cruelty, and dysfunction.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the actions of ICE agents are “not reflective of the high standards residents should expect of law enforcement officials.”
“This failure, in turn, compromises the ability of local and state law enforcement to do their jobs and jeopardizing the safety of police and civilians alike,” Nessel said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said Congress “must not send them one more taxpayer dollar without reforms that bring the agency back to its mission and in line with basic law enforcement best practices.”
“I’ve worked with brave, patriotic law enforcement officers for decades. They take their duties seriously to uphold our laws, de-escalate situations, and keep us safe,” McDonald Rivet said. “Lawless ICE operations are doing the opposite, and now we have chaos and dead Americans.”
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said that “anything less than abolishing ICE is a cowardly capitulation to fascism.”
“I am so sick of fake ass people who say they uphold our Constitution,” Tlaib said. “No you don’t if you fund this madness.”
U.S. Rep.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Hundreds in force, Mainers rallied this weekend against the Trump administration’s immigration operation in the state, decrying the arrests of their neighbors and recognizing those afraid to leave their homes who couldn’t join in protest. 
Since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement heightened its presence in Maine on Tuesday, the agency said it has arrested at least 100 people but provided few specifics, as public officials have called for transparency, to no avail. Community organizers, faith leaders, business owners, political officials and candidates at protests in Portland and Lewiston demanded accountability, pointing to the known detentions of at least several people with permission to work in the U.S. and no criminal records. 
Others shared personal stories and the anguish of loved ones who are afraid to leave their homes. 
Usually filled with children doing their homework and laughing, the office of Generational Noor, a youth education nonprofit in Lewiston, is now empty, said executive director Amran Osman. 
“They’re scared to show up because they think that showing up to somewhere means that they might not make it home,” Osman said. “No child should have to feel this way.”
Safiya Khalid, executive director of the Community Organizing Alliance, a Lewiston-based group boosting civic engagement among Black and immigrant communities, said her phone is filled with requests for help. A friend afraid to drive into work. Another in need of food, fearful they’ll be picked up outside the store. Detentions in both scenarios have already been documented in Maine.  
“But at the same time,” human rights activist Faisal Khan told Maine Morning Star, “more and more people are waking up; more and more people are speaking out, not only in protest but really showing support to the marginalized communities that are being targeted right now.”
While many comments at rallies were targeted calls to get ICE out of Maine, speeches were also filled with gratitude for how community members have stepped up. 
“There is an effort in this country to define who belongs and who does not… to convince people that if it is not happening to them, it is not their problem,” Khalid said. “But here is what they miscalculated: they underestimated community. They underestimated neighbors who will drive each other to work. They underestimated networks that would deliver groceries. They underestimated people who refused to look away.”
In Portland Friday night, passing cars honked incessantly amid the chants of the roughly 1,000 people gathered in Monument Square, where speakers demanded justice for Minneapolis resident Renee Good and others killed by federal agents, before marching down Congress Street, stopping traffic.
The next morning in Minneapolis, federal immigration officers shot another U.S citizen.
On Saturday afternoon, about 500 people gathered inside the Agora Event Center in Lewiston, many taking to the podium to condemn that latest killing, while equally as many people marched outside in solidarity in single digit temperatures. Other actions were held across the state, including about 60 people who lined the streets of Saco, and dozens more who protested South Portland.

Pointed critiques and calls to action
In a statement condemning the recent killing, Gov. Janet Mills said she requested a meeting with President Donald Trump to demand in-person that his administration “withdraw these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave threat to public safety.” 
Mills also called on Congress to immediately bring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem before them for a public hearing and to cut off further funding for ICE “until their lawless tactics and dangerous behavior cease.”
Some who rallied in Lewiston and Portland criticized Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden for voting for a spending package Thursday after many other Democrats rejected it, objecting to funding the Department of Homeland Security amid aggressive immigration enforcement. 
Others directed their anger toward Republican U.S. Sen Susan Collins.
Democrat Troy Jackson, gubernatorial candidate and former president of the Maine Senate, said, “I hear all the time about the supposed power and influence of U.S. Senator Susan Collins. Well, Senator Collins, this would be a great time to use it.”
Graham Platner, the oysterman trying to unseat Collins, called on current Maine leaders to do more. 
Platner criticized Mills for delaying her decision on a forthcoming law that will restrict local police from cooperating with ICE. State and local police already couldn’t enforce immigration laws, which are a federal matter, however local authorities have contributed to immigration arrests in Maine, including through traffic stops and 911 calls.
While the Maine Legislature passed it last year, Mills let it become law without signature earlier this month, making it so it can’t take effect until the summer. Maine State Police, however, is already following the law. Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck issued a directive last month that essentially implemented its underlying policies.
Democratic State Rep. Ambureen Rana of Bangor also called out Mills during the rally in Portland, arguing that fear of government retaliation for the law was regarded above “the terror that immigrants in our community face day-to-day.” 
Immigration authorities and state Republicans have pointed to that law when defending the surge of immigration enforcement in Maine. 
“Every elected official is complicit,” Rana said, “and they must be held accountable. They must be pushed. They must be swayed and brought along in this movement.” 
Other calls for action came from Jackson, who said the state needs to create more accessible systems of accountability, such as a civil rights and legal action team. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who is also running for governor, said the state ought to use the documented evidence of ICE’s actions so far to hold the agency accountable. And another Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Hannah Pingree, called on governors and attorneys general across the country to file suit every single time the Constitution is violated by ICE.

Here’s what would.,Mike Goldstein,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/what-were-doing-to-treat-adhd-isnt-working-heres-a-plan-to-change-that/,"There needs to be a wholesale rethinking of our approach to ADHD, one that is guided by evidence and a better understanding of the dynamic nature of attention problems.","AFTER DINNER, some 200,000 Massachusetts teenagers retreat to their bedrooms. Nominally, they’re doing homework. In practice, many are waging—and losing—a private war of attention. Even when they turn their phones off or leave them in the kitchen, the homework itself often lives on a laptop, where a single click offers instant distraction and relief. 
We recently launched a consulting business to coach high schoolers struggling with getting homework done. The fancy, sometimes broader name for the skill we try to help them develop is executive function.  
We’ve worked with dozens of teens over the past six months. Many try in good faith.  They trudge upstairs after dinner.  They stare at Google Classroom, click into math or history, maybe start a problem or two. Then they promise themselves they’ll start “for real” in 10 minutes, and click elsewhere. The evening dissolves into self-reproach.  Now it’s 9 pm.  Oops, now it’s 11.   
What we’ve learned in helping kids with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is that they need more than “strategies.”  Teachers and counselors have already explained these – here is how to get organized, how to prioritize, here are some tricks to help you focus. It is not leading to behavior change.   
There is no one-size-fits-all plan that will work with all students.  Most of our students arrive having already tried these things.   
What’s needed is a wholesale rethinking of our approach to ADHD, one that is guided by evidence and a better understanding of the dynamic nature of attention problems. Getting the diagnosis right will allow us to stop spinning our wheels and develop the best plan for each student dealing with these challenges.  
ADHD is a complex, multi-dimensional problem.  You need a spirited trial-and-error, equally multifaceted plan to address it.  It’s a chronic condition that is always changing, often in reaction to changed circumstances: fall to wintertime blahs, loss or gain of friends, a particularly inspiring or boring teacher, sports participation.   
The chronic nature means it’s unlikely that an ADHD teen will ever transform into someone like his or her super-organized friend or sibling.  What’s more plausible is that an hour a week of well-considered, evidence-based, trial-and-error coaching can help unlock perhaps 10 additional individual hours of effort – which could mean the world to the mental health and school trajectory of a struggling 15-year-old.    
When it comes to how adults respond to a teen with ADHD, parent reaction varies.  Some feel sympathy, others fury.  Some parents (moms more than dads) blame themselves.   
At high schools, many veteran teachers shrug.  It’s always been like this – some teens just can’t or won’t get their work done – but it’s way worse now in the smartphone era. Solving the 8 am to 3 pm smartphone issues with school cellphone bans, however, doesn’t do anything for the 3 pm to 3 am problem.   
What precisely is behind all this? As journalist Paul Tough  wrote last year in The New York Times Magazine, experts argue vigorously about ADHD. What is it? Are we over- or underdiagnosing it? How should we treat it?
In 2024, Tough wrote, 11.4 percent of all US children had been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among adolescents, the figure was even higher — 15.5 percent — while a stunning 23 percent of all 17-year-old boys had an ADHD diagnosis.  
Our take: It’s over-diagnosed in affluent communities, where some families simply see a path to advantaging their teen over their friends, with extra time on SAT and so forth. Meanwhile, it’s under-appreciated in high-poverty schools, where there’s less belief that many teens are trying in good faith to get their work done, but stuck.   
Families desperate for answers often marshal everything they can to address the problem. The cavalry sometimes succeeds: medication, therapy, IEPs and 504 plans, executive-function coaching. Often it doesn’t. 
Take Alan, a 16-year-old with two D’s and an F. His mom had already tried the obvious fixes. She sat him at the kitchen table to do homework—he’d start, then toggle to Discord within five minutes. She hired therapists—he felt better after sessions, but turned in zero additional assignments (and sometimes used therapeutic language to deflect Mom). The school offered daily check-ins. Alan BS’d his way through them. 
We tried all sorts of strategies with him. Clear task list with time estimates? First night: 8 out of 10 level of impact. Two weeks later: it had slipped to 4 out of 10. Pomodoro technique – the celebrated 25 minutes on, 5-minute break tactic?  Failed for him.  App blockers? Alan circumvented them in minutes. Hard start time? Somehow 4:30 pm became 5:15 pm became “after this YouTube video.” 
What worked? A coach adopting a Sherlock Holmes mentality when navigating the school’s online platform (it might take 22 clicks to find what was actually due tomorrow); detailed nightly plans his mom enforced; body-doubling for math, where Alan dictated answers, first to the coach and eventually to the computer; chunking big research paper assignments into smaller pieces with micro-deadlines; live editing sessions, where a coach would hover over Alan a little bit, kind of like a personal trainer at the gym (“OK, now hold this plank for 60 seconds”).  
What were Alan’s final semester grades? In chemistry, he went from an F to a B. In pre-calculus, from a D+ to an A, and in history, from a D to a B. When all was said and done, four strategies failed, five worked – for Alan. The next kid will need different ones. 
And that’s the problem. Schools, parents, and even some clinicians use the strep throat framework. Positive strep test? Amoxicillin.  Or, to borrow another medical analogy: broken ankle?  A cast, followed by eight weeks of PT. These solutions work reliably. 
ADHD doesn’t operate that way. That’s why everyone gets frustrated. We should treat it more like diabetes: a complicated, chronic condition that requires constant monitoring and adjusting of treatment, as warranted.     
Even when you think you’ve cracked the code, conditions change, and the treatment needs to also. The sport season that was a motivating force ends. The friend group shifts. The science teacher who motivated kids goes on leave, and the sub is a dud. 
What are the policy implications of all this? 
1. ADHD exposes the failure of one-shot systems. 
The problem with our approach to ADHD is the same as the problem with how we deal with many learning disabilities that call for an individualized education program.  IEPs aren’t built for trial and error. Moreover, they often have a legal compliance vibe. Many veteran teachers are forced to sit through meetings where, in their heart of hearts, they don’t think the plan has any chance to succeed – it’s full of jargon and nominal accommodations like “preferential seating.”    
We could learn from how we handle other chronic conditions like diabetes, where success means continuous monitoring and adaptation. What if IEP teams reconvened quarterly, not annually, explicitly to test and adjust interventions?  This won’t make a difference if the special ed services amount to no more than bureaucratic compliance. In that scenario, it’s just more worthless meetings, annoying for all involved.  But this is an essential idea if the services are delivered in good faith, because only trial and error is likely to stumble on the set of things that work for that particular teen at that moment in their lives.   
2. ADHD has an evidence vacuum. 
When it comes to treating ADHD, we have passionate practitioners—therapists, coaches, teachers, pediatricians—but little shared measurement of whether interventions actually improve a student’s ability to plan, start, and finish tasks.   
Massachusetts is home to many world-class social scientists.  MIT’s Blueprint Labs  uses data to better understand policies in education and other areas.  There are many other similar research centers. The state could fund randomized controlled trials with real outcome metrics: tasks started on time, assignments submitted, credits earned. Publish all results, good or bad. The goal isn’t crowning one method—it’s building a testing infrastructure and evidence base that separates what works from what merely sounds helpful.   
3. ADHD magnifies a brutal equity gap. 
Trial and error costs money. What works is relentless tinkering—come up with a strategy the teen is willing to try, do it, measure it, adjust—until some combo clicks. Our small firm mostly serves wealthy families who can afford multiple attempts until something clicks. Families relying on services in public schools often get one shot, maybe two, before the system gives up on their teen. 
Massachusetts already knows how to democratize boutique interventions.  For example, the 2006 Rosie D. settlement—a class-action lawsuit over inadequate mental health services—transformed home-based therapy for Medicaid-eligible children from a luxury into a statewide benefit.  We should do the same for executive function support—making the trial-and-error coaching process accessible to every family, not just those who can pay.

The Mississippi Department of Transportation said ice had been reported on roads and bridges in at least 26 counties, primarily in northern Mississippi. In a social media post, the agency urged residents in heavily impacted areas to use roadways only for emergencies as crews monitored conditions and treated major routes.
People hunkered down in their homes after stocking up on groceries, and officials warned that electricity outages are likely in some places if ice coats power lines or knocks trees onto the lines.

Local officials echoed warnings about avoiding travel as temperatures dipped below freezing. Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill and the city’s police department reported that several major roadways were icy on Saturday afternoon, with conditions expected to worsen overnight and into the weekend.
“Please stay off the roads if at all possible,” Tannehill said. 
Severe winter weather is a rare occurrence in the Deep South, so it can have outsized impacts because Mississippi has limited winter weather infrastructure. Ice accumulation, even in small amounts, can quickly make roadways impassable and increase the risk of crashes.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has warned that the storm could cause major power outages that could last several days across much of the state. MEMA had also urged residents days in advance to prepare by having enough water and non-perishable food on hand.
Gov. Tate Reeves has declared a state of emergency and said at a Friday news conference he had been in contact with federal authorities to prepare for the storm.

The Associated Press reported that almost 12,000 weekend flights in the U.S. were canceled as the massive storm started to wreak havoc.
Roughly 140 million people, or more than 40% of the U.S. population, were under a winter storm warning from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecast warned of widespread heavy snow and a band of catastrophic ice stretching from east Texas to North Carolina. By midday Saturday, a quarter of an inch of ice was reported in parts of southeastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas and portions of Louisiana.
“What really makes this storm unique is, just following this storm, it’s just going to get so cold,” said Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won’t be going away anytime soon, and that’s going to hinder any recovery efforts.”

Jackson’s homeless shelters opened additional beds ahead of a potentially devastating ice storm to protect vulnerable residents from the freeze.
But advocates say it would not be enough to serve the city’s entire unhoused population – some of whom will weather the storm outside in tents, tarps and sleeping bags. 
“I’m ready for this cold. I got on plenty layers and lots of blankets. I’m good,” said Michael Veal regarding the impending winter blast forecast for this weekend.

It’s not just homeless people in open-air encampments who will be left in the cold: Jacksonians with poorly insulated homes — as is common across the Southeast — may also need to seek refuge, further straining shelter capacity across the city. In other parts of Mississippi, churches and social services groups started opening shelters Friday as a winter storm with snow, freezing rain and sleet started moving across parts of the state Saturday.
Jackson’s roughly 250 shelter beds, operated by Stewpot Community Services, Shower Power, Gateway Rescue Mission and the Salvation Army, will accommodate the homeless or unstably housed during the coming week’s freezing temperatures, according to Melvin Stamps, the planning director for the Central Mississippi Continuum of Care.

But the number of available beds is in flux, with advocates reporting that two of the year-round centers, the men’s shelter at Gateway Rescue Mission and the adult shelter at Salvation Army, are full or near capacity. The Salvation Army typically charges a boarding fee, but it waives that cost during inclement weather.
During past weather events, the city of Jackson has opened a temporary shelter at the Johnnie Champion Community Center, often called Champion’s Gym, near Jackson State University. With more than 100 beds, the building offers the largest capacity of any shelter in the city.

It will not be open during this storm because the heaters need to be replaced, according to city officials. An additional city facility that has been used as a temporary shelter, the Jackson Police Training Academy on Charles Street, is also not in sufficient condition to open. 
Nic Lott, the city’s spokesperson, said the building and maintenance department is working to secure new heaters. “We would love to use the facility, but the heaters need to be replaced and there’s a process we’re going through to get that done,” he said. 
Shower Power, which has operated at Champion’s in the past, opened 75 beds on Saturday at its building on South Commerce Street. 
Stewpot offers beds at two shelters, a men’s facility and a facility for women and children, all year round. On Friday, it opened an additional 30 beds at its downtown Opportunity Center – usually a day center – in anticipation of the falling temperatures. 
The city announced in a press release that the American Red Cross would be offering shelter, but as of noon on Saturday, the nonprofit was not affiliated with any shelters in Jackson or in the state of Mississippi, according to its online map.

“We probably won’t have enough inventory to be able to support the number of beds that may need that warming space,” said Stamps from Continuum of Care, which is composed of several organizations working to reduce homelessness. “Now, I think it would have been OK if Champion’s Gym was open.” 
While some homeless people in the Jackson area will attempt to weather the ice storm, Stamps said he anticipates the vast majority will attempt to seek shelter. Earlier this week, his organization conducted a survey of the number of homeless people in Jackson and found 123 people living at roughly 50 encampments throughout the city. 
“It’s all about establishing a positive rapport with them so that when a situation like this occurs, it’s not like we’re trying to poke and prod,” Stamps said. “We already have relationships.”

Even so, the number of people outside who will attempt to seek shelter is likely higher, as point-in-time counts often fail to accurately capture how many homeless people live in a community. 
For the people who don’t seek shelter, advocates and outreach coordinators like Dee Dee Barlow Moore say the coming days will be life-threatening. Last month, a homeless man died of hypothermia after opting to sleep outside a building in downtown Jackson — mere blocks away from a shelter. 
“So many of them, in their minds, equate shelter to confinement and to so many horrible, traumatic things in their past,” she said. 
Another reason people avoid the shelter: Their dogs can’t come with them. 
Teresa Renkenberger, the founder of Shower Power, said she wishes it were possible to accommodate pets, but it is too disruptive.
“They would fight and bark, and trust me, I want to take them,” she said. 
To help the folks outside, she said they will be making repeated visits with sleeping bags and even pet food. And if people do choose to go to Shower Power, Renkenberger promises warmth: She said they recently finished installing blown-in insulation to complement two 5-ton heaters inside the large sleeping area.

Moore has also been visiting encampments throughout the city – collections of tents on streets in a mostly deserted industrial area close to downtown Jackson or groups who congregate behind chain retailers in the city’s northern limits – to pass out camping gear and other supplies. 
“But the ones that are the diehards, that truly believe that they can make it through anything, I ordered some of these camping mats that are insulated,” she said. 
That’s in addition to doling out what Moore estimates is three cars-worth of thermal blankets, tarps, hats and gloves, and sleeping bags. She is also planning to pass out propane camping heaters.

Chemical hand warmers in particular can save lives, she said. 
“I’ve had one guy that literally didn’t die from hypothermia because his entire encampment pooled all of those together,” she said. “He had fallen in the mud and all they saw was his shoes sticking up. They got 20 to 30 HotHands and covered him in it until AMR got there.” 
Belonging to a group can help in other ways, too, Moore said. Some people who don’t want to go to shelters will pool funds they have made from panhandling to buy motel rooms. But for that to work, at least one person in the group must have identification — leading to the sometimes fatal resort of staying outside. 
“The wet and the cold is what will kill them,” she said. 
It’s not just the ice that can lead to death. The winter months in Jackson are known as “fire season,” due to the number of homes — abandoned or otherwise – that ignite, said Jeremiah Howard, the Hinds County coroner who also works as a volunteer firefighter in the tiny town of Pocahontas. 
The city of Jackson will sometimes see multiple fires in one night, Howard said. One cause of the repeated blazes: Homeless people seeking shelter inside abandoned houses and lighting fires to stay warm. 
Moore said she’s recently started passing out hand sanitizer to people living in encampments so they can safely start fires, as she’s seen too many people try to light tires to stay warm, then breathe in toxic smoke. 
“They come out looking like they’ve been rolling in soot,” she said. “But they’re trying to survive.”

Another reason for the fire season: Drafty windows and poor insulation that force residents to heat their homes through unsafe methods, such as multiple space heaters or the oven. 
Jill Buckley, Stewpot’s executive director, said the extended freezing temperatures mean a higher likelihood that people will face financial hardship from trying to stay warm.  
“It’s a cascade of events that starts here and now and will take months to recover from,” she said. 
In one scenario, Buckley described a resident’s gas usage going up because they’re relying on the oven to stay warm, leading to a higher bill the next month. 
“Then you have to figure out how to pay your regular bills,” she said. “Or something happens with your plumbing, you can’t afford to get the plumber out, and JXN Water charges you thousands of dollars.”

The Saturday shooting comes one day after tens of thousands of people protested ICE in downtown Minneapolis in subzero temperatures.

“If you tamper with my players, I’m going to turn you in. It’s just that simple,” Swinney said during a news conference. “I’m not out to get anybody fired, but there has to be accountability and consequences for this type of behavior and total disregard for the rules.
“If this happened in the NFL, which is an actual league with rules, they would be fined, they would take draft picks, they hit the cap, whatever,” Swinney continued. “This is such a terrible example for young coaches in this profession. … To me, this situation is like having an affair on your honeymoon.”
Ferrelli, a former linebacker at California, entered the transfer portal on Jan. 2 and committed to Clemson four days later. Ferrelli subsequently enrolled, began classes, and began attending meetings and workouts, Swinney said.
Ferrelli reentered the portal on Jan. 22 and committed to Ole Miss.
“You can’t sign with the Browns and practice a week, and then the Dolphins call you and say we’re going to give you a little more money and you say, ‘See ya, boys,’ and go play for the Dolphins. That’s not the real world,” Swinney said.
Ole Miss athletic officials did not respond to Swinney’s allegations when contacted on Friday by The Associated Press.

NCAA vice president of enforcement Jon Duncan said in a statement that the association “will investigate any credible allegations of tampering and expect full cooperation from all involved as required by NCAA rules.”
Swinney alleged that Golding maintained contact with Ferrelli after the linebacker had enrolled at Clemson, even texting, “I know you’re signed, but what is your buyout?”
When Swinney found out about it, he said he initially told Clemson general manager Jordan Sorrells that he wanted to give Golding “some grace” because the Rebels’ coach was newly promoted after Lane Kiffin left for LSU over Thanksgiving weekend.
Swinney asked Sorrells to tell Ole Miss officials “that we know what’s going on, and if he doesn’t cease communication, I’m going to turn him in. I really thought that would be the end of it, but it wasn’t.”
Swinney said Ferrelli’s agent confirmed that Golding had continued reaching out to the player, so Clemson officials asked for copies of the text messages.
“The agent communicated that if we were to add a second year at $1 million to the already agreed-upon deal with Luke, then they would gladly give us whatever we need to turn Ole Miss in,” Swinney said. “Jordan, appropriately, said, ‘No, we’re not doing that.’”
Clemson athletic director Graham Neff said the university’s main reason for making the allegations public was to spur changes to the college football calendar and related rules — or lack thereof — that have contributed to upheaval across the sport.
“The NCAA was surprised a school was willing to come forward as directly and transparently as we were,” Neff said. “We need to look real hard at how we got here, but (also) how to get out of it.”
Neff added that Clemson was exploring its legal options.
“This is not about a linebacker at Clemson,” Swinney added. “I don’t want anyone on our team that doesn’t want to be here.
“It’s about the next kid and about the message being sent if this blatant tampering is allowed to happen without any consequences.”
Swinney also called the January transfer portal window “stupid,” saying it causes “flat-out extortion in some cases” because players and schools are making major decisions during “such a short period of time, right in the middle of when people are trying to play bowl games, playoff games, et cetera.”
If the system is not reformed, Swinney warned, there will be unintended consequences for players who transfer among multiple schools while chasing short-term financial payouts — particularly if they don’t make it to the NFL.
“We’re going to have some screwed-up 30-year-olds … that have no degrees, that have spent their money, that can’t play football anymore and aren’t connected to anything,” Swinney said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/24111155/AP25361755369011.jpg,,,2026-01-24 12:57:15.130108

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)Judges in South Dakota routinely order people charged with alcohol or drug offenses to get chemical dependency evaluations or sign up for drug treatment programs as a condition of pretrial release from custody.
In practice, those orders have long functioned more like suggestions in most counties.
“Nobody follows up on that,” South Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Steven Jensen told the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee on Friday at the Capitol in Pierre. “We don’t have anybody doing that, because we’re not doing pretrial probation.”
That’s about to change in South Dakota’s second most populous county, Jensen told lawmakers earlier this year.
The chief justice told the committee that the pretrial supervision pilot program in Pennington County will use a $385,000 grant from the MacArthur Foundation to build a base-level of supervision for people who’ve yet to be tried in court. Probation officers will follow up with people released on bond to notify them of upcoming court dates. 
Chief justice outlines roadmap to more services for drug offenders, young people and probationers

One piece of the Pennington County program is already in place in Minnehaha County, and has been since 2018.
In all counties outside of Minnehaha, Jensen said, judges set bond conditions without seeing a criminal or drug abuse history for the person asking for pretrial release. 
Under the pilot program, Pennington County court staff will gather that information and share it with judges upfront, as staffers in Minnehaha County already do.
The Unified Judicial System isn’t asking for any extra money from lawmakers this year for the pilot program, as Jensen said existing employees should be able to shoulder the workload. He also said, however, that the pilot program could point the way to a future expansion of pretrial services.
Jensen is asking lawmakers to take an action without a price tag, however. House Bill 1015 would authorize the state court system to offer probation-like services to people who’ve yet to be convicted. The House Judiciary Committee voted 10-3 on Wednesday to send that bill to the full House of Representatives.
Committee members commended court system officials for exploring ways to refine bond condition decisions and reduce problems with missed court appearances. Some members expressed concerns about ongoing funding when the grant money runs out. 
One opponent, St. Onge Republican Rep. Mary Fitzgerald, said she couldn’t support a bill that put more responsibilities on overworked court service officers.
“How in the world do you expect them to do this in Pennington County without hiring?” she said Wednesday.
Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, said he understands concerns about ongoing funding, but that he supports the program. The issues created by a lack of pretrial services for people at risk of missing court or misbehaving are too serious to ignore, he argued.
“I’m of the mindset that doing something is mandatory, and doing something like this is way better than doing nothing,” Hughes said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has been getting some flak recently from his Republican primary election opponents for using his office to bolster his reelection campaign. It will be interesting to see, should any of them displace Rhoden, if they use the office any differently. 
At the top of the opponent complaint list is the governor’s penchant for roaming the state, handing out checks from the Future Fund. So far he has hit Aberdeen, Watertown and Brookings, offering payments to bolster economic development.
One of Rhoden’s opponents, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, questioned the timing of the $1 million grant to Aberdeen’s two new business parks. In a South Dakota Searchlight story, Doeden said Rhoden “uses taxpayer money the same way career politicians have been using taxpayer dollars for decades — largely for his own benefit.”
It’s easy to see Rhoden’s largesse in Aberdeen as a political jab at the wealthy Doeden, as though the governor is saying “you’re not the only one in this race with some money to throw around.” 
Governor hits the road to award more state grants; opponents call it campaigning

In the same story, Rhoden’s other opponents also offered criticism of the timing of the Future Fund grants. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson said it was concerning when award announcements turned into campaign rallies and state House Speaker Jon Hansen said that the Future Fund was funding Rhoden’s political future. Rhoden countered by saying he was just doing his job. 
Created in 1987 at the request of Gov. George Mickelson, the Future Fund was designed to allow a governor to respond with funding quickly for an economic development opportunity. Gov. Kristi Noem’s use of the fund raised some eyebrows. She used it to pay for a series of commercials starring herself, a shooting range lawmakers had refused to pay for, a fireworks show and a rodeo. Basically, she used the Future Fund to pay for items that were too expensive for her to put on her state credit card. 
Part of the Noem legacy that Rhoden is left to deal with is Senate Bill 1, a measure that would take some control of the Future Fund away from the governor and give it to the Board of Economic Development. As much as his opponents don’t like the timing of Rhoden’s Future Fund awards, they may be secretly rooting for SB 1 to fail, ensuring their own ability to make grants and influence people. A vote on the bill ended in a tie in the Senate State Affairs Committee. It’s likely to be resurrected in some form this session. 
A case can be made for saying Rhoden began using the office to bolster his political career as soon as Noem left for a life of leading the masked marauders in the Department of Homeland Security. It’s likely the scent of her perfume still lingered in the governor’s office when Rhoden hit on the idea to embark on an Open for Opportunity tour of the state. The taxpayer-funded series of events was designed to introduce the state to its new governor and the new governor to business leaders and potential donors. 
Well-timed economic development grants and taxpayer-funded travel aren’t the only benefits of incumbency. Rhoden also inherited a well-tuned communications machine that cranks out news releases aplenty. These releases rarely, if ever, include bad news. It’s usually a glowing report on state finances, grant announcements, task force recommendations, board appointments — with the appointee expressing what a pleasure it will be to work with the governor, pleas for Congress to do better and announcements about Rhoden’s Open for Opportunity itinerary.


Let us know what you think...


 

In among those news releases is a weekly column from Rhoden. Anyone with experience in public relations knows that it’s unlikely the governor actually writes the columns. Still, they serve as inexpensive political advertising when picked up by the state’s newspapers. His pre-session column assured voters that he would be working hard for them with the Legislature. 
It would be easy for Rhoden to quell this particular line of attack from his opponents. He could stay in the Capitol, emerging only for actual campaign events. He could put away the Future Fund checkbook, or if there’s a community in need, send an economic development minion to hand over the grant. That would keep the presentations from having the same air as a campaign event. He could cut back on the news releases and, out of fairness to his opponents, suspend his weekly column until he’s no longer a candidate for office. 
It’s unlikely he’ll do any of those things. Using the perks of the office for his benefit is what happens when a politician runs for a job he already has. 
As for the other Republicans running for governor, they may want to choose something else to complain about. By harping on the notion that Rhoden is using his office for political gain, they run the risk of reminding voters that he’s the governor and they’re not.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7788-scaled-e1769266672955-1024x727.jpg,,,2026-01-24 10:57:39.379165

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2026/01/childrens-hospital-transgender-patients-california/,Families sued to block the Justice Department's subpoena for records of young transgender patients. The agency agreed to drop its request through 2029.,"In summary
Families sued to block the Justice Department’s subpoena for records of young transgender patients. The agency agreed to drop its request through 2029.


Transgender patients of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles secured a win this week after the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to end its efforts to obtain personal and medical information of more than 3,000 young patients. 
Last summer, the federal Justice Department announced that it sent subpoenas to more than 20 medical providers that offered gender-affirming care for minors. At the time, the department said it was doing so to investigate “healthcare fraud” and “false statements.”
Seven families whose children have received gender-affirming services at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles sued in November to quash the subpoena to protect their information. 
The department never provided evidence of fraud, said Khadijah Silver, director of Gender Justice & Health Equity at Lawyers for Good Government, one of the firms representing families in the class action lawsuit. The hospital did not not turn over the requested documents. 
“It was basically a fishing expedition,” Silver said. “Without any probable cause, they did not have the authority to be seeking medical information.” 
The DOJ and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles did not immediately return requests for comment.
The department subpoena demanded the hospital provide a large range of documents, including patient intake forms, insurance claims and “documents sufficient to identify each patient (by name, date of birth, social security number, address, and parent/guardian information) who was prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy,” court documents show.
Under the agreement, filed in federal court Thursday, the Justice Department will withdraw requests for documents that identified patients or their families through 2029. 
Attorneys representing patients and their families have moved to dismiss the case.
“This is one piece of a large, very important puzzle, but it does allow our clients to hold on to their basic legal right to medical privacy,” Silver said. 
The settlement unfolded the same week that a judge in Baltimore rejected the Trump administration’s request to subpoena the same information from Children’s National Hospital in Washington D.C.  
The subpoena is not the only federal action that has targeted transgender patients and their providers.
Last year, the Trump administration issued an executive order that threatened to pull federal funding from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care. Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the summer seeking to block the order. 
The federal government has also issued orders that recognize only two biological sexes and prevent transgender girls and women from participating in women’s sports. A third order threatens federal funds for schools that support transgender youth.
After federal actions escalated, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles closed the doors to its Center for Transyouth Health and Development last July, leaving about 3,000 young patients in limbo. Other providers in the state have also scaled back gender-affirming services. 
“The shutdown came despite efforts my office took over recent months to assure (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) that they were protected and required to provide gender-affirming care,” Bonta said at the time. 
Bonta’s office has filed amicus briefs opposing the Trump administration’s attempts to subpoena medical records of gender-affirming care at other hospitals including University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Children’s Hospital Colorado. Bonta did not intervene in the case settled this week.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/021325_CHLA-Gender-Affirming-Care-Demo_JWH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-24 08:56:29.334769

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The 1967 bombing of the Beth Israel Congregation was far from a solitary act. The attack on Mississippi’s oldest synagogue came as part of a reign of terror by the nation’s most notorious Ku Klux Klan.
The newest attack on the house of worship, which happened this month, shows that “history repeats itself,” said Lindsay Baach Friedmann, South Central regional director for the Anti-Defamation League. “The question is not whether we are teaching the next generation, but what are we teaching them?”
The FBI has charged Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison, with burning the synagogue in the predawn hours of Jan. 10. According to federal court documents, Pittman referred to it as “the synagogue of Satan” — a term used by followers of Christian Identity, a white supremacist religion that teaches that Adam and Eve were white, that non-whites are “mud people” and that Jews are the offspring of Satan.


What makes the latest attack scary is “there are a lot more of him out there,” said Rabbi Valerie Cohen, who served Beth Israel from 2003 to 2014.
During the Civil Rights era, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan became the most violent white supremacist organization in the U.S., responsible for at least 10 killings in Mississippi. They were also responsible for dozens of church bombings as well as the bombings of the homes of civil rights and Jewish leaders.

The White Knights rose to the fore after the University of Mississippi enrolled its first Black student in 1962. By 1964, the Klan group boasted more than 90,000 members.
When news came in early 1964 that civil rights workers planned to “invade” Mississippi that summer, Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers told his Klansmen, “The events which will occur in Mississippi this summer may well determine the fate of Christianity for centuries to come.”
He urged them to get their guns ready.
“When the black waves hit our communities, we must remain calm and think in terms of our individual enemies rather than our mass enemy,” he told them. “We must roll with the mass punch which they will deliver in the streets during the day, and we must counterattack the individual leaders at night.”
Then he advised them, “Any personal attacks on the enemy should be carefully planned to include only the leaders and prime white collaborators of the enemy forces.”
On the first day of summer 1964, Klansmen killed three young civil rights workers, who were investigating the Klan’s burning of a Black church in Neshoba County. A deputy jailed Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman and released them into the hands of waiting Klansmen, who shot them to death and hid their bodies in an earthen dam.
Forty-four days later, FBI agents discovered the buried bodies. By killing the trio, the White Knights meant to send a message not just to those in the movement, but across the nation, about who held power in Mississippi, who could do as they pleased and who needed to live in fear.

Between June and October 1964, Mississippi saw the bombings of at least 48 Black churches, homes and “freedom houses,” according to records kept by the Council of Federated Organizations, an umbrella group for civil rights organizations.
That same year, the White Knights began to regard Jews as their major enemies, just as the Klan had done in the 1920s. Klansmen embraced the views of Christian Identity, which teaches that white people are the true Israelites and that Jews are imposters.
On Sept. 18, 1967, the White Knights bombed the Beth Israel synagogue, the opening salvo of the White Knights’ campaign against the Jews.
A month later, the White Knights suffered their biggest setback when a U.S. District Court jury convicted seven, including Bowers, on federal conspiracy charges for the 1964 killings of the three civil rights workers. They received prison time up to 10 years, but they initially remained free on appeal bonds.
The violence continued.
On Nov. 15, 1967, the White Knights bombed the home of the Rev. Allen Johnson, a Black Methodist member and NAACP leader in Laurel, where Bowers lived. Four nights later, a bomb ripped through the home of civil rights activist Bob Kochtitzky in Jackson.
Two days before Thanksgiving, the White Knights bombed the home of Rabbi Perry Nussbaum, leader of the Beth Israel congregation in Jackson.

More attacks followed in 1968, including the bombings of Black churches and a synagogue in Meridian.
After Meridian police determined that Klan bomber Thomas Tarrants was behind the synagogue bombing and others, a shootout took place between him and officers. He somehow survived, but his companion, Kathy Ainsworth, was killed.
After the death, Bowers wrote to an officer involved in the shootout and questioned why he would protect the Jews, calling them “the synagogue of Satan.”
Tarrants went to prison for the bombing. While there, he underwent a religious conversion that he later wrote about in his book, “Consumed by Hate, Redeemed by Love.”
Tarrants, now president emeritus of the C.S. Lewis Institute, became friends with the Rev. John Perkins of Jackson, who was beaten in jail by law enforcement for his involvement in the civil rights movement.

The latest burning of Beth Israel “is not just an attack on a building — it is an assault on human dignity, on faith and on the sacred truth that every person is made in the image of God,” said Elizabeth Perkins, co-president of The John & Vera Mae Perkins Foundation.
“My father has always said that reconciliation is born where truth and love meet,” she said. “That belief still stands. We grieve with Beth Israel. We stand with Beth Israel. And we commit ourselves again to the long, holy work of justice, reconciliation, and peace. Hate will not have the last word. Love will.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12154649/DSC01168.jpg,,,2026-01-24 07:56:30.711528

All four said they regretted ending their pregnancies.
The state rested its case Friday after bringing to the stand a panel of witnesses who argued abortion is harmful to women and should be governed by strict regulations. It’s the same argument Missouri’s anti-abortion movement continues to make the focus of its campaign to ban the procedure.
With the trial scheduled to end Monday, the state capitalized on emotional testimony in an attempt to prove its case that these regulations, which have crippled Planned Parenthood’s ability to perform abortions, are necessary safeguards. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri, which sued to strike down the laws under the state’s new voter-approved reproductive rights amendment, have argued the laws are discriminatory and unconstitutional because they have prevented tens of thousands of Missouri women over the past several years from accessing abortion without crossing state lines.
State attorneys leaned on the stories of women who sought abortions decades earlier at Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics, before the procedure, its providers and its clinics were more heavily regulated. The four described impersonal visits and overcrowded dark rooms with heavy, sad atmospheres where women were often crying.
“The abortionist came in from a side door,” testified Stephanie Jacobson, using an anti-abortion pejorative for the doctor, about the first abortion she had when she was 16 in 1978. “It was very excruciating. I must have been squirming, because they kept saying, ‘Lay still.’”
After her second abortion in 1982, this time at a local hospital, Jacobson said she miscarried another pregnancy and attributed it to her abortions. She went on to give birth to five children.
But until about nine years ago, when Jacobson said she completed an abortion recovery counseling program, she said she was depressed, angry and had thoughts of harming herself because of the choice she’d made.
The requirement that Missouri’s 26-page informed consent booklet be given to every woman seeking an abortion is one of the challenged laws in the case. While it does mention that a provider must inform the patient of “possible adverse psychological effects associated with the abortion,” it does not go into any further detail about those effects or provide any basis for the statement.
Missouri regulator says abortion clinics faced heightened scrutiny unrelated to safety

Marilyn Cox, of Hillsboro, said she was going through a divorce in 1980 when she was seeing another man and got pregnant. For financial reasons and because she “didn’t want to face” her dad, she had an abortion. 
Cox said the Planned Parenthood she went to did not properly inform her of the development of the fetus in the womb at eight weeks. She testified that she would not have gone through with the abortion if she knew that, or if she had seen it on an ultrasound.
After that, she described two near-suicide attempts, one that occurred about a year after the abortion.
“I hated my guts,” she testified.
Linda Raymond took the stand on Tuesday and spoke about the effects of her abortion in 1976, saying she had depression, anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks, and is still on an anti-depressant today. Like Jacobson, she said she found a “post-abortive” counselor to help her through it.
And Crystal Lane had an abortion in 2009, during a divorce when she was dating someone else. Lane said she didn’t want to bring more children into a volatile family situation, as she already had two at home.
“No one at the (Planned Parenthood) clinic coerced me, but I wasn’t told how it would affect me,” Lane said.
Lane said she’d had some substance abuse issues before the abortion, and later became addicted to methamphetamine. She said it wasn’t until she went through a program focused on healing from abortion that she could process the trauma. The program encouraged her to name the fetus she aborted, and she now has the name “Starling” tattooed above her right eyebrow.
During cross-examination of the witnesses, attorneys for Planned Parenthood pointed out that three of the four women testified they had been abused by someone close to them. Raymond said her mother physically abused her, Lane said her ex-husband and father were abusive and Cox said her previous marriage was abusive.
Many studies show women who experience intimate partner violence are at increased risk for developing mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse disorders.
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood affiliates and the ACLU of Missouri repeatedly challenged the relevance and expertise of the state’s witnesses on scientific and relevancy grounds, leading to drawn-out exchanges that eventually drove Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue to accuse the other side of purposely doing it to “run out the clock.”
But the witnesses still provided plenty of testimony, despite the objections.
An Ohio nurse practitioner named Maureen Curley testified that although she hadn’t referred anyone for an abortion in 20 years, her counseling of patients who had abortions led her to believe that motherhood is protective, and giving birth is “psychologically safer” than abortion. 
She said even in a case like the 10-year-old girl in Ohio who was pregnant as a result of incest and had to travel to Indiana for an abortion, giving birth would be more protective from a mental health standpoint.
Abortion safety takes center stage as Missouri trial enters second week

St. Louis Dr. Andrew Steele, an OB-GYN who largely performs pelvic-related surgeries, said he’s seen four cases of abortion complications between 2009 and 2023. And one California doctor who had performed a different type of abortions than today’s practice between 1987 and 1994 was largely excluded from testifying after the plaintiffs objected.
Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought to exclude the testimony of Priscilla Coleman, a retired professor of human development and family studies who frequently writes and testifies against abortion. Coleman’s papers, some of which have linked abortion to increased risks of mental health problems, have faced criticism and even retraction.
On cross examination, attorneys for Planned Parenthood tried to accuse Coleman of cherry picking data points and studies that supported her anti-abortion views. Coleman provided an expert report in the case and told the court she had read each of the 280 papers she cited in that document. But she acknowledged she removed one of her citations of a study published only in Turkish, which she does not speak, after it was pointed out by plaintiffs. 
Coleman testified she believed abortion should be illegal in almost all cases, including rape.
She acknowledged that the American Psychological Association, the National Academy of Sciences and the United Kingdom’s Royal College of Psychiatrists have all concluded that scientific literature shows no association between abortion and adverse mental health, but said scientists were breaching ethics to advance abortion rights.
“I believe there’s an effort to distort the literature,” she said. 
A temporary injunction blocked most of Missori’s abortion regulations pending trial.  Until a ruling is made, the Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis continue offering appointments for procedural abortions. Medication abortion remains unavailable.

[…]","The Missouri Capitol Building in Jefferson City (Getty Images).January is National Mentoring Month, a time often marked by good intentions and well-meaning reminders to “give back.” But mentoring is not a box to check or a seasonal act of generosity.
In Missouri—at a time when leadership pipelines are strained, women continue to exit the workforce, and civic trust feels fragile—mentoring is essential infrastructure.
I have spent much of my career mentoring women leaders across Missouri: women balancing careers and caregiving, women stepping into leadership for the first time, women returning after a setback, and women wondering whether the table they worked so hard to reach truly has a seat for them. Through my work with the Greater Missouri Leadership Foundation (Greater MO), I have seen again and again that mentoring is not about advice alone. It is about belief, access, accountability—and support that helps women soar.
That support matters more than ever. According to the Women in the Workplace study from McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.Org, one of the biggest drivers of women’s ability to advance in their careers is the level of career support they receive. But women still receive less of that support, particularly early and later in their careers, which can limit their professional growth. It also robs our economy of the benefits of their full potential.
At Greater MO, our mission is to strengthen Missouri by preparing women for civic, community, and organizational leadership. That work is grounded in a simple but powerful truth: leadership does not develop in isolation. It develops in relationship, and all of us have a role to play.
When women are supported and mentored well, they stay engaged, pursue promotions, run for boards, step into public service, and remain connected to their communities. When they are not, we see the opposite: talent loss, disengagement, and leadership gaps that ripple across sectors. Mentoring is how we build a sustainable pipeline of leaders who are prepared not only to lead organizations, but to steward communities.
But despite the overwhelming evidence of the importance of mentorship to our workplaces and our economy, mentorship remains too scarce. Research shows that women are 24% less likely than men to get advice from senior leaders, and 62% of women of color say the lack of an influential mentor holds them back. And while the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies offer mentorship programs, uptake is a challenge—with less than a quarter of employees taking advantage of the programs available to them.
We can do better.
National Mentoring Month is an invitation—to individuals, organizations, and communities—to take mentoring seriously. Not as a program, but as practice. Not as charity, but as strategy.
If you are further along in your career, consider who is watching your path and wondering if theirs is possible. If you are earlier in your journey, seek out those who ask thoughtful questions and honor your full life, not just your résumé. And if you lead an organization, ask whether mentoring and structured support systems are embedded into your culture—or left to chance.
Mentoring does not require perfection or decades of experience—only presence, curiosity, and a willingness to share both lessons learned and lessons still unfolding. In fact, research shows peer mentorship leads to longer-lasting relationships and is just as effective as traditional mentorship.
One of the most meaningful mentoring relationships in my own life came at a moment when I did not yet have the language for what I needed. My mentor did not hand me a blueprint. Instead, she asked better questions: What do you want your life to look like? What are you optimizing for right now? What does “enough” look like in this season?
Those questions stayed with me. They shaped how I lead, how I mentor, and how I encourage others to define success on their own terms—not as perfection, but as progress with intention.
The future of leadership in Missouri will not be built by accident. It will be built through relationships, intention, unwavering support, and the quiet, powerful work of mentoring—one conversation, one goal, one rising leader at a time.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-512285042-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

You know the ones—ominous music, grainy photos, and a narrator who sounds like they gargle gravel for a living. We’ve all seen them. We’ve all heard them. And at this point, we’re anesthetized. Political Novocaine.
Enough.
Montana deserves better than campaigns that treat voters like raccoons rummaging through ideological trash cans. We deserve ideas, not insults. Debates, not drive-by smear jobs. Sunlight, not sludge.
And that brings us—unavoidably—to incumbent Sen. Steve Daines.
Rather than showing up in Montana for public town halls, rather than standing in front of voters and answering unscripted questions, Daines has perfected a different approach – absence. He won’t hold a public town hall. He won’t face constituents. Instead, Montanans get something else entirely—well-financed, vicious attack ads, launched long before an election and even before a candidate has formally declared.
That’s offensive.
If you won’t show up, don’t send a hit piece in your place. Montana is not a focus group. Democracy is not a mailer campaign. And an attack ad is not a substitute for showing your face and answering hard questions.
Daines should show up. Sending a slick, cynical attack ad instead doesn’t cut it.
Now let’s be honest about what just happened—because it tells us everything we need to know.
University of Montana President Seth Bodnar resigns his position, and before he even announces a campaign, before he files for office, before he says a word about running, Republicans launch a vicious attack ad.
Day. One.
That’s not confidence. That’s fear.
You don’t unload the attack ads that early unless you’re scared stiff.
No welcome. No thanks for service. No “let’s debate the issues.” Just straight into the gutter, guns blazing, facts optional. Misleading claims. Flat-out untruths. The political equivalent of throwing a punch before the bell rings.
Shame on them.
This is exactly why Bodnar is such a compelling candidate. The very speed and savagery of the attacks are the tell. When the ideas are weak, the attacks get loud. When the record can’t compete, the mud comes out early.
Here’s a radical thought: What if candidates held 56 debates across Montana? Fifty-six. One for every county. Let voters ask questions. Let candidates explain who they are, what they’ve done, and what they actually plan to do—rather than explaining why their opponent is apparently the third cousin of Satan.
Crazy, right?
Attack ads don’t persuade; they poison. No one watches one and says, “Wow, that really enriched my understanding of public policy.” They say, “I hate all of you now.” These ads ruin television, make public service unattractive, and convince good people that running for office isn’t worth the personal abuse.
Attack ads are why decent people stay home and cable news stays rich.
This isn’t the Montana way. Or at least, it didn’t used to be.
Which brings me back to Bodnar.
Under his leadership, UM stretched to new heights: roughly $300 million in infrastructure improvements—much donor-funded; R-1 research status (a very big deal); rising enrollment; better retention. He took on a tough job and exceeded expectations.
Now, according to reports, Bodnar may run for the U.S. Senate—as an independent. And suddenly the political establishment loses its mind.
Let’s pause on something important: Bodnar is a real public servant. Full stop.
First in his class at West Point. Rhodes Scholar. Truman Scholar. Green Beret. Multiple combat deployments. Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana National Guard—still serving. Leadership under fire isn’t theoretical for him; it’s lived.
This guy didn’t read about leadership—he graded it.
He taught economics at West Point. He served as a senior executive at General Electric. He knows how large, complicated systems work—and how to fix them.
So what do the attack ads do? They lie.
They claim Bodnar raised tuition by 30%. False. Tuition is set by the Board of Regents, appointed by Gov. Gianforte. If you’re angry, aim accordingly.
What Bodnar actually did was create the Grizzly Promise: Students from families earning $50,000 or less attend UM tuition-free—about a quarter of undergraduates. The average Montana student paid around $3,000 a year in tuition. That’s not an increase. That’s a lifeline.
They claim he’s anti-woman. Also false. His record includes hiring and promoting accomplished women across campus leadership—law, business, conservation and beyond.
Montana deserves truth—not attack-ad garbage. Not politics as a blood sport. Not tribal stupidity served with gusto. 
Public service should not require body armor.
This is a call for higher integrity and higher discourse—from every party and every candidate. Tell us your vision. Tell us your ideas. Tell us how you’ll make Montana stronger.
And if you’re already in office, show up. Face the people you represent.
Just spare us the lies, the fear-mongering, and the political junk food.
Montana deserves better. And we should demand it—loudly.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bodnar-1024x885.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

Megan Degenfelder, Wyoming's top education official, proclaimed a desire to someday be president back in high school. Today, she’s running to become the state’s second female governor, the first in a century.
The post Degenfelder sets sights on long-held ambition to lead Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Liz Masterson has been a high school journalism teacher long enough that some of her current students have parents who also took her classes. 
A lot of things have changed in the course of the almost two decades since Masterson began her career. But she still remembers Megan Degenfelder’s drive, especially compared to other students.  
“She said she wanted to be the first woman to be president of the United States,” Masterson recalled. 
Upon graduation, Degenfelder forged a path she now says sets her apart from other Republicans in the race to be Wyoming’s next governor — and potentially the first woman to hold the office since Nellie Tayloe Ross a century ago.
Degenfelder’s resume looks like one drawn up to check every box for an ideal Wyoming politician. She attended the University of Wyoming and then studied economics in Beijing, where she wrote a master’s thesis on coal and natural gas. She then spent about a decade in the energy industry. She also worked for U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis in D.C. and served under former Superintendent Jillian Balow in Cheyenne. In 2022, when voters elected Degenfelder as superintendent of public instruction, she became one of the youngest statewide officials in Wyoming history. 
“Now here we are,” Masterson told WyoFile at a Tuesday night campaign event in Degenfelder’s hometown. 
In a capacious, modern outbuilding dubbed “The Barn” by its affluent owners, Tiffany and Blake Gamble, on the Oil City’s eastern outskirts, dozens of Degenfelder’s family members, friends and supporters gathered. 
Wearing a red jacket and skirt with a turquoise squash blossom necklace, Degenfelder moved easily from one conversation to another, shaking hands, laughing and smiling. Her long blonde waves curled away from her face.

The crowd leaned younger, closer to Degenfelder’s age of 37, and was a contrast to the typical older turnout at GOP events in Wyoming. A gaggle of children ran around in red campaign T-shirts while parents and other attendees munched on Domino’s pizza. For many of those in the room, Degenfelder’s bid for governor felt both inevitable and thrilling. 
“I’m fired up,” Tiffany Gamble told WyoFile before her opening remarks. 
Standing in the truck bed of a blue, cherry-condition, vintage Ford, Gamble spoke into a microphone about her time with Degenfelder at Natrona County High School. Together they served as student body president and vice president. 
“Of course, Megan, she was president,” Gamble said. But the evening was not strictly about friendship, she added.
“We have a clear choice to make,” she said. “Do we drift toward middle-of-the-road politics, trying to please everyone, borrowing liberal ideas that don’t fit who we are? Or, do we stand firm in our conservative values?”
“I can tell you, my family is choosing the latter,” Gamble said. 
As superintendent, Degenfelder has not shied away from aligning with the right flank of the party. She backed legislation to authorize charter schools and a voucher program to make public funds available for private tuition. (The latter remains in limbo after it was challenged in court as unconstitutional.) She also supported legislation limiting transgender students’ participation in school sports and bathroom accessibility, and cheered the Trump administration’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education. 
Still, the Wyoming Republican Party has not always backed Degenfelder. 
In 2022, when Balow resigned from her superintendent post to take a job in Virginia, the party voted to nominate three other finalists over Degenfelder, even though she had served in a key leadership position at the state’s education department. More recently, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican lawmakers that’s gained a significant foothold in the party, has been mum about her gubernatorial bid while weighing in on other statewide races, and taking aim at Degenfelder’s most evenly matched opponent, Sen. Eric Barlow of Gillette. 
But Degenfelder has something now she didn’t have in years past. This time, the most powerful person in the country is backing her campaign. Four days before she announced her plans, President Donald Trump gave his endorsement. 
“Should she decide to enter this Race, ‘MAGA’ Megan Degenfelder has my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump posted online. “RUN, MEGAN, RUN!”
Although Degenfelder defeated Trump-endorsed incumbent candidate Brian Schroeder in 2022, Trump’s endorsement counts for a lot in Wyoming, where 75% of voters supported him in 2024. Her campaign Facebook page includes a photo of him next to an image of her. 
Bryan Dugas, Degenfelder’s husband of about a decade, introduced her Tuesday night. 
“I’m a better Christian, a better husband, better physician, a better man because of Megan,” Dugas said. “And we have the opportunity to support her and her aspiration to better this entire state, its people and its future.”

After Degenfelder stepped into the truck bed, she began by thanking her hometown supporters and her mom, Cheryl, who died in 2024. 
“She hated politics, but she’s with us, and I’m very grateful for that,” Degenfelder said. 
From there, Degenfelder asked the crowd to go back in time with her to the mid-1800s, “when a group of people on the East Coast of the United States of America heard about the promise of a better life out west.”
She described their journey as the greatest risk of their lives. And she spoke about her own family, who ultimately wound up west of Casper and would come to grow a life from half a section of land to over 8,000 acres. 
“They arrived at this place after this journey — if they survived — and they look around and nothing’s here,” Degenfelder said. 
There were, of course, people here. She did not mention the Indigenous people who inhabited the land going back at least 12,000 years, or the Plains Indians, whose pragmatic routes over mountain passes, along river corridors and across sagebrush basins were followed by early Euro-American immigrants and explorers. 
When her ancestors and other settlers arrived, Degenfelder said, “they started building something bigger than themselves. That’s who we are as Wyomingites.” 
Today people expect elected leaders to “get out of the way,” she said, “but to fight hard as hell for Wyoming when it matters most.”
The fight at Wyoming’s doorstep, as described by Degenfelder, includes: coastal elites and celebrities “trying to push a climate agenda” that hurts the state’s jobs and revenue, transgender athletes and “radical activists that are literally trying to redefine genders of children,” a lack of respect for the rule of law and for citizenship, assaults on ICE agents and law enforcement officers, child care fraud in Minnesota, and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani “who literally hates everything that we stand for in America.” 
Degenfelder made a vow if elected governor.
“I will protect our conservative values and way of life because our rights, our freedoms, they come from God, not from the government, and they cannot be taken away,” she said.

Many of those supporting Degenfelder’s gubernatorial campaign were by her side in 2022 when she ran for superintendent, including Kayleigh Clark. 
At the event, Clark told WyoFile she recalls working with “a bunch of other moms” to put together Degenfelder’s Casper Parade day float, and sharing an excitement with them about “where we live.”
Clark doesn’t think of herself as a political person, she said, but learned from seeing her parents review the Casper Star-Tribune’s voter guides over the years to be informed about her choices. Clark now has two children and said she wants to be a part of setting up the state for success. 
“Now feels like a different energy,” she said. Tiffany Gamble echoed that, telling WyoFile it feels like a “whole new generation” becoming more interested in politics. 
Gamble recently founded Powder River Prep, a private school in Casper, due to growing concern with “politics brought into the classroom,” she said.
The school is “rooted in conservative values and faith-based principles,” according to its website. Families need more choices, Gamble said, lamenting that her school cannot receive state funding and voicing her appreciation for Degenfelder’s support of school choice. 
As a member of the State Board of Land Commissioners, Degenfelder has opposed Prism Logistics’ development of a gravel mine at the base of Casper Mountain. Even so, Prism’s owner, Kyle True, was there Tuesday to support her campaign.   
“There are bigger issues than my little business,” True said, adding that he’s been impressed with her time in statewide office. 
In an interview with WyoFile at the event, Degenfelder answered questions about recent budget cuts supported by the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. The panel sent shockwaves around Wyoming when it recommended major cuts to the University of Wyoming, the defunding of Wyoming Public Media and the elimination of the Wyoming Business Council.
“I support that the Joint Appropriations Committee is trying to get people’s attention. They are trying to make sure that people know what government is funding, and really to have that conversation about it,” Degenfelder said when asked about the committee’s proposal to cut roughly 11% of UW’s block grant. 
“Now, do I think that the $40 million cut to the University of Wyoming is the right move right now? No,” she said. “I think we can find where that sweet spot is.”
As a UW graduate, Degenfelder said she wants “the best” for the school, but that “doesn’t mean we just allow runaway spending.” 
Asked about her stance on the committee’s proposal to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council, Degenfelder said the state’s tax structure is at odds with the agency. 
“It’s very difficult for them to be successful,” she said, adding that economic development has a place in Wyoming. 
“But when we talk about economic diversification, it’s incredibly difficult to do,” Degenfelder said.

In his budget proposal released Jan. 15, Gov. Jim Pillen proposed to transfer $40 million, over two years, out of the Nebraska Environmental Trust to finance a new boat marina along with bank stabilization work at Lewis & Clark Lake, and to pay for water conservation projects – two things previously funded using state taxpayer funds.
The $40 million take, which must be approved by the Legislature, would nearly exhaust about $20 million-a-year in state lottery proceeds given to the Trust to dole out annually via competitive grants to enhance and conserve the state’s environment.


Amendment proposed
A proposed constitutional amendment introduced in the Nebraska Legislature would “cut out all of this nonsense, and preserve the (Environmental) Trust,” according to former State Sen. Sandy Scofield, the head of the watchdog group, Friends of the Environmental Trust.
Legislative Resolution 298CA, by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, would let voters decide whether Trust funds only can be used for “the conservation, enhancement, or restoration of the natural physical and biological environment in Nebraska.”
It also would require state agencies to come up with a 50% match for any funds granted to them by the Trust.


The $32.7 million earmarked for the Lewis & Clark Lake marina and bank improvements would nearly replace the $37.5 million in state tax funds that Pillen set aside for the project last year. The $8 million in Trust funds proposed for the Water Resources Cash Fund mirrors a request made recently by the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment, which administers the fund.
Neil Sullivan, the governor’s budget director, told the Examiner in an email that using $40 million in Trust funds, rather than state taxpayer funds, “contributes toward delivering both a balanced budget and additional property tax relief.”
But Jon Oberg, a former director of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services who has sued previously to prevent a transfer of Trust funds, characterized the use of Trust money to replace general taxpayer funds as “classic money laundering” to solve a state budget problem.
Oberg, in an email, said he hopes the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee rejects the Pillen administration’s attempt to “circumvent the Constitution” and “uphold(s) budget integrity.”
He said rejection of the transfer by state lawmakers is preferable to requiring “citizen lawsuits” like the one he and W. Don Nelson, a chief of staff under then Gov. Bob Kerrey, filed in 2020 to block a swap of Trust grants to benefit an ethanol blender pump project.
In May, Oberg threatened – but didn’t file – a lawsuit against the Pillen administration’s proposal to transfer $15 million in Trust funds to sustain a state water conservation fund.

The proposed Trust fund transfer comes as Pillen looks to close a $471 million budget gap by tapping excess state funds (see infobox) and cutting government spending.
The Legislature has, in past years, approved transfers of funds from the Trust into the Water Resources Cash Fund. Local natural resources districts use that fund to finance projects that conserve water and soil. Backers say it fits with the Trust’s stated purpose “to conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”
The Environmental Trust currently shows a surplus fund balance of about $20.6 million, but that does not include a recent $6.5 million transfer from the state lottery at the end of December.
The governor’s fund transfer proposals in Legislative Bill 1072 call for $32.7 million for the Lewis & Clark Lake work to be transferred by June 30, which raises the question of whether the Trust will have enough money by then.
Questions also have been raised about whether Trust funds can be used for “recreation” projects, such as a marina for boats at Lewis & Clark Lake.
Sullivan, the state budget official, said recent Trust grants have included a discovery center at Pecan Creek in Lincoln and renovation of Memphis Lake. He said the Lewis & Clark project would improve public access to the lake and include shoreline restoration and enhancement of fish habitat.

“Using these funds to protect the vital groundwater and surface water resources and for lake improvements, access enhancements and shoreline restoration is a clear constitutional and commonsense use of the funds allocated to the Environmental Trust,” he said.
But former State Sen. Sandy Scofield, who heads a watchdog group called Friends of the Environmental Trust, said financing a marina for 350 motorboats and sailboats at Lewis & Clark Lake doesn’t fit with the Trust’s purpose.
“The only habitat it creates is for predatory humans,” Scofield said. “I love the [marina] idea, and I’d certainly support the project, but it’s not even remotely appropriate for the Nebraska Environmental Trust.”
Last year, the governor had a bill introduced to expand the use of Trust funds to include “recreation” and the construction of new cabins at state parks, but the bill didn’t advance.
Scofield added that transferring almost all of the Trust’s funds to one project — at Lewis & Clark Lake — runs contrary to the Trust’s goal of spreading the lottery money to all counties and cities across Nebraska.
“It’s just unfair to everyone in the rest of the state to play games like this,” she said.

Other proposed fund transfers
Besides the $40 million transfer from the Nebraska Environmental Trust, Gov. Jim Pillen’s budget proposes several other fund transfers to the general fund, including:
* $50.7 million from the Water Recreation Enhancement Fund. (It was created by the so-called STARWARS committee, created in 2021 to improve recreational opportunities in the state. The original proposals included new marinas at Lewis & Clark Lake and Lake McConaughy, a new lodge at Niobrara State Park and a huge sandpit lake between Omaha and Lincoln.)
* $18 million from the Economic Recovery Contingency Fund.
* $13.8 million from the Nebraska Capital Construction Fund.
* $7.8 million from the Health and Human Services Cash Fund.
* $6.5 million from the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund.
* $5.7 million from the Perkins County Canal Project Fund.
* $4.9 million from the Trail Development and Maintenance Fund.
* $2.4 million from the Nebraska Rural Projects Fund.
* $5 million from the Records Management Cash Fund.
* $2.5 million from the Secretary of State Cash Fund.

In an effort to help Idahoans follow major bills, resolutions and memorials through the legislative process, the Idaho Capital Sun will produce a “legislative notebook” at the end of each week to gather information in one place that concerns major happenings in the Legislature and other news relating to state government. To receive the full extent of our reporting in your inbox each day, sign up for our free email newsletter, The Sunrise, on our website at idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe/.
Here is our quick rundown of the major happenings during the second week of the Idaho Legislature’s 2026 session.



 First bill to conform Idaho’s tax code with ‘Big, Beautiful’ bill emerges

One of the biggest puzzles Idaho legislators must solve in the 2026 legislative session – and every session – is the state budget. And one of the biggest pieces to that puzzle this year is how the state will choose to conform with the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act championed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.
In most legislative sessions, a tax conformity bill is usually one of the first pieces of legislation to be introduced, often with little fan fare or debate. But 2026 is different due to those massive changes to the federal tax code.
On Friday, Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, unveiled a proposal that would adopt nearly all the tax deductions that were included in Trump’s megabill, which Ehlers estimates could cost the state about $155 million in lost tax revenue each year that the deductions are in effect.
Idaho Legislature’s budget committee adopts more optimistic revenue forecast

“This is a much bigger bill this year,” he said before the House Revenue and Taxation Committee.
There are about 39 tax code changes from the massive federal tax and spending bill — such as no taxes on a worker’s tips, no taxes on some workers’ overtime, and various business deductions — most of which have financial implications for the state.
The timing of these tax changes matter, and there are different ideas from elected officials on when Idaho should conform with the federal law.
Ehlers estimated the changes will cost $155 million annually, which is the same as what the governor projected in his budget proposal. However, Gov. Brad Little’s proposed budget assumed the tax changes would take place starting in the next fiscal year. Ehlers’ proposal would have the budget reductions hit in the current fiscal year.
If the state adopts the changes for the current 2026 fiscal year, that could put additional strain on the Idaho State Tax Commission as it rolls into the busiest part of tax season. It may also lead to more Idahoans having to file amended tax returns.

The issue becomes even more complicated because some of the definitions states must use to apply to their own taxes from the “Big, Beautiful” bill have not yet been released by the federal government. That means Idaho lawmakers don’t have a clear estimate on how much conforming to the GOP megabill will actually cost as they set the state budgets for all agencies and departments.
Idaho officials have cited estimates on the cost of adopting all the tax changes that ranged from $115 million to around $400 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Asked why he chose to use the retroactive date, Ehlers noted that some of the changes expire in 2028, such as the no taxes on tips or overtime. 
“If we don’t allow them to take it in 2025, then they’re missing one of the four years,” Ehlers said in an interview. “So that’s like 25% of the benefit; they’re only going to take it for the three years. So, we wanted to make sure that they got the full four years of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”
 House committee narrowly rejects introducing bill that would have eliminated Idaho’s Hispanic commission

After a tie vote in the House State Affairs Committee on Thursday, a draft bill that would have eliminated the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs was not introduced for further consideration. 
House committee rejects bill to eliminate Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs

Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, presented a draft bill that would have repealed any mention of the commission from state code, eliminating it completely by July 1. Scott served on the Legislature’s interim DOGE committee, named after the federal (and now defunct) Department of Government Efficiency, which was tasked with finding bloat in state government programs and budgets to cut.
Some members of the state DOGE committee said the commission represents “DEI,” which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion, and voted to recommend its elimination last year.
The governor’s proposed budget for the commission is $288,500 in state general funds, according to the state legislative budget book.
 Legislation of interest during the first week of the 2025 session

House Resolution 20: Sponsored by Rep. Monica Church, D-Boise, the resolution condemns political violence, honors the lives of those killed or injured, and calls on all Idahoans to reject all forms of such violence. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill 489: Sponsored by Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, the bill adds to existing law to prohibit the use of a mask or disguise during a criminal offense. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill  491: Sponsored by Rep. Marco Erickson, the bill amends Idaho’s existing Good Samaritan law to protect people who give aid to an individual that is experiencing a mental health or suicidal crisis. The bill prevents a civil lawsuit from being filed against someone who stops at the scene of an emergency and, “in good faith,” tries to provide assistance, unless they are found to be “grossly negligent.” It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill 493: Sponsored by Rep. Britt Raybould, R-Rexburg, the bill would make it a felony on a first offense for anyone 21 years or older to solicit commercial sexual activity. Idaho’s current law provides for charging a misdemeanor for the first offense, followed by a felony for the second offense. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
 What to expect next week at the Idaho Legislature

Quick note: Many committees, especially at the beginning of the session, have agenda items known as an RS (which stands for routing slip). That’s legislative talk for “draft legislation.” An RS is not a public record until a committee votes to introduce the bill. Many of those agenda items are only listed by subject matter, so it’s impossible to ascertain what the RS is specifically about, other than the few words used to describe the RS until the introductory hearing takes place.
IDAHO SENATE
Senate Resources and Environment Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold introductory hearings on an RS relating to “Consolidation of the Soil and Water Conservation Commission,” and it will consider the gubernatorial appointments of Kenneth Long of Horseshoe Bend and Carl Rey of Boise to the Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board.
Senate Education Committee
3 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on Senate Bill 1225, which would change Idaho law to reduce the public disclosure requirements of finalists for the state’s open public university presidency positions from five finalists down to one sole finalist. The committee is also scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS that would change “Lewis-Clark State College’s name to Lewis-Clark State University throughout Idaho Code.”
IDAHO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
House Education Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to “Education funding, disabilities.
House Health and Welfare Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold seven introductory hearings on RSs relating to “cottage food operations,” “yellow dot program,” “directed blood product transfusions,” “health care cash payments,” “health benefit plans – cancer medications,” “midwifery,” and “epinephrine delivery systems.”
House State Affairs Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to  “flags, gov entities, penalties.”
Idaho constitutional amendment proposed by state senator to protect public lands

House Local Government Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday:  The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to “agricultural pests” and “open meetings, public comment.”
House Transportation and Defense Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold four introductory hearings on RSs relating to “vehicle registration stickers,” “parent-student driver’s training,” “transportation, identity,” and “transportation, funding, fuels.”
 Quote of the week

“I wanted feedback. I wanted a lot of feedback, because it deals with a very personal matter for every Idahoan, and that is our public land here in Idaho.” – Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, who introduced a proposal on Wednesday to amend the state constitution to protect public lands acquired by the state from the federal government

Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice G. Richard Bevan gave the annual “State of the Judiciary” speech to the Idaho House and Idaho Senate on Wednesday, asking legislators to thoughtfully consider how best to protect public officials and members of the public who use the court system as threats made against judges in the state continue to rise.
“Threats directed at Idaho judges and courts have increased significantly in recent years, and while most never materialize, those that do require precautions that can disrupt court operations and delay the delivery of justice,” Bevan told legislators.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Secretary of State Michael Watson says that strengthening Mississippi’s notoriously lax campaign-finance laws will be his top legislative priority this year. 
Attempts to tighten Mississippi’s campaign spending laws have sputtered in recent legislative sessions. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been reluctant to consider any reform. But Watson, a Republican who helps administer the state’s elections, said recent criminal corruption allegations against local officials have renewed his push. 
“This is not just a political issue,” Watson said. “This is a crime-fighting issue.” 
A federal grand jury last year indicted two county sheriffs in the Mississippi Delta on charges of corruption linked to an alleged drug-trafficking scheme. The two have pleaded not guilty, though court documents allege that undercover law enforcement agents bribed the officials through campaign donations.

Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens and former Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba are also fighting federal bribery charges, where law enforcement agents accuse them of accepting bribes in the form of campaign donations. They have pleaded not guilty. 
Watson’s proposal would require local and state candidates to file reports online, cap cash donations to political candidates at $1,000 and transfer enforcement authority from the Mississippi Ethics Commission to both the Secretary of State’s office and the Attorney General’s office.
If a candidate does not have reliable access to the internet or is unable to operate a computer, they can send a facsimile copy or a letter of their report to the Secretary of State’s office, who will then upload the report online.

The secretary of state said he has worked with Sen. Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, and Attorney General Lynn Fitch in crafting a bill. 
MaryAsa Lee, a spokesperson for Fitch, told Mississippi Today in a statement that the Attorney General’s Office was proud to work with Watson and legislative leaders on the bill, and Mississippians deserve to control their own elections.

“Together, we have created a package of reforms that will close the loopholes that allow outside, special-interest dark money to flow into Mississippi elections,” Lee said. “We are hopeful that this year the Legislature will make these reforms.”
Mississippi’s current law has a confusing, conflicting enforcement system that gives some responsibilities to the secretary of state’s office, the attorney general’s office and the Ethics Commission. 
The new proposal would task Watson’s office with investigating violations and Fitch’s office with prosecuting them if a crime has occurred. The only time the Ethics Commission would step in is if the secretary of state’s office was involved in alleged violations. 
England is the author of the legislation, and the lieutenant governor’s office has referred the measure to the Senate Elections Committee, which England leads. 
The Jackson County lawmaker said he’s hopeful the Legislature will pass the measure because it’s important for the state’s elections to be as “transparent as possible.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21165710/MG_9221.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

Wes Wolfe/Georgia Recorder March 10 is shaping up to be a busy day 
There are now four special elections set for March 10 in Georgia.
The most closely watched will be the race to fill former Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s seat in northwest Georgia. Nearly two dozen candidates signed up to run in what is known as a jungle primary, which is when all the candidates appear on the same ballot at once, and if no candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two compete in a runoff.
With so many names on the ballot, the race for the 14th Congressional District will surely go to an April 7 runoff. 
But there are also now three state legislative races set for that day. 
One election is to replace ex-state Sen. Colton Moore, a Trenton Republican who is running for Greene’s seat. Senate District 53 includes Walker, Dade, Chattooga, Catoosa and part of Floyd counties. 
Candidates can start qualifying for the special election Thursday. 
There are also two House seats on the ballot after a pair of lawmakers resigned shortly before the start of the 2026 session. 
Former state Rep. Karen Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat, resigned before being charged with unemployment fraud. She pleaded guilty Wednesday to making false statements to obtain the aid, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of Georgia. 
House District 94 includes portions of DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. Qualifying for the seat starts Monday. 
Ex-state Rep. Lynn Heffner, an Augusta Democrat, said she was stepping down because damage to her home from Hurricane Helene left her unable to satisfy a state law requiring lawmakers to live in the district they represent. House District 130 includes part of Richmond County. Candidates can start qualifying Monday. 
Winter storm Fern will freeze the state legislative session, at least for a day.  
House leaders announced they would delay the start of Monday’s session until 1 p.m. and that no legislative business would be conducted that day. The Senate is still set to gavel in Monday morning but the chamber is expected to be quiet. The Senate committee meetings that were scheduled for Monday have been canceled. 
Gov. Brian Kemp declared a statewide state of emergency Thursday ahead of the weekend storm that is expected to bring a wintry mix and wind gusts that could take down trees and power lines and cause other damage. 
“If you can just stay off the roads, that would be a big favor to us and help keep everybody safe,” Kemp told reporters during a virtual media briefing Thursday. Kemp was in Belgium Thursday on an economic development trip. 
Monday will be the sixth official day of the 2026 session, which is set to end April 2. Lawmakers are scheduled to be in session through Thursday next week. 
Announcements:
Denise Pierce Burns, who is the former GOP congressional district chair, announced Friday that she will run to replace former state Sen. Colton Moore. In a press release, the homeschool mom describes herself as a homesteader who has also advocated for “food freedom, medical freedom and small farms.” 
Ross Sheppard, a Milledgeville Democrat, has launched his House campaign for District 149. Sheppard is a Milledgeville native who says he served as a legislative aide while in college for former longtime Rep. Rusty Kidd, who died in 2020, before working as a lobbyist. He’s challenging Democratic incumbent, Rep. Floyd Griffin, who won the seat in 2024. 
Endorsements: 
Sen. Nabilah Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, has picked up several endorsements from her colleagues in the Senate in her quest to become Georgia’s next insurance commissioner. Parkes announced Thursday that she has the backing of Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones of Augusta and more than a dozen other Democratic Senate leaders and senators.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A bill introduced in the Kansas House this week, one that its Republican sponsor hopes will embolden free speech in honor of Charlie Kirk, might indeed prevent censorship and nudge student voices, as he intends.
However, it might also frustrate many Kansans (including fellow Republicans) who won’t enjoy the unfettered expression — from students and faculty, on campus and online — that this bill protects. We can nitpick other likely consequences of the bill after we cover the basics.
Rep. Brett Fairchild, R-St. John, introduced a bill Tuesday that would, generally speaking, enlarge the free speech rights of people on Kansas university and postsecondary education campuses. The bill’s acronym? The FORUM Act, for “forming open and robust university minds.”
In the other chamber, Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, announced this week that additional legislation “is being drafted to safeguard free speech for students across Kansas education, from K-12 to public colleges.”
Fairchild and Masterson paid homage to Kirk, a slain conservative activist and free speech advocate who was shot and killed in September while speaking at a Utah college campus.
“Charlie Kirk was martyred for bringing truth and wisdom to college campuses, where the free exchange of ideas must remain central to their mission. He built a legacy of respectful yet passionate discourse and warned of the dangers when we stop talking to one another,” a statement from Masterson said, calling the bill a “top priority.”
Fairchild called Kirk “a great champion of free speech on college campuses.”
While Kirk’s views on many issues struck me as wrongheaded and offensive, his advocacy for free speech was different. The open debates he created, particularly for college students, pivoted campus norms about free speech.
I worry that this bill — or ones like it — won’t do nearly as much.
As we wait for the Senate bill, let’s review the House bill from Fairchild. Or, to be more accurate, the piece of legislation that Fairchild said came from someone connected to the libertarian group Young Americans For Liberty. Fairchild credited the words in the bill to a person who “knocked on doors when it was 100 degrees outside” and “helped me get elected a few years ago.”
“I’m a big fan of free speech and the First Amendment and I didn’t have any reason to say no,” Fairchild said during my interview with him this week.
He also expressed a loose commitment to the current language of the bill, House Bill 2472.
“I’m not necessarily 100% locked in to keep the bill exactly how it is,” Fairchild said. “As it is currently written, I’m open to amendments if universities come and testify.”
My former University of Kansas colleague Harrison Rosenthal helped me rake through the bill’s legalese. Rosenthal now works as a managing associate at the Dentons law firm and focuses on media and constitutional litigation.
Many of the bill’s provisions would duplicate protections provided by the First Amendment, and in that way the bill seems to me like political stagecraft — feting Kirk without making meaningful changes on college campuses.
However, Rosenthal said, “the bill’s novel moves are significant.” For example, the bill instructs universities to make all outdoor areas on campus into “public forums.” Another provision bars institutions from providing preference to groups or speakers affiliated with the university over unaffiliated groups or speakers.
The bill also protects off-campus and online expression by students. This is where I believe the bill proposes more than many Kansans actually want.
Section 9 of the bill says, “No postsecondary educational institution shall discipline, penalize or otherwise retaliate against a student, student organization, faculty member or staff for expressive activity conducted online, whether on social media, in email, on websites or other digital platforms, if such activity is protected under the first amendment to the constitution of the United States and section 11 of the bill of rights of the constitution of the state of Kansas and conducted in person.”
No discipline, penalty or retaliation at all? For students, organizations, faculty and staff? Would that be a popular outcome?
While I personally believe that universities should not be in the business of regulating a freshman’s Instagram post, is that what Fairchild believes?
In our interview, he said that he doesn’t want “speech constrained unless the speech is basically violent or racist speech.” It’s unclear, in my reading of the bill, what would trigger constraints on racist speech — and those guardrails have existed in the past.
Apart from racist speech, many fellow Republicans, including national political figures, have worked to punish students and faculty for speech recently. In fact, some of that speech was in response to Kirk’s shooting. 
Last year, a KU staff member posted that Kirk was “better in the ground as worm food than up here preaching that murdered children are a necessary sacrifice for 2A rights,” referencing the second amendment.
The backlash was understandably fierce from conservatives, including Masterson, who called for the university to fire the staff member. (KU did not.)
If Fairchild’s bill — or one similar in the Senate — passes, employees and students would be emboldened to speak in that same way.
Similarly, the New York Times published previously sealed court documents this week that showed the only evidence used by the Trump administration to seek deportation of university students was constitutionally protected speech. The judge in the case unsealed the documents to showcase how free expression about Israel and Palestine was being weaponized.
The judge in that case chided two Trump cabinet members for their role in an “unconstitutional conspiracy.” The administration’s actions were, in the judge’s view,  “violating” expressive rights of students studying in the United States.
“These cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution,” Judge William G. Young said last week in an emotional denunciation of the government from the bench.
The bill also requires that each institution “submit a report to the legislature and the governor” detailing the restrictions it enforced, speech disruptions or censorship and more. Asking for more annual reports is a curious pose from a political party that seeks to make our state government leaner and reduce funding for state universities. (It also smacks of a fishing expedition to provide fodder for screaming headlines in partisan media outlets.)
My biggest concern with this bill and others like it: Conservatives envision such laws as potentially liberating conservative speech on campus while somehow constraining contrary messages.
What will conservatives think if the law allows unfettered speech for their political foes?
For his part, Fairchild said he wants all speech protected.
“I don’t think it’s promoting a certain political view over any other type of political view,” Fairchild said. “I think it would protect speech from students who are on the left side of the political spectrum just as much as it would those on the right.”
As a free speech advocate, I support most of the bill’s language. Campuses could improve by fostering more open and risky debate among everyone on campus.
However, I worry that Kansas state law has little to do with the reticence that most students have. I have never heard a student bemoan the lack of statutory protection for what they want to say in class or on social media.
Rather than being a legal problem, student hesitation about being honest and open is a problem of social psychology.
Undergraduate students between 18 and 22 have grown up with the specter of digital retribution for their expression: Is someone going to post a recording of what I say in class to Instagram? Will I be canceled by friends if I post this video on TikTok? Will I be tossed out of contention for a dream job because of something I wrote on Twitter in high school?
These are the worries that they reported to me in class this week as we started a new semester. We reviewed recent research showing how college students see First Amendment protections as being damaged — more and more each year.
At the end of the presentation, I stood at the front of the auditorium and said, “So, this is the time to let me know what you think — how you feel.”
More than 150 undergraduate students looked back at me silently, some doodling nervously in their notebooks. Only the hum of computer projectors filled the classroom. Someone coughed.
“I’m really good at these awkward silences that encourage students to speak up,” I said.
I paused again.
Veteran teachers know that if you make eye contact and provide a kind smile, students will often take that as a cue.
“Still nothing?” I said.
Their nervous stares answered: nothing.
While I don’t see much objectionable in the House bill introduced this week, I don’t think it will break that silence in my classroom or at the state’s other university campuses.

The expiration of popular federal tax credits last year led to higher health care costs across the board, and some Marylanders just couldn’t afford their previous plans, opting for cheaper, less-comprehensive health care coverage for the 2026 plan year.
It was one of the many caveats that came with the newest enrollment data, which actually showed an overall increase in enrollments — despite expectations that rising costs would push more people away from coverage.
Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, urged lawmakers to “dig deeper” into the data, because 5,743 people moved from a higher coverage policy called a “gold plan” to the bottom rung 0f coverage, a “bronze plan,” taking on significantly higher deductibles to maintain less-comprehensive health coverage.
Higher costs are only part of the changes coming to health insurance

“Most of our bronze plans carry $10,000 deductibles, so now that financial burden for medical has gone up tenfold for that family,” Eberle told senators during a Thursday briefing for the Finance Committee.
Gold plans tend to have a deductible of around $1,000, meaning plan holders only have to cover $1,000 of a significant medical cost before their insurance steps in to cover the rest.
“That’s really, really unfortunate that that’s happening,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All coalition. “That means that people are not going to be able to get the health care that they need and are going to go to the hospital and create uncompensated care … we’ll have to pay for that hidden health care tax.”
A major factor to health care costs rising is the expiration of Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, a popular COVID-era federal benefit that helped keep monthly costs down for 190,000 Marylanders who purchased individual plans on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace.
“The federal government’s inaction to extend the tax credits means those who can afford coverage will be forced to pay more while getting less,” Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said in a written statement. “The ripple effect of this will lessen access to needed health care, result in job losses for health care workers, and be a blow to our state’s economy in a time when Marylanders are already experiencing rising costs in so many areas of their lives.”
New data from the exchange supports Seshamani, as data reports that thousands of Marylanders found their previous plans were no longer affordable and dropped to lower-quality plans.
The end of the federal tax credit in December had ripple effects on the whole health care economy. Last year, state insurance officials approved an average 13.4% premium rate increase for 2026 health care plans, to compensate for the expected drop in enrollment.
Despite those rising costs, Marylanders proved they wanted health care, officials said.
State subsidy softens blow to enrollment
According to early data, about 255,600 people purchased individual health care plans from the Maryland Health Connection, with 207,797 people renewing coverage this year and 47,815 newly enrolling in the exchange.That’s about 3.4% more than in last year’s open enrollment period.
The early data eases fears of what many anticipated to be a major drop in coverage due to the expiration of the federal tax credits. But officials from the marketplace note that the 2026 data is not finalized, and there may be a drop in enrollment numbers in coming weeks.
“Individuals must pay the first month’s premium to their insurance company by the end of January to start coverage,” according to a press release from the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. “There will be some who will get the first month’s bill and not be able to pay.”
A new state-level subsidy may help some people keep their health care plans.
Maryland lawmakers last year approved funding, called the Maryland Premium Assistance, to help replace some of the lost benefit for 2026 plans.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) believes the new state-level subsidies likely helped stave off a massive drop in enrollment.
“I thought more people would leave their plans,” Beidle said. “I’m sure the state subsidy is helping people to stay.”
The Maryland Premium Assistance subsidy replaces the extended tax credit for those earning up to twice the federal poverty level. For those earning two to four times the federal poverty level, the state subsidy can replace 50% of the value of the federal tax credits.




Federal poverty level
The Maryland Premium Assistance subsidy replaces the lost federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credit for individuals making up to 200% of the federal poverty level.
In 2026, individuals making up to $31,300 a year are earning about 200% of the federal poverty level, state officials say. For a family of four, an income of $64,300 would be twice the federal poverty level.
Someone making up to $62,600 a year would be earning four times the federal poverty level and could qualify for a state subsidy worth about 50% of what the federal credit would have paid. The same level of support would apply to a household of four earning around $128,600 annually, which is 400% of the federal level.
Those making above 400% of the federal poverty level do not qualify for the state’s new premium assistance.




Without the state-level premium assistance program, the exchange anticipated that 90,000 people would have dropped their coverage when the federal tax credits expired. Even with the state subsidy in place, the marketplace estimated that some 30,000 people dropped their coverage because they can no longer afford it.
The new state subsidy is likely a temporary solution to what could be a long-term problem if Congress does not renew the lapsed federal tax credit, which is currently under debate in Washington.
The state may not be in  position financially to continue funding the program down the line.
The state’s premium subsidy is currently funded by Maryland’s reinsurance program — a special fund through which insurers are reimbursed for a portion of the costs of patients requiring the most expensive care.
The reinsurance program is funded through a 1% assessment on health insurance policies and is currently set to end in 2028 unless the federal government approves an extension on the state’s waiver for the program.
Beidle said that continuing to fund the premium subsidy past 2026 would likely require increasing the assessment or pulling from general funds. But lawmakers this year face a $1.5 billion budget shortfall in the fiscal 2027 budget.
“Our overall budget is so tight,” Beidle said. “There’s only so much you can do with a limited amount of money.”
She noted that the open enrollment data will finalize around March and the legislature would likely have some time to respond if legislative action is needed.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/healthcare-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 07:56:30.711528

The Kentucky Lantern won first place in the best website design category. 
Judges wrote that there is “something for everyone who accesses this site” and that it has a “great variety of stories in a well laid out format.” 
The staff of the Lantern also placed third in the general excellence category, which honors the breadth of work for an outlet. The Louisville Courier Journal placed first in that category and the Lexington Herald-Leader took second. 
Teri Carter, an opinion writer, won first place in the best columnist category. 
“At a time when dissenting voices are often silenced, I’m thankful every day that I have the support to do this work,” Carter said after receiving the award. 
Politics reporter McKenna Horsley won a second place award in the general news category, saying she is “humbled that we were honored among our fellow journalists.” 
“I’m so proud of the Lantern’s great work this year,” Horsley said. “Our commonwealth is home to a tradition of dogged reporting and I am confident that will continue in the future.”
Austin Anthony, whose photojournalism has frequently appeared in the Lantern, won a second place award in the best general news photo category. He said the award itself is “an honor,” but “I take even more pride in having the name Kentucky Lantern next to mine.” 
“As a freelancer I’ve worked with reporters at prestigious national publications, and can confidently say that the team at the Lantern is as talented and devoted to the craft as anyone,” Anthony said. “It’s not an easy time to do this work yet they continue to excel.”
Health and policy reporter Sarah Ladd placed third in the best feature story category. 
“We don’t do journalism for awards, but it always feels nice to be recognized by peers,” Ladd said. “None of my reporting would be possible without the people who trust me with their stories. All of my thanks goes to them.” 
The 2026 convention was held at the Crowne Plaza Hotel. More than 100 journalists from around the state attended.

(Courtesy of Heritage Frederick)Little is known about the two sets of skeletal remains uncovered during an excavation in downtown Frederick earlier this week — only that police are convinced they’re “historic in nature.”
The bones were discovered Tuesday by archaeological crews excavating land near the Hessian Barracks, an 18th century building on the grounds of the Maryland School for the Deaf. The excavation was part of the beginning stages of historical restoration work.
The remains were left in place and reburied to protect them, a state official said. If they are eventually exhumed, examinations could reveal more about the remains, including their approximate age.
But in the meantime, local historians have their guesses.
Could they be from the American Revolution, when the barracks held British and German, or Hessian, prisoners of war?
Could they be from the Civil War, when the barracks became a hospital for injured Union and Confederate soldiers, including from the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle on American soil?
“When you look at the history of this site and the various uses that it has had, whether as a military barracks, as a place where prisoners of war were kept, or as a hospital — I mean, it really doesn’t surprise me,” said Jody Brumage, archivist and museum manager for the Heritage Frederick historical society.
During times of peace, the barracks have served a diverse array of functions: The barracks were a supply depot for the Lewis and Clark expedition west after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803; in the late 1800s, a pair of merchants raised silkworms there.

But Tuesday’s discovery has directed attention to wartimes, when on-site burials would have been more likely.
Chad Baker, a former teacher and later deputy superintendent at the Maryland School for the Deaf, said he once read a diary entry from a Hessian soldier imprisoned there that said a fellow prisoner died and was buried outside the barracks.
“I would hope, I like, I wish — whatever — that they find out they can date it to the Revolutionary War period,” said Baker, who focused on preservation of the barracks during his decades at the school, before his 2014 retirement. “That would verify the document that referenced the possibility — and especially if there are any artifacts that they buried with them. You never know.”
Brumage, for his part, believes the remains may be more likely to be from the Civil War era, when wounded from both sides inundated the site.
“We know that in different instances with Civil War hospitals, that burials were done in almost any available place,” Brumage said, “particularly in those periods like after Antietam, where just the sheer numbers of wounded soldiers that are being dealt with in these places is really astronomical.”
But Baker said there was a temporary morgue in the Civil War era — at that time called a “dead house” — just to the east of the barracks, making him question the idea that burials could have occurred there.
“They had a place to put — in a temporary morgue, if you will — those soldiers, Civil War, who died while being cared for in the barracks,” Baker said.
The barracks were commissioned by the state legislature in the late 1770s — one of three funded by the state at that time, Baker said. Back then, they were on the southern outskirts of town, atop a hill that gained the nickname “Cannon Hill,” because townspeople fired cannons from the barracks for special occasions, such as Marquis de Lafayette’s 1824 visit, or the Baltimore & Ohio railroad’s arrival to the city.
Today, though, the barracks are tucked into the School for the Deaf’s 68-acre, 14-building campus, which is surrounded by a residential area full of historic homes in Frederick.
“Today, Frederick completely surrounds the site where the barracks stand, and the remaining structure really sits right in the heart of the Maryland School for the Deaf campus,” Brumage said.
The barracks were originally the Frederick Town Barracks, Baker said, though it was later nicknamed for the Hessian prisoners held there who later became part of the community. After the Revolution, many Hessian prisoners were freed and settled in Frederick, which already had a sizable German population, Baker said.
“When repatriation to Germany was offered, most of them said no and they just stayed locally,” Baker said. “And some, in fact, married the proverbial farmer’s daughter, and we have descendants in Frederick that have that lineage.”

That the discovery of aged remains happened in 2026, the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence, is no accident: The School for the Deaf got a $750,000 National Park Service grant in July 2023 to support the preservation of the barracks site, including “critical stabilization and foundation work,” said Amy Mowl, a spokesperson for the school, in a statement.
It was during “pre-restoration archaeological work” for this project that the buried human remains were found, said Brandon Stoneburg, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of General Services. The department is working alongside the Maryland Historical Trust on the project, Stoneburg said.
“The discovery, while unexpected, is being handled with appropriate care and historical consideration,” said Maryland School for the Deaf Superintendent John A. Serrano, in a YouTube video message delivered in American Sign Language.
“At this time, authorities are working to determine the next steps for the respectful and compliant handling of the remains. Work in the affected area will remain paused until this process is complete,” Serrano said.

With the resolution, higher education and state leaders vowed to align higher education with the best interest of students and the state.
“We remain dedicated to research and teaching that fosters academic excellence, explores new ideas, respects differing viewpoints, drives economic growth, and discovers solutions to our most complex problems,” the resolution reads.

Gov. Spencer Cox was still fresh from his State of the State address, in which he called on Utahns to build “moral infrastructure.” His Friday remarks had a similar tone, highlighting not only the economic perks of higher education, but also the development of other skills.
“Just teaching people how to think for themselves, that matters. That matters as much as any economic gain,” Cox said. “Our ability to debate one another, our ability to understand who we are as Americans, our ability to reason and to learn from our past mistakes is just as important as any of the economic boosts that we see here.”
Cox also praised the Utah Board of Higher Education, but also said that “reform is never finished,” and listed his wish list for the system, including increasing timely degree completion rates, to “always credit for prior learning,” and to continue to maximize higher education’s financial value.
“I want to just say unequivocally that higher ed matters, that we support you,” Cox said. “And I hope you feel that coming out of this legislative session.” 
Cuts may be discussed in the next weeks
Last year, flagship higher education legislation directed universities to cut and reallocate 10% of their budgets for courses, or $60 million in total, aiming to switch that funding from “underperforming programs” to initiatives that are in higher demand. With a tight deadline, some universities were left scrambling to make the cuts and had to plan for layoffs and the elimination of programs.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Friday there have been lots of benefits from that exercise and that he believed every area of government should be looking at similar initiatives.

The Executive Appropriations Committee directed all legislative appropriations subcommittees to identify a 5% ongoing spending reduction target this year. For higher education, that would mean a $93.7 million cut, according to a Legislative Fiscal Analyst presentation.
The Legislative Fiscal Analyst office recommended making cuts to different Utah System of Higher Education programs, like reducing the estimated budget to make an equal opportunity initiatives report, taking back engineering and computer science initiative funding approved last year, and reducing 60% of out-of-state tuition waivers, among others.
Schultz said more details about that may emerge in the next few weeks.
Why the Utah System of Higher Education may get redesigned into ‘regions’

“We just went through that process with higher education. We’re not going to cut 5% of the budget, but we’re going to look at it and say, ‘OK, do we need to reallocate some more money? (Are) there things that we need to continue to look at?’” Schultz said. “So we’ll see. I’d say, let’s give it another week or two and see what comes out of that.”
The resolution was ceremonial, Schultz said, but represented a commitment to the system’s future, to reevaluate programs that don’t work, and to keep tuition costs down.
During the signing ceremony, Geoffrey Landward, Utah commissioner of higher education, commended the effort to collaborate among institutions and government.
“My only worry is that the significance of this will be lost in an era of higher education that is marked by diminishing trust, questioned value, or turmoil,” Landward said. “Assembled here today are the elected leaders of our state and leaders of our system of higher education, gathered in unity, saying with one voice, higher education will remain a pillar of our state and thrive in uncertain times because we refuse to let it flounder.”
A bill sponsored by Clinton Republican Rep. Karen Peterson went public on Friday, which, if approved would direct “the alignment of the system of higher education into regions for vertical and horizontal integration.”
That would help ease credits transfers, integrated admission, enrollment and student services.
“I think that’s a great right. You may want to start out at UVU, but finish at Weber State.

Gov. Jim Pillen, Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., and the heads of the Omaha and Nebraska business chambers of commerce held a news conference in Omaha Friday touting Legislative Bill 1165, newly introduced by State Sen. Brad von Gillern on behalf of the Pillen administration.

Dubbed the “Grow the Good Life Act,” the proposal modifies three existing business incentive laws. Key changes ensure that a large employer undergoing a merger or acquisition gains benefits that might encourage them to stay and grow in Nebraska, said von Gillern, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee.
While U.P. is not identified by name, portions of the bill appear tailor-made for the Omaha-based railroad company as it seeks federal approval of an $85 billion merger with Georgia-based Norfolk Southern to create the nation’s first single-line coast-to-coast rail system. The merged systems would create a combined enterprise of more than $250 billion.
The union of two Fortune 500 transportation companies faces opponents and saw a setback recently when the Surface Transportation Board rejected an initial application as incomplete. U.P. said it will provide the necessary information. 
 ‘Aggressive, assertive’ 

On Friday, Pillen proclaimed as “groundbreaking” the initiative that addresses pressure business groups have put on his administration to focus more on economic development, as he has concentrated on property tax relief measures.

“This is more aggressive and assertive than anything we’ve ever done before,” Pillen said at the event, which used vintage U.P. railcars as a backdrop at Omaha’s Durham Museum.
An estimated cost has yet to be attached to the new incentives, said von Gillern, who emphasized that provisions were sure to change as the measure advances through the law-making process. 
He called it a pay-for-performance plan — “not welfare, not a give-away.”
Ewing said he hopes for a “Super Bowl” business climate. 
“We have to run new plays. We have to expect to win companies, jobs and people,” the mayor said. “We’ve got to be willing to have the courage to go for it on fourth down.”

In response to a reporter’s question, Pillen said the state had not negotiated an incentive package with U.P. He said other businesses could benefit from the legislation as well, and mentioned HDR and Kiewit Corp. as among growing companies that could perhaps tap revamped incentives. 
U.P., in a statement to the Examiner, said the railroad was “excited to grow with Nebraska.” 
“We support Governor Pillen and the Legislature’s goals of attracting and retaining high-paying jobs in the state.”
Upon announcing the acquisition plan last July, U.P. leaders said the combined company would be headquartered in Omaha and that Atlanta will remain a “core location” with a focus on technology, operations and innovation. 
U.P. employs more than 5,500 people in Nebraska (about 33,000 nationwide) and operates more than 1,000 miles of track in the state. The railroad has maintained operational headquarters in Omaha for more than 160 years, and moved into a then-new downtown Omaha headquarters in 2004.
 Nationally, Norfolk Southern has more than 20,000 employees, with more than 3,000 at its Atlanta headquarters that the company opened in 2021.
 Staying ahead of competition

Von Gillern said possible relocation should be a concern, noting that Georgia has been “very aggressive “with incentive offerings. He said the Norfolk Southern Atlanta campus is “pretty stunning.”

“We have to be ahead of our competition,” von Gillern said. “This bill will benefit the employees of Union Pacific and Nebraska taxpayers by ensuring that a high-caliber, high-paying great corporate citizen stays here in our home state.” 
Incentives laid out in LB 1165 include sales and use tax credits and grants, and modify the Key Employer and Jobs Retention Act, the ImagiNE Act, and Site Building Development Act.
Key provisions apply to private employers in the state that have more than 3,000 full-time workers and an enterprise value of more than $25 billion after a merger. As currently written, von Gillern said, those employers could be eligible for a 10% tax credit for bringing to the state 1,000 full-time jobs with $90,000 salaries over a seven year period. 
Another change, not to exceed $5 million in 2026-27 fiscal year, would provide capital improvement grants to employers following a change of ownership. 
The Department of Labor also would establish a grant program, not to exceed $300,000 annually for any employer, to provide workforce retention and recruitment support to businesses undergoing an ownership change.
LB 1165 responds to pressure from Nebraska business leaders who have been releasing studies showing the state falling behind some of its peers in job growth and economic development.
 Clear message 

Heath Mello, a former senator who had led the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee and is now CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber, said the legislation reflects months of discussion with the Pillen team to retain and expand jobs and talent.

Tax incentives, Mello said, are usually the first thing companies look for in deciding where to build a workforce and commercial enterprise. 
He noted that “some of Nebraska’s most iconic employers” currently are navigating major ownership changes, and mentioned U.P. 
“This legislation sends a very clear message: Nebraska is prepared to meet change with confidence,” Mello said.

Steny Hoyer endorses freshman Maryland Del. Adrian Boafo as his successor in Congress, the Legislative Black Caucus gets new leadership, Sen. C. Anthony Muse chooses between two jobs and more in political notes.","Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George's) on the House floor Friday, the same day he received an endorsement from Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) as his successor. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)When he announced just over two weeks ago that he would not run for reelection after more than four decades in Congress, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) said he would share his thoughts about a successor “at some point in time.” Turns out that point in time was just over two weeks.
Hoyer on Friday endorsed Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George’s), who worked for the congressman between 2019 and 2021, as someone constituents “could count on to resolve their problems.”
“I have known Adrian for years. He is as warm as he is smart, as principled as he is pragmatic. He genuinely loves our community and our people,” Hoyer said in a statement. “Public service defines Adrian. As a member of my staff, he earned Marylanders’ trust.”
Although Boafo, 31, hasn’t officially filed with the state Board of Elections, he does have a campaign website and he has created an account with the Federal Election Commission.
Boafo, a former Bowie mayor pro tem, said after Friday’s House of Delegates session that he was pleased to get Hoyer’s endorsement.
“To even be running in this race is a blessing in itself. To have the guy who’s been doing this job at a major national level for that long say, ‘I think he can pass, take the mantle and run with it,’ is even better,” Boafo said. “It’s still surreal and it hasn’t fully set in, but the job’s not finished. We still have a coalition to build. We still have to make sure we win this race.”
Still a crowded field — for now
Boafo could have plenty of competition in the June 23 Democratic primary.
As of Friday afternoon, 14 Democrats had either filed paperwork with the board of elections or created a campaign committee with the FEC to replace Hoyer in the 5th District, which includesCalvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties in Southern Maryland and parts of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties.
One of the Democratic hopefuls, retired Navy officer Terry Jackson, praised Hoyer’s service in a statement Friday but also said the “moment called for something different.”

“With so many qualified candidates stepping forward, this was an opportunity for an open conversation about the future of the district — a chance to hear ideas, debate priorities, and allow Marylanders to weigh competing visions free from political pressure,” he said. “Instead, the race was effectively framed before voters had that opportunity.”
Besides Boafo, two other high-profile candidates from Prince George’s County filed with the FEC: Del. Nicole Williams and County Councilmember Wala Blegay, who was appointed last month as the council’s at-large member.
A few other state lawmakers and former congressional candidates have expressed interest and said they were “definitely considering” the possibility of a run. But that was before Hoyer’s endorsement.
Political analysts predicted a crowded Democratic primary, with the winner almost certain of a general election victory in the district, where there were 2.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in 2024. Analysts also expect voters in the district will choose a more progressive Democrat in June than the more-moderate Hoyer.
Candidates have until Feb. 24 to file for the seat.
New leadership for Black Caucus
The Legislative Black Caucus announced Thursday that Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County) will serve as chair of the caucus, replacing Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) who stepped down after three legislative sessions at the helm to take over as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.
“I am honored by the confidence of my colleagues and grateful for the strong foundation laid by those who have led before me,” Phillips said in a statement. “The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland is well positioned to continue advancing policies that strengthen Maryland’s families and communities.”
Sen. Antonio Hayes (D-Baltimore City) announced on the Senate floor Thursday that Sen. Shaneka Henson (D-Anne Arundel) will serve as first vice chair of the caucus. Del. Melissa Wells (D-Baltimore City) had been first vice chair under Wilkins, but she stepped down to chair the new House Government, Labor and Elections Committee.

	Henson received a round of applause from her colleagues that also garnered a light moment from Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).
“It’s nice to have some Senate leadership in the caucus. We don’t often get out-voted, you know,” he said. The last senator to chair the caucus was Catherine Pugh, from 2010-12, according to the state archives.
The caucus is expected to announce its legislative priorities for the 90-day session soon. It has considerable influence in Annapolis with more than 60 members — a third of the legislature — and heavy representation in leadership positions, including House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Senate President Pro Tem Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), House Judiciary Committee chair Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), Wilkins leading Ways and Means and Wells chairing the so-called GLE Committee, among others.
Muse resigns
Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s) said Thursday he has resigned from his job in Prince George’s County government amid an ethics investigation.
State law generally does not allow members of the General Assembly to work simultaneously for local governments, though there are some exceptions. Muse said in December that the State Ethics Commission determined his job did not qualify for an exemption from the rule, but he also said then that he intended to fight the commission’s determination.
When asked on the Senate floor Thursday why he changed his mind, Muse said simply, “I wanted to be here.”

County officials told Maryland Matters that Muse applied for and had received a job as the county procurement officer. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Muse’s resignation.
Muse said in December that he believes legislators should be able to hold other government roles, especially since the legislature works part-time. Legislators receive about $56,000 per year for their roles. Muse’s county job had an annual salary of $180,000.
State law allows legislators to keep a govenment job they held before filing to run for office, or if they are working as a teacher, non-elected law enforcement officer or emergency responder. Exemptions are also granted if the role was awarded under an entirely objective merit-based system, such as an exam.
No member of the General Assembly currently has the latter exemption, said Deadra Daly, ethics council for the legislature, in a December interview.
“The committee is pretty strict,” Daly said of the merit-based exception. “We want it to be very much an objective ranking system. Then, one can’t argue that this person only got the job because the agency was trying to curry favor with the legislator.”
Grownups like snow days, too
Members of the House got a welcome Friday break just in time for the coming snowstorm, as chairs of the seven standing committees stood up, one after another, to announced that there would be no meetings after the floor session.
But House Environment and Transportation Chair Mark Korman (D-Montgomery) assigned homework.
“All the members are instructed for two hours to think about energy,” Korman said.
“You’re going to be tested on it,” House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk chimed in.
Grownups like snow days, too: Part II
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) may be less freaked out about an impending snowstorm than many of the residents of his district. Ferguson warned the Senate, which was meeting in a pro forma session Friday, that Monday night’s regularly scheduled session might be affected by the weather.
“We’ll do the best we can. Looks like something is coming, we just don’t know what,” Ferguson said to the mostly empty chamber.
On Friday, Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency and warned of a winter weather system that could affect the state over multiple days, including a clean up.
The leader of the Senate isn’t worried.
“I’ll tell ya, I really want to go sledding, so fingers crossed,” Ferguson said.

Julie Emerson has pulled her name from consideration in the U.S. Senate race in Louisiana, following the entry of U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow earlier this week with President Donald Trump’s endorsement.
Emerson announced her candidacy in October, targeting fellow Republican incumbent Bill Cassidy.  In a social media post Saturday night, Trump urged Letlow to enter the Senate race, which she did Tuesday morning.
“With Congresswoman Letlow’s entrance into the race, the path to victor that was visible a couple of months ago has diminished,” Emerson wrote Thursday in a social media post. “I support President Trump and respect his decision to endorse Julia Letlow to defeat Bill Cassidy.”


At 37, Emerson is still considered to be on the upslope of her political career. In 2015, she became the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the Louisiana Legislature at age 27. She chairs the critical House Ways and Means Committee, where all tax matters originate, and has been a floor leader for Gov. Jeff Landry on issues such as state finance and education.
It was Emerson who sponsored legislation to end the “jungle” primary elections Louisiana had held since 1975, which featured candidates from all parties. Now she has opted out of the first closed primary since her bill was approved in 2024.
With Emerson out, the announced field for the May 16 Republican Party primary includes Cassidy, Letlow, Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of New Iberia, St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden and Public Service Commission member Eric Skrmetta.
Democrats who’ve announced their U.S. Senate candidacy are: civic activist Tracie Burke of Gretna; Jamie Davis, a farmer and former Tensas Parish Police Jury member; and Jabari Walker, who worked for nearly eight years on New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s staff.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Supporters of Alaska’s election system filed a lawsuit against the Alaska Division of Elections on Thursday, alleging that the state’s description of a roll-back-the-clock ballot measure is biased and inaccurate. 
The state has defended its language, with a spokesperson calling it “accurate, neutral, and consistent with prior initiatives.”
This fall, voters will be asked with Ballot Measure 2 if they want to return Alaska’s election system to what it was in 2020. The state’s description would be printed on ballots alongside the measure. 
Until 2020, political parties determined who could vote and run in primary elections, voters were required to pick just one candidate in the general election, and people could donate secretly to nonprofits that could then pass money to candidates.
In November 2020, Alaskans approved Ballot Measure 2, which put all political candidates for an office into the same primary election. The top four advance to a general election that uses ranked choice voting. Nonprofits that donate to political candidates are required to disclose their donors.
In 2024, an effort to repeal the primary and general election changes failed by 737 votes out of 320,985 cast statewide.
The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit are AFL-CIO president Joelle Hall, state Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and former Juneau city council member Barbara Blake. All three are represented by attorney Scott Kendall, the prime author of the 2020 ballot measure that installed the current elections system.
The suit was organized by the Alaskans for Better Elections Foundation, Kendall said. Alaskans for Better Elections supported the 2020 measure and has opposed prior efforts to repeal it. 
“I think (Alaskans) should know that the ballot language that has been offered by the Division of Directions is materially inaccurate, and in some cases, says the measure does the opposite of what it does, and it omits very significant changes the measure will make,” Kendall said by phone on Thursday.
In particular, the suit objects to the state’s claim that the ballot measure would restore or “bring back” campaign finance rules.
“The proposed measure (24ESEG) would not ‘restore,’ ‘bring back,’ or add even a single
campaign finance rule to Alaska’s statutes,” the suit states. “Rather, 24ESEG would fully repeal a litany of campaign finance disclosure requirements, and eliminate enhanced fines.”
A key part of the 2020 ballot measure and existing state law is the requirement that nonprofit groups disclose their financial supporters if those nonprofits contribute money to election candidates. 
A prior effort to repeal the 2020 ballot measure would have left the disclosure requirement in place. The new repeal effort would eliminate the dark-money disclosure law, concealing donations.
A section-by-section analysis published by the Alaska Department of Law in February 2025 concluded that this year’s measure would “reverse several changes to campaign finance disclosure requirements.”
“It repeals a ton of very, very popular campaign finance disclosure provisions, and yet, the ballot language proposes to say it restores them,” Kendall said.
Ballot Measure 2 will appear alongside Ballot Measure 1, which would reimpose financial limits on political contributors. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Alaska’s prior limits in 2021, and the state declined to appeal that verdict. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who ran for re-election in 2022, said at the time that he favors having no contribution limits. 
The lawsuit dealing with Ballot Measure 2 also asserts that the state’s approved language downplays the way that political parties would be permitted to determine who may vote in primary elections.
Independent candidates would not appear on primary election ballots unless one or more political parties allow them. Independent voters would not be allowed to vote in a primary unless permitted by political parties.
Before 2020, both the Republican and Democratic parties in Alaska allowed some independent voters to participate in their primaries.
“Granting major political parties in Alaska the power to disenfranchise voters for primary elections is neither mentioned, nor even implied, in the proposed ballot language,” the lawsuit states. 
The Alaska Division of Elections is being legally defended by the Alaska Department of Law, which has not been formally served with the lawsuit but has a copy of the complaint. 
“We have been in the midst of ongoing discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel, who was urging the adoption of ballot language that would have departed from the legal standard requiring accuracy and neutrality,” said Sam Curtis, a spokesperson for the Department of Law. 
“We have not yet been served with the complaint and will review it when we are. The ballot language at issue is accurate, neutral, and consistent with prior initiatives. The alternative language advanced by the plaintiffs would be confusing and inject advocacy where the law requires impartial description. We are confident the courts will uphold the State’s language.”
The plaintiffs challenging the state have diverse political perspectives: Hall is a registered Democrat, Giessel is a Republican, and Blake is a registered nonpartisan. All three have opposed prior repeal efforts and are opposing this year’s as well.
Giessel said she wants Alaskans to know what they’re voting on.
“People tell me that they’ve signed initiatives, particularly this year — and other years previously as well — and then they find out that actually what they were told they were signing was misrepresented to them. So I want them to know exactly what’s in this,” she said.
Hall is an experienced campaigner.
“People need to know what they’re being asked to vote on, as clear as possible. Because some people will walk into that booth and read that word for word,” she said. “They will not have made up their mind ahead of time. So it just needs to be really clear.”



What do you think?
Below are the two versions of the proposed language on Ballot Measure 2. Which do you think is clearer and more accurate?
First, the state-written language:
An Act Restoring Political Party Primaries, Single-Choice General Elections, and Campaign Finance Rules
This act would get rid of open primary elections and ranked-choice general elections. It would bring back political party primaries and single-choice general elections. It would also bring back campaign finance rules.
Elections will occur as they did before open primaries and ranked choice voting. In the primary election, voters will choose a party’s ballot. They will vote for one candidate in each race and the winning candidate will be the party’s nominee. In the general election, voters will select one candidate in each race. The candidate with the most votes will win. Party petitions, special runoff elections, and other parts of the prior election system would return.
Campaign finance rules would also return to the way they were in the prior election system. This act would remove the limits on donations to joint campaigns for governor and lieutenant governor. It would remove limits and disclosure rules under current law, including for digital ads, out-of-state donations, undisclosed donations, and the true source of donations. It would remove some fines and change the meaning of a campaign expenditure.
Second, the language proposed in the lawsuit:
An Act Restoring Political Party Primaries and Single-Choice General Elections, and Repealing Certain Campaign Disclosure Requirements and Fines
This Act would get rid of open primary elections, where all candidates appear on one ballot. It would get rid of ranked-choice general elections. It would replace them with political party primaries and single-choice general elections. This Act would also repeal certain campaign finance disclosure requirements and get rid of or reduce some fines for violations.
In the primary election, voters would choose one party’s ballot and vote only for candidates from that party. Political parties would be given the power to prohibit voters who are not registered members of their party, including Nonpartisan and Undeclared voters, from voting in their primaries. The winning candidate from each primary would be the party’s nominee. In the General Election, voters would vote for only one candidate. The candidate receiving the most votes would win, whether or not that candidate has a majority of the votes cast for the race.
This Act would end the ban on dark money by getting rid of the requirement that independent expenditure groups report the true sources of their contributions. It would also get rid of the requirement that such groups, when they are funded mostly by out of state money, disclose that fact in their ads.
Finally, it would get rid of or reduce the fines for some campaign finance violations.

Those foster youth live in other housing, like shelters and dorms, and struggle to access state funds to cover basic living expenses, the lawsuit says. 
The lawsuit filed by the non-profit advocacy organization, Facing Foster Care in Alaska, says the state should provide the same monthly living stipends to older foster youth for basic necessities, as they do to foster families with youth in their home.
“For youth in these alternate settings, there’s no foster care payment going anywhere,” said Amanda Metivier, executive director of Facing Foster Care. The organization is arguing that without these living stipends, the state is failing its duty of care for older foster youth in state custody, and are asking the court to require the state to distribute living stipends directly to all older foster youth. 
The Office of Children’s Services, housed within the Alaska Department of Family and Community Services, runs the state’s foster care system. It provides a “cost of care” stipend to foster families for each foster youth in their home to pay for essential items like food, clothing, toiletries and school supplies. 
But there’s no stipend for foster youth living independently, in shelters, college dorms or other housing. Instead, the department provides vouchers and small grants for living expenses, but advocates say it’s not enough — and call it a failure of the state to uphold its constitutional duty in the lawsuit.
A spokesperson for the Office of Children’s Services said older foster youth have the same funding and support as younger children, and items or services are provided by need or request. 
Plaintiffs say foster youth not placed with families are left struggling to care for themselves and find ways to pay for basic necessities like clothing, food and transportation to medical appointments, work or school, according to the lawsuit. “And so it’s a lot of going without,” Metivier said. 
She said her organization filed the lawsuit on behalf of foster youth who asked for help so they can recover a sense of financial stability. 
Youth who are not adopted or reunited with family are eligible to remain in state custody until they are 21 years old, as per state law, as a transitional period into adulthood. 
Metivier said that’s a good thing, and mirrors national trends of extending foster care to provide foster youth with additional support and improve their life outcomes. 
Foster youth are more likely to be at risk for homelessness, incarceration and mental health challenges: A national survey by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 2020 to 2024 to track outcomes for foster youth found that 35% of foster youth in Alaska had experienced homelessness, 18% had experienced incarceration and 24% had a substance use referral by the age of 17. 
Miye D’Oench, an attorney with the civil rights firm Northern Justice Project, who is representing the plaintiffs, said the lawsuit calls on OCS to fulfill its legal duty of care.
“At the end of the day, this is to us, just plainly unacceptable, and it’s a massive failure of the foster care system, and it’s unconstitutional,” she said.
Moreover, the number of foster homes is not keeping up with the number of children and youth in need, according to the lawsuit, which is forcing foster youth to live independently in youth shelters, dorms or even in cots in OCS offices. In November, the state reported 2,493 youth in foster care and 1,184 foster homes. 
Officials with the Office of Children’s Services declined to answer specific questions but provided an email statement to address the issue generally, through Brian Studstill, communications director for the Alaska Department of Family and Community Services.
“Young adults served by OCS have access to the same funding streams available to younger children, as well as additional resources designed to support their transition to adulthood,” the statement said. 
The department provides financial incentives for participation in skill‑building activities, including independent living classes, assessments and transition planning, as well as funds to grantees and contractors who deliver independent living services, according to the statement. 
“OCS routinely offers food and clothing vouchers, bus passes, and other transportation assistance such as cab fare or limited vehicle maintenance for those who rely on personal vehicles for work or school,” the statement said. “Additional supports may include assistance with cell phones, laptops, work attire or gear, and driver’s education costs. Young adults are encouraged to seek support whenever needed.”
Studstill clarified that payments are not made regularly to older youth, like monthly stipends. “There is no re-occurring stipend paid to children or youth,” he said. 
“Services and commodities are paid for by OCS based on need or request, which may include re-occurring payments for room, board or ongoing expenses or they may be covered as the need arises such as clothing and food vouchers,” he said. 
The department’s statement cited additional federal funds available to older youth, including $5,000 per year for educational and training vouchers for attending college. In the lawsuit, plaintiffs said those vouchers fail to come close to covering student expenses. For example, University of Alaska Anchorage tuition is estimated at over $30,000 per year, according to the lawsuit, and students are shouldered with covering housing, food and school supplies. 
As of Jan. 12, there were 112 youth in state custody between the ages of 18 and 21, and 56 youth were living outside of a foster care home or group home, according to the department’s statement. 
“​​Those living outside of a licensed foster home reside in various placements such as college dorms, on trial home visits with family, unlicensed relative homes, assisted living homes to meet extraordinary needs, or are in custody of the Division of Juvenile Justice,” the OCS statement added. 
For licensed foster homes, OCS provides foster families with a monthly stipend for each child based on age and difficulty of care. For youth ages 12 to 20 years old, it’s roughly $40 per day or $1,200 per month. 
Metivier said teens as young as 14 and 15 years old are living outside of foster homes, and providing the living stipend would allow more stability. 
“This gives them an opportunity to be in care, have that safety net, but to also practice managing money,” she said. “To take care of themselves as a staggered way to be able to cover their cost of rent and food and transportation as they prepare to be able to do that on their own once they’re out of custody. And that’s successful, that’s successful in a lot of places.”
D’Oench, the plaintiff’s attorney, pointed out OCS makes a budget request from the Alaska State Legislature each year based on a foster youth count which includes older youth, estimated at 2,500 children and youth in care. 
OCS is also facing a federal lawsuit alleging systemic failures in the department and the state’s foster care system, including chronic understaffing, overburdened caseworkers and failure to find adequate placements, which is risking harm to children. The case went to trial in August, and will be decided by the presiding federal judge in the coming months.

Meanwhile, lawmakers who codified the center’s creation are pushing to make programming the center will offer a requirement for all students at the university. Lawmakers heard an update this week on what civics centers at the three state universities are doing.
Certain courses offered by the centers in the future could become required as part of general education courses as bills in the Iowa Senate and House of Representatives to change core curriculum moves ahead. Legislation to require public university students take courses in American history and government has passed out of subcommittee in both chambers.

While the original schedule for the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa had courses running the entire semester, the center’s interim director, Luciano de Castro, said in an interview the inability to hire faculty, figure out lecturer schedules and adequately advertise to students led him to cancel the section set to start in January and only offer courses starting in March. He said he canceled the course early in December and will use the first half of the spring semester to make students aware of it.
Both of the seven-week courses, titled “Political and Economic Institutions in the United States” and “American Culture and Values,” will operate with pass/fail grades and invite outside speakers to give lectures to students on various topics. According to his presentation to the committee, the cultures and values course will cover topics like the costs and benefits of freedom, freedom of speech, American literature, “self-reliance as an American value” and “why capitalism rocks.”
De Castro said he wanted to offer the political course twice this semester, but scheduling was more challenging than expected, especially with his focus on the center’s inaugural event that took place in December.
When asked how many students had enrolled in the center’s first course before its elimination from the schedule, de Castro said he couldn’t remember. Those students were transferred into the course taking place in the second half of the semester.
With the semester started, de Castro said he and center staff are connecting with student organizations in the hopes of engaging more with students and ensuring they know about the center and its activities.
De Castro told lawmakers this week the center has contracted with the Common Sense Institute to conduct a market demand assessment, and hired a research assistant to aid them. The center paid the Common Sense Institute $18,600 for the contract, he said in an interview, and the study should be complete by the end of the semester.
With the study underway, de Castro said during the meeting the center’s next steps are requesting funds from the UI to hire faculty.
“I will prioritize hiring adjunct faculty, they are called teaching faculty or temporary faculty, because this will allow more flexibility for the permanent director to define things on a long term basis,” de Castro said in the interview.
The executive committee within the center’s advisory council will handle the search for a permanent director. No advisory council meetings are currently scheduled, de Castro said, as they are waiting to hear back on firms that could be contracted to aid in the search. Quotes should be coming back in late February, he told the committee.
After hearing from directors of the other university centers, de Castro said he’d like to work with them on coordinating with some of the speakers they brought up as being invited to campus.
University civics centers report on activities
Nearly one year after he presented to the then-new committee on the benefits of bringing a school of intellectual freedom to the University of Iowa, de Castro spoke to the higher education committee this week about the center’s advisory council, its first event and upcoming plans for courses and the search for a permanent director.
He was joined by Center for Cyclone Civics Co-Directors Karen Kedrowski and Kelly Shaw and University of Northern Iowa Center for Civic Education Director Allison Rank. Each center has already started hosting events and seeking information from students about their current civic knowledge and what they’d like to see from their centers, and are beginning to find ways to work with each other.
“All of the centers are in their infancy, so we have just begun the effort of this collaboration,” Kedrowski said.
Iowa State University Center for Cyclone Civics
Officials at the Center for Cyclone Civics at ISU have spent the past months studying its students, developing programming and seeing just how far they can reach — potentially to each county in Iowa.
Interns at the center created a program titled “Byte Sized Civics” for Iowa State University Extension and Outreach last spring, Shaw said. The program includes short videos covering different aspects of state and local government, how they work and interact.
The center also conducted surveys in spring 2025 of then-seniors to better understand their knowledge of civics and government and examine their political attitudes and voting trends. While the data from the civics survey is still being mined, Shaw said scores of 20 multiple choice questions are averaging at 17 — in the B range for a grade.
During the fall semester and looking ahead to this spring and beyond, Shaw said the center has focused on the 250th anniversary of America’s founding. Local and national speakers came to campus throughout the semester to give talks on related topics, and more are planned in February through April.
The first discussion of the semester, hosted by Ames pastor Rev. Mark Vance, will cover the “importance of honesty and debate in an age of political tribalism,” the center’s presentation stated.
“Increasingly, students go to their corners and come out swinging, if they come out at all,” Shaw said. “But we really want to help create a way for students to have these difficult conversations moving forward.”
The center has also developed its first course, Shaw said, which will go over many of the topics raised by de Castro in his presentation about founding documents, capitalism and “why are we the way that we are 250 years later.”
Center for Civic Education at the University of Northern Iowa
Allison Rank, director of the Center for Civic Education at UNI, agreed that students need to start engaging more with viewpoints they wouldn’t gravitate to usually, and UNI faculty believe the same. That is why one of the events put on by the center was focused on how faculty can foster discussion in the classroom when students don’t want to talk.
It was the best-attended professional development session she’s had, Rank said, and she has already begun working on similar professional development sessions to bring to community colleges like Des Moines Area Community Colleges and Iowa Lakes Community College.
“We seek to be a nationally recognized leader in research, teaching and public outreach for both free speech and civic education, and the way that the center hopes to do that in terms of its vision is about university students, supporting pre K through 12 students, and also thinking about the broader public by developing and implementing civic learning strategies, respectful dialog across difference and educational resources,” Rank said.
As the state’s “teacher training college,” Rank said UNI is working to “specifically foster civic learning among Iowa’s pre-service and in-service teachers” while also aiding in professional development and curricular shifts at other universities.
One way the center is meeting this goal is through a $1.2 million grant UNI received in the fall to establish the Iowa Civic Educators Institute, which will provide professional development, seminars and course materials in American political traditions, government and history, as well as state-focused history and politics.
“We know that what teachers want is sort of this high quality, directly connected research that they can take into their classrooms,” Rank said, “and that’s what we aim to provide from this center.”
UNI students are also being engaged by the center through a birthday party for the U.S. Constitution thrown last year and upcoming programming, including a “civic culture ideation session” where around 100 students in small groups will identify issues relating to civics education and what they’re seeing on campus, develop solutions and pitch them, hopefully in a “Shark Tank-style.” The top solutions will go in the center’s strategic plan for the 2026-2027 academic year.
Rank said she is hoping to launch a program which she called the “Challenging Perspective Series,” where two individuals with “distinct viewpoints on a similar topic” would speak before students head into small groups to discuss what they heard. She is currently working on a survey to give to students who participate in center events to learn about their political viewpoint so in future events groups are made up of mixed perspectives.
“I like this idea of consistently trying to have two people on a similar topic that are articulating different approaches to understanding that topic, whether it’s different diagnoses of the cause of the problem, different ways of solving what they both agree is the same problem, but actually modeling for students both having that conversation, ensuring that you got both perspectives at the same time,” Rank said.

The Rozenbooms, like most livestock operators in Iowa, collect the hog manure in on-site lagoons, pump it into tanks and transport it to nearby fields where it is incorporated into the soil as fertilizer. 
Like other medium to large livestock operators in Iowa, Rozenboom has a manure management plan on file with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and he calculates annually the amount of manure, based on the nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen, that can be applied to the field. 
This system, according to Rozenboom, means all of the manure in his operation is accounted for and the cost of fertilizer keeps farmers from over-applying to any particular field. 
“This this isn’t done willy-nilly, like some people seem to think it is,” Rozenboom said. “It’s very precise.”

But water quality advocates in the state say these manure management plans do not sufficiently regulate the massive amounts of manure produced by Iowa’s concentrated animal feeding operations. This in turn, they say, contributes to consistently high nutrient concentrations in Iowa rivers, lakes and drinking water.
Iowa Environmental Council and Food & Water Watch have called for greater enforcement of the manure management plans, an online database of the plans and for farms to avoid over-applying nutrients. 
The environmental groups argue too much of the livestock industry’s waste ends up in Iowa waterways and negatively impacts the health of Iowans and the environment.
What is a manure management plan?
Manure management plans are required in Iowa for any confined, meaning totally roofed, livestock feeding operations with a total animal unit capacity of more than 500 units. 
The plans includes estimates, based on established values from the farm, of the amount of manure, plus the manure’s nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. 
The second part of the plan requires farmers to determine the maximum manure application rate for each of the fields where they plan to apply manure. This amount is determined using information on crop rotation and proven yields to determine how much nitrogen and phosphorus would be taken up by the crop. 
Under the manure management plan, farmers are not allowed to apply amounts of manure that would exceed these nutrient limitations on each field.
On farm records
Manure application records are not submitted to DNR, but are kept on farm in case the department decides to audit a farm’s manure plan. 
In a conversation explaining manure management on his farm, Rozenboom displayed a sheet of notebook paper where his great nephews had meticulously recorded, by hand, the date and amount of manure applied to each of the fields in his manure plan.
Critics of the plan argue these records should be submitted to DNR as part of digital, public record.
Michael Schmidt, general counsel with Iowa Environmental Counsel said records, like air emissions and solid waste discharges are public in “every other industry.”
“We clearly see that some of the nitrogen is getting from these agricultural sources into public water supplies and causing issues downstream,” Schmidt said. “This is an issue of public concern, and so it does not make sense to keep that confidential when people downstream are being directly affected.” 
Daniel Andersen, an assistant professor at Iowa State University and a manure specialist with the university extension program, said this information is not public, likely because it’s viewed as proprietary information for a farmer. 
“Most farms today, I don’t think they’re putting on malicious amounts of manure on purpose,” Andersen said. “ I think generally, fertilizer prices have risen enough, relative to the cost of manure application, that they’re trying to use manure responsibly.” 
Plus, Andersen noted, farmers who rely on commercial, non-manure, fertilizers, are not required to report the amounts they applied, nor adhere to a nutrient limit. 
Because manure is difficult and expensive to transport, it works out that 25% to 30% of all nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium used to support crop production in the state comes from manure. The rest of those needs are met with synthetic fertilizers, according to Andersen.
Schmidt with Iowa Environmental Council said it’s also problematic that manure management plans, while public, are not more accessible. 
Tammie Krausman, the communications director with DNR, said the manure management plans are “available for review at the field offices or via public records requests.” 
Records maintained by the facility to demonstrate compliance with the plans are “statutorily mandated as confidential records” Krausman said. 
Schmidt said this means that even if a neighbor suspects someone is doing something wrong on their field, “there’s no way that they can prove that by checking the records.” 
Rozenboom argued that “spot checks” work in a number of systems to keep players honest. Plus, the economics mean a farmer wouldn’t want to apply more manure than what his field needed.
The way the math works out, the manure he applies is worth about $280 per acre in nutrients. 
“Now, I don’t know too many people, farmers, or otherwise that are gonna burn half their money – they can’t afford to do that,” Rozenboom said.

Andersen said manure management plans typically include more fields than where a farmer typically applies manure to account for a year where they might have more manure than they planned for.
Audits 
While some of the records are not public, DNR can request them from farmers at any time, and they are reviewed by the department in the event of an audit.
According to Krausman, in 2025 DNR staff conducted 745 onsite inspections of animal feeding operations that would have included a review of manure management plans. 
Krausman said DNR has “consistently pursued enforcement actions” since 2020 for animal feeding operation violations like late manure management plans, construction violations and prohibited discharges. 
“A top priority for the DNR is manure discharges that reach state waters,” Krausman said in an email. “All such incidents are referred to DNR Legal Services for review and potential further enforcement action.” 
Since 2020, DNR has issued 97 enforcement actions related to manure management plans and 62 enforcement actions related to prohibited discharges at animal feeding operations. 
The environmental group Food & Water Watch issued a blueprint for clean water in Iowa, with a slew of legislative suggestions that would “ensure that Iowa’s water is drinkable for generations to come.” Several suggestions related to manure management in the state.
The blueprint called for a “publicly available database” with manure management plan data, requirements for DNR to inspect one-fifth of all permitted animal operations annually and a mandate that farms monitor for discharges “during and immediately after land application.”
DNR relies on producers and the public to report spills of manure and other contaminants that end up in Iowa waterways. An analysis from Food & Water Watch, using DNR records, found that between 2013 and 2023, there were 179 instances of manure discharges to Iowa waterways, killing approximately 2 million fish over the time frame.
Food & Water Watch’s proposed solution is to mandate that all large concentrated animal feeding operations require federal discharge permits that are enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Dani Replogle, an attorney with Food & Water Watch, said these permits would give “transparent information” to the public and regulators about pollution entering waterways.
“We need federal nutrient management plans instead of Iowa’s manure management plan, and we need those permits to include monitoring so that we can see what’s actually happening, what pollution is coming off of these facilities, and then have a way to force facilities to make changes when it comes out that they are polluting water,” Replogle said. 
Replogle said manure management plans are a “completely inadequate way to address the pollution crisis” in Iowa, because the plans are written by farmers. 
“It’s really a case of the fox guarding the hen house,” Replogle said. 
A limit, not a recommendation
Andersen said the biggest point of confusion he sees with manure management plans is that producers will often view the nitrogen and phosphorus maximums as an application recommendation. 
“I think for a long time, people thought of it sort of as a recommendation tool – that’s how much nitrogen I should be putting on – and that’s not the case,” Andersen said. 
He explained that while the current nitrogen use factors in Iowa, as shown in part of the manure management plan, range from 0.9 pounds of nitrogen per bushel, to 1.2 pounds per bushel, data gathered from on-farm trials by the Iowa Nitrogen Initiative show that on average, farms need 0.93 pounds of nitrogen per bushel of corn. 
Andersen said these trials give a recommended amount of nitrogen that should be applied, which is lower than the value that most farmers can put on their manure management plan. 
“The manure management plan is sort of setting a limit of where most fields won’t be nitrogen limited,” Andersen explained. “It is not a nitrogen recommendation tool, and shouldn’t be treated as such.” 
He said in most manure-applied fields, farmers try to apply manure as close to the nutrient limits as they can. 
Part of this, he explained, is because it takes about 60 working days to apply all of the estimated manure produced in Iowa each year. Add in rain delays and the time it takes to move equipment and the reality is more like 80 to 90 days needed for application. 
“It’s easy to sit and say, ‘We should legislate so that no one’s allowed to put manure on before X date on the calendar’ but if we don’t have the capacity to do that, we run into other issues,” Andersen said. 
Replogle with Food & Water Watch said in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus running off of a field and into waterways, manure application can lead to other types of pollution. Replogle said things like fecal coliform bacteria, chloride, heavy metals and traces of antibiotics are all pollutants that could be in manure. 
“There’s a lot of other stuff in CAFO waste that is not being accounted for with a manure management plan or a nutrient management plan for that matter,” Replogle said. 
Andersen said when it comes to manure application’s relationship with water quality, ground cover, rather than application rate, is more important. 
A field with vegetation in the ground is more likely to hold on to nutrients, especially during a rain event, than an empty field. 
“Cropping system matters a lot, and we need to try and encourage having vegetation all the time,” Andersen said.
The state-led Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy has encouraged farmers to adopt cover crops and optimized nitrogen application strategies as methods to reduce the nutrient load ending up in Iowa waterways. 
The state has also implemented grants and funding programs to help establish vegetation along waterways, saturated buffers and other strategies aimed at improving nutrient concentrations in watersheds.
A group of Iowa Democrats previewed legislation to improve water quality in the state. The plan did not include farm regulations, but called for a boost in the incentives to farmers and landowners to implement these strategies. 
“I worry less about an individual farm’s records, and more about, how do we generally help support farmers, use manure as a resource, make better manure decisions,” Andersen said. “Because I think generally people are in compliance – our real problem is that people are applying close to that manure management form (limit).”

,California,2026-01-24 00:55:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles might tweak its ‘mansion tax.’ Here’s why that matters for the rest of California,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2026/01/measure-ula-raman-howard-jarvis-ballot/,The ballot measure do-over is intended to restart apartment development across Los Angeles and ward off a statewide anti-tax crusade.,"In summary
The ballot measure do-over is intended to restart apartment development across Los Angeles and ward off a statewide anti-tax crusade.


To save the City of Los Angeles’ controversial “mansion tax” — and fend off the threat of fiscal calamity across the state — Angelenos need to re-write the law.
That’s according to City Councilmember Nithya Raman who introduced a motion on Friday to put a mansion tax do-over on the June 2026 ballot. The council is scheduled to vote on the measure Tuesday.
The tax, known as Measure ULA, has stuck high-value real estate sales with supersized transfer taxes — 4% on sales of between $5 million and $10 million and 5.5% for anything higher — since it was passed by nearly 60% of local voters in 2022. All that revenue, $1 billion and counting, is reserved for affordable housing development and upkeep and low-income tenant assistance.
The measure has fierce defenders, among them tenant rights groups and public sector unions. 
Apartment developers hate it just as ferociously. Despite its moniker as a “mansion tax,” the policy draws no distinction between single family compounds in Beverly Hills and large new apartment buildings constructed for renters.
In the years immediately following the enactment of ULA, multifamily property sales did see a steep drop compared to those in other cities around the county. 
More recently, the fate of the Los Angeles mansion tax has become a statewide concern. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, a group that advocates for lower taxes in California, is gathering signatures to put a measure on California’s November 2026 ballot that would, in part, sharply curtail the ability of more than two dozen cities to charge heightened transfer taxes like the one in Los Angeles. 
If it passes, it would deal a multibillion dollar blow to municipal budgets in some of California’s largest cities. But even if qualifies for the ballot and ultimately fails, opponents of the measure such as public sector unions and other allies of California Democrats would likely feel compelled to spend millions on electoral offense. A growing number of Democratic lawmakers in the state capitol are eager to avoid either outcome. They hope that tinkering with Measure ULA will defang the anti-tax crusade statewide.
Hence Friday’s proposal by Raman. 
The motion calls for a local ballot measure that would make a series of tweaks to the original tax. The most significant would exempt apartments, condos, commercial and mixed-used projects from ULA’s transfer tax for the first 15 years — removing what has come to be seen by many developers as an impediment on construction. 
The motion would also change some of the rules about how money gathered by the measure can be spent.
At a council meeting on Friday, Raman described the proposed measure as an effort to “protect” the heart of the mansion tax.
“Multifamily and mixed-use housing production has slowed in the City of L.A., lenders are pulling back from the market entirely and there’s multiple efforts to un-do ULA entirely — to take it away from us completely,” she said, directing her message to the crowd of protesters who showed up to rally against any proposed changes to the tax. “There may be different ways of thinking about how we protect this going forward, but I stand here with you in deep agreement with the comments that you’re making.”
Opponents did not seem convinced. 
“Measure ULA is working,” said Joe Donlin, director of the United to House LA, a coalition of labor unions, affordable housing developers and private development skeptics that launched the initial ballot measure, said in a press release. “It’s irresponsible to propose changes without even an analysis of how much it would cost. Why would we give ‘The People’s Billion’ to the billionaires who already have so much?”
The council voted to circumvent the typical committee process and push the motion to a full and final vote at the Tuesday meeting, which begins at 10am.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/090821-Beverly-Hills-Mansion-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-23 19:56:53.583912

(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)Iowa State University researchers received unexpected answers to the question of how often people humanize artificial intelligence in news writing.
ISU English professor Jo Mackiewicz and Jeanine Aune, an English teaching professor and director of the university’s advanced communication program, recently published a study on how prevalent the use of anthropomorphizing, or humanizing, language is when it comes to artificial intelligence programs.
They were surprised to find that AI was not typically described in human terms. Even the use of humanizing verbs like “learns,” when considered in context, did not always treat the technology like a person.
“It’s the exact opposite of what I was expecting,” Aune said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Aune said the pair got the idea for this research from a conference they both attended. The discussion included the suggestion that educators emphasize that AI is a tool that cannot replace communication principles and practices and to avoid anthropomorphizing the technology when they talk about it.
Iowa State University alumni were also involved in the study, including current Brigham Young University associate professor of linguistics Matthew Baker and University of Northern Colorado assistant professor of English Jordan Smith.
Heading into their research, Aune and Mackiewicz said they both had their assumptions as to what they’d find — that  humanizing the technology would be widespread. Prior research has shown people anthropomorphize when working with robotics, and Aune said they’ve read articles written about how people use and perceive AI that have suggested humanization is happening.
The research team used News on the Web to study language relating to AI, Mackiewicz said, as it includes the most recent data aggregated from news articles originating from 20 different countries. The database has topped 20 billion words, and it includes some of the earliest news articles about AI to recent articles covering the technology.
“When we started to do an analysis of the individual pairings, that’s where the findings became most interesting, because the overall finding was that, oh, they don’t really pair as frequently as prior research or opinion pieces would have you think,” Mackiewicz said.
Words the team was on the lookout for focused on “verbs that reflect cognition,” Mackiewicz said, also known as “mental verbs” — needs, learns, means, and understands are just a few examples. They also narrowed the search to references to AI or ChatGPT, as it was one of the first AI tools to become publicly available and known.
What they found is that these mental verbs are not often paired with the identified terms, and there was nuance to the instances where they were used together.
“AI means, or AI needs, or ChatGPT knows — you put those together, just on the surface, they seem anthropomorphizing, but they’re not necessarily,” Mackiewicz said.
Anthropomorphization “exists on a spectrum,” Mackiewicz said, where a word like “means” could apply to different senses and meanings depending on how it is being used. Other words have different meanings in their common usage or usage by different disciplines, such as “learns.” Mackiewicz said the terms “AI” and forms of “learn” were paired together frequently in the data, which to some would seem to say that the technology is learning like a human could, but to others would mean something completely different.
It’s this nuance that shows why strict guidelines of what words can and cannot be used in relation to AI are flawed, she said, and what advice the researchers would offer instead is that people need to be careful about knowing who their audience is when writing about AI and thinking about how their words could be interpreted.
Mackiewicz said that in a way, this work showed the value of human beings. It’s easy for a computer to count how many times words are paired together, but it’s harder to analyze it within its context and determine the language’s actual meaning.
While it would be a bigger lift than this study, the researchers said they would be interested in studying what language is used to refer to AI in other areas of writing, like social media. This would require them to create their own database and scrape social media for the necessary information, Mackiewicz said, but it could yield interesting results.
While journalists utilize style guides created by the Associated Press or other organizations when deciding how to write on certain topics and receive editing on their writing, Mackiewicz said, social media generally doesn’t follow such rules.
“We now even had some students refer to ChatGPT with a male pronoun, not talk about it as ‘it,’” Aune said. “So I personally really advocate being intentional with the language, so talking about output text and it uptakes the prompt, you could really kind of emphasize that it is a tool that’s really helpful, but it’s not replacing our brains.”

At least 94 Democrats and 153 Republicans have qualified to run in Alabama state and federal elections this year. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)At least 94 Democrats and 153 Republicans were listed to run for the Alabama Legislature in state and federal elections later this year as candidate qualifying ended on Friday evening.
While lists were being finalized Friday, several notable developments emerged:

Alabama Democrats appeared to be fielding their most robust slate of candidates since 2018;
Alabama Republican Party Chair John Wahl entered the race for lieutenant governor late on Friday, after an unexpected endorsement from President Donald Trump;
Former U.S Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Madison, qualified to run for a Huntsville-area House seat;
At least 12 candidates – seven Republicans and five Democrats – will run to succeed outgoing U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is running for the Republican nomination for Alabama governor.

In addition to the candidates for the Legislature, there are five Democratic and three Republican candidates for governor, two Democrats qualified for lieutenant governor, joining eight Republicans, and a crowded U.S. Senate race on both sides of the aisle.
Wahl declined to comment about his bid for lieutenant governor Friday evening, saying he would have a formal statement on Monday. In a phone interview Friday afternoon, prior to qualifying, he said Tuberville is a shoe-in for the gubernatorial nomination.

“This is obviously Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s race. He has almost cleared the field. The fundraising difference, the polling numbers,” Wahl said. “At the end of the day, though, every race is decided by the voters of Alabama, and we leave it up to the candidates to convince the voters that they should vote for them.”
According to campaign finance reports, as of Jan. 20, Tuberville has raised over $7 million in campaign donations.
Other GOP gubernatorial candidates include Ken McFeeters and “Alabama” Will Santivasci.
On the Democratic side, five candidates qualified for the state’s highest office. Joining former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones will be pastor Will Boyd, hemp businessman Chad “Chig” Martin, former state Rep. Nathan Mathis, and former gubernatorial candidate Yolanda Flowers.
In 2022, 87 Democrats ran for office, according to paperwork submitted to the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office. For the 2026 midterms, there were 94 as of early Friday evening.
“I think a healthy democracy does include more candidates rather than less,” said Alabama Democratic Party Vice Chair Tabitha Isner, a candidate for Senate District 26 in the Montgomery area. “I see more candidates on the ballot as evidence of a healthier democracy, or at least a desire to have a healthier democracy.”

There are eight Republican candidates running for Lieutenant Governor. Current Secretary of State Wes Allen, George Childress, Army veteran Patrick Bishop, Pastor Dean Odle, current Commissioner of Agriculture & Industries Rick Pate, Alabama Ethics Commission member Dr. Stewart Hill Tankersley, Nichole Jones Wadsworth and Wahl who was endorsed by President Donald Trump Thursday night.
Allen sharply attacked Wahl’s candidacy in a statement Friday evening. Referring to Wahl as “Nehemiah Wahl,” the GOP chairman’s legal name, Allen said Wahl’s candidacy would hurt the Republican Party.
“By entering this race, Nehemiah Wahl has, once again, betrayed his obligation to the Alabama Republican Party,” he said. “Instead of living up to his duty to promote Republican values and the success of Republican candidates, he has chosen self-promotion that will undercut the campaigns of Republicans up and down the ballot. Democrats are fielding the strongest slate of candidates in recent history and the chairman of the Alabama Republican Party is giving them ammunition to attack every Republican candidate in the state.”
On the Democratic side, Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery and 2010 legislative candidate Derryl Perryman will run for lieutenant governor.
Republicans qualified for Alabama’s 1st Congressional district include former congressman Jerry Carl, James “Jimmy” Dees, small business owner Rhett Marques, Army veteran Joshua McKee, John Mills, Marine Veteran James Richardson and Air Force veteran Austin Sidwell. Army veteran Clyde W. Jones, Jr., is the sole Democrat running for the seat, left vacant by current Republican U.S. Rep. Barry Moore’s bid for Tuberville’s Senate seat. Moore is endorsed by President Donald Trump.

The Legislature

Former U.S Sen. Mo Brooks came out of retirement and qualified Friday for Alabama House District 20, currently held by Rep. James Lomax, R-Huntsville.
“An elected official and a long time friend, Stan McDonald, asked me to go out to lunch with him. I did, and they asked me, urged me, to run for the state legislature,” Brooks said in an interview Friday. “That was followed up with over a period of time, total of about five or six elected officials asking me to run in the House District 20 position coupled with a number of people who were not office holders, asking me to run and they would, each of them give their reasoning for why it would help the state of Alabama.”
Efforts to contact Lomax Friday were not immediately successful.
Brooks ran for U.S. Senate in 2022 and initially got Trump’s endorsement in the race. But the president withdrew the endorsement as Brooks struggled to get traction and after the congressman made comments at a Trump rally saying that the president had no legal pathway to overturn the 2020 presidential election, won by Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
Three districts have multiple Democratic candidates in seats that have been left by their former holders running for other offices or retiring. House District 74, currently held by Phillip Ensler, running for lieutenant governor, has two Democratic candidates, Jasmyne Crimel and Austin Smith, and Republican Alva Lambert.
Debra Foster and David Reddick qualified for House District 32, currently held by Rep. Barbara Boyd, D-Anniston, who is retiring.
Senate District 2 in Huntsville has three Democratic candidates, Rudolph Valentino Drake, Alex House and Guy Sotomayor, and Republican John Roberts. Current Sen. Tom Butler, R-Huntsville, announced he would not seek re-election last summer.
Isner said the Huntsville-area seat is one the party is focusing on, with hopes of flipping.
“Actually flipping of seats is pretty rare. The balance hasn’t changed much in recent years, but if we’re talking about a seven point swing that puts more into play,” Isner said. “Having more candidates on the ballots has big, long term impacts in terms of civic engagements and Democratic enthusiasm.”
Isner said that the party will measure success in the midterms not by flipped seats, but by narrowed margins. Specifically, it is keeping an eye on Senate Districts 2; Senate District 7, also in Madison and represented by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville; and Senate District 26, held by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road and the subject of a redistricting battle.
In the House, Isner said the party would watch Huntsville-area districts 20 (where Lomax and Brooks will battle); 21 (held by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville) and 25 (held by Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville). The party will also be watching two Jefferson County-area districts: House District 15, currently held by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena and House District 47, currently held by Rep. Mike Shaw, R-Hoover.
“Certainly a big reason that people are so interested in elections in 2026 is because we are seeing the possibility of more Democratic victories, as evidenced by other states such as Georgia lending to public service commission seats. Virginia and elsewhere have seen elections that went blue that might not have otherwise,” she said.
While there is not a Democratic candidate for every legislative seat, Isner said recruiting candidates that reflect voters is what the party focused on.
“That’s the other reason that it’s so important to have people running everywhere is because, even if a candidate can’t themselves win, if they can increase Democratic turnout in an area that can help our statewide candidates perform better,” Isner said.
Democrats will also have candidates for every statewide office; all seven U.S. House congressional districts; three Public Service Commission seats; four State Board of Education districts and a seat on the Alabama Supreme Court.

Second homes already pay more, and squeezing them further won’t solve Vermont’s education crisis.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dan Petherbridge: Stop treating camps like a cash cow.","Dear Editor, 



Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, wants to tax second homes at a higher rate to pay for education. 
First of all, nonhomesteads already pay a higher education rate. I’m a retired Vermont homeowner who pays ridiculously high property taxes on my home and camp. 

READ MORE

Rather than spend money on an RV, cruise or elaborate trip, we decided to buy a small camp as our way to recreate and vacation. 
Why should camp owners be singled out every year to make up the ever-increasing burden of education costs, while others who enjoy different leisure activities are untouched? 
Taxes have risen at unprecedented levels, and increasing them even more on our so-called second home—which we can only use about three months a year—may force us to sell and move out of state.
I think people believe second-home taxation is going after wealthy out-of-state families, but many camps are owned by Vermonters. Camps are nonhomesteads and thus treated like second homes and pay higher rates already.
When considering the bill for education, legislators should first look at reducing expenses. These expenses have risen dramatically while the number of students has decreased significantly. 
Expenses need to decrease, not rise. We also need to transition from using property taxes to pay for education toward income-based sources. Property taxes should only fund one’s city or town services, not education. If you want to know why retirees are moving out of Vermont, in my mind, a major factor is taxes.
There needs to be a philosophical shift to deal with the costs of education, not the same old approach, which is not solving the problem. 
We need innovation to solve the education crisis, and taxing second homes is not the answer; it’s a bad idea.
Dan Petherbridge, Essex, Vt.

President Trump’s “America First” agenda is undoing decades of U.S. leadership, alliances and global trust.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter Welch: The perils and promise of ‘America First’.","This commentary is by Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who represents Vermont in the U.S. Senate.



As far back as the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, our small state has wielded outsized influence in the nation and the world. 
Former Vermont senator Warren Austin was the country’s first ambassador to the United Nations. My predecessor, Sen. Patrick Leahy, worked tirelessly to build relations with people and governments in other countries. 

READ MORE

In Washington and abroad, Leahy found ways to project a positive face of America. His efforts not only helped improve the lives of countless people enduring poverty, injustice, conflict and disease, but also enabled the U.S. to find ways to work together with governments that had previously been aligned with our adversaries. 
Vietnam is an example: Leahy worked to build trust and address some of the worst legacies of the Vietnam War, like cleaning up contamination from Agent Orange and helping tens of thousands of people injured by landmines and bombs. 
Those and other war legacy programs continue today; they formed the foundation for U.S.-Vietnam reconciliation and our comprehensive strategic partnership.
There are many other instances where our foreign aid has been a catalyst for closer relations and partnerships with governments and the world: efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and other infectious diseases; educational and cultural exchanges; the Peace Corps; programs to combat hunger and protect biodiversity and endangered species; work to counter corruption, repression and impunity. 
These efforts required proactive, sustained engagement, cultivating relations over many years with foreign officials and average citizens in those countries, on a bipartisan basis. 
This was Leahy’s vision of “America First.” He and his Senate colleagues understood that what happens beyond our borders directly affects us. To deal with climate change, terrorism, pandemics and other threats, the U.S. needs allies and partners who share our goals.
President Trump’s new “America First” National Security Strategy is the opposite of what bipartisan leaders have spent decades working hard to achieve. In a mere 12 months, much of that work has been undone.
President Trump and Elon Musk dismantled our foreign aid programs practically overnight. Billions of dollars for those programs—which passed with bipartisan support—have been rescinded. 
This has life-and-death consequences for hundreds of millions of people who depend on U.S. aid. Thousands of career Foreign Service officers and local employees at the State Department and our embassies have lost their jobs. They were our eyes and ears, providing objective analysis of evolving threats around the world and building relations with counterparts in foreign countries.
President Trump’s misguided policies extend far beyond U.S. aid. His national security strategy lampoons building alliances in defense of democracy and freedom, while lauding business deals with dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi royal family. 
He is trying to dominate weaker neighbors. His economic agenda hinges on reckless tariffs, which immediately led to a trade war. These tariffs not only amount to tax hikes for Americans and lost revenue for our farmers and businesses; they have also weakened our alliances and partnerships, including with our closest neighbors Canada and Mexico. 
Today, these and many other countries no longer see the United States as a reliable partner and are seeking stronger trade and security ties with our adversaries, China and Russia. 
Last November, 194 countries attended COP30, the United Nations climate conference in Brazil. The U.S., the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, was absent, along with two failed states, Afghanistan and Burma. 
To President Trump, “America First” means mining for as much carbon-polluting coal, oil, and natural gas as possible, including on public lands. 
Meanwhile, China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, sent nearly 800 delegates to COP30, and it is the largest producer of renewable energy technology, including over 80% of the world’s solar manufacturing. President Trump is turning over the keys to America’s future security to the fossil fuel companies and our global competitors.
And recently, with the unauthorized use of military force to capture Venezuela’s dictator Nicolas Maduro, the President has entangled the United States in a costly, open-ended nation-building venture in Venezuela that harks back to the days of 19th-century gunboat diplomacy.  
A year ago, speaking of Greenland, he said, “One way or the other, we’re going to get it.”  Last week, he warned, “We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not. … If we don’t do it the easy way, we’ll do it the hard way.”  
The President’s foreign policy strategy is rooted in greed and bullying. It breeds resentment and anger, and over time, that will become a dangerous liability. 
We are already seeing the seeds of that, as one foreign leader after another looks for alternative markets and partners. 
It may make an easy campaign slogan, but it is the American people who will struggle to pay the price for his ill-conceived, isolationist policies. President Trump’s foreign policy might be more accurately summed up as “Trump First.” It is certainly not putting Americans first.
Under this administration, our values, our credibility, and our reputation are under assault. As Vermonters, we face a choice: pull the covers over our heads or renew a commitment to global leadership and engagement consistent with our ideals. 
The United States must continue to set an example as a generous nation. We must continue to stand for democracy and freedom. 
Austin did this at the United Nations, and Leahy did this so effectively throughout his Senate career. They showed that diplomacy and cooperation are almost always better than conflict. 
I am working to carry on their vision in the Senate. When we make that effort, we allow for the possibility of better outcomes for ourselves, for our country, and for people everywhere.

(Photo Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)With a massive winter storm just hours away, North Carolinians found warmth and hope Friday in a message of peace from a procession of Buddhist monks.
Thousands of people lined their route as they approached the Triangle area in chilly rain.
This was Day 90 of a 2,300 mile journey from Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., to encourage loving kindness and compassion.
The walk is led by Venerable Bhikkhu Pannakara, who urged the audience of more than a thousand gathered at Jordan Lake to concentrate on the present moment, breathing in and out.
“That is mindfulness,” he said. “Do not multitask anymore. Do one thing at a time.”
Renee McHugh of Apex acknowledged it was easy to feel overwhelmed in today’s deeply partisan country. She said this message resonated.
“We’re so plugged into what’s going on in the world that we hear everything now,” said McHugh. “Back in the day, you could kind of buffer it, and you can’t anymore. So when something good like this happens, I need to go see that.”
Frauke Rona-Bowler was born in Germany, but has called North Carolina home for 30 years. Like McHugh, she was hungry for hope.
“I started following them online a little bit, and it’s the only thing of positivity that I see when I’m online, so I wanted to be part of it. It was important to be here today.” Rona-Bowler said.
Jim Curtis drove 50 miles from Southern Pines to hear the monks, and said he wasn’t disappointed.
“I had such a sad feeling about the way things are, and I see a group of individuals trying to make us think better, and I was inspired,” said Curtis.
Curtis said it was encouraging to see so many people committed to peace.
“It is wonderful when you think sometimes, you’re the only one,” he said. “And then I see all kinds of people around me, various colors, various genders, young and old.”
Pannakara told the audience that in all lives there will be moments of suffering, greed, hatred, and anger, but the key is to slow down and quiet the “monkey mind” — the restless, wandering thoughts many people have.
For those still feeling anxious, he offered a simple daily task.
“Every day when you wake up, get a piece of paper out, write out the statement, ‘Today is going to be my peaceful day,'” Pannakara said.
“Write it down, read it over and over,” he told listeners. “Tell the universe that today is our peaceful day, my peaceful day, so that no one can mess it up except ourselves. And please, don’t mess it up.”
As a small token to represent inner peace and a blessing, the monks offered the people gathered to hear them in Apex woven peace bracelets at the end of the program — a wearable reminder to maintain a calm, positive mindset.
The Venerable Buddhist monks and their dog Aloka, who continues to recover following surgery in South Carolina, will continue their Walk for Peace through North Carolina this weekend. A support team is ready to make adjustments in the schedule if the weather becomes too dangerous.

Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) during Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's final State of the State address on Jan. 20, 2026. (Kate Russell for Source NM)New Mexico came one step closer Friday to entering an interstate medical compact that would make it easier for doctors licensed in other states to practice in New Mexico.
The state Senate voted 40-0 to approve Senate Bill 1, the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Act. Supporters of the bill hail it as a critical step in addressing the state’s shortage of health care workers and expanding telehealth services in rural areas. 
Advocates for entering the compact have in recent years faced pushback from some lawmakers. Some Democrats have also been reluctant to focus on more than two compacts at a time, contending that entering several could overburden the state Regulation and Licensing Division.
Lawmakers who spoke from the Senate floor on Friday praised the bill, but were quick to add that they don’t see it as a silver bullet for the many problems facing New Mexico’s health care system. They said the health care worker shortage will persist until the state reforms its medical malpractice laws, which currently have no cap on damages payments. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has made such reform a priority for her final year in office.
“Some have said it’s not a silver bullet. I prefer to say it’s not the only solution,” Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), one of the bill’s sponsors, said from the Senate floor Friday.
In a subsequent interview with Source NM, she said she thinks that loan forgiveness for health care professionals and affordable housing are also key steps toward solving the worker shortage.
“There’s a lot of work to do and it isn’t just found in one particular piece of legislation,” she said. 
While similar legislation failed in the 2025 session, lawmakers this week praised SB1’s passage and several stressed the importance of entering similar compacts for other licensed professionals. Representatives in the state House on Wednesday advanced nine bills focused on interstate compacts for several licensed occupations, including physician’s assistants, physical therapists and social workers.
Trujillo told Source that several of those multi-state compacts do not yet have enough participating states to be considered “active.” Others have not yet done the proper rulemaking needed to become active compacts, leading her to question whether signing onto them in this 30-day legislative session is the best use of the Legislature’s time.
Republicans in the Senate on Friday showed nothing but enthusiasm for those other compacts, though.
“I would just like to remind this chamber that this is just one little piece of the pie and that we have a lot more compacts lined up, too,” Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec), who’s seeking the Republican nomination for governor, said during the Senate’s discussion of the bill.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bykaterussell-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 19:56:53.583912

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ new appointees to the Board of Corrections moved swiftly Friday to assert control of the panel she’s been at odds with for over two years, firing its attorney and taking over the board’s top spots.
The moves showed the new power the Republican governor has won with a majority on the seven-member board she’d previously clashed with over control of the state prison system. The decisions were met with consternation by members who had been appointed by previous governors.
Sanders’ spokesperson Sam Dubke wrote in an email that the governor chose the new board members for their abilities and “is glad [her appointments] have taken this opportunity to end the Board’s distracting legal issues and focus on the mission of keeping Arkansans safe.”
Board member Dubs Byers said in an interview that he didn’t doubt the new members were “highly competent people,” but said the vote to allow new board members to take the officer positions was still premature. He’d asked during the meeting to hold elections in 30 or 60 days to give the members time to get to know one another.
“They don’t know about the Department of Corrections. They haven’t learned anything yet,” Byers said. “I’ve been on the board now for ten years, and I worked for the [Department of Corrections] for 39 years, and there’s still things … I need to learn.”
By the end of the day, the board had voted to rescind a 2024 vote to hire an outside attorney used by the board in its lawsuit against Sanders.
Friday’s meeting was the first since Sanders had appointed Jamie Barker, Nathan Lee and Boyce Hamlet to the board.
Barker, Sanders’ former deputy chief of staff who left her office to work for a lobbyist two weeks before his appointment, was voted as the board’s new chairman despite officer elections not being placed on the agenda by Byers, who became chair after Benny Magness’ term expired last month. The chair places items on the board’s agenda for consideration.
Barker was voted chair by all four of the Sanders appointees. Watson and Alonza Jiles voted for Byers, who did not vote since chairmen typically only vote to break a tie.
Lee was voted as vice-chair, and Hamlet, who is the chair of the Post-Prison Transfer Board, was voted as secretary.
It did not take long for the new board members to begin undoing board actions Sanders and her allies had criticized. Within two hours of becoming chair, Barker adjourned the board to call a special meeting, initially to rescind the “illegal hiring” of Abtin Mehdizadegan and his law firm in litigation against the governor. The reference to the lawsuit against Sanders was removed from an amended agenda.
Mehdizadegan did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
The Barker-led board then voted to rescind the 2024 vote to hire Mehdizadegan, 4-3. Mehdizadegan is also representing the board in a separate but related lawsuit filed by Attorney General Tim Griffin, who says the board — then led by longtime chairman Benny Magness — violated public records laws when it hired the attorney.
Judge says Arkansas corrections secretary serves at pleasure of Board of Corrections, not governor

A Pulaski County judge ruled in favor of the board in its lawsuit against Sanders last year. The board sued over state laws passed that shifted oversight of the Department of Corrections’ secretary from the board to the governor, arguing they were an unconstitutional power-grab. Sanders and Griffin have appealed the ruling. The case filed by Griffin is still ongoing.
The special meeting was called with the minimum two hours of notice permitted under the state’s public records laws.
Griffin did not immediately commit to ending his case against the board, which is based on his contention that Mehdizadegan’s hiring violated state laws.
“I am pleased that under new leadership the Board is taking the necessary steps to correct this error. My office will continue to assess the situation as it develops and take steps as necessary to reach satisfactory conclusions in both lawsuits,” Griffin said in a statement.

Tax Appeal Boards are required by state law of every county and allow a citizen to appeal their property taxes. They are to be made up of, at minimum, three people appointed by county commissioners. 
Broadwater County recently had one member die and another move, County Commissioner Debi Randolph told the Daily Montanan, and just one member was listed on their website last week.
Randolph said the county has addressed the issue, but not before Broadwater County resident Linde Hoff ran into a situation where she says she was unable to appeal a property tax bill this year.
When Hoff got her property tax bill this year, rooms were added to her residential home that aren’t included in the house, so she and her husband appealed. Hoff, along with her neighbors, are also in a lawsuit against another neighbors regarding junk on the property. 
That’s important because because during that lawsuit regarding junk, Hoff had a private assessor come to her property and found the neighboring property was devaluing theirs. This private assessment was also used to calculate her taxes, she said.
Tax Appeal Boards are supposed to give citizens a voice in their taxes, and in nuanced situations like Hoff’s, can allow for additional information to be presented to the county.
As Cascade County puts it on their website: “The primary purpose of the County Tax Appeal Board is to review the market value assigned by the Department of Revenue and to determine if the taxed property is correctly appraised at 100% market value.”
And if it’s not, that’s when changes to a person’s taxes can be made.
Hoff learned that the Tax Appeal Board wasn’t functioning while trying to go through with the process of filing an appeal. She was shuffled around between Broadwater County and the state, eventually being told to call Lewis and Clark County about the issue. Hoff said she was told to fill out the wrong form by Broadwater County treasurer Melissa Franks. 
Broadwater County didn’t comment directly on Hoff’s situation, but said the tax appeal process is “confusing” and suggested citizens should use an attorney or accountant.
Hoff did call Lewis and Clark County Treasurer Amy Reeves and was told they can’t pull up that information from other counties, so they couldn’t help.
Hoff was also in contact with the state Department of Revenue. But DOR doesn’t “really play a role in the county’s tax appeal boards,” DOR communications director Jason Slead wrote in an email.
DOR sends a letter out and people have 30 days to appeal, which they need to do through a county form referred to as an “8026,” Franks said. If a property owner doesn’t like the response they get from the Department of Revenue, then there’s a separate form a person has to fill out to appeal it to a county tax board.
Hoff filled out the first form and a state employee did come out to their property, but nothing ever seemed to come out of it, she said. She then filled out the second form, was told there would be a call if something was wrong with it, and never heard back about it.
Now, Hoff said, she was told she has no recourse and will have to wait until next year. The new Broadwater County Tax Appeal board needs to be trained, and the county said they would wait until it was closer to a time they’d meet again. Tax Appeal Boards generally meet between July and August.
There is a Montana State Tax Appeal Board, but that’s an independent board separate from DOR, with members appointed by the Governor. That board handles disagreements that haven’t been resolved in a county Tax Appeal Board, though neither Franks nor Randolph appeared to know this during an interview on Friday, something the state clearly says in a video regarding the process.
Hoff said she feels “insulted,” though county officials did meet with her on Friday, she said. Hoff has successfully appealed property taxes before.
“I feel like I’m being ripped off by my government,” Hoff said, adding that someone needs to “take responsibility.”
 ‘No one wants to take that on’

Board vacancies are not unique to Broadwater County, nor is it limited to county Tax Appeal Boards.
In Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, there are currently only two members of the Tax Appeal board. It’s not for lack of trying — they are looking for someone to fill the position, secretary Jessica Dailey said, but they haven’t been able to do so.
“There’s been a vacancy for quite a while now,” Dailey said. “And I mean, we advertise it in the newspaper every so often, and we just don’t get any bites. It’s almost as if no one wants to take that on.”
And small numbers of board members can also put people in odd situations. In one instance Dailey said, one Tax Appeal Board member had to make the decision on one of the other board members’ taxes. Without any other board members, there was no other option.
“It would have been super helpful if we had another member on the board,” Dailey said.
Some Tax Appeal Boards, though, have no issue filling their ranks. Lake County Tax Appeal Board Secretary Kate Stinger said it’s “probably the easiest board” she’s had to fill.
“I think that’s probably because residents are interested in property taxes and frustrated with rising property taxes and maybe that’s the impact that they can have on that situation,” Stinger told the Daily Montanan.
There has been significant noise on the property tax issue in the Flathead and a lawsuit was filed this week by multiple current and former legislators, including Sen. Greg Hertz, a Polson Republican. Rising property values in one of the most scenic parts of the lower 48 states has been an ongoing issue in the area and second homes in the state are now taxed at a higher rate.
Both Stinger and Dailey said they were seeing significant increases in the number of appeals going through their boards. Franks said she hasn’t seen one since becoming Broadwater County’s treasurer.
Blaine County, meanwhile, recently went through the process of selecting a new Tax Appeal Board member. County Commissioner Miles Hutton said that board wasn’t a huge issue to fill, but others are.
“There’s lots of boards nobody wants to serve on,” Hutton said.
Across the state, many counties have a huge number of appointed boards. In Broadwater County, for example, there’s an airport board, a broadband advisory board, a county compensation board — all intended as a method of citizen engagement.
And if people don’t apply for these positions and serve terms, it doesn’t leave counties with many options.
“We rely on those boards a lot,” Randolph said. “They do a lot of research work for us, and deal with a lot of projects, where we don’t have time to deal with the beginning steps of them, and then they come to us, which is a wonderful community service that they provide.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BroadWater1-23-26.png,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Heading into 2026, Iowans currently holding statewide offices are largely leading in campaign fundraising for state positions ahead of the upcoming primary and general elections, according to recent state campaign finance reports — with one exception.
In the midterm elections, all of Iowa’s statewide offices — governor, attorney general, auditor, secretary of agriculture, secretary of state and treasurer — are on the ballot.
Sand leads governor’s race fundraising
In the race for governor, Democrat Rob Sand, Iowa state auditor, reported raising more than $9.5 million in 2025, according to state reports for the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board. Candidates were required to file their fundraising totals for the previous year, from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2025 by Jan. 20.
While the Democrat faced criticism for receiving $7 million in donations from his wife and her family in 2024, these family members did not donate in 2025. The most recent reported $9.5 million came from roughly 117,000 individual donations. These included many small contributions, as well as some high-profile large donors such as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate who donated $50,000 to Sand’s campaign; Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder who gave $250,000, and former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Fred Hubbell who contributed $200,000.
That fundraising combined with 2024 contributions puts Sand at a total of roughly $18 million heading into the 2026 election season, surpassing other gubernatorial candidates on both sides of the aisle.
“Rob Sand didn’t just outraise every candidate in this race — he outraised all of them combined,” Sand’s campaign manager Kyle Buda said in a statement on the fundraising totals. “Iowans across the state and the political spectrum are rallying behind Rob Sand in record numbers because they’re ready to turn the page on ten years of one-party control that has left them behind and made their problems worse.”
There is one other Democrat running for governor, Julie Stauch, who raised $32,078 in 2025, according to fundraising reports.
More Republicans are seeking the nomination for governor in the 2026 campaign season following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek another term as governor.

U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, currently representing Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, raised the most money among Republicans at $4.3 million in 2025. His total came from nearly 2,000 individual donations, and he ended the reporting period with $3.2 million in cash on hand.
He said in a statement earlier in January he was “blown away” by the Iowans’ support for his campaign, as it set a record for campaign fundraising for GOP gubernatorial candidates during a non-election year.
“Our campaign set this record of $4.3 million raised because Iowans believe in our vision to take our state to new heights and advance President Trump’s America First agenda in Iowa,” Feenstra said in a statement.
While other Republican gubernatorial candidates reported smaller fundraising figures, Zach Lahn — an eastern Iowa farmer and businessman who worked for the conservative group Americans for Prosperity — also entered the year with a significant campaign reserve. While he reported raising $156,931, Lahn also loaned his campaign $2 million and ended 2025 with more than $2.1 million cash on hand.
Former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services Adam Steen ended the year with less in the bank at $336,073, but raised more than Lahn from outside contributors at $499,975. Former state Rep. Brad Sherman, who entered the race before Reynolds announced she would not seek reelection, raised $201,815 in the reporting period, and Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, raised $40,285.
While Sand has a strong fundraising lead and will not be running against a GOP incumbent, Republicans have dominated recent election cycles in Iowa. Political forecasters like the Cook Political Report and Sabato Crystal Ball are rating the race as “leans Republican” heading into the midterms.
Bird raises $2 million in attorney general reelection bid

The highest fundraiser in 2025 for statewide offices beyond the governor’s race was Attorney General Brenna Bird, who reported raising just over $2 million in 2025 and ending the reporting period with $2.2 million cash on hand. Bird had weighed a bid for governor but ultimately decided in July to seek another term leading the AG’s office.
Democrat Nate Willems, a former state representative and lawyer, reported raising $717,599 over the past year in his bid to unseat Bird in the 2026 election.
Challenger leads fundraising for secretary of state
In the race for Iowa secretary of state, the Democratic challenger, Ryan Peterman, outraised the incumbent Republican Paul Pate. Peterman, a former U.S. Navy pilot, raised $200,784 in 2025 while Pate reported raising $62,104.
In a news release, Peterman said the fundraising totals “reflect a lot about our campaign.”
“I hear it everywhere I go—Iowans are supporting this effort because they want elections that are secure and accessible,” Peterman said. “They’re tired of career politicians, and they’re ready for a new generation of leadership that’s focused on truly serving the public. I am incredibly grateful for the support we’ve received, and I’m looking forward to building on this movement everyday until Election Day.”
Other statewide offices
While there are two Democrats — Chris Jones, a water quality advocate, and farmer Wade Dooley — who have announced they are running for Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, both launched their campaigns after the most recent reporting period. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, who is running for reelection, reported raising $164,942 and starts the year with $315,922 in campaign reserves.
Iowa Treasurer of State Roby Smith, a Republican who was first elected to the position in 2022, reported raising $31,595 in the past year. There are currently no other candidates who have announced campaigns for treasurer.
There is only one statewide elected position with no incumbent in the race in 2026 — the Iowa auditor seat, currently held by Sand. So far, there are no Democrats who have launched campaigns for the office, but two Republicans have launched their bids for the position.
Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer announced in May she would run for state auditor, months after she was appointed to the lieutenant governor position under Reynolds in December 2024. She raised $180,412 since announcing her campaign. Republican Abigail Maas, an Iowa County supervisor and farmer, launched her campaign for the seat in July, and reported raising $35,216. Of that total, Maas loaned her campaign $20,000 in the last reporting period.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sand.newton.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

Under the new AHSAA classification, private schools and public schools will still compete against each other in the regular season but will not compete for the same championships, the first time that will happen in state history.
The reclassification also included dismantling the “financial barriers for private school eligibility.”

In a statement released Friday, AHSAA executive director Heath Harmon said the decision came after discussions with private schools.
“Through multiple meetings with our private school members, they expressed a desire for greater financial flexibility,” Harmon said in the statement. “This model directly addresses those concerns while maintaining fair play for all.”
A message seeking comment was left with Harmon Friday afternoon.
AHSAA was sued by Gov. Kay Ivey and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter last year over an AHSAA policy prohibiting transfer student-athletes from immediately participating in sports if they receive CHOOSE Act funds. In November, Judge J.R. Gaines did not hear arguments and instead ordered both parties to remediation.
During her final State of the State Address earlier this month, Ivey mentioned what she calls the “Let the Kids Play Act.” She said the law would be carried in both chambers of the legislature to ensure “no family benefitting from the CHOOSE Act is unfairly benched again.”
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that extends tax credits for private school tuition and other non-public education related expenses.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)As debate on the New Mexico Senate floor stretched into Friday afternoon, Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee staff members addressed the crowd in a committee room with an apologetic tone: Committee Chair Sen. Linda López (D-Albuquerque) was concerned about the impending winter storm creating dangerous road conditions, they said, so the hearing on several pieces of proposed legislation would be rescheduled for Monday.
Frequently during debate on the Senate floor, lawmakers reminded one other of the impending storm as a reason to adjourn early.
That didn’t stop some, like Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho), from engaging in debates over proposed legislation before the Senate. Senate Bill 2, which would fund statewide highway infrastructure projects in part with increased registration fees for passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. It would also allow the State Transportation Commission to issue bonds to finance road projects.
“Adding fees and taxes onto businesses, which are going to pass that onto the consumers — I hear about affordability all the time from those on the left. You’re actually making it worse with this bill,” Block said during debate over the bill, which passed 31-9 with amendments.
Among the proposed laws the Senate Health and Public Affairs committee was scheduled to discuss were Senate Bill 6, which aims to appropriate nearly $547 million for a new University of New Mexico School of Medicine, and Senate Bill 8, which would funnel $650 million into the state’s Behavioral Health Trust Fund. The fund was signed into law after the 2025 legislative session as a way to rebuild the state’s behavioral health system.
Medical compact bill advances
New Mexico moved closer to entering an interstate medical compact Friday afternoon.
The state Senate voted 40-0 to pass Senate Bill 1, the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Act. The bill aims to ease the state’s health care worker shortage by making it easier for licensed professionals from other states to practice in New Mexico.
“This is a big step forward,” Sen. Rex Wilson (R-Ancho) said on the Senate floor. After voicing his support, though, he told his fellow senators that the legislation was not a cure-all for the many health care challenges facing the state. “This is not a substitute for the big issue we need to deal with in terms of revisions to our malpractice laws.”
Fellow Republicans shared Wilson’s sentiment.
“Make no mistake, we are far from truly accomplishing our goals for New Mexicans,” Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. “If we fail to reform our state’s medical malpractice laws, New Mexico will continue to drive healthcare providers out of our state.”
Reading bill moves forward
Members of the Senate Education Committee on Friday advanced the High-Quality Literacy Instruction Act, which would build on the state’s structured literacy requirements in public schools. Senate Bill 37, sponsored by state Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque), has been endorsed by the Legislative Education Study Committee. Stewart told the committee the bill builds on work the Public Education Department has done over the last several years to improve literacy rates and ”attempts to set in framework a way that we can help everybody learn to read in our public schools.”
Suicide Awareness Day
New Mexico’s most recent health data shows a 9% increase in suicide deaths in 2024. Rosella Sanchez, the director of community and stakeholder relations for the state’s 988 crisis line, said she wants more New Mexicans to understand their options for free resources. The 988 phone line is a free, confidential resource for people experiencing mental health crises.

“It’s for anyone, any time, any struggle. It’s not just for suicidal ideation, anybody can call no matter what situation they’re going through,” she told Source NM. “There’s no judgement, no shame.”
Sanchez offered resources in the Roundhouse rotunda as part of the Legislature’s “Suicide Awareness Day.” The line has reached more than 80,000 New Mexicans, she said. 
The state revamped the 988 line in 2022 following the federal passage of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, which funded the resource for mental health, substance use or suicidal crises. In addition to the phone number, the NMConnect app allows for text messages and provides videos and links to local resources. 
The New Mexico Crisis and Access Line, which answers the 988 calls made in New Mexico, offers counseling, Sanchez said, along with connections to resources for alcohol or substance misuse. Additionally, there is a peer-to-peer warmline to offer a “non-crisis line, for a listening ear,” she said.
Looking ahead
After a busy first week for the legislative session, the halls of the Roundhouse were noticeably less lively Friday morning.
Source NM had planned to cover the Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee hearing Friday afternoon, and will keep eyes on legislation for the new UNM School of Medicine and the Behavioral Health Trust Fund when they are discussed next week.
Also early next week, the House Education Committee will review House Bill 47, which would amend insurance contributions for public and charter schools across the state, and House Bill 24, known as the “Professional Recruitment and Retention Act,” which would aid licensed professionals including registered nurses and dentists with buying a house.
The House Judiciary Committee will also review a slew of bills related to entering interstate compacts for licensed professionals.
Later in the week, the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources committee plans to hear the “Green Amendment,” a proposed change to the state’s constitution to enshrine a right to “clean and healthy air, water, soil and environment.” House Joint Resolution 3 is sponsored by Democratic Reps. Joanne Ferrary (Las Cruces), Joseph Franklin Hernandez (Shiprock) and Patricia Roybal Caballero and Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, both of Albuquerque. If passed, the voters would decide on the constitutional amendment in the next general election.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A New Mexico district judge will rule next week on a request by social media giant Meta to limit recording or streaming during the upcoming trial in Santa Fe centered on allegations the company allowed child exploitation on its sites.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez first brought the civil suit in December 2023, arguing in the complaint that Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on its sites, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaint further argues Meta “profits from its exposure of young users to harmful material.” The NMDOJ sued both the social media company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Meta’s attorneys told the court in a Jan. 16 hearing that the company had “security concerns” for witnesses who work for Meta, and requested limits on filming or recording the trial “because the case pertains to such sensitive issues that invoke strong feelings.”
The New Mexico Department of Justice countered in a filing that Meta’s attorneys did not follow the proper procedure to request limits on broadcasting the trial and requested instead that the trial allow for video and audio recording.
“Consistent with the spirit of New Mexico law and the transparency protections it provides, the trial in this case should take place in a public forum, with access for members of the media and the public who wish to cover it or observe the proceedings,” the NMDOJ’s motion stated.
In a statement emailed to Source NM, an unidentified Meta spokesperson said the NMDOJ made “sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments” in its lawsuit and said the company will “show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.”
Jury selection for the trial is scheduled for Feb. 2, and arguments are set to begin one week later.

Most of the revenue generated from sales of the plate would go to a state fund supporting environmental sustainability and outdoor recreation initiatives.

Fans of Vermont Green FC, the popular semi-professional soccer team based in Burlington, may not need a bumper sticker much longer to flex their support out on the road.
The club — along with Vermont State Treasurer and Green fan Mike Pieciak — is asking legislators to create a new, specialty license plate featuring its colorful crest. The Senate Transportation Committee held a hearing this week on the proposal, S.234.
Vermont Green got widespread attention last August when it won the national championship for its summertime league, USL League 2, over Ballard FC of Seattle. But the team has also won eyes for its outspoken support of climate justice, immigrants’ rights and other progressive causes since its founding in 2022.
Revenue from sales of the license plates would be shared between Vermont’s Transportation Fund and a new, separate state fund managed by the Treasurer’s Office, according to the bill. Roughly 20% of the money would go to the T-fund, while about 80% would go to the new fund. The latter would likely pay out grants to environmental sustainability projects and outdoor recreation initiatives throughout the state, Pieciak told senators on Tuesday. 
Those are both causes, he said, “that are mission-aligned with the Vermont Green — but also, things that are really critical to Vermont.”
Fans would purchase Vermont Green plates the same way they can get one of the state’s existing specialty plates, such as the ones featuring loons, deer or brook trout that help fund wildlife protection and water quality efforts. The Green — with a capital G — plate would cost $45 a year, paid when one’s vehicle registration gets renewed, according to the bill.
Vermont Green’s plate would be the state’s first to commemorate a sports team, said Damien Leonard, an attorney with the Office of Legislative Counsel. But he noted many other states already sell such plates. New York, for instance, has options for fans of all its major teams — and even still sells one commemorating the New York Yankees’ most recent World Series win in 2009.
Senate Transportation hasn’t decided whether it will advance Vermont Green and Pieciak’s proposal yet. But committee members generally like the idea, said Sen. Richie Westman, R-Lamoille, the panel’s chair, on Friday.
He noted that it’s one of multiple license-plate-related measures before the committee this year. In its proposed miscellaneous motor vehicle bill for 2026, the state DMV is asking legislators to nix a requirement in state law that people display a license plate on the front of their vehicles, in addition to the rear. The motor vehicle bill got an introductory hearing this week, too.

In the know
The House and Senate’s Joint Rules Committee set the dates for this year’s crossover deadlines on Friday. Those are the lines in sand by which a bill, at least in theory, must clear at least one House or Senate committee if it has a real shot of becoming law. 
The first crossover deadline is Friday, March 13. But for bills that have a fiscal impact — and must pass through the appropriations committees, or the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee — the deadline is a week later, on March 20.
Of course, bills are never truly dead unless the powers that be condemn them so. Some major bills are exempted from that timeline, such as the state budget. But given that it’s the second year of the legislative biennium, most proposals not moving by this year’s crossover will be facing real peril.

Gov. Phil Scott wants to expand the state’s pre-trial supervision program, which tasks the Department of Corrections with keeping a closer eye on people who are at risk of committing new crimes while they’re awaiting trial. 
In his budget address, Scott proposed a $200,000 increase to the state’s general fund to expand the program statewide. But before that happens, lawmakers will have to figure out why defendants aren’t being referred to the program. 
Only one person in the state is currently under pre-trial supervision, said David D’Amora, who evaluates the program for the Council of State Governments. 
When the program was first piloted in Newport, fewer than 10 people took part in the program, D’Amora told representatives in the Corrections and Institutions Committee Friday. And since the pilot was moved to Chittenden County this fall, only six people have been referred to the program, he said. 
“Why are the numbers so low?” asked Rep. Alice Emmons, D-Springfield, who chairs the committee. The committee will have to bring in defense attorneys and prosecutors to find out, she said.

On the move
The House passed a bill Friday to broaden the state’s power to procure vaccines and issue immunization recommendations. In a roll call vote this morning, H.545 passed with 127 representatives voting yes, 12 abstaining and 9 voting against the measure.
The bill’s approval follows efforts by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under the helm of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to loosen the recommended pediatric vaccine schedule. Vermont’s health commissioner has testified in favor of the bill. 
“Today’s vote on H.545 is another example of the Vermont House of Representatives taking action to protect the health and safety of Vermonters in the face of the federal government refusing to do so,” said House Speaker Jill Krowinski in a statement, adding that the bill does not mandate any immunizations.

Read it here.
Durante décadas, los estacionamientos del Parque Balboa de San Diego estaban abarrotados, con filas de conductores que serpenteaban por los carriles en busca de un raro lugar libre.
 El sábado pasado había muchos espacios abiertos, y el miércoles varios lotes estaban medio vacíos, mientras la gente hacía fila detrás de los quioscos para pagar las nuevas tarifas de estacionamiento.
 Este mes, la ciudad de San Diego impuso las primeras tarifas de estacionamiento para este sitio cultural centenario, lo que provocó confusión y desprecio. Los museos informaron que las visitas disminuyeron un 20 % de inmediato, vándalos dañaron los parquímetros y los alcaldes del condado de San Diego instaron a la ciudad a revertir esta impopular política.
 “Los impactos negativos del estacionamiento de pago en el Parque Balboa han sido inmediatos y mensurables”, declaró Jessica Hanson York, directora ejecutiva del Museo Mingei y presidenta de la Asociación Cultural del Parque Balboa, que representa a los museos del parque, en una conferencia de prensa el miércoles. “Nuestros visitantes lo están notando, al igual que nuestras instituciones culturales y museos en todo el parque”.
 El alcalde de San Diego, Todd Gloria, dijo que las tarifas de estacionamiento proporcionarán ingresos estables para el parque y sus museos, y ayudarán a cerrar una brecha presupuestaria de la ciudad de aproximadamente $300 millones este año fiscal y $110 millones el próximo año.
 “La alcaldesa Gloria, con el apoyo del ayuntamiento, tomó la difícil decisión de poner en marcha el programa el año pasado para crear una fuente de financiación específica para que el Parque Balboa, la joya de la corona de la ciudad, siga siendo un espacio especial para las generaciones futuras”, declaró Dave Rolland, portavoz de Gloria, en un comunicado a CalMatters. “Entendemos que este es un cambio importante, pero es necesario”.
 Reacción instantánea
 El programa de estacionamiento tuvo un comienzo difícil. Las estimaciones actuales de la ciudad para los ingresos por estacionamiento este año representan aproximadamente una cuarta parte de su objetivo original. Mientras tanto, los directores del museo advierten que la pérdida de ingresos por entradas podría superar con creces las ganancias, ya que las nuevas tarifas dificultan el acceso al parque.
“Creo que siempre hemos considerado los parques de nuestra ciudad y región más como algo sagrado que como una forma de equilibrar el presupuesto”, dijo Jim Kidrick, presidente y director ejecutivo del Museo del Aire y el Espacio de San Diego.
 Incluso los días de entrada gratuita se vieron afectados. Los martes, el parque ofrece entrada gratuita a museos selectos para los residentes del condado de San Diego. Este mes, la participación disminuyó un 25 % en comparación con enero del año pasado, lo que la convierte en la asistencia más baja en una década, según Judy Gradwohl, presidenta y directora ejecutiva del Museo de Historia Natural de San Diego.
El personal y los voluntarios del parque están exentos de pagar, pero deben estacionarse en estacionamientos más lejos. Las autoridades del museo afirmaron que esto representa un problema de seguridad para el personal que trabaja de noche y una carga para los voluntarios.
 “Mis voluntarios son casi exclusivamente personas mayores y traen trenes, herramientas y todo lo que usan a diario para operar las maquetas”, dijo Michael Warburton, director ejecutivo del Museo del Ferrocarril en Miniatura. “Es un reto para ellos traer todas estas cosas y luego encontrar un lugar para estacionar”.

 El Ayuntamiento de San Diego está sintiendo la presión. Dos concejales que votaron a favor del programa ahora piden la suspensión de las tarifas de estacionamiento para residentes. El concejal Stephen Whitburn, cuyo distrito incluye el parque, votó en contra de las tarifas de estacionamiento , argumentando que desalentarían a familias, estudiantes y personas mayores de visitarlo. Ahora está redoblando su oposición.
 “La gente se está perdiendo el disfrute y el enriquecimiento cultural del parque, y los museos están perdiendo los ingresos que financian sus exhibiciones y personal”, declaró Whitburn a CalMatters. “Me gustaría que el ayuntamiento llegara a un consenso para derogar las tarifas y restablecer el estacionamiento gratuito en el Parque Balboa”.
 Lawrence Frank, profesor de estudios urbanos y planificación en la Universidad de California en San Diego, quien estudia políticas de transporte, cree que el cambio es inevitable. Frank, quien estudia los efectos negativos de la cultura del automóvil en la salud, afirmó que el nuevo sistema de pago de estacionamiento podría disuadir a los conductores y fomentar el uso del transporte público y la transitabilidad peatonal en los alrededores del parque.
“Es razonable”, dijo. “Es comparable a lo que se hace en otros lugares. No es único. Lo que es único es que era gratuito”.
 San Diego no es el único estado que ha revisado las políticas de acceso gratuito a los parques. El verano pasado, la Junta de Supervisores de San Francisco votó a favor de imponer tarifas de estacionamiento en el Parque Golden Gate para recaudar fondos para su Departamento de Recreación y Parques. Mientras tanto, la administración Trump eliminó la entrada gratuita a los parques nacionales el Día de Martin Luther King Jr. y el Juneteenth, y añadió el cumpleaños del presidente Donald Trump a su calendario de días sin tarifa. 
 La joya de la corona de San Diego
 San Diego reservó 1400 acres para el Parque Balboa en 1868, con el fin de crear un espacio urbano similar al Central Park de Nueva York, inaugurado una década antes. En 1915, el Parque Balboa albergó la Exposición Panamá-California, y su icónica arquitectura neocolonial tomó forma con extensas plazas, arcos españoles, fachadas talladas y azulejos moriscos.
 El parque alberga actualmente 17 museos de arte, ciencia e historia, además del Zoológico de San Diego. Estos museos abarcan desde el Museo de Historia Natural de San Diego, con esqueletos de mastodontes y megalodones, y el Museo del Aire y el Espacio de San Diego, con un módulo de mando del Apolo y aeronaves históricas, hasta el Museo de Arte de San Diego y el Museo de Arte Timken, de acceso gratuito, que exhibe obras de antiguos maestros europeos.
 Lugares más pequeños, como el Museo del Ferrocarril Modelo de San Diego y cabañas internacionales, atienden pasatiempos o culturas específicos, mientras que grupos de artes escénicas, un club de bridge y bolos sobre césped ofrecen actividades recreativas.
 También es un lugar de encuentro para miles de habitantes de San Diego que caminan, hacen picnic o hacen turismo todos los días.
 “Veo gente paseando a sus perros, empujando a sus bebés y reuniéndose con amigos para tomar un café”, dijo Hanson York.

 El estacionamiento tradicionalmente gratuito ha sido un atractivo, dijo Joyce Miller, residente de San Diego y voluntaria del Departamento de Policía de San Diego, en el parque el sábado.
 “Cuando patrullamos aquí, todos los que nos hablaron dijeron que era el mejor lugar porque el estacionamiento era gratuito”, dijo Miller. “Es una gran ventaja para nosotros en San Diego y una excelente atracción turística”.
 El mantenimiento y las operaciones del parque se financian con el fondo general de la ciudad de San Diego, pero Gloria quería crear una fuente de financiación directa. Inicialmente, propuso un plan que, según sus estimaciones, generaría $11 millones para el año fiscal en curso. El ayuntamiento revisó esa cifra a $15 millones, y luego redujo el plazo y la estructura de tarifas, lo que resultó en una estimación de ingresos de $2.9 millones para este año fiscal. 
 ‘La gente está realmente enojada ‘
 Los directores del museo están molestos ante la noticia de que los ingresos del estacionamiento no se sumarán al presupuesto del parque (al menos este año), sino que cubrirán los gastos del fondo general, de modo que la ciudad pueda usar ese dinero para otros fines.
 Los parquímetros cuestan $2.50 por hora y las tarifas diarias oscilan entre $5 y $16. Es menos que los estacionamientos comerciales, que pueden costar más de $30 por día en San Diego. Pero para quienes visitan el Parque Balboa semanalmente o incluso a diario, es excesivo, se quejan los críticos. Es una añadidura a la herida para quienes sufren la inflación, y para los residentes de San Diego se suma a las nuevas tarifas de basura y al aumento de las tarifas del agua.
 San Diego se ha clasificado regularmente entre los mercados inmobiliarios más caros del país, y un análisis reciente reveló que solo el 1.6% de las viviendas en San Diego son asequibles para el hogar promedio. Los precios de la gasolina en California son aproximadamente un 50% más altos que en el resto del país, y hasta el jueves, los precios en San Diego eran 20 centavos más altos, con un promedio de $4.40 por galón, según la AAA.
 En la ciudad de San Diego, los votantes aprobaron por un estrecho margen una medida para cobrar a los propietarios por la recolección de basura , que históricamente era asumida por la ciudad. Sin embargo, el costo final (43,60 dólares) fue al menos un 50 % superior a las estimaciones previas de entre 23 y 29 dólares por vivienda. Mientras tanto, los residentes de la ciudad pueden esperar un aumento del 14,7 % en las tarifas del agua el próximo año y del 14,5 % en 2027.
En otra medida controversial, el consejo aprobó una estructura de tarifas escalonadas, con tarifas más bajas para los residentes de la ciudad de San Diego y tarifas completas para todos los demás, incluidas las personas en otras partes del condado de San Diego.
 Un grupo de alcaldes de otras ciudades protestó porque el Parque Balboa es un recurso regional.
 “He visitado el Parque Balboa toda mi vida y es un valor regional”, dijo la alcaldesa de San Marcos, Rebecca Jones. “Los parques deberían ser gratuitos. Quienes más los utilizan son quienes realmente los necesitan: quienes viven en viviendas multifamiliares”.

 Los visitantes que llegaron al Parque Balboa el sábado estaban furiosos por las nuevas tarifas.
 “Lo detesto”, dijo Caden Mays, estudiante de kinesiología de la Universidad Estatal de San Diego. “Muchas de las exhibiciones son gratuitas; es una pena que el estacionamiento cueste dinero”.
 La caótica implementación de las tarifas de estacionamiento no hizo más que aumentar la animosidad pública. Kidrick, del Museo del Aire y el Espacio, describió el programa como mal concebido y “autocrático”.
 “Alguien debe haber hecho una pasantía de seis meses en ACE Parking”, dijo.
 Los residentes de la ciudad de San Diego tuvieron problemas para inscribirse para el descuento local, y muchos visitantes tuvieron problemas con quioscos de estacionamiento que presentaban fallas y brindaban instrucciones confusas, rechazaban tarjetas de crédito o devolvían a los usuarios a la página de inicio cuando intentaban pagar.
 En represalia, vándalos dañaron al menos 10 estaciones de pago rociando sellador de espuma en las ranuras para tarjetas y monedas, según informó el agente Terrell Totten, portavoz del Departamento de Policía de San Diego. La reparación de cada una costó $400.
 En otros incidentes, la gente rompió las pantallas de las estaciones de pago, esparció pintura verde sobre ellas y untó heces en una de ellas, dijo.
 “Ha habido mucha controversia sobre el estacionamiento pago en Balboa Park últimamente, pero eso no les da a las personas el derecho de destruir los parquímetros”, dijo en un correo electrónico a CalMatters.
 ¿Que sigue?
Frank dijo que la ciudad podría lograr la aceptación pública de las tarifas, pero sólo si invierte el dinero en programas en el parque y en mejorar el acceso mediante el transporte público.
 “Me parece muy razonable que se cobre el estacionamiento, pero debería haber cierta responsabilidad por el uso del dinero para asegurarse de que beneficie al parque y al público”, dijo.

 Reconoce que pertenece a una minoría. Los vecinos lo han rechazado al enterarse de que está de acuerdo con cobrar por estacionar en el Parque Balboa.
 “Esta gente está furiosa”, dijo. “Muy, muy furiosa”.
 Para suavizar el golpe para los usuarios regulares, San Diego ha ofrecido pases anuales de $150 para los residentes de la ciudad y $300 para otros visitantes del parque.
 Hasta el lunes, la ciudad había emitido 2405 pases, incluidos 2236 para residentes, según Rolland, portavoz del alcalde. Gloria también indicó que revisaría los resultados del programa de tarifas de estacionamiento y haría los ajustes necesarios.
 Peter Comiskey, director ejecutivo de la asociación cultural, instó a Gloria a revisar el programa de estacionamiento de inmediato, señalando las advertencias de los directores del museo de que los escasos ingresos por estacionamiento y la disminución de las visitas crean una espiral descendente.
 “Esa espiral descendente podría convertirse rápidamente en una espiral de muerte, todo por unos pocos dólares en ingresos por estacionamiento”, dijo Comiskey. “Como región, como guardianes de este distrito cultural histórico, no podemos permitir que esto suceda”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012126_Balboa-Parking_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

The National Weather Service in Albuquerque is warning residents in most of northern and eastern New Mexico to prepare for another storm, this time with several inches of snow and frigid temperatures. (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Meteorologists and state officials are urging New Mexicans to take seriously forecasts of a winter storm hitting the state this weekend.
As of Friday afternoon, most of central and eastern New Mexico remained either under a winter storm warning or advisory, according to the National Weather Service, beginning Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon.
The warning for much of eastern New Mexico predicts total snow accumulation of four to eight inches, with up to 16 inches in areas at 9,000 feet or higher of elevation. 
Forecasters warn travel will become “very difficult to impossible,” primarily from Tijeras Canyon to the Texas border along Interstate 40. Roads appeared clear in that area around 4 p.m. Friday, according to NMRoads, which offers up-to-date driving conditions. 
Power outages are also possible due to the accumulating snow weight, and temperatures are expected to drop into the single digits, with wind chills below zero. 
‘Snow drought’ observed across the West, amid higher-than-average winter temps

Elsewhere in the state, including northwestern New Mexico and as far south as Ruidoso, between two to five inches of snow or rain are forecast, except at elevations about 8,000 feet, where as much as 10 inches of snow could accumulate, according to the NWS.
On Friday afternoon, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued an emergency declaration, authorizing $200,000 in state funds for the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to help the public stay safe through the freezing temperatures and hazardous driving conditions. 
“I’m grateful to those working around the clock in extreme weather, and to the New Mexicans who are doing their part to keep themselves, their families and responders safe,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. 
DHSEM officials warned residents statewide in a statement Thursday to expect several days of “frigid temperatures, snow and ice” that increase risks of hypothermia and frostbite. 
DHSEM offered a list of warming centers, but encouraged residents to reach out to local officials for the most current information on the centers. 
The department is also activating its Emergency Operations Center in anticipation of the extreme weather, they said.
The looming snowstorm comes as much of the state and elsewhere of the West experience “snow drought,” marked by higher than average temperatures and drought that reduce precipitation or turn snow into rain. 
As of Thursday, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder, snow covered about 2,900 square miles of land in New Mexico. The median snow cover for this time of year is about 14,000 square miles.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/snow1-scaled-e1769210238171-1024x972.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Friday afternoon, saying it would allow the commonwealth to access funds and make resources available to prepare for and respond to impacts from the storm. The National Weather Service said snow accumulations would exceed 12 inches across much of the state by Monday.
PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll said crews were pretreating roads across the commonwealth and would work around the clock to keep them clear and passable when the snow begins early Sunday. But the intensity of the storm, with snow falling one or two inches per hour, means roads won’t be completely free of ice and snow until the storm clears, he said. 
“For us, the rate of snowfall is as important as the amount of overall snow,” Carroll said in a news conference with other public safety and transportation officials Friday.

PennDOT is imposing a Tier 4 travel restriction, which prohibits commercial motor vehicles on the highways. Also prohibited are school buses, motor coaches, motorcycles, recreational vehicles/motorhomes and passenger vehicles towing trailers.
The weather system formed Friday in the Rocky Mountains and southern Great Plains. It is forecast to spread snow and ice across a swath of the eastern half of the country this weekend, continuing into next week. It will be accompanied by bitter cold temperatures through next week, with high temperatures in the teens and low 20s.
“We know that this storm is or has the potential to have major impacts across the commonwealth, not just during the storm, but for days afterward,” Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Director Randy Padfield said.
PEMA is coordinating with state and federal agencies and county emergency officials to review likely impacts from the storm and assess the state’s readiness. The agency has opened its Commonwealth Response Coordination Center, where multiple state agencies and other organizations can work together efficiently, Padfield said.
But, Padfield stressed, preparedness begins with the public.
“The sad fact is that despite our best attempts, this storm will most likely result in tragedy somewhere in the commonwealth,” he said.
Padfield noted vehicle crashes, house fires from improvised heating sources and stress on heating systems and carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use during power outages are common causes of injury and death in winter weather.
He urged Pennsylvanians to be prepared for themselves and their families, check on neighbors and relatives and look out for their communities. Padfield noted little things, such as ensuring fire hydrants are cleared of snow, can save crucial minutes in an emergency.
Pennsylvanians looking for guidance on how to prepare for weather emergencies should visit ready.pa.gov, he said.
Carroll noted that while the storm is not expected to meet the National Weather Service’s criteria for blizzard conditions, conditions Sunday will be blizzard-like. He urged people to stay at home and not drive. If travel is unavoidable, motorists should visit www.511PA.com to check road conditions. The site also shows the location of snow plows, he said.
In addition to interstate highways, the Pennsylvania Turnpike and its extensions, the following roads are covered by the travel restriction:

The bill would also ban camping and “symbolic” tents from overnight use on state property. It would allow the state to hold tents or other items left on state property in violation of the code for up to 90 days. 
Idaho state legislator Bruce Skaug (Courtesy of the Idaho Legislature)
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, introduced the bill Friday in the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee. 
He said the bill “enhances that security” provided by the Department of Administration and state police. 
If passed by the Legislature and approved by the governor, the bill would allow individuals to be banned from Capitol and Supreme Court buildings for one year, if the person: 

Refused to comply with lawful orders of government officials or law enforcement
Violated one or more laws, rules, more regulations governing conduct in those buildings
Threatened to or disrupted conduct of “legitimate government business,” or,   
Threatened the safety of people or the property 

The determination of whether to ban someone could be made at “the sole discretion” of the director of the administration department or ISP, or their designees. 
If someone was banned, they would need to contact the Department of Administration security office if they have “legitimate business” to conduct on the property they are banned from. Those who violate the ban would be charged with criminal trespass. 
The ban on symbolic tents would mean that any tents or other “enclosed structures” would need to be removed from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., unless other rules are created by the Department of Administration. 
In 2022, a large encampment was erected near the state Capitol in Boise to raise awareness about challenges related to homelessness. Gov. Brad Little and then-attorney general Lawrence Wasden sued to remove the protesters, BoiseDev reported. 
In 2025, the Legislature passed a bill criminalizing sleeping outside or in cars on public property in large cities. 
Under Skaug’s bill, camping would be banned outright. The legislation’s definition of camping includes erecting tents or other enclosed structures as a “temporary or permanent place of dwelling, lodging, residence, or living accommodation.” The ban may include storage of personal items, food, cooking, sleeping or laying out a sleeping bag or blanket. 
The code would allow non-enclosed shelters, such as a canopy without side walls, to be erected “as long as it is not used for sleeping or camping.” 
Anything left unattended on state property in violation of these regulations would be subject to the agency taking those items and holding them for up to 90 days. The agency could charge a “reasonable storage fee” when the person comes to claim their items. 
The committee on Friday voted to introduce the bill Friday with no discussion. Its introduction means the bill may come back to the committee for a public hearing and vote.

But the head of the association for Iowa’s private colleges and universities says the institutions can make their own decisions.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, sent a letter to leaders at Iowa’s private universities Thursday urging them to require three-semester-hour courses in American history and government for all students — a change he is trying to make law for public institutions.
“For too long, we have seen a gradual erosion of foundational knowledge about our nation’s history, its founding principles, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship,” Collins said in the letter. “Restoring a robust understanding of American history and civics is essential not only in producing informed citizens, but also to fulfilling the mission of a true liberal arts education.”

Legislation has moved out of subcommittee in both the Iowa Senate and House of Representatives that would require universities governed by the Iowa Board of Regents to include American history and government courses in their general education criteria.
Described in a press release sent out with the letter as “forthcoming law,” Collins said in the letter that when state universities adopt these rules, the state’s community college system will “develop parallel courses that satisfy the same requirements” to ensure a seamless transfer of credits.
Private universities are not included in the bill, but Collins said in the letter having them align their requirements would “preserve maximum flexibility for students who transfer between the many institutions of higher education in our state.” He added that he and his staff are ready to begin discussions on the topic with university faculty, provosts and other “stakeholders.”
Iowa Association of Independent Colleges and Universities President Gary Steinke commended Collins for leaving private universities out of the general education requirements legislation, saying their curriculum “is the sole responsibility of each of our private institutions and nobody else’s.”
Most of Iowa’s private institutions are already having students participate in civic learning in one way or another, Steinke said, often implemented as community engagement and volunteering opportunities.
“Do you have to offer curriculum, and do students have to take classes in American history in order to learn what a great country this is? No, you don’t need to take classes to do that,” Steinke said. “And it’s oftentimes better if you don’t.”

Burlington’s Howard Center intends to shut down its sterile syringe distribution program, and the services surrounding it, this summer, according to a letter from its CEO and confirmed by the Health Department.
The Safe Recovery Program is one arm of the substance use treatment, mental health treatment, and developmental disabilities services that the Burlington nonprofit offers. The program provides people with free, sterile needles to prevent the spread of blood-borne disease. It also offers narcan, drug testing strips, overdose prevention training, and linkages to care management. The Safe Recovery Program also hosts a clinic, offers Hepatitis A/B vaccination and testing, as well as medications for opioid use disorder. They provide counseling and care management.
All of these programs are set to shutter this summer, when the Howard Center’s current contract for the syringe services program with the Vermont Agency of Human Services ends on June 30. The center will continue offering its other services for mental health care, developmental disabilities services and substance use treatment.

“This decision is not a reflection of the importance or effectiveness” of syringe services programs, Howard Center CEO Sandra McGuire wrote in an email Thursday to Chittenden County lawmakers and Burlington city officials. “Rather, it reflects Howard Center’s need to steward our limited resources in those areas where Howard Center is best positioned to make a significant impact in the future.” 
Six employees will be affected by the closure, but offered other positions within the Howard Center to avoid layoffs, according to Katherine Levasseur, a spokesperson for the center.
The nonprofit center is the state’s designated agency for mental health and developmental disability services in Chittenden County — meaning it receives state funds to coordinate this care locally. But it has faced consistent challenges with the high costs of staffing and operating its other programs that support people with mental health challenges and substance use disorders. 
In July, the center announced it would cut over 50 staff roles and tighten some programming, citing years of multimillion dollar operating deficits. 
The syringe service program has been controversial in Burlington, with many neighbors concerned about how many syringes end up as litter and not properly discarded or returned to the center. 
The Howard Canter and the Vermont Department of Health reaffirmed they are working to transition the syringe service program to other providers. 
“Ensuring access to these services and a responsible transition for the people who rely on them is extremely important to us,” McGuire wrote in her Thursday email, citing that the center has been working with for “several months” to continue the service elsewhere.  
The state said it learned of the Howard Center’s intention not to renew its contract on Wednesday. 
Kyle Casteel, a spokesperson for the department, said that the Health Department will continue working internally and with other community providers to prevent any interruption in local access to these services that fell under the Howard Center Safe Recovery Program. 
The state provides Syringe Service Program funding to three other organizations in Vermont, including Vermont Cares, which already operates some mobile services in parts of Chittenden County.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-23 22:49:38+00:00,Mississippi Today,AMA recap: School choice debate heats up,Mississippi Today,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/23/ama-recap-school-choice/,Mississippi Today education reporter Devna Bose (left) and political reporter Michael Goldberg answered readers' questions about school choice online.,"The state Legislature kicked off its current session with a heavy focus on school choice, or expanding K-12 options beyond traditional public schools. 
Those conversations, and related policies, address a broad swath of policies such as expanding charter school accessibility and using public funds to pay for private-school tuition. Both chambers want to expand school choice in Mississippi over the next three months, but they don’t agree on how. 
Mississippi Today education reporter Devna Bose and political reporter Michael Goldberg have been at the state Capitol reporting on those and other education policy discussions since the session began. 
On Jan. 16, Bose and Goldberg answered questions from readers on Reddit and Facebook. The following are some highlights from those conversations.

Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: We were promised that charter schools would thrive where districts were performing poorly. How have charter schools scored over the last few years compared to the public schools near them?
Click for the answer.
The latest state accountability scores show that six out of seven of Mississippi’s charter schools that were graded this past year are rated a D or F. But all of the state’s charter schools are located in the Jackson metro area or the Delta — areas with economically disadvantaged populations and adverse socioeconomic conditions. Charter school leaders say they struggle for the same reasons the local public school districts struggle. 
Experts who met with the Mississippi Legislature last year said the most robust and successful charter sectors are well funded and less limited than they are in Mississippi. Current state law only allows new charter schools in areas where the local public school district is rated a D or F. Those experts encouraged lawmakers to loosen charter regulations, but the Senate appeared hesitant to do so when the state’s current charter schools are rated poorly.  — Devna

Q: Why are lawmakers singling out Copiah County School District and Hazlehurst City School District, and FORCING a school board consolidation?
Click for the answer.
I can’t say why these specific districts are targeted in House Bill 2. Hazlehurst is a C-rated district and Copiah is a B-rated district. House Education Chairman Rob Roberson told us that the consolidation proposal could be used as a model for future district consolidations. The House may want to test the waters with these districts before considering wider reaching consolidation measures in the future.  
The potential for school closures as a result of district consolidation has been a fear cited by many parents in rural areas. HB 2 would not require school closures even if the districts that govern these schools are abolished. — Michael

Q: Will private schools be required to accept all students who want to attend? Will private schools have public financial reports so taxpayers can see where their money is going?
Click for the answer.
No, even if they accept the public dollars, private schools will not be required to accept all students. Very little will change about the way private schools conduct business under this program. 
But lawmakers have expressed concern about the House education savings account program’s price tag after reviewing what happened when similar programs in other states ballooned in participation and costs. That’s why, House leaders say, they’ve capped the program at 12,500 students in the first year, and there’s a slow rollout every year after that. — Devna

Q: How are private schools that receive funding originally allocated to public schools going to be held accountable? Why are they not held to the same methods (state tests and accountability model) that public schools use?
Click for the answer.
Proponents of HB 2 have acknowledged that private schools would not be subject to the same accountability standards as public schools even though this bill would send taxpayer dollars to private schools. That was the central criticism of the bill during the House debate on Jan. 15. This element of the legislation raises questions about whether some private schools might end up maintaining poor standards on the public’s dime.
But the bill’s supporters argue parents offer sufficient accountability. They contend that if a private school performs poorly, families can withdraw their children and take their funding elsewhere, creating market pressure that will force private schools to maintain high standards. — Michael

Q: Is HB 2, the House’s school choice bill, constitutional?
Click for the answer.
Parents for Public Schools previously sued the state over sending public dollars to private schools, but the Mississippi Supreme Court didn’t make a decision about the law’s constitutionality. Instead, the court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue.
So, it’s possible that this could go to the Supreme Court again if someone sues. I’m not sure who would have the right to sue, but the defendants would almost certainly argue that these funds aren’t appropriated directly to private schools, they’re given to parents.
Rep. Jansen Owen told me: “We believe it will pass constitutional muster in both state and federal court.” — Devna",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23162022/School-Choice-AMA.jpg,,,2026-01-23 17:56:54.599985

(Photo by Jason Post/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)I live along the Yukon River, where my family has harvested salmon for countless generations. Every summer used to bring the same reassuring sight: Busy fish camps. Full smokehouses. Families coming together to pass down traditions that have thrived for thousands of years. Happy kids, curious babies, loving grandparents, moms, dads, aunties, uncles and cousins. Each is an intrinsic part of a beautiful summer day at the smokehouse. 
Today, summers mean less time on the river, empty smokehouses and fish camps, and no intergenerational learning. The State of Alaska tells my community and over 50 other Indigenous communities in Alaska and Canada that we are the ones who must stop fishing, we are the ones who must sacrifice, we are the ones who must somehow bear the burden of a crisis we did not create. 
Salmon were the living thread binding generations. Now, they’re a precious memory, one my youngest child has yet to experience. How can this be?
Over the past three decades, by NOAA’s own data, more than one million Chinook and many millions of chum salmon have been killed and discarded as bycatch in the pollock trawl fishery. According to the best available genetic information, at least 114,000 Chinook salmon and 615,000 chum salmon from Western and Interior Alaska rivers – including the Yukon – were part of this bycatch in the past 15 years alone. 
At the same time, runs of Chinook and chum in the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Norton Sound and even historically abundant Bristol Bay tributaries have collapsed. Early numbers from 2025 show no meaningful recovery: Yukon Chinook remain at record lows, chum returns again failed to meet escapement goals and food insecurity is rising sharply.
Our true wealth and health is a freezer of dry fish, half dry, whole fish. Every single part of the salmon holds value and meets the traditional dietary needs of thousands of families and Elders. From the tail to the head, every part is carefully taken care of, eaten, shared, and put away for the harshest and most extreme temperatures. 
Decades of unmanaged and discarded salmon have impacted so many families. People in my region now rely on food aid in places where salmon once filled every smokehouse. Elders can no longer teach their grandchildren what was taught to them. Families are forced to choose between buying expensive store food — if they can afford it — or leaving the region entirely. 
This is an ecological crisis, a cultural trauma, an economic emergency and a public-health disaster. Entire communities — especially Alaska Native villages whose identities are inseparable from salmon — are being pushed to the brink of extinction right alongside the fish.
Yet the State of Alaska and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council act as if nothing is wrong. They hide behind bureaucratic language and point to other agencies or factors as the problem, avoiding responsibility and accountability. They talk about draggers’ bycatch as a percentage of the total of millions of tons of catch, echoing trawl industry talking points that minimize the fact that a small percentage of an enormous number is, cumulatively, an enormous number. 
They ignore what Indigenous people have been saying for decades: when runs are this low, every salmon matters. Beyond that, every egg matters. When escapements fail year after year, entire age classes disappear, and the very survival of a species hangs in the balance, bycatch could be the difference between recovery and collapse.
The State controls most in-river management through the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Alaska’s Governor controls the majority of appointments to the Council — the very body shaping offshore rules. This is not a divided system. It is the choice of the State Administration to, with one hand, give trawlers a permission slip to kill hundreds of thousands of salmon offshore, while the other hand closes our subsistence fisheries and criminalizes us for feeding our families. 
On the Yukon River, the State of Alaska and Government of Canada forced a seven-year moratorium and ambitious escapement goal for Chinook salmon. The in-season fall chum salmon run estimates have been below the minimum drainage-wide escapement goal that does not support mainstem subsistence harvest. We have absolutely no subsistence salmon fishing opportunities.
Hard bycatch limits and adherence to subsistence law could help us save our salmon. Our lives depend on the science of Indigenous knowledge — and putting our right to fish above corporate profits.
Our salmon are being pushed toward extirpation. And so are we.

James Townsend (R-Artesia) in his Roundhouse office, pictured Jan. 22, 2026. Townsend is asking the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene as the New Mexico Legislature considers prohibiting public entities from contracting with ICE. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A Republican New Mexico senator announced Friday he asked U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and the federal Department of Justice to “engage” or “intervene” in New Mexico as the Legislature moves toward passing a bill prohibiting public entities from contracting with federal agencies for immigrant detention. 
Sen. James Townsend (R-Artesia) posted a letter on Facebook he said he sent Thursday to the USDOJ. It says House Bill 9, aka the “Immigrant Safety Act,” “raises serious constitutional concerns,” particularly in light of a recent federal Court of Appeals ruling involving CoreCivic, which also operates two detention centers in New Mexico.
In that case, CoreCivic sued New Jersey over a 2021 law that company lawyers said improperly banned CoreCivic from renewing a contract with ICE to house detainees. 
NM House committee advances bill to ban immigrant detention in NM

In July, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the state cannot ban private companies from contracting with the federal government to detain immigrants. Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote in the majority opinion that the law effectively seeks to regulate the federal government and to prevent the federal government from carrying out a core function.
Townsend’s letter said HB9 in New Mexico presents “materially similar issues” as the overturned New Jersey law and says the New Mexico bill’s “practical effect would be to foreclose federally authorized immigration detention contracting within New Mexico.”
Two of the bill’s sponsors, Reps. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) and Eleanor Chavez (D-Albuquerque), did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Neither did Becca Sheff, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who defended the bill during a contentious debate Thursday before a House committee.
But Sheff responded to a similar argument from HB9 opponents during the hearing Thursday, saying that the New Jersey and New Mexico laws are different. The court’s ruling, she said, applies only to the part of the New Jersey law that sought to “directly regulate contracts between private companies and ICE.” 
NM governor will include proposed ban on immigrant detention on legislative agenda

It would not apply in New Mexico, she said, because the bill seeks only to prohibit public entities, like counties, from cooperating. Three New Mexico counties are currently entered into “intergovernmental service agreements” between ICE and private prison companies, agreements the “Immigrant Safety Act” would render illegal. 
The bill, if passed, would not affect private companies’ ability to contract directly with ICE, supporters say. In fact, the chair of the Torrance County Commission, one of the three counties that contracts with ICE, previously told Source New Mexico that his best guess is that ICE and CoreCivic will contract directly should HB9 pass. 
The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee passed the bill Thursday after several hours of debate. Majority Democrats in both chambers have said they expect the Legislature to quickly send it to the governor for consideration.

After a weekend of projected extreme cold temperatures, Vermont is expected to be hit with heavy snowfall as a massive winter storm rolls over the state.
The National Weather Service is predicting between 8 inches of snow in the north part of the state and 12 to 18 inches in south and central Vermont. Temperatures are expected to drop to well below zero over the weekend and snow storms are predicted to last from Sunday until early morning Tuesday.
“Every truck that we have with a plow and a wing … will be deployed for this storm,” Greg Smith, a district transportation administrator for the Vermont Agency of Transportation, said of the state’s snow removal fleet.
“There won’t be any trucks sitting.”
Temperatures are anticipated to drop Friday night as an arctic front crosses over the state, with wind chills expected to be as low as minus 40 degrees in some areas, per the weather service forecasts. 
But as soon as Vermonters get a slight respite from the subzero temperature on Sunday, the top edge of a massive winter storm that stretches from Texas through the Carolinas and up to Maine will bring the largest snowfall of the season, according to Scott Whittier, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Burlington.
While the snowfall is not anticipated to set any records for Vermont, it will be the largest of the last few seasons, according to Whittier. Whittier has not seen a multistate winter storm of this magnitude hit Vermont in quite some time, he said. 
The weather service has already issued an extreme cold advisory for all of Vermont, and Whittier expects that a winter storm warning and an advisory to drivers to limit travel is likely to be issued for Sunday and Monday. 
Vermont’s unhoused and unsheltered population is most imminently at risk as temperatures drop, according to officials. Emergency shelters and warming centers began mobilizing earlier this week. 
Eric Forand, Vermont Emergency Management director with the Department of Public Safety, said he and his staff have already begun coordinating efforts to set up emergency shelters across the state, focusing on informing vulnerable people of shelter locations. Forand recommended that residents prepare their home heating sources for the extended cold snap and asked that neighbors check in on elderly community members.  
Vermont travelers should expect significant snow on the roads Monday, according to Smith. The Vermont Agency of Transportation will prioritize snow removal on major highways and travel arteries throughout the state, Smith said. 
Smith urged people to limit their travel during the snowstorm, but if needed, to travel at lower speeds and stay clear of snow plows. He added that if a traveler does become stranded, they should stay in their vehicle and call emergency services rather than venturing into the cold. 
Vermont State Police also announced on Friday that troopers will conduct overnight “freeze patrols” on highways over the weekend to look for stranded motorists.
Meanwhile, Smith feels his crew is ready.
“We’re doing everything we can, pulling out all the stops,” Smith said. “But that’s pretty typical for us.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)On the heels of a record-breaking influx of new legislation in 2025, a new bill would limit how many bills individual lawmakers can ask the Idaho Legislature’s research arm to draft. 
The Senate State Affairs Committee on Friday introduced a resolution that would cap lawmakers’ requests to 10 finished pieces of draft legislation from the Legislative Services Office each year. The bill’s sponsor Sen. Jim Guthrie, a Republican from McCammon who chairs the committee, said the limit was not requested by the Idaho Legislative Services Office, which drafts bills for lawmakers.
 

 Number of pieces of legislation prepared for legislators or committees

2025: 1,378
2024: 1,234

2022: 1,046
2021: 1,226
2020: 1,053
Source: 2025 Idaho Sine Die report



Senate Concurrent Resolution 114’s statement of purpose says the number of bills legislators have brought in recent years “has ascended to problematic levels,” which “creates logjams for bill drafters and has placed unreasonable expectations on that critical human resource.”
To pass, the resolution would need to pass both the Idaho House and Senate with at least two-thirds support. If it succeeds, it would establish a new joint rule for both chambers of the Legislature. 
Here’s how the proposed rule would work:

Each year, from July 1 to June 30, legislators could ask the Legislative Services Office for a maximum of 25 pieces of draft legislation and 10 completed routing slips, or RS for short. Those are the final forms of draft legislation before they are officially introduced for consideration and become available for the public to see.
Legislation revised in the drafting process would count as one piece of draft legislation.
Several exceptions would apply to: Budget bills, amendments, trailer bills that are essentially add-ons to other bills, bills brought by interim committees, and when exceptions are granted for lawmakers by the leader of their legislative chamber.

In the first week of this year’s legislative session, the Legislative Services Office prepared 179 draft pieces of legislation — more than the first week of every legislative session since 2021, according to the Legislative Services Office’s weekly progress report. But only eight bills had been officially introduced in the first week of this year’s legislative session.
The resolution capping draft legislation requests could return for a full public hearing in a Senate committee in the coming days or weeks, before it would go for a vote in the Senate.

Hope currently represents the district covering South Lansing and Delhi Township, and was previously a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners. It is a fairly safe Democratic district that at present doesn’t have any declared contenders to take up Hope’s mantle or a Republican in the race for 2026.
The representative, in a statement issued Friday afternoon, said her decision was based on careful consideration and to focus more on her health.
“I am proud of what I have accomplished in elected office, including leading on legislation to ban child marriage; protect women’s health and expand access to care; improve outcomes for young people in the juvenile justice system; and make it easier for people to protect their rights,” Hope said. “I am also pleased to have been part of broader efforts to reduce gun violence, protect civil rights, and provide every K-12 public school student with free breakfast and lunch. And it has been gratifying to see state investments that I supported in public safety, housing, and education improve life for district residents.”
Michigan Advance asked if there were any declared contenders running for the seat prior to her announcement. She said in a text message that the district was a safe seat for Democrats by a wide margin, but was unaware of anyone — on either side of the aisle — who was stepping up to succeed her.

Earlier this week, attorneys for the secretary of state’s office filed a motion requesting that Georgia’s case be dismissed, arguing that the Justice Department had exceeded its authority in requesting the records, that it lacked the jurisdiction to sue and that the Macon-based court in which the case was filed was the wrong venue.
In Friday’s ruling, Judge C. Ashley Royal sided with the secretary of state, writing in his order that the Macon-based court lacked jurisdiction over the case “because the Attorney General’s demand was not made, and the demanded records are not located, in the Middle District of Georgia.”
Raffensperger had previously sent Justice Department officials some of the state’s voter registration data, but he argued that state law prohibited his office from divulging the Social Security numbers, full dates of birth and driver’s license numbers of Georgia residents. He also maintained that stance in the face of an escalating pressure campaign from some state lawmakers and members of Georgia’s State Election Board urging him to turn over the data.
Raffensperger rebuffs pressure campaign to hand over sensitive voter data to feds

In a statement following the case’s dismissal, Raffensperger, a Republican who is running for Georgia governor, said he is committed to protecting voters’ personal information.
“I will always follow the law and follow the Constitution,” he said in a statement. “I refuse to violate the oath I took to stand up for the people of this state, regardless of who or what compels me to do otherwise.”
The ACLU of Georgia, which was representing nonprofit government watchdog group Common Cause Georgia in their motion to intervene, also celebrated the judge’s ruling.
“We’re relieved that the court has stopped the Trump administration’s current attempt to access Georgia voters’ private information, and we hope this illegal effort will now end,” said ACLU of Georgia Legal Director Cory Isaacson. “Georgians are entitled to confidentiality in their personal data and to trust in the voting process, and we will fight to protect those rights if threatened again.”
The U.S. Department of Justice attorney on the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment, or to questions about whether the Justice Department plans to re-file their complaint in the Northern District of Georgia.
Georgia is among at least 44 states who have received requests from the Justice Department for their complete voter data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking the requests. It is also among the 24 states that the Brennan Center says are currently facing lawsuits for refusing to turn over all the requested data, which includes voters’ names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. 
In September, the Trump administration confirmed that the Department of Justice is also sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 22:03:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"Amid child care crisis, CT tries new source of funding: employers",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/tri-share-pilot-new-london-ct/,Advocates framed the Tri-Share model as an investment for CT employers to improve child care affordability while boosting retention and more.,"Two years ago, Connecticut legislators backed a novel idea: making the cost of child care more affordable by encouraging employers to help pay for it. 
They designed a pilot program for New London County to test a model known as “Tri-Share”, a cost-sharing program that evenly splits child care costs among three groups: employers who volunteer to participate, eligible employees of those companies and the state. 
The program, part of a larger $100 million dollar initiative to support state early education programs, received $1.8 million in federal pandemic relief funds to support the effort. 
The Connecticut pilot is still in the early stages, but businesses in New London County got significant updates this week at an event hosted by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. 
The model has spread to a number of states in recent years as officials try to address the ongoing child care crisis, an issue that threatens to leave a $329 billion hole in the national economy over the next decade and costs Connecticut an estimated $1.5 billion a year. 
Alongside speakers from the state and LEARN, the local organization helping to coordinate the pilot, child care advocates framed the Tri-Share model as a smart financial investment for Connecticut employers, enabling them to help address child care affordability for working families, while boosting employee retention, increasing productivity and improving recruitment. 
“It’s important to look at this when you’re talking about wages or scheduling,” said Elle-Jordyn Sherman, the executive director of the Northeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce.  “It’s truly like infrastructure.” 
But the program’s success is largely dependent on how many people, both employers and employees, are willing to actually use it. And that will require an increase in both awareness of Tri-Share and adoption of the program. 
A new tool for employee recruitment and retention
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, families should spend no more than 7% of their income on child care. 
Most families in Connecticut are spending far more than that.
Data on child care affordability in the state put costs at anywhere from $14,000 to $20,000 a year, with the exact cost changing depending on things like the age of the child, the amount of time they need care and the type of care a family enrolls in.
The Tri-Share model allows a family’s contribution to shrink by two-thirds. The program is largely targeted at moderate- and middle-income households in Connecticut. Employees who are enrolled in other state child care subsidies, like the Care 4 Kids program, cannot use Tri-Share.
Cost sharing, advocates said, gives both employers and employees flexibility in the process. Employees are able to select the child care provider. 
Employers, meanwhile, can set the specific amount and duration of their contributions to an employee’s child care. Speakers at the CBIA event encouraged New London employers to set their specific programs up in a way that will minimize disruptions to employees and will keep them from sudden financial shocks. 
“There was definitely a huge appreciation from so many employees” who have entered the pilot, said Adrenna Paolillo, the assistant director of early childhood education at LEARN, the educational service center tasked with administering the pilot program and managing the paperwork for local employers and employees. 
“Their children were in a place that they felt comfortable, employees were in a place that found comfortable, and then in turn, they’re hopefully being a really productive employee.”
That is especially important in New London County, where ALICE families — an acronym for households that are asset-limited, income constrained, and employed — are spending close to a third of their salaries on child care. 
“If your employees are paying upwards of 27% of their income, that’s not health care, that’s not food, it’s not housing,” said Kathleen Hollister, the facilitator of the SECT Childcare Collective, a 40-organization collective housed in the United Way of Southeastern Connecticut. “I think that just reinforces this whole need for flexibility to understand that this is what people are experiencing in our community.”
So far, the earliest adopters of the pilot program have, ironically, been child care providers themselves. These providers usually already offer child care subsidies and discounts to their employees, lowering the costs for their children in exchange for their work. Adopting the Tri-Share model allows those providers to pay even less. 
“It saved us money as an employer,” said Linda Fecteau, a business advisor for child care programs and the founder of her own early childhood education business. “It’s really been very helpful for the staff members and as a recruiting and retention tool.”
So far, the pilot program is still in the process of drawing in new employers. In November, submarine manufacturer Electric Boat announced that it would enter the Tri-Share pilot to help employees as the company launches an ambitious expansion effort in the state. 
Tri-Share is gaining national support — and criticism
The Tri-Share model, supporters say, gives businesses the ability to directly assist their employees by helping share a significant expense. In this framework, child care costs are treated much like other employee benefits like a flexible spending account or health care. And similarly to those benefits, employers hope that offering child care support can increase employee loyalty and productivity. 
The model, which first drew attention in Michigan after the state launched a pilot in 2021, is becoming a popular initiative in states looking to address child care gaps in ways that reduce the amount state governments need to invest. Close to a dozen states, including West Virginia, Ohio and New York, have launched full programs or are currently running pilots.
There’s federal interest in the concept as well: members of Michigan’s congressional delegation introduced a bill that would create a federal Tri-Share pilot late last year. 
But the Connecticut pilot, which expects its $1.8 million in funding to last through 2027, faces some visibility challenges as the program gets underway. Around 150 families are currently enrolled, according to LEARN. One of the biggest issues highlighted at the CBIA event was the need to make more employers aware of the fact that the pilot even exists. 
And there’s still a question of exactly how the program will scale and what types of employers will embrace the model. 
Some child care advocates in the state have also voiced concerns that Tri-Share, while making costs affordable for employees working at participating companies, does not increase the number of child care providers in the state and is also unlikely to help many of Connecticut’s lower-income residents. The program also doesn’t address the state’s shrinking child care workforce, which urgently needs more workers.
Some of these criticisms have been echoed nationally, with policy organizations noting that while the Tri-Share model has an obvious impact on affordability for working families, the program is not structured to address a more fundamental issue: supply. 
And on a deeper level, there is a worry that an overreliance on Tri-Share will shift responsibility for addressing the child care crisis from policymakers onto the private market, forcing people to rely on their employers to maintain access to affordable child care.  
“I’ve never been really excited about the idea,” said Merrill Gay, the executive director of the Connecticut Early Childhood Alliance. “If I’ve got my kids in a child care program, and then either my employer downsizes or I’d rather work for somebody else, I now lose the subsidy that made it possible for me to pay for the child care program where my kid is comfortable.”
“It’s not my preference on how we do things,” he added. 
In an interview, Gay said that he is currently focused on shoring up the Care 4 Kids program for low-income families, which is currently dealing with a significant waitlist, and monitoring Connecticut’s new Early Childhood Education Endowment, which will be used to expand funding for various state programs. 
“We’ve been much more focused on efforts that will serve more families and focus on the families who are most in need of care,” he said, noting that the state’s lowest income families will not benefit from Tri-Share.  
That reality was acknowledged at this week’s event, with participants noting that Tri-Share is far from a singular solution that can fix the range of issues driving child care needs in the state. CBIA has also acknowledged that Tri-Share isn’t the only way businesses can help employees struggling with child care costs, noting that employers could explore flexible and remote work options, on-site child care, and stipend programs to help. 
But at a moment where state funding must address a variety of child care system crises, and a lack of affordable child care continues to impact the workforce, advocates say the model is still worth trying.
“The issues related to child care are complex, and no one organization can fix it,” said Hollister. “This is a situation where everyone needs to come to the table and see what role they can play, what part they can play.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2824-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 17:56:54.599985

As part of that same case, the U.S. Department of Justice is objecting to what it views as a request for sanctions against an Omaha-based immigration judge who once worked for Homeland Security and now denies claims for asylum at a much higher rate than her colleagues around the nation.
The case involves the asylum claim of 25-year-old Philander Dambreville of Urbandale, a native of Haiti who has been in the United States since January 2024.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
As part of what the U.S. Department of Justice calls a “routine screening” of Iowa jail inmates to locate potential deportees, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials encountered Dambreville in the Polk County Jail on Nov. 18, 2025.
At the time, Dambreville was facing misdemeanor charges of public intoxication and interference with official acts, stemming from his arrest outside an Urbandale apartment building where police were responding to a disturbance.
Dambreville ultimately pleaded guilty to a public intoxication charge, and the interference charge was dismissed. Before he was released from jail, however, ICE officials determined he was in the United States without authorization and issued an “immigration detainer” on him, essentially holding him in the county jail indefinitely while the Department of Homeland Security initiated deportation proceedings.
Days later, in immigration court, Dambreville was denied a bond hearing at which he could have argued for release while his request for asylum was processed. That denial was based on the Trump administration’s position, adopted last summer, that federal law mandates the detention of all individuals suspected of having entered the country illegally, even if they’ve been living and working in the United States for years or decades.
Dambreville’s lawyer, Jessica Donels, took Homeland Security, the Omaha Immigration Court and the Polk County Jail to U.S. District Court over the matter, arguing that the federal government was denying her client his due process rights and that “without relief from this court, Mr. Dambreville faces months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his family and his community.”
Since July 2025, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected the government’s argument, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.
Even so, Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to use that interpretation of the law to argue for mandatory detention. Immigration judges — who are not part of the Judicial Branch and instead function as administrative employees of the Executive Branch led by the president – are continuing to deny detainees bond hearings unless otherwise ordered by a federal judge in U.S. District Court.
Bond hearing questioned by attorney
On Jan. 12, Chief District Judge Stephanie M. Rose issued a ruling ordering the federal government and the immigration court to provide Dambreville with a bond hearing.
Court records show the bond hearing was held on Jan. 14 before Immigration Judge Alexandra Larsen. At the hearing, Department of Justice lawyers argued Dambreville was a danger to the community, citing his November arrest, and that he posed a flight risk.
According to court filings by Dambreville’s attorney, Larsen questioned why the government shouldered the burden of proof in arguing against Dambreville’s release, and then, without detailing the underlying rationale for her decision, said, in effect, “Whoever has the burden of proof, I find that Mr. Dambreville is a risk of flight and a danger to the community.”
That ruling resulted in Donels, Dambreville’s lawyer, going back to U.S. District Court where she recently filed papers seeking to have the government held in contempt for failing to comply with Rose’s order by denying Dambreville his due process rights during the bond hearing.
Larsen, Donels argues, didn’t articulate how the government had met its burden of proof in concluding Dambreville posed a flight risk and threat to the public. She is now seeking sanctions against the federal government in the form of payment of Dambreville’s legal fees.
DOJ opposes a ‘monetary sanction on the judge’
The Department of Justice is fighting back, arguing that Donels is seeking to hold Homeland Security and ICE in contempt for the decision-making of an independent immigration judge.
“The immigration judge fully complied with this court’s order,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Peyton Gaumer argued in court papers filed Friday. “The immigration judge is not required to document in her written decision the burden of proof.”
Gaumer also suggested Donels’ contempt motion was aimed at Larsen, adding that Donels had cited “no authority in support of the remarkable proposition that a U.S. District Court may hold an immigration judge in contempt of court and impose a monetary sanction on the judge.”
If, Gaumer argued, Donels is seeking only to hold Homeland Security and ICE in contempt, she has failed to show how those agencies’ actions resulted in Larsen’s denial of bond for Dambreville.
Gaumer went on to argue that Dambreville is, as the judge ruled, a danger to the community and a flight risk. Dambreville, he told the court, “has only been in the United States a relatively short time, around two years. He is unemployed. He has no assets. He is not married and has no children.”
Judge once worked for ICE and Homeland Security
Prior to becoming an immigration judge in 2019, Larsen served as assistant chief counsel in the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor for ICE and Homeland Security, according to the TRAC, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research center affiliated with Syracuse University.
From 2011 to 2012, she served as deputy chief and chief of Office of the Principal Legal Advisor in the District Court Litigation Division of ICE and Homeland Security. Prior to that, she served an associate legal advisor for the ICE and Homeland Security.
According to data compiled by TRAC, Larsen has denied asylum in 89.6% of the cases that have come before her, while immigration judges nationally denied 58.9% of asylum claims over the same time period.
In 2024, the ACLU of Nebraska issued a report, Courting Disaster, detailing a list of concerns with immigration court practices in Omaha by Larsen and others.
The report cited the three-minute duration of many immigration court hearings, judges’ repeated failure to advise people of their rights, and the high number of cases handled without attorney representation.
Recently, the federal government’s firing of immigration judges, followed by the hiring of what it calls “deportation judges,” has come under fire, with some legal advocates suggesting the Trump administration is attempting to fill the positions based on political considerations.
The attorney for one Iowa detainee recently cited in court the federal government’s written solicitations for applicants to the position of “deportation judge.”
The solicitation states: “YOU BE THE JUDGE. Help write the next chapter of America…  DEFINE AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS… Preside over cases in federal Immigration Court and determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay. Make decisions with generational consequences… Restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

Lawmakers push for improved data collection on greenhouse gas emissions to meet statewide requirements to cut carbon

Instead of launching a shiny new climate program this year, lawmakers are looking at a more concrete means to meet legally binding goals to reduce carbon emissions: data collection. 
A proposed greenhouse gas reporting program would collect data on emissions from fuel suppliers, largely for heating and transportation, which together make up about 70% of state emissions. The Agency of Natural Resources submitted a memo in December estimating the program would cost the state $800,000 to start, and then require an annual $500,000 to pay staff and run a public website.
“That’s a lot of money anytime, and especially right now,” said Rep. Kathleen James, D-Manchester, who filed H. 740 on Wednesday and included the $800,000 budget request.

For Vermonters, the stakes are practical as well as political. Without more reliable data on where exactly emissions come from, some lawmakers lack a detailed roadmap as they debate costly climate policies that could affect home heating bills, gas prices or future taxes. Better reporting, the bill’s supporters say, could help the state avoid repeating past battles over sweeping emissions programs. 
Now, with Vermont appearing to miss its legally binding climate targets and federal support shrinking, lawmakers say credible data may lay the groundwork that bigger policy swings have lacked. 
James planned to take testimony to determine whether the budget request is a fair amount. The new program could be modeled off of neighboring New York, which launched its own program in December. 

While Vermont has taken on a host of climate proposals over the last decade, the state has so far largely failed to meet the requirements set by legislation. 
Since 2017, the state passed: a Renewable Energy Standard that requires most Vermont utilities to get 100% of their energy from renewables like solar and wind by 2030; the Global Warming Solutions Act, which binds the state to cutting greenhouse gas emissions; the Climate Superfund Act, the first program in the nation to make major carbon polluters like Chevron and Exxon pay the state for their carbon emissions.
But recent reports show the state has likely failed to meet legally binding targets for reducing carbon emissions. Legislators have failed to pass programs that could move its energy sectors closer to those goals, and the state’s GOP leadership has proposed bills that would weaken the state’s renewable energy plans. Under the second Trump administration, Vermont lost tens of millions of dollars in funding for clean energy projects on top of expensive court battles brought by the federal government against Vermont’s landmark climate policies.
“We’re on the famine side of feast or famine in the moment we find ourselves in,” Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore told the House Committee on Energy and Digital Infrastructure earlier this month. “We’ve had unprecedented federal investment in climate action, and it’s ending really abruptly. This requires some pretty significant changes in the assumptions about what financial resources are available to Vermont in terms of making investments in climate action.” 
Such shifts, plus statewide issues of affordability, have made lawmakers wary of spending on the programs needed to ensure Vermont meets its climate goals.
“In previous sessions, the legislature has taken up a clean heat standard, taken up a cap-and-invest program, and these are big, meaty policy pieces,” Moore said. “The fact of the matter is we haven’t necessarily done something smaller and more manageable in the short term.”  
A study of the potential data collection program stemmed from the 2025 Vermont Climate Action Plan, a report released every four years that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote climate resiliency in the state. The Climate Council, a 23-member body of state officials and appointed members, includes the state’s climatologist, a farmer and a high school senior. 
The plan received a strong endorsement from the vast majority of the Climate Council, whose members also backed the financial request from ANR. The exception was Matt Cota, a fuels lobbyist, who did not sign onto a letter supporting the plan. 
One of the flaws in the clean heat standard, relegated to legislative obscurity last session, was the lack of detailed data to build sound policy, James said in early January. 
“No matter what we do in the future, whether it’s cap and invest or something else, we need solid data,” she said.
Cota disagreed. 
“I am not convinced that spending $800,000 of taxpayer money on a new data collection system is essential,” Cota said Thursday. 
Tracking emissions as they move across state lines and between counties is tricky, according to Cota. County-level data would be required by the program, but he said such figures are “not information that suppliers routinely collect or can readily access.”
He also warned of redundancies.
“All gallons are already counted and reported, and this data is publicly available,” Cota said. 
Vermont already collects some fuel and emissions data, but not in a way that lets regulators clearly see who is producing how much pollution. Without detailed, enforceable reporting from fuel suppliers, the Agency of Natural Resources can’t reliably track emissions or hold specific emitters accountable — a gap that lawmakers say must be closed before the state can meet its legally binding climate targets
The Agency of Natural Resources doesn’t need the legislature’s permission to mandate such a program under the Clean Air Act, but Moore said other states that didn’t have their legislature’s endorsement to implement a greenhouse gas reporting rule had faced extensive legal challenges.
“There is benefit in the environment we currently find ourselves in having the legislature specifically authorize this work,” Moore told the committee. 
But Moore wasn’t convinced of the necessity of such a program either. 
“In the moment we currently find ourselves in, personally, I wouldn’t say this is a priority,” she said. She also noted the thin line she was trying to weave. She had been critical of programs like cap-and-invest and the clean heat standard in the past because the programs lacked such data. 
Tracking emissions data is only becoming more difficult for states like Vermont under the current administration, according to Jane Lazorchak, director of the Climate Action Office. 
“In this time of significant federal uncertainty and rollbacks in the data being collected by the Environmental Protection Agency that Vermont relies on for our greenhouse gas inventory to produce annually,” Lazorchak said in a committee meeting discussing the plan, “it would help us move in house the data collection that we now rely on from federal data sets.”

Gov. Tate Reeves on Thursday announced a state of emergency through Jan. 30 in anticipation of prolonged freezing temperatures and possible  sleet, freezing rain and ice, which were expected to begin in parts of the state Friday night and continue through next week. 
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has a list of warming shelters on its website. The agency also encourages Mississippians to prepare for the winter weather by preparing an emergency supply kit. 
Hannah Maharrey, executive director of Good Samaritan Health Services in Tupelo, said the organization has spent the last week working to ensure that unhoused people are aware of the severity of the impending storm and have a plan to seek shelter. Though the nonprofit is accustomed to communicating about severe weather in the summer, preparing for cold and ice of this magnitude is a “new experience,” she said. 
The organization has helped several people this week to obtain identification cards, a requirement for some area shelters.  
She encourages people to be proactive about seeking shelter, and for those who don’t, to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they experience health problems from the frigid temperatures. 
“Don’t wait until it’s too late,” she said. 
In Alcorn County in the northeastern corner of the state, A Place of Grace is serving hot meals three times a day and setting up accommodations for people to stay overnight at the Gospel Tabernacle Church in Corinth. Kelly Thornton, the organization’s executive director and cook, said the nonprofit is working with local emergency management services to transport people to the church, where she and others set up at least 50 cots and mattresses.

The organization is planning to continue these services until at least Feb. 2. Thornton said she expects roads to close and recommends people in the area call the organization early, at 662–287-7737, if they need transportation to the shelter. 
Thornton, who lived through the Mississippi Delta Ice Storm of 1994, said the early reports of the looming cold front feel reminiscent of it. 
“It kind of caught people unaware,” she said. “We knew something was coming. I don’t think they really predicted the magnitude of what it turned out to be.”
Roderick Gordon, the director of the North Delta Planning and Development District Area Agency on Aging, said meals originally scheduled for delivery this weekend or early next week to homebound seniors were being  distributed Friday to ensure people are prepared for the storm. 
Schelika Chisolm, who runs Salvation Army of Tupelo, said her shelter will be operating with special rules for the winter storm and the following week, during which temperatures are expected to drop below freezing. However, the food pantry will only be open during its regular hours: weekdays 9 a.m.-2 p.m.
Special rules include allowing people to stay in the shelter during the day, rather than requiring them to leave at 8 a.m. and return at 4 p.m. As of Friday afternoon, the shelter only had six beds available, out of 61. 
“We are going to provide meals and beverages, shelter, cold weather supplies like blankets, gloves and hats,” she said. 
Her team will be out in the community checking on people as soon as it’s safe to do so, Chisolm said.
“Once the roads are clear, we take our canteens (trucks) out, and we try to find those areas where maybe the lights are out, and we distribute hot meals and things of that nature,” Chisolm said. “So, that will be part of the second phase once the storm passes a little bit.”
Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer of Delta Health Center, said the county will host warming shelters at the Cleveland Expo Center and the Rosedale Courthouse. Delta Health Center has nonperishable food items available any time in drop boxes outside its Mound Bayou, Indianola, Moorehead, Hollandale, Leland, Greenville and Rolling Fork locations. 
If people would like to help A Place of Grace’s efforts, Thornton said the organization is accepting food donations to the church at 1624 Glover Drive, Corinth, Miss.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05140357/3X0A2282.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 21:44:16+00:00,CT Mirror,GOP’s Betsy McCaughey promises to eliminate CT income tax,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/betsy-mccaughey-income-tax-ct-governor/,The Betsy McCaughey campaign for governor of Connecticut opened Friday afternoon in Hartford with a New York tabloid brashness.,"The Betsy McCaughey campaign for governor of Connecticut opened Friday afternoon in Hartford with a New York tabloid brashness, offering quotable critiques of Gov. Ned Lamont, fulsome praise of Art Laffer’s supply-side economics and a recycled GOP promise to eliminate the income tax.
“Right now, Connecticut ranks 48th out of 50 in economic growth, near rock bottom. Gov. Ned Lamont — Moneybags Lamont — claims that the state’s economy is resilient,” said McCaughey, one of three Republicans running for governor. “That’s a lie. This state’s economy is almost dead.”
McCaughey, a Sunday morning host on right-wing Newsmax, shrugged off a report earlier Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that found Connecticut’s economy grew at a 5.6% annual rate in the third quarter of 2025, ranking 4th nationwide. She pointed to dismal ratings by business groups.
She was similarly unconcerned that eliminating the income tax has been a foundation of campaigns by two previous Republican gubernatorial candidates.
Eight years ago, Bob Stefanowski opened his campaign with a similar promise, albeit one made less colorfully, if with slightly more detail in a 10-page plan — and the actual presence of Laffer. Stefanowski lost to Lamont in 2018 and barely mentioned the income tax idea during their rematch in 2022.
In his successful run in 1994, Republican John G. Rowland promised to cut the income tax over five years and eventually eliminate it. Over a decade as governor, Rowland never proposed a budget that would have significantly reduced income taxes.
No matter, McCaughey said. She also would help elect a Republican legislature, flipping control of a General Assembly where Democrats currently enjoy at least 2-1 supermajorities in each chamber.
McCaughey announced her candidacy last week with a video. The press conference Friday was her first as a candidate.
As a Newsmax host, McCaughey has been a friend to President Donald Trump, whose endorsement she would welcome. McCaughey is 77, competing with former Mayor Erin Stewart, 38, of New Britain and state Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich for the GOP nomination. Lamont is 72.
McCaughey said she is confident of qualifying for a Republican primary, which requires winning 15% of the state convention vote in May, and then the GOP primary in August. In dismissing age as an issue, she borrowed from Ronald Reagan.
“They will choose a battle tested, proven fighter. I’ve got decades of experience. I’m not going to make age an issue in this race. I don’t want to belittle my opponent’s youth and inexperience,” she said, smiling.
Standing in the Legislative Office Building before a color-coded U.S. map identifying the eight states with no income tax and others taking steps to eliminate them,  McCaughey said times have changed. 
“None of them could point to a map like this, in which the other states are doing it right now,” McCaughey said. “This is an unprecedented moment in terms of the competition among states for business growth. You’ve never seen anything like this.”
McCaughey offered no specifics Friday on how the state would manage to eliminate the income tax, other than asserting that cutting taxes generates economic activity that produces more tax revenue, allowing a phase-out she would predicted would take five years. She said she would leave other tax rates in place.
She released a two-page press release that promised a panel of experts who would map out concrete steps based on actions under way in other states. It included a quote from Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform saying, “Five of those states have already passed laws that trigger income tax rate reductions down to zero as growth brings in more tax revenues.”
McCaughey’s personal and professional life long has been fodder for New Yoirk tabloids, and she was playful during the news conference and then in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror.
McCaughey was born in Pittsburgh and raised in Connecticut but came to public notice in New York in 1994 as the author of an influential and controversial critique of health care reforms Hillary Clinton was advancing on behalf of her husband’s administration.
The piece, published by The New Republic, won a National Magazine Award for “Excellence in Public Interest” in 1995, the judges stating, “More than any other single event in the debate, what she wrote stopped the bill in its intellectual tracks.”
Her analysis later came under withering fire over what critics contended were factual errors and wrong-headed conclusions, including an assertion that the plan would have prohibited doctors from accepting private payments for services. But her newfound role as influential Clinton critic won her a spot as the lieutenant governor of New York under Gov. George Pataki.
She had a falling out with Pataki, who jettisoned her from the ticket before seeking a second term. McCaughey briefly became a Democrat in a failed effort to unseat him. All appears forgiven: Pataki recently offered a statement of support for her run in Connecticut.
While she writes a column for the New York Post, the tabloid hasn’t always been kind, noting her difficulty with Pataki and her divorce from Wilbur Ross Jr., the wealthy financier who would become Trump’s commerce secretary.
“The woman who’s most famous for being dumped — first as lieutenant governor by George Pataki, then as wife by wealthy hubby Wilbur Ross — says she wants to be taken seriously in her new role as a public-policy scholar for the Hudson Institute think tank,” Amanda Peyser wrote 25 years ago in the Post.
On Friday, McCaughey said she stood by everything she wrote about health care and didn’t much care about gossip about her love life. She has married for a third time and has lived in Greenwich for a decade. 
“You know what? When you’re a romantic, you can get married a lot of times, right? I’m a romantic,” she said.
As for Trump, an endorsement would be nice, but not necessary.
“I would welcome an endorsement, but I stand on my own two feet. Donald Trump is doing everything he can for America, and I’m going to do everything I can for Connecticut,” she said.
But would she seek an endorsement? a reporter asked at the news conference.
“I don’t have to seek it, honey,” she replied.
What that means was not explained. An aide interrupted.

Oct. 10, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMichigan attorney and 2022 Republican attorney general candidate Matthew DePerno returned to court on Friday to argue whether a private investigator and a computer analyst should be admitted as witnesses in the case against him. However before the hearing had even begun the court determined that it would not make a ruling as it awaited the outcome of a separate but closely-linked case. 
DePerno was indicted in 2023 alongside former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) and attorney Stephanie Lambert Junttila following an investigation into a conspiracy to gain access to voting tabulators after the 2020 election. 
D.J. Hilson, the special prosecutor overseeing the case, alleged DePerno, Rendon and Lambert Junttila coordinated with private investigator Michael Lynch to “investigate” the 2020 election, though Lynch was not charged. 
Judge Jeffrey S. Matis of the Oakland County Circuit Court remanded DePerno and Rendon’s case to the 44th District Court in Royal Oak for a preliminary examination, where the judge reviews evidence brought by the prosecution to determine whether it is sufficient to move to trial. Lambert Junttila, however, opted to move straight to trial.

While DePerno’s attorney, Michael Cronkright, argued that Lynch, alongside Ben Cotton – who analyzed voting machines in multiple battleground states including Michigan – should be blocked from taking the stand in the case, Judge Derek Meinecke held firm that he would not be ruling on a motion to strike the witnesses until a similar motion pertaining to the same individuals is addressed by Matis in the Lambert Junttila case.
While Meinecke acknowledged that defendants must feel as if the case is in limbo, he argued it would be foolish for the court to forgo an attempt to understand the issues Matis is looking at with the same two witnesses. 
He noted that Matis would address the motion at either a hearing set for Wednesday, Jan. 28, or on Feb. 4.
“I don’t think it is a unnecessary or prejudicial delay when we’re talking about weeks, rather than months and months, to try to see if we can get some sort of guidance,” Meinecke said, after emphasizing that Lambert’s case is connected to those before him.
The next hearing in DePerno’s case is slated for 1:30 p.m. on Feb. 27, with Meinecke telling the court he intends to issue a ruling, regardless of whether the matter in the Lambert Junttila case had been decided or not. 
“There is no utility in continuing to adjourn and push and delay, because once again, the court will have been disappointed in its efforts to try to just make sure it has all the best information in making a ruling,” Meinecke said, acknowledging the many delays in the Lambert Junttila case.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6417-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

(Photo by Getty Images)A state legislative committee is intensifying scrutiny of alleged fraud involving Maine’s Medicaid program, MaineCare, following an ongoing state investigation and a new federal audit that identified $46 million in questionable payments tied to autism services.
During the Government Oversight Committee meeting on Friday, lawmakers reviewed a letter from three Republican members of the committee citing several concerns about fraudulent billing, particularly related to Portland-based health provider Gateway Community Services, and its alleged overbilling for interpreter services. The letter urged the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability (OPEGA) to open a formal investigation into the Maine Department of Health and Human Services’ handling of Medicaid funds.
After halting payments to Gateway in December, the Health Department is conducting a probe into overbilling for interpreter services. Gateway has appealed the notice of suspended payments, and the department will soon hear that appeal. But some Republican lawmakers, including those who wrote the letter, have said they want additional scrutiny on Maine DHHS, alleging that the department is not doing enough to uncover and prevent fraud.
“Based on the letter and based on the concerns that I’ve heard from people, there was fraud, people were alerted to it, and action wasn’t taken,” said Rep. Chad Perkins (R-Dover-Foxcroft) at the Friday committee meeting. “Whether that was intentionally, or whether that was from incompetence, or whatever the reason, I think that’s what the core of the issue is.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined in an audit released Thursday that the state also made more than $45 million in improper payments to several providers of autism services for children.
Federal government’s investigation into improper payments
According to that report, released by the federal health agency’s Office of the Inspector General, Maine’s Medicaid payments for rehabilitative and community support services for children diagnosed with autism increased substantially in 2023, initiating the audit. The office found that Maine’s payments for autism treatment services did not comply with federal and state requirements, and that the federal share of the improper payments was $28.7 million, which the federal government is asking Maine to refund.
The department “did not provide effective oversight” of Medicaid payments for autism treatment services, the audit found. The report notes that since the program began in 2010, the state agency has not performed a postpayment review of payments to verify that providers complied with federal and state requirements related to documentation, nor did it provide sufficient guidance to providers for documenting rehabilitative and community support services.
The state health department responded to the federal agency in a November 2025 letter agreeing to most of those findings. 
Michelle Probert, director Office of MaineCare Services, wrote at the time that prior to notification of the audit, the office’s program integrity unit “has previously identified the need to review” rehabilitative and community support services.
The federal audit required the state to conduct postpayment reviews of the services providers billed for, train them to improve documentation of those services and instate annual reviews to ensure providers have proper guidance. 
However, Probert also said the office will conduct its own reviews of the identified providers and claims to determine whether violations occurred before paying the federal government back. 
“To the extent those reviews identify overpayments, OMS will recover overpayments from providers and refund the federal share of any such overpayments,” she wrote. 
Lindsay Hammes, spokesperson for DHHS, told Maine Morning Star on Friday that the audit was part of a routine programmatic review that included multiple states, and it was not triggered by any allegation specifically against Maine.
“It should be noted that the report does not include findings or allegations of fraud,” she said. “The audit identified potential documentation and compliance issues, which the state is now reviewing. The report does not question the appropriateness or necessity of services, nor does it allege intentional wrongdoing by providers or the state.”
Gateway investigation 
Meanwhile, leaders from three different DHHS offices — including the Program Integrity Unit that is investigating Gateway — presented information last week to the Health and Human Services Committee on the most common types of Medicaid fraud, and how they investigate and recover funds.
“Maine DHHS takes allegations of fraud very seriously, and that commitment is reflected in our rigorous oversight, transparency, and coordination with law enforcement and providers,” Hammes said in a statement after the presentation. “The Department’s work is governed by a clear legal framework of audit, review, and compliance monitoring.”
The latest Gateway investigation is the third “comprehensive, multi-year audit” of the provider’s billing practices, according to Hammes. The department’s MaineCare Program Integrity Unit analyzed more than 15,000 claims Gateway had filed, and found that the Portland-based community health provider had overcharged by more than a million dollars for interpreter services. 
There were many examples throughout the review when documentation identified the patient
spoke English while charging for interpreter services, the interpreter was a family member, or the record of the patient visit (called a “progress note”) did not document that an interpreter participated in the session despite MaineCare being billed for these services, according to the department’s audit.
The audit also found instances where MaineCare had been charged for services delivered by non-qualified staff, or the scope of the service fell outside what MaineCare covers.
In a Dec. 30 press conference held by Republican lawmakers, Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matt Harrington (R-Sanford) said the department’s investigation into Gateway is “only scratching the surface” of the actual fraud going on in Maine.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/health-insurance-form-1024x6811707346143-1.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

Patrick Morrisey addresses reporters Friday, Jan. 23, 2026, ahead of a snow storm that’s expected to bring snow and ice to West Virginia over the weekend. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Ahead of a “significant snow storm” expected to hit much of the Southeast United States this weekend, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey urged residents to prepare for “very difficult weather conditions.”
“We want to make sure that you’re getting prepared for this storm and also for any of the conditions in the winter,” Morrisey said during a news conference Friday. “Also if you need help, reach out to that 211 number and get the assistance that you need. Because it’s better to be prepared than to be stuck in a really bad place.”
Morrisey said snow and ice will make travel difficult in parts of the state. 
“We know that in different parts of the state there are some forecasts for snow, it can range depending on where you are from 3 to 7 inches,” he said. “But also, importantly, there might be a line where it’s wintery snow and icy mix, and that could create a very dangerous cocktail that we want people to avoid partaking in.”
Morrisey has issued a state of preparedness for all 55 counties ahead of the storm. 
The West Virginia National Guard is on standby to assist in emergency response if needed, he said. The State Emergency Response Center will be activated and staffed as needed, he said. 
The National Weather Service in Charleston has issued a winter storm for its forecast area through Monday.  
The snow is expected to start Saturday afternoon for much of West Virginia, said James Zvolenski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Charleston. 
By Saturday night, warm air will change the snow into a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain. All of West Virginia could see a wintry mix by Sunday morning, he said. The snow will return Sunday night as colder temperatures return with an arctic air mass, he said. 
“So at first, we’re going to get a lot of heavy snow, and then it’s going to turn into a wet mess, mixed bag of wintry precips,” Zvolenski said. “And that’s going to continue, basically ensue an ice storm. We’re looking at pretty decent ice amounts over the two-day period of this whole event.”
From Saturday night to Sunday morning, ice accumulations are possible across the state, with the exception of the Northern Panhandle, he said. The state’s higher elevations will see the most ice — up to a half an inch in some localized areas, he said.
The storm will “for sure” cause “massive travel impacts” and power outages, Zvolenski said.  
“At first it’s going to be a dry, fluffy snow, and it’s going to switch over to a wet, heavy, icy conditions,” he said. “So that’s going to drop down trees and power lines for sure.”
The power outages could be particularly unfortunate in light of colder temperatures that are expected after the storm dwindles, Zvolenski said. The temperature will be in the teens on Sunday, and won’t rise above freezing on Monday, he said. Tuesday’s temperature is expected to be in the single digits, he said. 
“All this wet mess and ice and snow is going to stick around,” he said. “It’s not going to be able to melt. If you’re out of power, God forbid, it’s going to be cold. We’re going to have extreme cold warnings, most likely, for Monday night and Tuesday. 
“It’s just going to be one heck of a mess,” he said.”



Matthew Blackwood, West Virginia’s deputy director of emergency management, said residents should take the following steps to prepare for the snow storm.
“This is about our response as a government, but also about the need for neighbors to look out for neighbors and plan ahead,” Blackwood said.
Before the storm: 

Review emergency supplies including food, water, medications, flashlights, batteries and blankets.
Review backup plans for medical equipment that requires power.
Check to be sure smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors work properly.
Refill vehicle fuel and ensure approved alternative heating sources have adequate fuel and are used safely.
Bring pets indoors and include them in emergency planning.

As the storm approaches:

Fully charge cell phones, medical devices and backup power supplies.
Check trusted weather forecasts and official alerts.
Adjust travel and work plans ahead of time, avoiding unnecessary travel once conditions worsen.
Ensure you have multiple ways to receive emergency alerts (weather radios, mobile alerts, local media).
Check on family members, neighbors and anyone who may need assistance, especially older adults and those with medical needs.

During and after the storm:

Travel should be limited to essential trips only.
Use emergency heat sources only if properly ventilated. Never operate grills, generators, or fuel-burning devices indoors or near open windows. Generators must be operated outside, at least 20 feet away from homes.
Take frequent breaks when shoveling snow to avoid overexertion.
Never approach downed power lines, and report outages to utility providers.

The judges, shown in a September 2024 photo, are from left, Kelly C. Broniec, Robin Ransom, W. Brent Powell,  then-Chief Justice Mary R. Russell, Zel. M. Fischer, Paul C. Wilson and Ginger K. Gooch (Pool photo by Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch).The Missouri Supreme Court on Friday threw out a law passed last year to keep politicians in control of writing ballot summaries and give the attorney general extraordinary appeal power.
The bill was changed too much during its path through the General Assembly, Chief Justice W. Brent Powell wrote in the unanimous opinion. The changes, he wrote, violated the Missouri Constitution’s requirement that amendments should not change the original purpose of legislation.
The original bill contained one section intended to prevent the courts from rewriting ballot language for measures referred to voters by the General Assembly. By the time it was passed, it changed five sections of state law, completely revising the process for court challenges to ballot suumaries and granting the attorney general authority to appeal preliminary injunctions preventing enforcement of state laws or regulations in any field.
In arguments on Jan.7, Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Freedlund tried to convince the judges that changes to how ballot summary cases are managed are germane to the attorney general’s appeal power because the bill, from the start, was designed to amend the process for judicial review of state laws.
“This argument stretches the boundaries of logic,” Powell wrote.
The court considered allowing the changes to ballot title cases to remain in effect, which was the result when Cole County Circuit Judge Danel Green ruled in September. Green found that the original purpose of the bill had not been improperly changed but there was no legal basis for allowing the attorney general’s office to have special appeal power.
The Supreme Court considered whether the bill would have passed absent the provisions for the attorney general, Powell wrote. 
“While it remains possible the General Assembly would have passed (the law) without the amendment…this mere possibility is not enough for this court to save the non-offending provisions (the law),” he wrote.
The decision restates what lawmakers should have known when they passed the bill because what is and is not allowed procedurally has been argued repeatedly in court, attorney Chuck Hatfield said.
Hatfield represented Sean Nicholson, who sued in part because the new ballot summary process is more expensive and creates delays for ballot initiatives
“Every few years, the Supreme Court needs to remind the Legislature that they have to follow the procedural requirements of the Constitution when they pass a bill,” Hatfield said. “It’s not that hard. They need to vote on things separately.”
The ballot summary provisions of the law were written to take revisions out of the hands of the courts. In lawsuits during 2023 and early 2024, the courts rewrote the language for the abortion rights initiative petition, finding the original version written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft “replete with politically partisan language.”
Instead of a judge making changes when summaries are deemed unfair or biased, the law gave the secretary of state three chances to make revisions.
The law was used last year during a challenge to the summary of a proposal to reinstate Missouri’s almost-total ban on abortions. Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green approved a summary from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins after rejecting two previous versions, but that decision was overturned at the Western District Court of Appeals, which issued its own revision.
By throwing out the law, the judges put revisions to a referendum on Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting plan into the hands of Cole County Circuit Judge Brian Stumpe. Hoskins has already admitted in court through his attorneys that the ballot summary “is close to the line of being inherently argumentative.”
In the effort to save the law, Freedlund during oral arguments asked the court to reject the lawsuit entirely. Nicholson is not working for any initiative campaign engaged in litigation over a ballot title and therefore had no injury, he contended. 
And there is no standing, or right to sue, for anyone to challenge the appeal power because it involved no new expense for the state, he argued.
The court did not address the first argument and rejected the second. While in many cases a challenge could not be sustained if the only expense is for state employees who would be paid a salary anyway, this case is different, Powell wrote.
Lawmakers added the appeal power to the bill specifically to allow the attorney general to challenge a preliminary injunction in the court battle over abortion rights playing out in Kansas City.
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri are suing the state over laws and regulations that prevented Missourians from immediately accessing abortion following the passage of an abortion rights amendment in 2024. 
Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang found some of the regulations to be unconstitutional under the new abortion rights law and issued two preliminary injunctions.
Immediately after the bill was signed, Bailey used the new authority to file appeals that were ultimately unsuccessful. Those filings, Powell wrote, are a use of state funds that would not have been made absent the new legal authority. 
“In connection with the attorney general’s appeal of a preliminary injunction filed after passage of (the law), tax dollars necessarily have been spent on the pursuit of that appeal when no appeal was previously allowed,” Powell wrote. “This expenditure establishes taxpayer spending.”
The decision helps clarify when a lawsuit challenging a new law or regulation can be filed, Hatfield said.
“That’s somewhat helpful,” he said, “to those of us who worry about this kind of thing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ready-240910-RC-Amendment-3-13-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)Members of the New Mexico Legislature’s Senate Education Committee on Friday advanced the High-Quality Literacy Instruction Act, which would build on the state’s structured literacy requirements in public schools.
Senate Bill 37, sponsored by New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque), and endorsed by the Legislative Education Study Committee, would require public schools to administer literacy assessments approved by the Public Education Department for all students between kindergarten and third grade, and would mandate literacy instructional materials be consistent with the science of reading for English and biliteracy. 
Other provisions include requiring schools to notify parents if their K-12 child has difficulty reading and have a plan for both school and home support. For instance, if a school identifies a student has dyslexia, the school would notify parents and create an improvement plan and a read-at-home plan.
“Reading at home to students is one of the best ways to ensure that they learn to read,” Stewart said. “It’s book language, it’s different from talking. It’s vocabulary, it’s comprehension.”
PED would also have to assign literacy instructional coaches to elementary schools in the lowest quartile of reading proficiency.
The bill does not include an appropriation, but according to its fiscal impact report, it would increase operational costs for schools and the PED starting in Fiscal Year 2028.
“We have worked so hard for the last four to five years with the governor, with the Public Education Department, on improving our literacy rates, and they’re going up….We are starting to see real gains,” Stewart told committee members, while still pointing out there is work to be done. “We’ve got implementation gaps all over the state, and this bill attempts to set in framework a way that we can help everybody learn to read in our public schools.”
The K-3 assessments would begin in the 2027-2028 school year with “minimal” impact on instructional time, Stewart said.
Marla Shoats, representing New Mexico Coalition of Educational Leaders, spoke in favor of SB37, but said the coalition has concerns about where PED intends to recruit literacy instructional coaches to work in  underperforming elementary schools.
“Are we pulling high quality teachers from classes?” Shoats asked the committee. “We are strong proponents of structured literacy. The training is invaluable. It takes time to put into practice though, and schools are still implementing and addressing. We ask to give time to fully implement.”
She also said the coalition is concerned about adding to teachers’ already heavy workload, and about funding to implement the bill.
Sen. Anthony Thornton (R-Sandia Park) said he supports the bill, but also voiced concerns about PED having enough funding and staff to implement the various requirements of the bill.
“Are they going to be prepared to do all the necessary staffing to do the assessments for their K-3 screenings?” Thornton asked during the meeting. 
Stewart said the department has time to address staffing needs as the assessments will not roll out until FY2028. She said the only area of funding she is “concerned” about is for instructional coaches. “That is what we still are trying to get into the budget,” Stewart said. 
PED Executive Manager of Curriculum and Instruction Jacqueline Costales added that the PED is “ready to go” and already working on creating a template schools can use to communicate with parents about students’ reading assessments. 
“Our whole assessment team is ready to do what we need to do,” she said during the meeting. “I think we will be OK with the below-the-line funding that [the legislature continues] to provide and is in the budget.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The community hospital in southwest North Dakota in financial distress is one step closer to solvency after the Legislature voted to pass emergency legislation this week. 
Senate Bill 2403 authorizes the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to issue a low-interest loan of up to $5 million to nonprofit hospitals in small communities in financial distress. 
Jacobson Memorial Hospital in Elgin, which is operating “payroll to payroll” and in danger of shutting down, is the only institution in the state that meets the program’s eligibility requirements, according to the North Dakota Hospital Association. 
“Once a rural hospital closes, reopening it is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible,” said bill co-sponsor Rep. Karen Rohr, R-Mandan, whose district includes the hospital. 
Hospitals must meet strict criteria to be eligible for a loan, including submitting financial documents to prove the business plan is sustainable. 
Jacobson Memorial Hospital provides care to residents of Grant, Morton, Sioux, Hettinger and Adams counties. Those residents could face drives of 45 minutes or more to the nearest medical facility if the hospital closes. 
“Critical access hospitals are not optional infrastructure in North Dakota,” Rohr said. “When minutes matter, there is no substitute for a nearby staffed facility of professionals who know their community.” 
The bill largely sailed through the Senate on Thursday 46-0. But it was the subject of vigorous debate in the House on Friday morning as skeptics questioned whether the hospital would be able to return to solvency.

“This is a facility that has been operating in the red for a few years, and so far what I haven’t heard is what they plan to do better,” said Rep. Matthew Ruby, R-Minot, who ultimately voted in favor of the bill. “Aside from poisoning the water, how do you get more people sick to get them to come in?”
The hospital’s administrator and a member of the board testified to lawmakers Wednesday that the hospital has worked with consultants to develop a strategic plan. The hospital has already begun implementing cost-cutting measures, collecting additional revenue by taking full advantage of a federal drug pricing program, and parted ways with the former CEO in November. 
“This is going to work,” said House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson. “This is a big deal for rural health care.”
Other representatives expressed concerns the bill, designed for a single hospital as the intended recipient, may violate the state constitution’s prohibition on gifting. Rep. Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, said there is no constitutional question because it’s a loan, not a grant, and open to any hospital to apply. Rep. Ben Koppelman called it a “shell game.”
“It seems a little disingenuous to say it’s open to everybody, but really only funded for the amount we want for that one hospital,” said Koppelman, R-West Fargo. 
Rural hospital on the verge of shutting down could be saved by lawmaker’s bill

The bill originally authorized $10 million and capped an individual loan at $5 million. It was amended in committee, cutting the funding to $5 million, enough for a single loan at the maximum amount. 
Other legislators pointed out this wouldn’t be the first time the Legislature has authorized a loan with a particular target in mind. 
“Fifteen years ago, we were in a special session and we gave loans for flood victims in Minot under similar terms,” said Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot. “So I would encourage a yes vote.”
Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, said a loan application would be scrutinized by the Bank of North Dakota.
“We cannot allow entire communities or regions of our state to face limited or delayed access to care,” Mitskog said. 
The House passed the legislation 80-12.
The Bank of North Dakota will examine how the hospital arrived at this point and review comprehensive financial documentation, said Kelvin Hullet, an executive with the state-owned bank.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, speaks during a special session of the Legislature on Jan. 23, 2026. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
“We’ll be going in depth with them through an application process. It will be treated like any other loan that we would review at the Bank of North Dakota,” Hullet said. 
Sen. Michelle Powers, R-Fargo, emphasized the hospital’s dire situation is the result of poor management in recent years and not because of fraud. 
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, said the situation in Elgin should serve as notice to hospitals across the state. The boards, often composed of local community members, should check to ensure their business model is sustainable.  
“They should be asking tough questions because we’re not gonna be able to bail out every single hospital in the state,” Cleary said. “There’s only so many dollars we have available, and frankly in a situation like this, if this plan fails, that’ll cast a pretty long shadow on other entities that are looking for support.

Curtis Water Treatment Facility. Tuesday, July 19, 2023.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Jackson’s third-party water manager said it doesn’t expect any major service disruptions this weekend as a winter storm approaches Mississippi. 
“JXN Water has completed winterization efforts across its operations and is prepared for the upcoming cold weather,” the utility said in a statement on Thursday. “System facilities are being actively monitored, and crews are ready to respond if issues arise as temperatures drop. At this time, JXN Water does not anticipate widespread service impacts related to cold weather conditions.”
In 2021, many in the capital city went weeks without running water after a winter storm impaired O.B. Curtis, Jackson’s main treatment plant. Cold weather has frequently jeopardized the city’s ability to deliver water to residents, including in 2010, 2014 and 2018. 
Not only was equipment at the treatment plant exposed to the cold conditions, but aging, undersized distribution lines throughout the city often break during fluctuating temperatures.
Since taking over the system in 2022, the private utility has winterized O.B. Curtis to withstand cold conditions. The utility is also much better equipped to respond to line breaks, JXN Water spokesperson Aisha Carson told Mississippi Today.
JXN Water now has a mapping system in place which makes it easier to identify breaks, Carson explained. She added that the utility is nearly fully staffed in both of its treatment plants as well as its repair crews, compared to having just a quarter of positions filled during the 2022 water crisis. Moreover, the thousands of repairs to leaks and broken valves JXN Water has made in the last couple years should put it in a “better position” to address service issues, Carson said.
Utility say it can’t make Jackson’s next debt payment
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate called a last-second status conference on Friday after JXN Water manager Ted Henifin again alerted the court of ongoing financial troubles. 
The utility won’t be able to make Jackson’s next debt payment of $1.5 million due on Mar. 1, Henifin wrote in a letter. JXN Water has sought a rate increase for nearly the past year, saying it lacks funds to pay its contractors or make sewer repairs. Because JXN Water must first advertise any rate change for 30 days beforehand, there isn’t enough time for the utility to accrue the necessary revenue by the Mar. 1 due date, the letter said. 
In response, Jackson City Attorney Drew Martin told the court it was JXN Water’s responsibility to make the payments as the debt belongs to the water system. The city made the last payment of $5 million in December on behalf of the utility. Mississippi Today reached out to city officials to ask if Jackson would be able to take on the next payment, but did not hear back by this publication.
If the city is unable to make future debt payments, it could be subject to losing sales tax revenue, the utility said. 
In his letter, Henifin said the only way JXN Water could make the March payment is if it receives $54 million in reallocated EPA funding by mid-February. In the fall, the city convinced Congress to redirect that money from $450 million originally set aside for capital projects.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100026/3X0A3937-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

(File photo by Michael Smith/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Every classroom in public K-12 schools and colleges would have to display a copy of the Ten Commandments under a bill that advanced in the House this week.
The House Judiciary Committee voted 18-to-3 to advance the bill, which also creates the option of displaying numerous other historical documents in classrooms and allows schools to accept volunteer chaplains.
Alongside the 11-by-13-inch posters or framed copies of the Ten Commandments, all teachers would also have to display a “context statement” about the history of schools teaching the text.
Schools would not have to pay for posters listing the Ten Commandments under the bill. Districts and universities can collect donations for the posters, or they can use free versions, which the bill requires the Department of Education to provide.
The Wednesday vote came the same day an appeals court heard arguments on a nearly identical law Louisiana’s legislature passed in 2024.
Although both the Louisiana law and the South Carolina bill listed U.S. Supreme Court decisions legislators claimed made the practice legal, a federal judge in Louisiana stopped the law from taking effect in the state in 2024. A subset of a federal appeals court found the law unconstitutional, before an appeal brought the case before a full, 17-judge panel for a hearing this week.
“This is still in limbo,” South Carolina Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Columbia Democrat, said of the bill. “It’s going to be determined probably by the U.S. Supreme Court.”
South Carolina’s bill repeats nearly the entire Louisiana bill, including a quote attorneys challenging Louisiana’s law say is attributed incorrectly to James Madison.
Defending the historical value of the Ten Commandments, the bill cites Madison as saying “(w)e have staked the whole future of our new nation upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.” But no one has proven that Madison actually said that, Louisiana lawyers argued in court.
South Carolina’s version expands the bill to classrooms at publicly funded universities. And, after a change made during the committee meeting, it lists the Emancipation Proclamation as one of the other documents teachers could display, though that is not required.
Teachers could also put up copies of the Mayflower Compact and the Declaration of Independence, though neither is required.
All three are historical documents, supporters of the bill said.
“We’re proud in South Carolina to put America first by continuing our history, our heritage and, of course, our faith,” Rep. Richie Yow, a Chesterfield Republican and Baptist pastor, told the SC Daily Gazette.
Students aren’t meant to unquestioningly accept the text but to engage with it as they would with any historical document, said Rep. Kathy Landing.
“For our young children to be exposed to that, to be able to ask questions and maybe even be able to debate and discuss sometimes some of those commandments is not a bad thing,” the Mount Pleasant Republican said. “It actually helps strengthen the education process, and Lord knows we need plenty of that.”
Opponents argued the bill violates the establishment clause in the Constitution’s First Amendment, commonly referred to as requiring a separation of church and state. Including the Ten Commandments but no equivalent for other religions can exclude students who aren’t Christian, said Rep. John King.
“While I am a Christian and believe in the Ten Commandments, I also am not blind in reference to other people, and they do not believe in what we believe in,” King said.
Rep. Justin Bamberg, a Bamberg County Democrat, said he didn’t mind teachers displaying the Ten Commandments but didn’t understand why that document was required while other important pieces of history were simply allowed under the bill.
Despite his concerns, Bamberg voted in favor of advancing the bill.
“I don’t think anybody has a problem with history,” Bamberg said. “The question is, what and whose history?”
The bill would also allow school districts to create policies for allowing volunteer chaplains to visit school grounds and counsel students on religious issues while there. Students would need parent permission to opt into any services involving the chaplains.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ten-Commandments-1024x668.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

This story by Tracy Brannstorm was first published in The Bridge on Jan. 22, 2026.
Vermont is the only state in the Northeast without a freestanding birth center. That could soon change: a team of Vermont midwives is developing the Green Mountain Birth Center and inviting the public to weigh in at an event on Feb. 1. 
A state law passed last May cleared the way for freestanding centers, establishing a licensing system and requiring insurers to cover their services. Several of the midwives behind the budding Green Mountain Birth Center were active advocates of that legislation.
The team is currently fundraising $3 million to cover startup costs and the first year of operations. The aim of the project’s first phase is to open a small prenatal and postpartum care practice in Morrisville this year, with estimated operating costs of about $25,000.
They are also searching for a permanent site for the birth center itself, ideally near a hospital that could serve as a transfer partner. Waterbury is among the top locations being considered.
Freestanding birth centers are standalone health care facilities that provide prenatal care, labor and delivery services and postpartum support for people with low-risk pregnancies. Typically led by midwives, they operate outside the hospital setting but maintain relationships with hospitals for transfer if complications arise.
Supporters often point to research indicating that birth centers deliver strong outcomes for uncomplicated pregnancies while also reducing medical interventions, achieving high patient satisfaction while costing less than hospital births.
Midwife Erinn Mandeville, a founding member of the Green Mountain Birth Center, said the model can also offer greater satisfaction in the workplace because it gives practitioners more autonomy. “You’re not beholden to hospital budgets or administrators who don’t understand our vision,” she said.
Mandeville was on staff for five years at Copley Hospital’s birthing center in Morrisville before it was closed last November. “I loved my job at Copley and thought I would retire there,” she said. “But when the hospital announced the unit’s closure, I was like, ‘OK, I guess I’m starting a birth center.’”
She is joined by four other founders — Alison Fischman, Heidi Riendeau, Lindsay Lachant and Mary Lou Kopas — who together bring decades of experience across hospital, birth center and home-based care, with a particular focus on serving rural and underserved communities. 
Several of them have long been involved in advocacy that supports birth center licensure — efforts that culminated last May, when lawmakers passed a law creating a statewide licensing system with fewer barriers. Previously, applicants had to demonstrate need through a review that allowed hospitals and other stakeholders to weigh in. The new law exempts freestanding birth centers from that process and requires insurers to cover their services by early 2027.
With the new law in place, the Green Mountain Birth Center organizers formalized their nonprofit, began recruiting volunteers and opened a patient waiting list — all while continuing their hospital and home-based midwifery work.
“So far it’s exciting and it’s daunting,” Mandeville said. “We’re all committed to serving our community, but now we’re having to become administrators, and business people, and marketers at the same time, when I just want to catch babies and help people through menopause or whatever’s going on with them.”
Mandeville said she is most excited about rethinking prenatal care by connecting patients with social services such as Women, Infants and Children care and housing assistance, offering early support through movement and body work that could prevent complications during birth or postpartum, and allowing for longer, more in-depth patient visits. “We really need to broaden our concept of what needs to be supported,” she said. 
The Vermont Department of Health is currently finalizing how the state’s new licensing system will operate. And while that’s happening, the Green Mountain Birth Center team will be continuing to plan the center’s next steps.
The event, scheduled for Feb. 1 from 2 to 4 p.m. at Emerge in downtown Montpelier (15 State St.) will be hosted by Amy LePage, a bodyworker and childbirth educator. The event is an opportunity to learn about the center’s plans, meet the founders, find out how to get involved and is open to the wider community, LePage said. “Not just people who are in this realm and time of their life of being pregnant, but really anyone interested in investing in family health and community care in Vermont.”
“We really want it to be a conversation,” she added.  LePage will be offering a donation-based class for stress relief and better sleep following the event, from 4:40 to 6 p.m., with all proceeds going to the Green Mountain Birth Center.

Jeff Landry is asking Louisiana lawmakers to double state funding for vouchers that pay for students’ private education expenses. The request has put him at odds with legislative leaders, who said state officials still won’t answer basic questions about the program’s structure. 

State legislators, with Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie leading the resistance, rejected a request from Landry last year to give Louisiana’s publicly funded voucher program called LA GATOR an additional $50 million. 
Landry is asking for an extra $44.2 million for vouchers for the 2026-27 school year. The governor’s budget architect, Commissioner of Administration Taylor Barras, said the allocation would expand the program to cover another 4,000 to 5,000 students.  

But Henry and other legislative leaders said their reservations about the program haven’t changed. 
“If you want to take a kid from a failing school and put them in a good school, I don’t think many people would object to that,” Henry told officials with the Landry administration Friday. “It’s all the other stuff that’s involved in [LA GATOR] that has muddied the water, that no one likes to discuss, that people have a difficult time justifying.” 
The Senate president’s comments came at the end of a public presentation of Landry’s overall budget proposal for the state fiscal year that starts July 1. 
Henry has repeatedly expressed concerns that Louisiana’s new private education voucher program could grow beyond what the state can afford to fund. The Senate president is also unhappy the grants can be used by families to pay for ancillary school expenses such as uniforms, laptops and tutoring for private school students – and not just tuition. 
Approximately three-quarters of the students who applied for LA GATOR last year were already attending private school, according to information released by lawmakers last year. It raises questions about whether extending vouchers to more families would actually help children escape inadequate public education or simply subsidize families who are already sending their children to private schools, according to Henry and others. 
“The reason I didn’t like GATOR because every year it has to double, right? And lo and behold, this year, it’s doubled,” Henry said. 

Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, who chairs the budget-writing committee in the Louisiana House, said he shares Henry’s worries about LA GATOR. Like Henry, he is concerned voucher funding can be used on expenses other than tuition, when families with public school students don’t have those same opportunities. 
“The devil is in the details, and we need to see what the devil is doing,” McFarland said in an interview.

While the governor wants to see public spending on private education go up, his $47 billion budget plan does not include approximately $200 million needed to avoid a cut to public school teacher and support staff pay in the next school year. 
Instead, the governor and legislators are hoping voters approve a constitutional amendment on the April 18 election ballot that will free up state money to give the teachers and support staff annual pay increases of $2,250 and $1,125, respectively. The salary hikes would replace stipends of $2,000 and $1,000 school faculty and staff have received the past two years. 

The April ballot measure specifically asks voters to dissolve education trust funds that currently support higher education and K-12 schools in order to pay down $2 billion worth of educator retirement debt. Local school districts will then be required to use their debt savings to give out the raises in the 2026-27 school year. Voters rejected a similar amendment Landry pushed last year, but the new proposal has been rewritten to address teacher compensation more directly and leaves out tax policy changes that weren’t as popular with the public. 

If the amendment fails, however, teachers and school support staff will be at risk of seeing their pay cut under Landry’s budget plan. It could also send lawmakers scrambling to try to fill the gap as they did last spring. 
In addition to private school voucher funding, Landry’s budget proposal for next fiscal year includes large state funding increases for prisons ($82 million) and a Louisiana Economic Development program called High-Impact Jobs ($75 million).

(Photo courtesy of Sarah Simmons)The American College of Nurse-Midwives sued Mississippi in federal court this week to challenge a state requirement that nurse-midwives must practice in collaboration with a physician.
In Mississippi, advanced practice nurse practitioners, including certified nurse-midwives, can’t practice without a signed “collaborative practice agreement” with a doctor. This typically involves the nurse midwife paying a monthly fee, the lawsuit states, and obstetricians can refuse to enter into such agreements.
Many states enforce similar requirements. Supporters say such rules protect patients and foster communication between advanced practice nurses and physicians. But the nurse-midwives group argues that they are unreasonable and do little to ensure that physicians are available when needed.
The case, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure, alleges that the requirement violates federal and state antitrust laws by limiting the number of certified nurse-midwives, thereby reducing competition for physicians.
The lawsuit, filed by Pillsbury Law and the Mississippi Center for Justice, also argues that the rules prevent nurse-midwives from filling gaps in maternal health care in a state that has some of the worst maternal and infant health outcomes.
For years, Getty Israel has been advocating to repeal the requirements. Israel, founder of Sisters in Birth, wants to build Mississippi’s first freestanding birth center, but the state’s collaborative practice requirement has hindered the project and made it difficult to hire nurse midwives, she said.
Mississippi state Democratic Rep. Dan Eubanks has written letters to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces federal antitrust laws, arguing that the state requirement has “created an unfair economic disadvantage for [certified nurse-midwives] in Mississippi, effectively barring them from practicing.” Eubanks filed a bill this session that would repeal the requirement.
“Currently, there are only 26 [certified nurse-midwives] registered with the Mississippi Board of Nursing, he wrote in a 2023 letter, and “only several practice midwifery care” because of the rules. The others can’t find jobs as nurse-midwives, he wrote, and have been forced to take lower-level nursing jobs. He wrote another letter to the FTC in October.
Clarke Edwards, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Office of Policy, wrote back to Eubanks last month.
“State-mandated collaboration or supervision requirements that restrict [advanced practice registered nurses] from practicing to the full extent of their abilities, may impede access to care, and may frustrate the development of innovative team-based approaches to health care,” Edwards wrote.
The lawsuit also references a 2014 report by FTC staff, which recommends that state legislatures set the rules but notes that based on the agency’s review of the available research, “supervision requirements… do not appear to be justified by legitimate health and safety concerns.”

Sharice Davids to hang onto her seat. Hawkins and Masterson are pictured during a Jan. 8, 2026, legislative hearing. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas governor candidate Philip Sarnecki took to social media to chastise fellow Republicans for lack of action by the Kansas Legislature to redraw boundaries of the four U.S. House districts to disadvantage the state’s lone Democratic incumbent in Congress.
Sarnecki, a candidate for the Republican Party’s nomination, accused the GOP supermajority in the House and Senate of deciding to “forfeit” its part in a national congressional redistricting fight between states controlled by Republicans and those dominated by Democrats.
“Kansas Republicans have a supermajority and can pick up a Republican House seat if they redraw the map,” said Sarnecki, founder of RPS Financial Group. “They are choosing not to. While Democrats redraw congressional maps to gain power across the country, Topeka is standing down.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican also running for governor, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, worked during October to secure support from two-thirds of members in both chambers to allow a special legislative session to redraw congressional boundaries. Enough Republican senators signed a petition to trigger a special session, but not enough GOP House members agreed with a plan to bring lawmakers together in November 2025.
The objective would have been a map that made it difficult for U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, to win reelection to her seat in November 2026. The tentative scheme was to split Johnson County between two or three congressional districts, which would disperse that county’s voters into GOP-majority districts.
Traditionally, Kansas congressional maps were redrawn every decade to reflect population shifts documented by the U.S. Census. The current map was passed in 2022 after the Kansas GOP pledged to keep Johnson County in a single district.
Masterson and Hawkins said they were interested in working on maps during the 2026 regular session of the Legislature. Masterson said it would be a “top priority,” while Hawkins said it was the “right thing to do.”
In two weeks of the current legislative session, there has been no substantive action in House or Senate committees to indicate progress on redistricting.
President Donald Trump and his allies, in a bid to cling to Republican control of the U.S. House, urged states to gerrymander enough Democrats out of Congress to prevail in the upcoming election cycle.
Sarnecki, who loaned his gubernatorial campaign $2 million in 2025, said he was convinced “weak GOP leaders in Kansas just chose to stand down and forfeit the fight for a Republican congressional map.”
“That’s not leadership and that is exactly why I’m running for governor. It’s time for a change,” Sarnecki said.
Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, said she was skeptical a new congressional map would be adopted by the House and Senate in the 2026 session. If a new map was passed, the governor could veto it. The House and Senate could override a veto with two-thirds majority votes in both chambers. If an override was successful, lawsuits challenging the new map would be likely.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1080267-1024x663.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 20:44:54+00:00,CT Mirror,How well is CT meeting the needs of incarcerated young women?,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/how-well-is-ct-meeting-the-needs-of-incarcerated-young-women/,Recent data from the Judicial Branch has renewed questions about how well CT is addressing the challenges young women face in detention.,"More than two years ago, on the heels of allegations of abuse and neglect at a girls’ group home, the Connecticut legislature instructed a group of experts to study services available for girls involved with the juvenile justice system. 
Now, recent data from the state Judicial Branch has renewed questions about the availability and effectiveness of programs designed to meet the unique challenges young women face in incarceration. 
According to a presentation given to the state’s Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee in October, the number of juveniles in detention has declined — but the number of boys dropped faster than the number of girls over the last five years. In 2025, the number of boys in detention was almost 20% lower than it was in 2019. For girls, the decline was 9.8%. 
The overall number of boys in detention remains significantly higher than girls — 450 boys compared to 101 girls as of October 2025. But the slower rate of decline in female juvenile detention has drawn the attention of people in the field. Those who’ve worked with girls in the justice system said they believe the reason lies in a combination of the unique challenges girls and young women face and a lack of services to address those specific needs.
Connecticut has long been a leader in gender-responsive strategies in juvenile justice — that is, methods for working with people that take into account the specialized needs of men and women. The state began to incorporate these strategies into the juvenile justice system about 25 years ago. Over that time, multiple laws were passed limiting detention for certain offenses, and new programs were established geared specifically toward girls, including a specialized probation model, according to a presentation at the May 2024 meeting of the state’s Gender Responsiveness Workgroup. 
Catherine Foley Geib, director of juvenile clinical, education and residential services for the Judicial Branch, said the number of teenagers in detention has dropped significantly over the last quarter-century, thanks to changes in state law. In the mid-2000s, the state changed its laws so teenagers would no longer be detained for things like running away or chronic absence from school. Another law change in 2016 limited the conditions under which a teen could be held in detention.
The result, Foley Geib said, was that the young people who did end up in juvenile detention were often the ones with the greatest needs. 
“If you don’t get at the root cause of what’s driving that behavior, we start to see the repeat behavior, the chronic offenses and that inability to exit the system,” said Tasha Hunt, the agency’s director of juvenile probation services. 
Hunt said that many girls come in with a history of trauma and victimization. That trauma, she said, can present itself in delinquent behaviors, like low-level assaults or charges for breach of peace. Hunt said more community-based services are needed for girls, particularly intensive, in-home services that address mental health challenges, substance abuse and trauma. 
“We know we don’t have enough,” she said. 
Erika Nowakowski, executive director of the Tow Youth Justice Institute at the University of New Haven and a leader of the working group, said she believes it’s time for Connecticut to revisit the research on gender responsiveness and see if some of its recommendations should change. 
“ It’s been some time and that’s why we’re doing this research now to see what are the newer interventions and what shift that they do to address the needs of women or females in the justice system,” she said. 
Trauma and poverty
In 2023, the state legislature passed a law creating the working group within the Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee. The group was tasked with finding improved ways to help young women who had lived through sexual abuse or human trafficking. 
The experience of trauma and abuse, particularly sexual abuse, is one of the most common attributes among women who have been involved with the criminal justice system. Data from Roca, a nonprofit that works with high-risk young women between the ages of 16 and 24 in Hartford and parts of Massachusetts, shows that more than 85% of the women they serve have lived through domestic violence, and a significant number have been victims of human trafficking.
Sunindiya Bhalla, an executive vice president with Roca, said young women — more so than young men — struggle to trust. All of the women Roca works with have been victimized in some way, she said, which makes them vulnerable and leaves them feeling scared. 
“They do perceive people that they don’t know and they don’t trust as a threat both physically and emotionally,” said Bhalla. 
Roper, the director of Roca Hartford, said the organization has seen an increase in young women committing violent crimes in recent years. “It seems with all of those factors coming up in their lives or within their lives, that they are now picking up weapons, fighting. I think it’s survival, to be honest,” she said. 
Bhalla and Roper said poverty is also a common factor among young women involved in the justice system. Many of the people Roca works with are struggling to find food and housing. And the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to financial insecurity for many women. 
Advocates also expressed concerns about state-run juvenile residential facilities, known as STTAR homes. Some girls who are placed in STTAR homes end up running away or getting into trouble. 
“That’s the irony. They go to a place that’s supposed to keep them safe and then they end up getting arrested at the STTAR homes for additional charges,” Martha Stone, an attorney and founder of the Center for Children’s Advocacy, said. 
Frank Gregory,  administrator of behavioral health community services for the state Department of Children and Families, which runs the STTAR homes, said young women have complex needs and running away can be a coping mechanism. He said it’s crucial for programs at STTAR homes to connect with young people and earn their trust, and he said DCF is investing in new programs to address that.
Ken Mysogland, a spokesperson for DCF, said, “These are some of our most vulnerable youth, and there is no other way to say that.” 
“We recognize they require some very specialized programming,” Mysogland said. 
Reintegration
Experts point to the importance of robust programming for young women who are returning home after periods of incarceration. Mentorship, mental health care, employment opportunities and counseling — as much of it within the communities where they live — are part of the range of support services needed for reentry. 
A 2023 task force also recommended that state agencies coordinate to make sure young people leaving the juvenile justice system are connected back into their school system, are given help with job or career readiness programs and have access to transportation and stable housing. 
Hunt, of the Judicial Branch, said juvenile probation officers stay in regular contact with schools. They’ll attend meetings for a child’s special education needs and work with “juvenile justice liaisons” in larger school districts to help young people transition back to school after being in a residential program. She said they assess young people for mental health needs, survey their housing needs and work to connect them to community organizations that can help. They also work with cities and towns to find job opportunities, Hunt said. 
Foley Geib said that young people in residential facilities are provided with “reintegration mentors” who work with them for up to a year after they are released, and help connect them to services in the community.    
“I think we sometimes overlook, when we’re thinking of deep-end care, what someone needs to feel a part of their community and not stigmatized in their community,” said Erica King, a senior manager at the Center for Effective Public Policy. 
“Do they have a place they can go to the gym and take a shower and work out? Do they have a favorite smoothie spot where the person knows them at the counter?” King said. “Just helping them to map their communities of where their safe anchors are, and how to help them build those.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/JUVENILE-GIRLS-1215-Participants-Kasani-and-Tylasia-collaging-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

Jan. 3, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.The Detroit Red Wings are officially hosting a Pride Night game in the 2025-26 season, adding that specific tag to the team’s game against the New Jersey Devils on April 11.
The team made the change after criticism emerged online as to why the Red Wings were one of only three teams — alongside the Los Angeles Kings and the Utah Mammoth, the latter of which do not appear to have any themed games — to not schedule a Pride-related game during the season.
Pride Night will be held alongside the team’s “People of Hockeytown” night, to highlight the “diverse range of fans, cultures, and communities that make Hockeytown one of the NHL’s most passionate fan bases,” along with “Fan Appreciation Night,” as the game will be the team’s last regular season home game.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The NHL’s official promotional schedule for the team now lists “PRIDE Night” as a part of the April 11 game, but that is a recent change — archived versions of the website show that as of at least late December, that wording was not present on the page.
“We have always planned to celebrate Pride within our People of Hockeytown Night on April 11. To clarify this, we’ve added the title of Pride Night, during which we will continue our longstanding support of team partners and fans within the LGBTQ+ community,” Ilitch Sports + Entertainment, which serves as the combined business operations of the Detroit Red Wings and the Detroit Tigers, wrote in a statement to the Michigan Advance.
In past years, the Red Wings have hosted specific Pride Night events, and the MLB’s Detroit Tigers, who have the same main ownership as the Red Wings, hosted their own Pride game in June.
A spokesperson for Ilitch Sports + Entertainment spotlighted those events, as well as the participation of the teams in the annual Motor City Pride Parade. The teams also participate in the Pride Month “Game Changers” Recognition Program with Comerica Bank, which gives awards to LGBTQ+ leaders around the state from groups like Equality Michigan and Stonewall Sports Detroit, as well as partnerships with local LGBTQ+ organizations like the Ruth Ellis Center and the You Can Play Project.

Pride events in the NHL have been a source of controversy for seasons, and in 2023, the league banned teams from wearing themed warmup jerseys, including Pride jerseys, after a number of players publicly refused to wear them. The use of Pride Tape on players’ sticks was also initially banned, but that was rescinded shortly after, following the use of the tape by an Arizona Coyotes player.
Teams and individual players have skirted the themed jersey ban by wearing them during player arrivals prior to warmups, and the Seattle Kraken this year auctioned off pride-themed jerseys to benefit local LGBTQ+ organizations. It remains to be seen whether or not the Red Wings will offer any Pride Night-specific merchandise, or if players will don themed gear before or during the game.
LGBTQ+ acceptance in the hockey world more broadly has come into the limelight in recent months following the release of the Canadian TV show “Heated Rivalry,” based on a novel of the same name, which tells the story of two closeted queer hockey stars who fall in love over the course of their professional hockey careers. (SPOILER ALERT) The show features a grand reveal of another gay hockey pro, who brings his boyfriend onto the ice for a dramatic kiss after his team wins the league championship. 
But grand gestures of LGBTQ+ acceptance are not the norm in the real NHL. There are no out LGBTQ+ athletes in the NHL, and there never have been — making them the only major men’s pro sports league in North America to never have an active or retired player come out publicly, according to LGBTQ+ sports website OutSports.
Hudson Williams, who plays one of the two leads in the show, has said that closeted professional athletes — in the NHL and in other leagues — have reached out to him and to Rachel Reid, the author of the books, expressing how unsafe it would be to come out as a professional athlete. 
“Sometimes they’re just reaching out privately through Instagram, and those ones are the ones that really just kind of hit you and go, ‘Oh, so this is a fun show, and it’s celebratory, but also sometimes it’s just hitting people right in the nerve,’” Williams told Andy Cohen on his SiriusXM show earlier in January.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2581-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

The State Board of Higher Education appointed Berg this week to lead the campus after President David Cook steps down. Berg will start Feb. 9.
Berg, a real estate developer, served in the state Legislature from 1985 to 2010 and served one term in Congress. He is a graduate of NDSU and a longtime supporter of the university.
“Berg brings extensive national‑level leadership experience along with sharp entrepreneurial and business expertise, strengthening NDSU’s ability to build and expand key relationships,” State Board of Higher Education Chair Kevin Black said in a statement.
The appointment is expected to continue until the next president is hired, likely in late spring. The board selected an interim president based on recommendations from North Dakota University System Commissioner Brent Sanford, who issued a request for letters of interest from people who wanted to be considered for the interim post. 
“NDSU has shaped so many lives across our state, including my own, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to support our students, faculty, and staff during this transition,” Berg said in a statement.
Cook, who has led NDSU since spring 2022, accepted a job as president of Iowa State University, his alma mater. His last day is Feb. 8.

“This isn’t the end,” he said at a noon press conference after the Legislature brought its special session to a close. “This is the beginning — now we’ve got to implement it.”
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services will start accepting grant applications from organizations interested in program money in February, according to Interim Commissioner Pat Traynor.
 
North Dakota Monitor special session coverage


The $50 billion program was created by Congress last summer as part of its budget reconciliation bill. It was advertised as a way to partially make up for funding rural states will lose from Medicaid cuts included elsewhere in the legislation.
The Legislature convened for three days this week to authorize the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services to spend its share of the money. Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said the cost of the special session is expected to be roughly $225,000.
The flagship legislation of the session, the state’s Rural Health Transformation Program budget, passed in the Senate unanimously Friday morning.
House Bill 1623 appropriates $397.9 million for the program for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, the amount the state expects to receive for the first two years of the program.
North Dakota in December learned its award for 2026 would be $199 million. The state plans to dedicate $33.4 million of that on technology, $116 million to expand health care access in rural areas, $32.2 million to address workforce issues and $17.1 million to promote healthy lifestyles.
Armstrong said he’s particularly excited about the prospect of the grant being used to expand mobile health clinics and telehealth infrastructure in the state.
“If you have access to it and you don’t have to drive 100 miles in a blizzard for an appointment that you could do in that space, I think that’s really, really exciting,” he said.
The budget also includes a provision to enable the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to provide up to $40 million in stop-gap loans to grant applicants awaiting reimbursement from the federal government.
He said the Department of Health and Human Services will now submit the budget to the federal government for final approval.
The agency has launched a webpage for the Rural Health Transformation Program where people can sign up for email updates.
Organizations will have a short timeline to apply for grants. The Department of Health of Human Services has to commit the money by the end of October and spend it within the following year.
The agency will soon organize listening sessions to field questions from grant applicants, Traynor said.
The department will have personnel available to assist with applications. That includes hiring a liaison to help Tribal communities navigate the grant process, given their unique legal status as sovereign nations.
Rep. Collette Brown, a Warwick Democrat and a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation, highlighted workforce shortages on the reservation as a major area where funding is needed.
“We need doctors, we need dentists, we need mental health, we need chiropractors,” Brown said.
Rep. Jayme Davis, a Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa citizen, in the fall pushed for 5% of North Dakota’s award to be set aside for tribes in the state’s budget, but the Rural Health Transformation Committee rejected her proposal.
Davis said she’s concerned about rural communities in the state getting their fair share of the funding.
“I want to make sure that the frontier, the real rural, is at the top of everybody’s list,” the Rolette Democrat said.
North Dakota Senate narrowly defeats free school meal bill

Armstrong on Friday afternoon also approved four policies that the Trump administration incentivized states to adopt by promising extra Rural Health Transformation Program money.
One of those policies, Senate Bill 2402, allows pharmacists to prescribe some medications to patients and order some lab tests.
House Bill 1621 requires North Dakota students to participate in the presidential physical fitness test. 
Armstrong also signed Senate Bill 2401, which mandates doctors receive one hour of education on nutrition and metabolic health as part of their continuing education.
The fourth policy, House Bill 1622, allows North Dakota to join a licensure compact for physician assistants.
The Legislature this week also passed a handful of unrelated bills, including an amendment to clarify how the residential property tax credit is applied.
House Bill 1626, brought by Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, would change how counties apply a 5% discount to homeowners who pay property taxes early. Currently, the 5% discount is applied after the primary residence credit, which Headland said prevents some homeowners from receiving the full $1,600 property tax credit promised to them during the 2025 Legislative session.
Lawmakers also approved legislation to set aside $325,000 for litigation funding for the Public Service Commission. If more money is needed, the bill authorizes the commission to take out a loan from the Bank of North Dakota as well. The legislation also earmarks $1.5 million for North Dakota Information Technology to bring state websites and other digital content into compliance with American Disability Act requirements.
Other legislation passed by the Legislature would allow the University of North Dakota to use proceeds from a land sale for renovations to the Ray Richards golf course or to support the school’s varsity golf teams. The university is selling 6.5 acres of land to the Department of Transportation to accommodate a railroad underpass project.
Additionally, the Legislature approved a resolution brought by Rep. Glenn Bosch, R-Bismarck, celebrating the 175th anniversary of the YMCA.
Armstrong as of Friday afternoon had not signed the additional bills.

(Daniel Montaño/KUNM)Early results of a study into how New Mexico runs a federal food assistance program show relatively low rates of fraud, but also a stubbornly high rate of mistakes, according to a presentation this week from Legislative Finance Committee analysts.
Republicans in the Legislature convinced majority Democrats at the end of the November special legislative session to include $50,000 for the LFC to evaluate the state’s handling of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Lawmakers sought answers about the extent of intentional fraud as well as how the state could bring down its “error rate,” a measure of accidental SNAP over- and underpayments.
The Legislature required the LFC to present preliminary findings by the 30-day session that began earlier this week. 
Analysts told lawmakers they reviewed federal data about SNAP benefits theft, along with state court filings, to glean insight into the extent of SNAP fraud, which they defined as “intentional activity intended to steal or improperly receive SNAP benefits.”
New Mexico Legislature passes, acting governor signs $162.5M to cover SNAP payments if needed

According to the analysts’ presentation Monday, 1.8% of New Mexico SNAP recipients, approximately 4,600 households, received approximately $2.3 million in federal funds to replace SNAP benefits stolen between October 2022 and December 2024. Analysts said the SNAP theft occurred primarily through the use of card skimmers, which thieves affix to the top of grocery store card readers to steal SNAP debit card information.
The $2.3 million in stolen SNAP benefits represents a fraction of the more than $1 billion the state would have paid in benefits during that time period.
Analysts also looked at state court data to determine the prevalence of buying, selling or trading SNAP benefits, which lawmakers have made illegal through specific criminal statutes.  
The report found that police and prosecutors have only brought 12 such fraud cases to court over the last five and a half years. 
New Mexico Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) told Source on Friday that his takeaway from the report’s findings is that if fraud “happens one time, it’s one time too many.” 
New Mexico agency seeks funds to bring down SNAP error rate — but not too quickly

But he said he is confident the state, with the help of the LFC report and promised reforms, is taking steps to reduce SNAP fraud, as well as unintentional overpayments. 
The LFC report does not calculate the total amount the state overpays each month. But it notes that 12% of SNAP payments each month are overpayments, which would amount to roughly $11 million of approximately $90 million the state distributes each month. 
“There’s a lot of money changing hands here,” Padilla said. “Obviously we want to make sure it gets to the people who actually deserve it, need it, and so I think the department is implementing safeguards to make sure that that happens.”
In addition to efforts at calculating the extent of fraud, analysts also sought to explain how New Mexico’s rate of SNAP administration errors became among the highest in the country. Unlike fraud, the analysts described the error rate as a result of unintentional mistakes by either state officials or applicants.
The Income Support Division at the state Health Care Authority oversees SNAP and is tasked with reducing New Mexico’s error rate. State officials are seeking funding for staff and technology that they said will bring the error rate down in time to avoid significant financial penalties in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed last year. 
The analysts said the state has focused primarily on getting benefits out quickly, particularly amid an influx of applicants when the COVID-19 pandemic began. That emphasis on quick payments coincided with more incorrect payments, analysts said.
As evidence, the report compares the state’s error rate to the state’s “timeliness” in distributing benefits within federal deadlines over a 15-month period. At the same time that the state’s error rate increased from 14.6% to 16.7% between July 2024 and September 2025, the state increased its rate of on-time payments from 78% to 98%. 
Analyst Clayon Lobaugh said that data shows the “tradeoffs” required to reduce errors while also filling benefits on time.

Lobaugh and fellow analyst Alma Kassim stressed during the presentation Monday that the results were preliminary, and the analysts solicited additional questions from lawmakers to try to answer in the final report due by July. 
Sen. James Townsend (R-Artesia), the Senate minority leader and one of the lawmakers who pushed for the study, told Source New Mexico in an interview Thursday at the Roundhouse that the early findings validate his concerns about waste and abuse in a program upon which roughly one in five New Mexicans rely. 
“I am quite certain, based on looking at that report and looking at other facts, that there is fraud and misrepresentation that is rampant in the program that’s got to be addressed,” he said. “And the quicker we get it straightened out, the better off we are.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

Phil Murphy hugs Jamal Muhammad, whose prison sentence he commuted in April 2025, during a news conference on Nov. 10, 2025, at Princeton University. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A trio of Democratic lawmakers want to alter the pardon powers of New Jersey’s governors after Gov. Phil Murphy issued waves of clemencies that lifted sentences for some convicted of serious violent crimes, up to and including murder, shortly before leaving office.
Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) and Assemblywomen Margie Donlon (D-Monmouth) and Luanne Peterpaul (D-Monmouth) urged changes to state pardon powers, arguing the wave of state clemencies and alleged abuses at the federal level demanded change.
“At a time when we are seeing a federal administration exploit executive power, New Jersey leadership must remain committed to serving the public welfare, not abusing power to sidestep our justice system,” they said in a joint statement.
A commutation Murphy granted to Maria Montalvo, a Monmouth County women convicted of murdering her two toddler children, has incensed Gopal, his running mates, and Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond Santiago.
A jury convicted Montalvo of killing her children, aged 18 and 28 months, in 1996. Prosecutors said she doused them in gasoline before setting her car ablaze in the driveway of her husband’s parents. The court sentenced her to 100 years, with parole ineligibility until 2054.
Murphy’s grant of clemency did not release Montalvo, but it did make her immediately eligible to seek parole.
Montalvo has maintained her innocence. Witness accounts of the incident varied, and her attorneys have argued the evidence used to convict her was based on science that has since been discredited.
Backers of Murphy’s expansive clemency program, which pardoned or commuted the sentences of 455 individuals, urged against denuding clemency powers, calling it a valuable tool to reduce the state’s prison population.
“From the mid ’90s to 2024, we only saw around 100 instances of clemency being granted in New Jersey over 30 years across so many governors. It’s a tool that is widely underutilized, and it’s something we should use to address systemic injustices in the criminal legal system,” said Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey.
The road to limit the governor’s pardon powers runs uphill.
The power to overwrite state criminal convictions and penalties stems from New Jersey’s constitution, and the document provides no means for anyone — not legislators or courts — to review grants of gubernatorial clemency.
That means only a constitutional amendment could change how pardons and commutations are meted out in New Jersey.
Amending the state constitution requires a voter referendum, but getting a constitutional question on the ballot requires legislative approval — either by simple majority votes in the Senate and Assembly in two consecutive years or by a single vote that wins a three-fifths supermajority in both chambers.
It’s not clear whether a broader set of legislators is willing to make those votes, especially with Murphy out of office. Gopal said he had not polled his colleagues broadly on changes to pardon powers.
“I can tell you my running mates and I are outraged,” Gopal said, adding he’d heard concerns about clemencies from members on both sides of the aisle.
Also unclear are what changes Gopal and his fellows might seek to make to gubernatorial pardon powers.
The senator said legislators were still in the process of determining how reformed pardon powers would function, a process that would include reviews of clemency authorities in other states.
Most commonly, clemency powers belong solely to the governor, though some states require a recommendation from a third-party board before the governor can issue a pardon or commute a sentence. Four states vest clemency powers solely in a board or advisory group, according to the ACLU.
“I think I would be potentially comfortable if there was a board that was not political that was a third-party board that looked at these types of reforms and politicians had nothing to do with it,” Gopal said.
Murphy convened a Clemency Advisory Board to solicit and review clemency applications and make recommendations in June 2024.
Sinha questioned whether an independent body could actually exist in New Jersey, noting any members would likely be nominated by the governor and could face Senate confirmation, including vetoes by individual legislators invoking senatorial courtesy, a tradition that allows senators to indefinitely and unilaterally block gubernatorial nominees from their home county or legislative district.
“They can all be influenced,” he said. “I don’t think that means we stop doing the work. I think it means we make sure there are objective, clear and transparent criteria to determine who gets clemency and who doesn’t.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0JS13124_1-1024x667.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)One of the biggest winter storms in at least a decade is expected to hit Pennsylvania Saturday night. Snow is projected to fall across the state with the National Weather Service forecasting anywhere between six inches to 18 inches, depending on the county.
Pennsylvanians are being reminded to limit their travel and stay sheltered — but for the more than 12,000 people  without homes, emergency shelters may be their only option.

The state’s 211 site lists 71 extreme weather shelters across the state, including ones that cater exclusively to men or women as well as one that focuses on LGBTQ services. Some operate as “Code Blue” shelters, meaning their doors open only if temperatures fall below a certain threshold. 
For examples of how they work, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reached out to a dozen organizations in different parts of the state, though most didn’t respond. 
The YMCA’s Allentown Warming Station plans to collaborate with several organizations — including the United Way, city and county services, Valley Youth House, Ripple Community, Inc., and Magellan Health — to open their doors two hours earlier on Saturday at 5 p.m. The building, which regularly houses 80 guests, will try to accommodate up to 85 with the storm. It is looking for additional community partners, according to a Friday email from Michael Reisman, the association’s director of communications. 
“A determination to return to regular warming station hours will be made on Monday. The YMCA is also looking to expand bed capacity during the storm, if needed,” said Reisman. 
Lehigh County diverted $10,000 in funds to help the shelter pay for the extra staffing, blankets and food, he noted. Thursday night was the first night the building hit its 80-person capacity. 
According to the 2025 Point-in-Time count, 401 people were unhoused in Lehigh County.
In Bradford County, vouchers to two hotels will be distributed through law enforcement to accommodate the extra need, according to county housing specialist Mary Sturdevant. 
“Nobody in this county, during this kind of situation, should need to go without shelter,” said Sturdevant.

Sturdevant shared that she once sheltered in her car decades ago when she was unhoused. 
“It’s still pretty fresh in my mind and I empathize, regardless of the reasons that people are unhoused,” she said. “I don’t want to see anybody suffer unnecessarily.” 
People in need must contact law enforcement, who will screen the requests before hotels can distribute the vouchers. Though normally capped at 10, Sturdevant said extras could be secured as needed during the forecasted weather. 
“These two hotels we work with are wonderful,” said Sturdevant, not sharing their names. “They’re so willing to do that social service piece for us. Without that, we really would not be able to pull this off.” 
Last year’s count identified 50 unhoused people, and Sturdevant said that planning ahead was tough financially. 
“We have a church-run shelter that’s small, so it’s already full,” said Sturdevant. “So when something like this comes up … they only have so much space. We offered this resource to expand on that already existing service.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/snow-day-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

Free.,"Trump to block foreign aid for transgender care, Vance tells anti-abortion rally",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-block-foreign-aid-transgender-care-vance-tells-anti-abortion-rally,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to expand a policy that blocks foreign aid dollars from going to organizations that discuss, refer or perform abortions to also include groups that address transgender health care or have policies on diversity, equity and inclusion, Vice President JD Vance said Friday.“We're expanding this policy to protect life, to combat DEI and the radical gender ideologies that prey on our children. And with these additions, the rule will now cover every non-military foreign assistance that America sends,” Vance announced at the March for Life anti-abortion rally on the National Mall.  “All in all, we have expanded the Mexico City Policy about three times as big as it was before,” he added. “And we're proud of it, because we believe in fighting for life.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom for more details on the policy expansion or when it would be implemented. Defending administration’s recordVance said during the rally he needed to “address an elephant in the room” that President Donald Trump and others in the administration have not made enough progress on anti-abortion initiatives during the first year of unified Republican control of the federal government.  “I want you to know that I hear you and that I understand,” he said. “There will inevitably be debates within this movement. We love each other. But we're going to have open conversations about how best to use our political system to advance life, how prudential we must be in the cause of advancing human life. I think these are good, natural and honest debates.”Vance mentioned that Trump nominated some of the Supreme Court justices that overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that had guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. He also noted that Republicans in Congress included a provision in the “big, beautiful” law that blocks Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year for any type of health care. Federal law had already barred funding from going to abortions, with limited exceptions.Vance argued that in addition to judicial rulings and federal laws, members of the anti-abortion movement must strive to change hearts and minds as well. “We're not trying to argue to the Supreme Court anymore,” he said. “We're trying to argue to our fellow citizens that we must build up that culture of life. And as you know, that effort is going to take a lot of time, it's going to take a lot of energy and it's going to take a little bit of money.”Later in his speech, Vance sought to discourage people from concentrating on professional lives and instead called on them to focus more on getting married and having children. “You're never going to find great meaning in a cubicle or in front of a computer screen,” he said. “But you will find great meaning if you dedicate yourself to the creation and sustenance of human life.”Trump didn’t attend the rally in person but recorded a video message that was played just before Vance spoke, telling attendees he “was proud to be the first president in history to attend this march in person” six years ago. “In my first term I was honored to appoint judges and justices who believed in interpreting the Constitution as written. That was a big deal. And because of that, the pro-life movement won the greatest victory in its history,” Trump said. “Now the work to rebuild a culture that supports life continues in every state, every community and every part of our beautiful land.”Calls for action on medication abortionTrump and some in his administration have come under scrutiny lately for not moving faster to complete a safety review of mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, which is approved for up to 10 weeks gestation. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and Lila Rose, founder of the anti-abortion group Live Action, both released statements in December calling on Trump to fire Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary over the pace of that review.Anti-abortion organizations want the administration to end the ability of doctors or other qualified health care providers to prescribe mifepristone and the second pharmaceutical used in medication abortion, misoprostol, via telehealth and have it shipped to patients. Several Republicans in Congress have joined their call, with Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., holding a hearing on mifepristone earlier this month. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected efforts from anti-abortion organizations to limit access to mifepristone in a June 2024 ruling, writing they never had standing to bring the lawsuit in the first place. Trump told House Republicans during a policy retreat at the Kennedy Center earlier this month they must be “flexible” about the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion with limited exceptions, in order to broker a health care deal that can reach his desk. Dannenfelser rebuked Trump for the comment, writing in a statement that to “suggest Republicans should be ‘flexible’ is an abandonment of this decades-long commitment. If Republicans abandon Hyde, they are sure to lose this November.”

GOP leaders tout major lawU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also spoke at the March for Life rally, touting the “big, beautiful” law as “the most pro-life and pro-family legislation that has been signed into law in decades.”“For the first time since Roe v. Wade was reversed, we have the White House, the Senate and the House all working together to deliver meaningful and historic pro-life victories,” he said. The law included several policies that Johnson said will aid Americans in having children, including an expansion of the child tax credit and the adoption tax credit as well as the investment accounts for babies. Johnson said the provision that blocks Medicaid patients from going to Planned Parenthood for non-abortion health care services, depriving the organization of that income, was a massive policy victory for Republicans. “We stand here today with one united voice to affirm the federal government should not be subsidizing any industry that profits from the elimination of human life,” Johnson said. New Jersey Republican Rep. Chris Smith, speaking just after Johnson while other GOP lawmakers stood on the stage, said eliminating access to mifepristone must be accomplished. “I've been here since Ronald Reagan's first election, 1981,” Smith said. “And I can tell you, this leadership is the most pro-life, so committed. And behind me are just absolute heroes. Men and women who take up the fight every single day.”Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., didn’t attend the rally in person but submitted a video that touted the Planned Parenthood defunding provision. ""Thanks to that landmark legislation, this year, some of the nation's largest abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, are prohibited from receiving Medicaid funding,"" Thune said. Other Republicans attending the rally included Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt, Arkansas Rep. French Hill, Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, Michigan Reps. Bill Huizenga and Tim Walberg, Minnesota Rep. Michelle Fischbach, Missouri Rep. Bob Onder, Pennsylvania Rep. Dan Meuser, South Carolina Rep. William Timmons, Texas Reps. Michael Cloud and Dan Crenshaw, Utah Rep. Mike Kennedy, Virginia Rep.

(Photo by Roberto Machado Noa/Getty Images)A pair of Florida Democrats have filed legislation that would in effect eliminate the state’s restrictive six-week abortion ban and other laws limiting abortion access and guarantee access to reproductive health care.
Called the Reproductive Freedom Act, the bills were filed on the 53rd anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States. It was undone by the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that returned abortion regulation to the states.
“The Reproductive Freedom Act would ensure all Floridians can access the full range of reproductive health care options, without the government looking over their shoulders in the exam room,” House Democratic Leader and HB 1151 sponsor Fentrice Driskell said. 
“I can’t think of a better time to announce this than the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. It was a decision that protected our grandmothers, mothers, and daughters until extremist judges and politicians took it away.”
A 2024 attempt to enshrine abortion rights in the Florida Constitution was supported by 57% of voters but failed to meet the 60% mark needed to pass. 
Pro-abortion right legislators are quick to remind Republican leadership that while the 2024 amendment failed it was supported by a majority of voters. Still, the proposals are unlikely to pass the Legislature at a time when the GOP supermajority seems intent of expanding restrictions on reproductive freedom — allowing would-be parents to file wrongful death suits for embryos, for example, and requiring public school children to watch “fetal development” videos as part of the academic curriculum. 
Fetal personhood, ‘free kill,’ sovereign immunity, and phosphates: It’s tort day in the House

Jacksonville Democrat Sen. Tracie Davis has filed identical legislation (SB 1308) in the Senate.
“You’ve heard us say this a thousand times before. And we’re going to keep saying it until we can change the law: All Floridians must have the freedom to make their own choices about their health care, in consultation with doctors who’ve taken an oath to act in their patients’ best interests,” Davis said. 
“At no time is a politician more qualified than individual patients and doctors trying to navigate unique, and sometimes life-threatening, health care decisions. We’re already facing a shortage of OBGYNs in this state and if we don’t pass the Reproductive Freedom Act, it’s only going to get worse.”
The bills wouldn’t alter or change any of the the state’s existing abortion statutes. Instead, they would modify the state’s  general public health laws, inserting legislative intent language into statute to make clear that the principles of individual liberty, personal privacy, and equality that are protected in the state Constitution ensure access to reproductive care.
The right to reproductive health care includes, but is not limited to:

A fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about the individual’s own reproductive health, including the right to use or refuse reproductive healthcare; and
A fundamental right to choose whether to continue the pregnancy and give birth or to obtain an abortion and to make autonomous decisions about how to exercise this fundamental right.

The bills would also amend public health statutes to make clear that “a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights” in Florida.
Lawmakers approve measure to allow doctors to withhold care because of ‘conscience’

The bills would amend statutes to ban the state, county, or local governments from denying or interfering with an individual’s fundamental right to access reproductive health care. The bills also would ban any state or local law enforcement agencies or officials from harassing or discriminating against an individual for providing or obtaining reproductive health care or for assisting another person in doing so. 
A 2023 law that prevents the use of state funds to foster travel to another state for abortion care and another law that bans a health care surrogate or proxy from consenting to an abortion on another person’s behalf also would be eliminated by the bills.

Boca Raton reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist Dr. Leah Roberts said that in many ways reproductive care is treated differently by lawmakers than other health care, with state legislatures more willing to intervene in its delivery.
“You know, there seems to be this carve out. You know, nobody’s gonna tell a cardiologist that they can’t, you know, put a stent in someone, but it seems to be looked at very differently when it comes to OBGYN care,” she said.
“I don’t think it’s a fair thing to be happening. I mean, I went to undergrad for four years, med school for four years, four years of residency. I practiced for a year and then did three more years of fellowship. So, certainly, I have just as much training if not probably a year or two more, than any cardiologist in regards to my organ system, which just happens to be, you know, only in women,” she said. “But it also affects men.”
ACLU of Florida Executive Director Bacardi Jackson said the bill would give every Floridian freedom over health care decisions.
“Decisions about whether and when to use birth control, whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and whether and when to grow a family are among the most personal decisions anyone will ever make. These choices shape our lives, our health, and our futures. Politicians are never more qualified than individuals, families, and their doctors to make these deeply personal decisions, and Florida’s laws must reflect that truth.”
The focus of the five-page bills is access to reproductive care but the legislation also would strike a 2023 statute that allows health care providers and payors to deny medical care based on conscience.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia delegates on Friday passed legislation that would allow the state’s Higher Education Policy Commission to set up a program to help students with food, health and hygiene products.
House Bill 4081 would establish the Higher Education Health and Aid Grant program. The bill passed with 71 to 22 vote. 
The program would allow the commission to set up a program to fund food pantries and health supplies at West Virginia colleges, said bill lead sponsor Jimmy Willis, R-Brooke. The bill does not allocate state funding for the program. Instead, it allows the commission to search for either public or private grant funding, Willis said. 
Willis said a student advisory counsel with the commission asked for the bill. 
The legislation is co-sponsored by Dels. Jeffrey Stephens, R-Marshall, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, Joe  Ellington, R-Mercer, Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell and Scot Heckert, R-Wood. 
Under the bill, colleges who receive the grant funding would be required to report to the higher education commission. Within a year of the grant being created, the commission would report to lawmakers about the progress of the grant, Willis said. 
The bill had some opposition, including from Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, who argued it could put taxpayers on the hook for paying for the program down the road. 
“Let me be clear, compassion is not the issue,” Anders said. “The issue is whether it’s the constitutional role of the state to create yet another possible government welfare program, especially one with no clear limits and no clear funding.”
He said he was troubled that the bill did not have a fiscal note that includes a cost estimate, specific funding source and what happens when the grants run out. 
“This bill does not directly appropriate a single dollar today, but that does not mean it is free,” he said. “What it does create is a mechanism, the framework for future appropriations. It authorizes a program first and possibly sends the bill to the taxpayers later. This is how government grows.”
Del. Henry Dillon, R-Wayne, urged lawmakers not to support the bill after asking for clarification that there’s not a way to limit the program to only West Virginia residents or U.S. citizens. 
Willis said there’s not a way to dictate which students would get assistance. 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, spoke in support of the legislation, saying that helping college students is a good use of taxpayer money. 
“I find it sick that some people in this room need a piece of paper to get up and talk about not wanting to help kids that need food or Band-Aids to be able to go to college,” she said. “What are we doing? If we want people to succeed, sometimes they might need help.” 
The legislation will next go to the West Virginia Senate for consideration.

Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat, is pictured at a May 2024 event at the Rhode Island State House.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)As threats and acts of violence against elected officials increase nationwide, the Rhode Island General Assembly will consider letting candidates for office use campaign funds for personal security.
The Safeguarding Election Candidates Using Reasonable Expenditures (SECURE) Act introduced Thursday by Senate President Pro Tempore Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat, would add home and office security systems to the list of ways state and local candidates can spend campaign money during an election cycle.
“Individuals who seek public office make many sacrifices, but they cannot be expected to sacrifice their personal safety,” Gallo said in a statement. “Far too often, we are seeing threats and acts of violence against elected officials at all levels of government. Elected officials and their families should not have to endure this, and we should be doing everything we can to ensure they are safe.”
In June 2025, two Minnesota lawmakers, House Speaker Melissa Hortman and Sen. John Hoffman, along with their spouses, were shot in their homes. Hortman and her husband died.
Closer to home, at least two members of the Senate leadership team, Senate President Valarie Lawson and Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, received emailed bomb threats in September, later determined to be hoaxes by Rhode Island State Police. 
Earlier this month, an envelope with a “suspicious white powder” was sent to the Rhode Island Department of State’s elections office in what Secretary of State Gregg Amore condemned as an “attempt to frighten” state elections administrators. One person was taken to the hospital as a precaution, according to news reports.
Gallo noted the “disturbing increase” in threats and violence against state and local officials.
“Violence has no place in our political discourse, of course, and it is imperative for the health of our democracy that candidates and public servants feel safe enough to run for office and to serve,” she said in the statement. “The SECURE Act provides candidates and officeholders a transparent way of protecting themselves, at no cost to the state, while maintaining the public’s trust in the integrity of our campaign finance rules.”
At least 20 states, including Minnesota and Massachusetts, let candidates for office spend campaign funds on security, according to the Vote Mama Foundation. Some have enacted formal legislation, while others developed security spending policies under ethics rulings, opinions from their attorneys general or secretaries of state. Some states allow officials to self-report spending campaign funds on security without penalty even though such expenditures are not expressly permitted. Cybersecurity, identity theft services and security for staffers are permitted in some states, along with physical security systems. 
The Federal Election Commission codified a 15-year practice, previously considered on a case-by-case basis, to let federal candidates spend money on security devices, personnel and software in September 2024.
Rhode Island’s existing campaign finance laws do not expressly ban security spending. Office equipment and supplies are among the authorized uses for campaign money, along with advertising, food, travel, consultants and employees, child care and donations to other political candidates and causes. But candidates are expressly prohibited from using campaign funds for “personal use,” including “any residential or household items, supplies or expenditures.”
Gallo’s bill, still awaiting a companion in the House, would cap candidate spending on home and office security at $10,000 per person per election cycle. Unrelated home improvements and firearms or ammunition would not be included in the permitted uses. 
Gallo did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday.
Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Board of Elections, which enforces state campaign finance laws for candidates and officeholders, declined to comment Friday, awaiting a formal review and vote by the elections panel on the legislation.
Gallo’s bill was immediately referred to the Senate Committee on Special Legislation and Veterans’ Affairs for review. A preliminary hearing has not been scheduled as of Friday.

Pannell, 44, has been at Grace House, a transitional sober living housing program for women in Jackson, since October. Pannell was sent there after she got out of prison. She began using drugs at age 14, and her addiction led to her losing communication with her family.
“I went to prison and caught that charge, and I got five and a half years over my head. So yeah, I got to get myself together,” she said, adding that she also wanted to be there for her granddaughter. 
Now in recovery, Pannell says she has changed a lot. She’s happy to be sober, though she struggles finding work because of the felony on her record.
“I’m glad I’m doing my recovery because I was going down a bad road. Now that I’ve stopped my drug use I’m better now. I’m doing a whole lot different.”
Pannell, along with several other people impacted by addiction, visited the Mississippi Capitol on Thursday for Mississippi Recovery Day.
Mississippi Recovery Day allows those impacted by addiction to share their stories and advocate for policies that support recovery. 
This year’s event was co-sponsored by End It For Good, a Mississippi-based non-profit that advocates for a health-centered approach to addiction rather than a strategy focused on criminal justice.
Christina Dent is the founder of End It For Good. A conservative Christian and foster mother, Dent changed her views on addiction after meeting the biological mother of one of her foster children.
“She had been struggling with an addiction for many years, and through getting to know her and seeing her, I realized she is a mom like me, who loves her son just as much as I love my sons.” 
Dent and her fellow advocates see addiction as a medical issue, not a moral or criminal justice one, and want policies that address it that way. Prior events focused on specific policies such as decriminalizing fentanyl testing strips and expanding access to Narcan. Both of those policies are now law.
Several other organizations sponsored the event, such as United Way of the Capitol Area and Mississippi Harm Reduction Initiative.
The Mississippi Senate formally recognized Recovery Day in the Senate Chamber. The attendees had a little over an hour to tour the Capitol, network and meet with their legislators before a press conference on the inner rotunda steps. After the press conference and lunch, some gathered at the All Recovery Meeting to share their experiences and connect with others.
Like Pannell, several attendees were either residents or graduates of Grace House. Emilee Shell is the director of Grace House and is a graduate of Grace House herself.
Last year, Grace House submitted a proposal to the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Advisory Council, but did not make the final list of recommended projects the state’s Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council shared with the Legislature. Shell hoped for Grace House to be reconsidered and to talk to lawmakers about increased access to detox programs and recovery residences. 
“People that are in recovery are some of the hardest workers, the biggest go-getters if you just give them a chance,” she said.
Like Pannell, Jerica Hill, 36, is a resident at Grace House who was inspired to get sober because of prison.
“I had a son. He’s six years-old right now, and when I lost custody of him and went to prison and everything, that’s when I realized I need to get sober,” she said.
Hill said her addiction also caused her to lose communication and trust with the rest of her family. She said that being sober is great, and that “you can actually really enjoy life.”
Stacey Spiehler, 45, fell into addiction after a traumatic childhood and several complicated pregnancies as an adult. Several members of her family struggled with addiction.
“I didn’t know how to handle my emotions. I didn’t know how to handle my fear. I didn’t know how to handle anything,” she said.
“There was one day where it was either a big bottle of vodka or a gun,” Spiehler said, and she chose the vodka.
Her addiction led to her becoming homeless. Over the next several years, she went to Matt’s House Shelter for Women and Children, brief stints in Brentwood Behavioral Health and St. Dominic’s Hospital, her mother’s house, a rehab in Chicago, Harbor House Chemical Dependency Services and finally Grace House.
She said Grace House was an important part of her recovery.
“Without that stable, kind of, floor to sit down on, chill out on, relax on and be around a whole lot of other women who had just beaten the same thing that I did, without that, I don’t know where I’d be,” she said.
She graduated from the University of Mississippi last year as a Lyceum Scholar and is president of the board for Families as Allies. She’s close with her family and ex-husband, and is an advocate for children with disabilities because of her son, who has autism and cerebral palsy.
Spiehler wants more lawmakers to listen to and understand people impacted by addiction. 
“We need kind, compassionate, informed paths to recovery,” she said.
During the press conference, legislators thanked the attendees for their advocacy and talked about supportive policies, and people impacted by addiction spoke in favor of health-centered approaches and non-traditional paths to recovery. 
“That’s the goal, a healthy thriving life, and we want to celebrate every step that a person takes that gets them closer to that healthy, thriving life,” Dent said.
In his speech, Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat from Byram, highlighted last year’s success in passing a state law that increased access to Narcan, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.
He told the attendees their presence in the Capitol was important. “We need you here to come here and talk about what is important to you because that’s the way that we get things done,” he said.
This year, Nelson is trying again to push a bill to take hypodermic syringes off of the drug paraphernalia crime list, which would allow for needle disposal programs.
Rep. Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, talked about a bill he authored to have state-funded clinical trials for ibogaine, a drug that could be used to treat opioid use disorder and mental health issues. The bill recently passed in the House and is now in the Senate.
“What it does is bring some of the most treatment-resistant, hardest-hit Mississippians into the kind of gold-standard they deserve for FDA-approved medical research,” he said.
Katie Scheel of Columbus credited medical cannabis with helping her recovery and making her healthier, calmer and a better mother. She spoke out against House Bill 1195, which restricts medical marijuana advertising.

Gov. Meyer Addresses Joint Session of General Assembly (picture by Brent Burdge)
DOVER, Del. (AP) — Governor Matt Meyer declared Delaware’s state “strong” in his annual State of the State address Thursday, casting a favorable light on the administration’s accomplishments.  It was  a laundry list, highlighting investments in education, health care, affordable housing, and economic development.  The address was held in the main House chamber.  Members of the Senate, the Judiciary, the Cabinet and leaders of higher education institutions were joined by other statewide elected officials.  The speech drew mixed reviews from the minority caucus in Dover.  There was a mix of bipartisan overtures at the state level, but some subtle barbs directed at the federal government.
Meyer opened the 47-minute speech by honoring Corporal Matthew “Ty” Snook, a state trooper killed in the line of duty last month.  Gov. Meyer presented Snook’s widow, Lauren, with the Order of the First State on behalf of her husband, calling it Delaware’s highest honor.
Despite recent difficulties, Meyer assured lawmakers, “The State of our State is strong.” He credited his administration’s efforts to “expand opportunity, protect affordability and keep communities safe.”
Education and Health Initiatives
Meyer announced a $50 million investment in early childhood education, supported by a national grant, and expanded access to childcare. He emphasized the adoption of the “Science of Reading,” increased funding for books and instructional kits, and a push to update the state’s school funding formula. “We are putting donated funds directly into teachers’ hands,” Meyer said.
On health care, Meyer cited federal funding for rural health transformation and plans for Delaware’s first medical school. “We will train physicians to serve statewide, expand training for nurses and physician’s assistants, and bring care directly into homes via telehealth and community health programs,” Meyer said.
Affordable Housing and Energy
Meyer pledged to streamline permitting and digitize approvals to make Delaware the most efficient state for building affordable housing, while preserving farmland and open space. He announced plans to replicate the HOPE Center model in Kent and Sussex counties.
Addressing energy costs, Meyer said, “Delmarva Power must stop overcharging Delaware families,” and called on the Public Service Commission to halt rate hikes. He advocated for the U.S. Wind project and bipartisan support for modern nuclear energy, saying, “Future economic success depends on generating more power within the state.”
Economic Development and Budget
Governor exits Joint Session (picture by Brent Burdge)
Meyer highlighted nearly 280,000 new business entities incorporated in 2025, crediting bipartisan leadership and Secretary of State Patibanda-Sanchez. He cited major investments from Merck, Aternium, Qnity, Incyte, and ILC Dover, and praised the Delaware Prosperity Partnership’s expanded mission to recruit large employers. The EDGE grant program has supported nearly 50 small businesses, and the Diamond State Port Corporation is advancing the Edgemoor Port expansion.
The governor said his upcoming budget proposal will return to “manageable growth — under 5%.”  He reported a 70% reduction in the unemployment claim backlog over the past year.
Public Safety and Closing Remarks
Meyer credited Attorney General Kathy Jennings and the Department of Justice for defending the state in federal funding disputes. He noted a marked reduction in shootings and praised New Castle County Police for disrupting a planned terrorist attack at the University of Delaware.
The address was closed by acknowledging various retirements (Supreme Court Justice Karen Valihura, Treasurer Colleen Davis, legislators Dave Lawson, Rich Collins, Charles Postles and David Sokola) and deaths (Governor Mike Castle, Dr. Jerome Lewis Charlie Paradee, John Kowalko, Ray Firmani and John Brady), with a closing acknowledgement to his parents and the First Lady, Dr. Lauren Meyer.
Republican Response
Tim Dukes (RD40) House Minority Leader
Jeff Spiegelman (RD11) House Minority Whip
A response was made by Rep. Tim Dukes (House Minority Leader) and Rep. Jeff Spiegelman (House Minority Whip).  Rep. Dukes opened with appreciation for the Governor’s sensitivity in awarding the Order of the First State to Corporal Snook’s widow.
Rep. Spiegelman stated, “the Governor leaned very heavily into positivity, things we can work on together.  There are things that we will disagree with, but we look forward to working on these with the majority party.”
A priority was placed on the importance of increasing power generation in the state to accelerate business growth and contain energy costs for consumers.
The governor’s priority for reducing permitting and various “red tape” involved in accelerating the creation of affordable housing.  The Minority response echoed this need but expanded this to include a broad spectrum of small businesses.  Rep. Spiegelman cited experience in his role as chair of the “Small Restaurant Task Force” as they went through the steps of starting a small restaurant business and saw firsthand the obstacles that small business owners face.
The minority caucus is looking forward to seeing the proposals that come forward to revise the school funding formula.  It seems unlikely that it will be completed this year, as a proposal has not yet been offered for review and discussion.
Both cited high interest in the Governor’s FY2027 Budget Proposal, expected next week.  His announcement of a less than 5% increase was seen as a welcome (if overdue) proposal, following five years of nearly 10% annual increases.
The Senate Minority Whip, Brian Pettyjohn, released a statement after the address regarding Meyer’s “partisan attacks”.  “Civility cannot be something we preach behind closed doors while publicly attacking Republicans in Congress, especially when Delaware’s rural health care expansion is being made possible by federal funding under HR1,” alluding to the federal legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.  “Delaware families deserve solutions, not finger-pointing.”",https://townsquaredelaware.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mayer-State-of-State-2026-4-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-23 14:56:59.057972

Outgoing Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham — who is term-limited by the Constitution from seeking reelection —  opened the 30-day legislative session with her final State of the State address and a message of finding common ground.
To underscore the theme, a video played in advance of the speech in which the governor shared a table in renowned Santa Fe breakfast spot Tia Sophia’s with several of her predecessors: Republican Governors Susana Martinez, Gary Johnson and Garrey E. Carruthers (former Democratic Gov. Toney Anaya joined by phone).
Unity notwithstanding, the crowd on the New Mexico House floor watching included some of this year’s Democratic contenders for Lujan Grisham’s position: Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman and former U.S. Interior Secretary and Congresswoman Deb Haaland (the third Democratic candidate, former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima, was in Denver, he told Source NM).

(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal and Kate Russell for Source NM)
It’s becoming crunch time for major party candidates — Democrats and Republicans — who must declare by Feb. 3 if they wish to participate in New Mexico’s June 2 primary elections. That declaration includes securing enough signatures from voters in their parties for the nominating petitions.
Independent, minor party and write-in candidates have until June 25 to submit their paperwork.
Here’s an overview of campaign activity in the opening month of 2026.
Another GOP contender

Another Republican candidate announced a returning bid for governor this week.
Doug Turner, the former chair of the New Mexico Judicial Standards Commission under former Gov. Johnson, and a longtime board member of the lobbyist organization Public Charter Schools of New Mexico, entered the race on Jan. 22.
“I grew up here, raised my family here, and built my business here — and I refuse to stand by and let New Mexico suffer any longer,” Turner said in his campaign announcement.
Turner, the founder of public relations firm DW Turner in Albuquerque, had an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2010, when Susana Martinez won the race.
Turner joins five other candidates seeking the Republican nomination: Gregg Hull, the mayor of Rio Rancho; Duke Rodriguez, a cannabis businessman and former cabinet secretary under former Gov. Gary Johnson; first-term state Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec); and James “Jim” Ellis, a former Public Regulation Commissioner appointed by Lujan Grisham in 2023, who served one year.
GOP candidate tangles with SOS over electronic signatures
Speaking of Rodriguez, his campaign is suing the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office for allegations the state’s elections officials violated public records laws.
Represented by former independent state Sen. Jacob Candelaria, Rodriguez and Kristina Caffrey, the chief legal officer for Rodriguez’s company Ultra Health, filed the Jan. 16 lawsuit in the 2nd Judicial District in Bernalillo County.
The complaint alleges the Secretary of State’s office violated New Mexico’s Inspection of Public Records Act by not fulfilling Caffrey’s request to see all of the electronic petition signatures submitted by candidates seeking the governor’s office and lieutenant governor’s office as of Dec. 31.
The Secretary of State’s office, in a letter closing the public records request, said that the office would not have the responsive records “until after the declaration of candidacy deadline” on Feb. 3. The complaint alleges the secretary of state’s office did not cite any allowable exceptions to deny the request under state’s public records law, and that a judge should compel the documents’ release.
Alex Curtas, director of communications for the Secretary of State’s office, told Source NM in an email Friday that the office had not been served with the suit, and he could not provide comment.
Rodriguez told Source NM in a statement that Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse OIiver’s own Democratic bid for lieutenant governor “makes transparency even more important.”
“Refusing lawful inspection and withholding public records is absolutely unlawful,” he said in a text message. “Every legal vote should count. That requires transparency, inspection, and accountability — not ‘just trust us.’”
This is not Rodriguez’s first foray into the courtroom this election season. In October before he officially declared, he filed suit in the New Mexico Supreme Court, contending that Lujan Grisham’s line item vetoes in the 2025 first special session were unconstitutional.
Liberal org eyes NM gov’s race
EMILYs List, an influential political action committee that backs Democratic candidates, announced this week that New Mexico’s gubernatorial race would be included in a plan to spend $15 million in campaigns across nine states.
In the Jan. 21 announcement, the PAC said it would back Haaland’s campaign for governor, saying that “EMILYs List is taking an aggressive approach to building Democrats’ state power in New Mexico with bold candidates who know exactly what’s at stake.”
In addition to New Mexico, EMILYs List said it would spend and organize to elect Democrats to state legislatures and other positions in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Larry Rhoden announced legislation Friday that would increase the punishment for threats or violent acts that prevent people from practicing their religion.
The crime is currently a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year of county jail time, a $2,000 fine or both. The proposed legislation would change the crime to a felony and allow a judge to send someone to a state prison for two years, fine them $4,000 or both.
“If religious liberties fail, any other liberty eventually fails with it,” Rhoden said during a press conference. “If someone decides to target a house of worship, there will be real consequences.”

He was “troubled,” he said, by recent events at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, where protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement actions disrupted a church service. A pastor at the church works for ICE, which has had thousands of agents in Minnesota conducting enforcement actions for weeks, stirring controversy with events including the fatal shooting of an unarmed 37-year-old woman, Renee Good.
South Dakota House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, a Republican from Spearfish, and Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff, a Republican from Pierre, are the prime sponsors of the bill.
Mehlhaff said it made him “angry” to watch as “out-of-state, professional agitators invaded the sanctuary of a church.”
“It’s not just shameful, in my opinion, it’s criminal,” Mehlhaff said. “This bill will send a message to these out-of-state agitators that if they come to South Dakota, they should plan to stay a while.”
The U.S. Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the St. Paul incident, and several people were arrested. There are federal laws against threats or violence that disrupt religious services.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)A retail worker arrested at a routine immigration check-in. A mother and a student, both asylum seekers, taken into custody. A civil engineer on a work visa and a corrections officer recruit, whose boss said he has a “squeaky clean” record and permission to work, both picked up during their commutes.
These are a few of the people U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have detained so far during their operation in Maine, which the agency said targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.” Accounts from family members, employers and background checks of those five people failed to show evidence of criminal records. Meanwhile, the incomplete list of arrests that the federal government has shared so far included 13 people with criminal records of the nearly 100 ICE said it has arrested. 
“The administration is taking 100% a dragnet approach to their operations,” said Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Part of that, Mehta said, is that cruelty is the point, designed to cause suffering and fear as a deterrent. But, it’s also happening because the government has the most information about immigrants who are already in proceedings, she said. 
With the Trump administration’s stated goal of 1 million deportations per year, the easiest people to go after are those the government already has personal identifying information about, Mehta said — “people that are checking in at their immigration interviews, people that are going to immigration court proceedings, people that have temporary protected status, people that are, again, lawfully here.” 
Available data underscores that. Not only has the number of people in detention surged during Trump’s second term, but also the percentage of ICE detainees with no criminal record. During the first nine months of Trump’s presidency, ICE arrested more than 74,000 people with no criminal record, amounting to more than a third of the total ICE arrests over that period, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project through a lawsuit against ICE.
Those figures don’t include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has reported record apprehensions in Maine, or people referred to ICE by other agencies.  
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, does not have complete information on all of the people who have been arrested in the first days of the operation in Maine but confirmed that several are asylum seekers following a lawful process. 
Maine leaders demand warrants, information about ICE arrests

On Tuesday in Maine, ICE detained Yanick Joao Carneiro of Portland at a routine immigration check-in at the agency’s Scarborough field office without a warrant, according to the petition filed by his lawyer. An asylum seeker from Angola, Carneiro was waiting for an immigration court hearing in 2027. Asylum seekers are typically allowed to live in the United States while their case proceeds.
Carneiro was the first person to challenge their detention after ICE began its increased enforcement in Maine, what the agency is calling “Operation Catch of the Day.” 
“While some of the door-to-door and apartment building raids may be targeted, it is clear the overall operation is anything but targeted,” Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project Executive Director Sue Roche said. “People are being racially profiled on the streets and in their cars. As is their playbook, ICE is doing everything they can to inflict maximum cruelty and chaos.” 
Arrests have become quicker and quieter, as opposed to the large workplace raids seen in Los Angeles last year. ICE is also reversing longstanding policy, according to an internal memo, by asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant.
“This is not the law as I understand it,” said Joyce White Vance, a former U.S. attorney who now lives in Maine, “and it is not the law that [the U.S. Department of Justice] has historically applied.” 
In Minnesota, where a federal agent’s fatal shooting of Renee Good sparked protests and subsequent deployment of thousands more agents, the federal government is re-examining the cases of refugees, who have gone through a robust screening process and are on a path to citizenship. During Trump’s second term, there have also been instances of judges tossing out asylum cases only for people to walk outside to find ICE waiting to arrest them. 
Maine Gov. Janet Mills on Thursday demanded the federal government provide arrest numbers, warrants and basic information about who is being detained. DHS told reporters on Thursday that 100 people have been arrested in the operation so far, up from the 50 reported by Fox News two days prior. 
When asked whether she has any reason to doubt the numbers provided by DHS, Mehta said, “I think it’s more that I don’t have any reason to trust the information.”










What does arrest mean? They've also arrested a ton of U.S. citizens, arrested lawful permanent residents.


– Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union


Mehta also said general arrest numbers don’t truly reveal what’s happening. 
“What does arrest mean?” Mehta questioned. “They’ve also arrested a ton of U.S. citizens, arrested lawful permanent residents.”
Jean-Pierre Obiang, an 18-year-old student at the University of Southern Maine, was detained after being involved in a minor traffic accident outside of Market Basket in Westbrook on Tuesday. He and his mother are asylum seekers from Gabon and have lived in Maine for three years.
In Portland on Wednesday, agents detained Micheline Ntumba after she dropped off one of her four children at Portland High School, her daughter told the Maine Monitor. Her daughter said Ntumba, who is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has a pending asylum claim and has been in the U.S. for nearly 10 years. 
Then Wednesday night, ICE agents arrested a Cumberland County corrections officer recruit, whose name has not been shared — leading County Sheriff Kevin Joyce to publicly question the agency’s priorities. 
Every corrections hire has to fill out documentation that proves they’re legally allowed to work in the U.S. and undergo background checks including on criminal history. The recruit had a “squeaky clean record,” as Joyce described it.   
“The book and the movie do not line up,” Joyce said, referring to ICE’s claims that they’re focused on criminals. He later added, “We’re being told one story, which is totally different than what’s occurring.”
On Thursday, agents took Juan Sebastian Carvajal-Munoz, a civil engineer, in Portland while he was on his way to work. Carvajal-Munoz, who is from Colombia and in the U.S. on a work visa, has since been released, according to one of his colleagues. 
DHS and ICE have not responded to questions about the basis for any of these detentions. 
Agents smashed Carvajal-Munoz’s car window and left the car running after taking him. Portland police officers went to the area after a report of a disturbance but identified no public safety concerns and did not take custody of the car, said spokesperson Brad Nadeau. The corrections officer’s car was also left after ICE detained him in Portland’s Bayside neighborhood.  
“They left it right on the side of the street,” Joyce said. “Folks, that’s bush league policing.” 
Across the country, federal agents have also left people’s vehicles and other personal belongings behind. The city of St. Paul paused the towing of abandoned vehicles due to the ICE surge in Minnesota. 
In Maine, the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and community organizers are mapping out a plan for a more coordinated system to return items to the family members of those detained. That type of grassroots effort to create de facto middle men has been seen in other states, too. 
Additionally, Maine organizers are helping loved ones get connected with legal counsel, as detention presents inherent challenges for due process. 
In the U.S., there is no right to appointed counsel for immigration proceedings because they’re civil, not criminal, matters. People in detention are less likely to get an attorney because facilities are often located in remote areas and because there are few places where attorneys can meet with their clients while they’re in custody, even by phone. 
In turn, Mehta said, that means people are left trying to navigate the complex system themselves and often unable to make claims. 
“You have people going through a faster, much more unfair process, where they are functionally being processed by the immigration court and expedited into a deportation system,” she said. “I think it would be absurd to pretend that it is a benefit for someone to be going through the proceedings while they’re in detention.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-ice-sign-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 14:56:59.057972

A man died by suicide using a gun hidden in his pants while in police custody Sunday morning, the Cheyenne Police said. Chief Mark Francisco said the department is “thoroughly evaluating what occurred and will take appropriate steps based on that review.”
The post Handcuffed man uses gun to kill himself in Cheyenne police vehicle, department says appeared[...]","A handcuffed man in the back of a Cheyenne police vehicle allegedly managed to retrieve a gun in his pants and use it to end his own life Sunday morning, the Cheyenne Police Department said Friday. 
The announcement, which came via the department’s Facebook page, didn’t share the dead man’s identity. 
The Cheyenne Police Department’s spokesperson hadn’t responded to WyoFile’s inquiries about the in-custody death as of publication. The Laramie County Coroner’s office declined to comment on the incident. 
Cheyenne Police Department Chief Mark Francisco said in the Facebook announcement that the department is “thoroughly evaluating what occurred and will take appropriate steps based on that review.” 
The post didn’t say if an outside agency would be involved in the investigation. Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation Commander Ryan Cox told WyoFile on Friday morning that the Cheyenne Police Department hadn’t contacted the division about the incident. 
Around 1:17 a.m. on Jan. 18, officers responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle near the intersection of West 9th Street and Deming Drive, the post says. 
When officers arrived, they found a maroon pickup parked on the sidewalk. According to the post, the truck appeared to have hit a guardrail before stopping in a grassy area off the road. 
According to body cameras and in-car video, the post states, officers started searching the nearby area for the driver. During the search, they saw a man running along Deming Drive. The officers learned he was the truck owner. 
The man appeared intoxicated and said he had consumed alcohol, according to the post. Officers detained him and removed a pocketknife from the man’s front pocket before handcuffing him. 
The post doesn’t say whether officers conducted a full search of the man. 
Officers then seated the man in a police car and transported him back to the crash scene. Officers then “briefly stepped away” from the police car while the man was still inside to assess the scene, the post states. The post doesn’t specify exactly how long officers were away from the vehicle, but that they were preparing to start a driving under the influence investigation. 
According to the post, the man was able during this time to move his handcuffed hands from behind his body to the front and reach a gun that was inside his pants. The post doesn’t clarify why officers didn’t notice that the man had a firearm. When officers returned to the police car, they allegedly discovered that the man had used the firearm to shoot himself. 
Officers started to give first aid until medics arrived, but the man died, the post says. 
“Any in-custody death is a matter of deep concern for our department — this is never the intended outcome when officers respond to moments of crisis,” Francisco said in the Facebook post. 
“Our officers approached this situation with patience and compassion, with the intent of helping the individual.”

Josh Stein warns of a coming winter storm and lingering dangerous conditions on Jan. 23, 2026. (Photo: NC.gov) Gov. Josh Stein and other state officials urged residents to get ready to stay at home and off the roads as a winter storm moves through the state this weekend, making travel unsafe and likely causing power outages. 
“This is a serious storm,” Stein said. “We’re taking it seriously, and so should you.”
A mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain are expected to fall over the weekend, starting at midday Saturday. It’s likely that there will be enough ice accumulation to break tree limbs and bring down power lines, said NC Emergency Management Director Will Ray. 
Power outages could last for days, Stein said, and icy roads will make for dangerous driving into next week.  
“Plan for the possibility that you’ll be stuck at home for a few days,” he said. 
Stein declared a state of emergency on Wednesday. 
The state Department of Transportation has spread 2.8 million gallons of brine on roads and is ready to plow and salt them when the storm starts, Stein said. 
Utilities have assembled 18,000 workers from around the country to help restore power, he said. 
Residents should prepare by making sure they have enough medication, water and non-perishable food for three to five days for each person and pet in their household. He advised residents to have a plan for keeping warm in case their power goes out, and to think about who they’ll call if they need help.

(Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)After a year of ongoing measles outbreaks that have sickened more than 2,400 people, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.
“It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel,” Abraham said. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
Infections from other countries, however, accounted for only about 10% of measles cases detected since Jan. 20, 2025, the official start of the deadly measles outbreak in West Texas, which spread to other states and Mexico. The rest were acquired domestically.
This marks a change since the U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. Measles occasionally popped up in the U.S. from people infected abroad, but the cases rarely sparked outbreaks, because of extremely high rates of vaccination. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strongly prevent infection and halt the virus’ spread.
To maintain its measles elimination status, the U.S. must prove that the virus has not circulated continuously in the nation for a year, between Jan. 20, 2025, and Jan. 20, 2026. To answer the question, scientists are examining whether the major outbreaks in South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Texas were linked.



The latest on South Carolina’s outbreak
Since the outbreak started in October, 700 people in the Upstate have been diagnosed with measles, according to the state health department’s Friday update.
South Carolina has the nation’s largest ongoing outbreak, with the total number of cases second only to Texas’ 800-case outbreak last year, which has since ended, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Students at 20 Upstate schools were among 485 people in quarantine Friday. The most recently exposed in that group will end their 21-day quarantines Feb. 14.
After weeks of steady upticks in cases, the numbers skyrocketed at the beginning of January. Over the past week, the case number grew by 142, according to the state health department.
A dozen people in the state have been hospitalized for measles. The agency does not track the severity of cases and did not give more information about those patients’ conditions.
The outbreak remains centered in Spartanburg County, where 668 of the cases were reported, but the virus has spread to nearby Greenville, Anderson and Cherokee counties, according to the health department.
Most of those sickened are under the age of 18, and at least 88% of everyone who contracted the disease were unvaccinated.
Vaccination against measles is extremely effective, officials continue to stress. Vaccines, typically given during childhood in two doses, are available at doctors’ offices, clinics and through statewide mobile health units.
Symptoms of measles typically start with a fever, followed by a rash that usually begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. Severe cases can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, which can be fatal.

Health officials confirmed that the main measles virus strain in each of these outbreaks is D8-9171. But because this strain also occurs in Canada and Mexico, CDC scientists are now analyzing the entire genomes of measles viruses — about 16,000 genetic letters long — to see whether those in the United States are more closely related to one another than to those in other countries.
The CDC expects to complete its studies within a couple of months and make the data public.
Then the Pan American Health Organization, which oversees the Americas in partnership with the World Health Organization, will decide whether the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status. And that would mean that costly, potentially deadly, and preventable measles outbreaks could become common again.
“When you hear somebody like Abraham say ‘the cost of doing business,’ how can you be more callous?” said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an online discussion hosted by the health blog Inside Medicine on Jan. 20.
“Three people died of measles last year in this country,” Offit added. “We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 — eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of.”
Abraham said vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles but that parents must have the freedom to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, and vaccine rates have dropped. A record rate of kindergartners, representing about 138,000 children, obtained vaccine exemptions for the 2024-25 school year.
Information on vaccines has been muddied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously founded an anti-vaccine organization. He has undermined vaccines throughout his tenure. On national television, he has repeated scientifically debunked rumors that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death.
Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, disparaged the Trump administration’s focus on finding genetic technicalities that may spare the country’s measles-free status. “This is the wrong thing to pay attention to. Our attention has to be on stopping the outbreaks,” she said.
“If we keep our status, it should be because we have stopped the spread of measles,” she said. “It’s like they’re trying to be graded on a curve.”
The Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to assist West Texas during the first critical weeks of its outbreak and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to KFF Health News investigations.
However, the agency stepped up its activity last year, providing local health departments with measles vaccines, communication materials, and testing.
Abraham said HHS would give South Carolina $1.5 million to respond to its outbreak, which began nearly four months ago and had reached 646 cases as of Jan. 20.
If the CDC’s genomic analyses show that last year’s outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country’s status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August.
And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country’s status: “They’ll say, who cares.”
Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a reporter from Stat that a reversal in the nation’s status would not be significant: “Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread.”
Data shows otherwise. Case counts last year were the highest since 1991, before the government enacted vaccine policies to ensure that all children could be protected with measles immunization.

More than 3,700 people have worked full time or part time on the Vineyard Wind project since development began almost a decade ago, amounting to more than $380 million in direct employee salaries, wages and benefits.
The project also exceeded its local hiring goals, with more than 70% of union labor coming from southeastern Massachusetts.
That’s all according to a new report Vineyard Wind quietly released late last month to unions and the state’s energy department.
The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, which established the reporting requirement with the wind project, said the annual reporting provides transparency and helps the state assess the industry’s impacts.
“The Vineyard Wind project has created thousands of good-paying local jobs, training and workforce development to create career pathways for residents of southeastern Massachusetts, and millions of dollars in economic benefits to New Bedford and the state,” said DOER Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony in an email.
“Vineyard Wind demonstrates that additional offshore wind projects would bring immense benefits to Massachusetts, including lowering energy costs and moving us closer to energy independence,” she continued.
Vineyard Wind declined The Light’s interview request and request for comment.
Of those employed, about 40% were members of a union, though last year, most of the jobs (73%) were held by nonunion workers. Most of the jobs were created during the last four years of construction, with 3,300 people working during this period either part time or full time.
The project was set to finish by March, but was hit with a suspension order by the Trump administration last month halting all construction. The New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal is mostly empty now, save a crew of 35 to 40 workers, one tower and several blade sets.
David Borges, the report’s author and visiting faculty at UMass Dartmouth, has been tracking the project since 2017 with data provided by the wind company and its subcontractors.
The project fell short, again, of its self-imposed hiring goals for minority and women union workers, which the company attributed in part to “broader, long-standing demographic challenges” in the male-dominated field of construction, he wrote.
Through September 2025, about 70% of union workers lived in Southeastern Massachusetts, which exceeded Vineyard Wind’s target of 51%. The region is fairly broad in this report, defined as Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Nantucket or Plymouth counties; 54% resided in Bristol County.
The 70% figure includes those who temporarily relocated for the job (estimated to be 113 people, or 7% of the region’s total).
Local hiring in New Bedford peaked in 2024 and 2025, when 22% of the project workforce each year was city residents, according to figures provided by Borges that were not in the report. A small number of people in these counts may have temporarily relocated to the city.
As for nonlocals, many came from port regions in Louisiana and Texas, Borges said, where the oil industry has long employed people with related skills. Others came from overseas, though people who never had “boots on the ground” (i.e. stayed offshore and on vessels) were not counted.
Foreigners weren’t just white collar office staff, Borges noted. They were also skilled in construction, bringing years of experience working for the mature wind industry overseas.
“We’re sort of in this space where there’s not enough pipeline of local workforce,” he said. “That was the hope in the long run, but people don’t want to get training for a job that might not exist.” (He’s, of course, talking about the hits the industry has incurred since President Donald Trump assumed office again last year.)
Aaron Waechter, a union millwright from New Hampshire, is a crew lead for tower installation offshore. He’s worked alongside Danish, French, Belgian, British, Romanian, Polish, Dutch and Spanish experts on a specialized installation vessel since 2023. Among Americans, it’s been a mix of union and nonunion workers from New England and beyond, he said.

“The word ‘steady’ isn’t always in our vocabulary. Offshore wind has provided extremely steady work,” said Andy Benedetto, business representative for New England’s millwrights union.
Some millwrights, he said, found at least two years of consistent work at the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal. It’s been a change from the seasonal, sporadic work to which they’re accustomed.
Waechter, a husband and father with young children, said the job has provided consistency. He works three weeks offshore, and then is off for three weeks.
“I know a lot of people who having this type of work available has made an impact on what they’re able to do for their families,” he said. “Before this, I would travel across the country to where there was work.” Sometimes, it meant being away for two months.
“This job gave me a fixed schedule,” he said. “It’s been really good for the kids and for my wife.”
The wind project directly paid or spurred more than $620 million in labor spending, Borges calculated, defined as the sum of all payments made to employees, including wages, salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes. This figure includes people not employed by Vineyard Wind, but by businesses and companies contracting with the project.
Borges included a headcount figure in his report, in addition to the more nebulous industry standard of full-time equivalents (or FTEs). One FTE represents work fulfilled by a 9-to-5, five days a week, 52 weeks a year position. (Two or three part-time workers can amount to one FTE.)
“I have each employee who has ever worked on the project in a database,” Borges said. “I can see month to month how many hours they worked. They leave, they come back. Some work for a week.”
John Dunderdale, business manager for Piledrivers Local Union 56, said the latest jobs report tells the success story of union labor rising to the occasion and meeting the needs of the new offshore wind market.
He estimates about 250 members — piledrivers, carpenters and millwrights — worked on the project at various points, including as many as 50 piledrivers during installation of the turbine foundations.

But with construction nearly done, he said he has maybe one piledriver left on the job. Dozens of union workers have since moved on to help with other projects, such as Revolution Wind and New York’s Empire Wind.
 Economic impacts

Borges also measured indirect impacts, broadly defined as supply chain spending. It would include a company hired for Vineyard Wind, as an example, contracting with a local ship repair business in New Bedford.
“That creates increased demand for services. That supplier in turn has to hire new people or buy new supplies to fill in,” Borges said. Other examples include subcontractors patronizing a city print shop, fuel station, or food supplier.
Induced impacts, another category Borges measured, are estimated using a model that factors in federal data, like census counts and labor statistics. He feeds the model with data provided by Vineyard Wind, businesses and employers, and the model adds a multiplier that estimates how much of a ripple effect a dollar spent has in a community.
In all, he estimated that Vineyard Wind to date has created $1.9 billion in economic output in Massachusetts, from the project’s direct spending down to an employee’s household spending in a community.
It is just an estimate, and Borges said one challenge is that this industry is new to the U.S., so there’s no historical data specific to offshore wind to work with.
Consistent with the project wrapping up, fewer people and hours were being worked by the fall of 2025 — the fourth year of construction. Most of the work went to nonunion members, with about half of them coming from out of state.
Once the project enters the long-term operations and maintenance phase, which is set to last at least 20 years, Vineyard Wind expects to create 80 to 100 permanent jobs. However, for at least the first few years, some of the jobs may be held by employees of the turbine manufacturer, GE Vernova.
Borges’ contract with Vineyard Wind is set to end in March, but he hopes to issue a final report summarizing everything he’s tracked for almost a decade.

Travis Holdman, R-Markle, speaks during a 2025 Senate committee meeting. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)President Donald Trump has taken direct aim at a high-ranking Indiana state senator who voted against the congressional redistricting plan by endorsing a potential Republican primary challenger.
A social media post from Trump Thursday night blasted Sen. Travis Holdman as a RINO — Republican in name only — “who, for whatever reason, voted against Redistricting in Indiana, in a District that I won by 39 points, which puts the United States Congress in jeopardy.”
Trump’s post said he would give “my Complete and Total Endorsement” to Blake Fiechter, a Bluffton City Council member whom the post called “a True America First Patriot.”
Holdman, who has been in the Senate since 2008, is the chamber’s third-ranking member as majority caucus chair and also is chair of the influential Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee.
Holdman is seeking reelection in Senate District 19 that includes all or parts of Adams, Allen, Blackford, Jay and Wells counties in northeastern Indiana.

Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Gov. Mike Braun and other redistricting supporters have repeatedly threatened political vengeance against Republican legislators who opposed Trump’s demand for a redrawing of Indiana’s U.S. House maps aimed at helping the GOP win all nine seats.
“We could have easily picked up two seats in Indiana, so Holdman, an America Last politician, put our Majority in the House of Representatives at risk, thereby putting our Country in a very dangerous position in losing some of the magnificent gains that we have made over the last year,” Trump’s post said.
Holdman did not immediately reply Friday to messages from the Indiana Capital Chronicle seeking comment.
Holdman made himself a Trump target in November by announcing: “The message from my district has been clear — they do not support mid-cycle redistricting, and therefore I cannot support it.”
He was among 21 Republicans who joined all 10 Democratic senators in opposing the redistricting plan when it failed in a 31-19 vote on Dec. 11.
Trump’s endorsement of Fiechter is the first the president has made since he started making his political threats months ago.
Fiechter is a real estate broker who is in his first term as an at-large member of Bluffton’s city council after winning election in 2023.
Fiechter did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment about his political plans.
He had not filed a candidacy for the Senate seat or opened a state campaign fundraising committee by midday Friday, according to Indiana Election Division online records.

North Haven’s school board filed that lawsuit in state court on Jan. 8. (Click here to read the 14-page complaint in full.)
While New Haven’s Board of Education has yet to file an appearance or formal response in the case, Mayor Justin Elicker described the lawsuit as “incredibly disappointing” and urged North Haven to drop the matter as the two sides work to resolve disagreements over the interpretation of relevant state law. 
CT Insider’s Jessica Sims first reported on the lawsuit.
The lawsuit claims that New Haven owes North Haven a total of $508,981.73 for special education services dating back to 2020. It accuses New Haven of “consistent refusal” to pay legally required costs associated with educating city students who attend North Haven Public Schools. New Haven has been sending students to North Haven as part of the Open Choice Program since 2020.
The lawsuit comes several months after New Haven Public Schools (NHPS) Chief Finance Officer Amilcar Hernandez reported in August that the district was actively contesting $589,000 in unspecified special education-related tuition costs.
According to North Haven’s lawsuit, between the 2020-21 through the 2024-25 school years, New Haven made partial payments but still owes North Haven more than $500,000.
The year-by-year breakdown included in the filing shows that for the 2020–21 school year, North Haven invoiced New Haven $66,075.18, with $38,538.18 remaining unpaid after partial payment. For 2021–22, North Haven invoiced New Haven $211,768.99, with $185,346.04 left unpaid. In 2022–23, the invoiced amount was $185,053.20, with $185,053.20 still owed. For the 2023–24 school year, North Haven billed $132,367.55, of which $111,431.21 remains unpaid. In 2024–25, North Haven invoiced $212,854.81, which North Haven states remains fully unpaid.
The lawsuit cites Connecticut General Statutes §10-266aa, which requires “sending districts” to pay “receiving districts” a portion of the reasonable cost of providing special education services. North Haven argues that under this state law, New Haven has no legal basis to refuse payment. The lawsuit states that New Haven’s actions have been “to the detriment of North Haven’s students.”
Despite the alleged nonpayment, North Haven has been forced to provide all required educational accommodations and special education services to New Haven students, as required under state law and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
The lawsuit also notes that New Haven has “never questioned, challenged, or otherwise objected to the reasonableness of the services plaintiff North Haven has been providing.”
The lawsuit warns that the financial dispute is likely to continue into the current school year and after unless resolved by the court. It also names Executive Director of Student Services Typhanie Jackson as the person who has allegedly “refused” to compensate North Haven for its services, as Jackson is the supervisor of the Open Choice Program for New Haven. The lawsuit states that Jackson “represented to plaintiff that defendant would participate and comply with the law relating to the Open Choice Program, including that defendant New Haven would meet its obligation under these laws.”
“Defendant New Haven acting through Jackson, knew or should have known that such representations were false,” the lawsuit concludes.
Mayor: ‘Reasonable’ Definition In Dispute
In response to the lawsuit, New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker criticized North Haven for its decision to pursue legal action in this case, calling the move “incredibly disappointing.”
In a statement provided to the Independent Friday, Elicker — who is also a voting member on the Board of Education — said that New Haven’s and North Haven’s school boards interpret the state law differently. “There is clearly a disagreement between our school districts on the interpretation of the state statue on this matter and what qualifies as ‘reasonable’ special education costs,” Elicker said, “and that needs to be resolved and clarified by our districts and the state.”
He added that the lawsuit will result in significant legal fees and staff time that would be better spent supporting students and teachers in classrooms for both school districts.
“Just like our municipalities are working together on important regional issues, our school districts should be working together as well to advocate for more special education funding for all our students, not  pitting ourselves against each other,” Elicker said. “I sincerely hope that North Haven Public Schools will reconsider this lawsuit and that our school districts can work together to find an amicable solution that provides our students with the resources and supports they need.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023_0810_SR_NorthHavenTownHall_004-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 18:57:48+00:00,CT Mirror,CT health plan subsidies set to be available beginning Feb. 1,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/ct-access-health-ct-plan-subsidies/,Access Health CT said it will launch an enrollment period Feb. 1 for eligible customers to enroll in coverage with the new state subsidy.,"On Feb. 1, qualifying Connecticut residents will be able to access newly available state funds to help cover the cost of purchasing ACA health plans purchased through Access Health CT. 
In December, Gov. Ned Lamont announced $115 million to provide assistance to certain residents in the face of vanishing federal subsidies. Earlier this week, a high-ranking budget official said it could take months to deliver the planned relief and that the state’s health exchange might not reflect the assistance until late March.
On Friday, Access Health CT announced that it will launch a special enrollment period beginning Feb. 1 for eligible customers to enroll in coverage with the new state subsidy. Its end date hasn’t yet been announced. The special enrollment period is also separate from the current open enrollment period, which ends Jan. 31. 
State subsidy amounts will be applied to the beginning of a customer’s 2026 enrollment period, a spokesperson with Access Health confirmed. 
“When Republicans in Washington stripped away critical Affordable Care Act subsidies, millions of Americans, including thousands here in Connecticut, were left vulnerable and at risk of losing coverage. We could not stand by and watch families face skyrocketing costs,” said Lamont in a statement on Friday.
The deadline for Congress to extend COVID-era financial assistance for ACA health plans, known as enhanced premium tax credits, lapsed on Dec. 31. In the wake of a failed federal vote in December to extend the subsidies for three years, Lamont announced that Connecticut would step in to fill some of the gaps.
The state subsidies will help two groups that are particularly impacted by the expiration of the federal tax credits — those who earn the least and those who lost all federal financial assistance.
Anyone who earns between 100% and 200% of the Federal Poverty Level and hasn’t already signed up for CoveredCT is eligible for the special enrollment period and will receive enough state assistance to make up for all of their expiring federal assistance. CoveredCT provides no-cost plans to low-income families that earn slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid.
Those earning between 400% and 500% of the FPL can also sign up during the special enrollment period and will qualify for enough state assistance to replace half the amount of their expiring federal subsidies.
Customers who have already enrolled in a plan will see a credit applied through their insurer, according to a press release from Access Health CT. 
Enrollees won’t see the state subsidy amount reflected in the online system until Access Health’s system updates go live in March, an Access Health CT spokesperson confirmed. But enrollees will soon receive a notice in the mail confirming the amount of their subsidy. Insurance companies will also send updated premium bills that reflect the credit from the state subsidy.
The funding for subsidy replacement will come from $500 million in state reserves designated during the November 2025 special session, which was intended to potentially backfill federal cuts to nutrition, health care, heating assistance and other human service programs until the next General Assembly session starts Feb. 4.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AHCT-storefront1-spanish-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-23 14:03:10.144870

Lawmakers estimated it will cost the state $155 million each year the deductions are in effect.

The Legislature every year must adopt an annual tax conformity bill, because Idaho essentially uses the federal tax code as a template for its own. The annual bill often just changes the tax year date or makes other small technical changes. 
“This is a much bigger bill this year,” Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said in the House Revenue and Taxation Committee on Friday. 
There are about 39 tax code changes from the massive federal tax and spending bill — such as no taxes on a worker’s tips, no taxes on some workers’ overtime, and various business deductions — most of which have financial implications for the state. 
How Idaho conforms to ‘big, beautiful’ bill amid budget woes will be central to 2026 Legislature

Ehlers presented a bill that would adopt nearly all the changes. Idaho had previously “de-coupled,” or chose to not adopt federal tax changes related to bonus depreciation, which is an immediate business tax write-off for certain long-lasting assets, so his bill did not include those changes. 
Ehlers estimated the changes will cost $155 million annually, which is the same as what the governor projected in his budget proposal. 
Idaho had entered the year facing a projected budget deficit, and although revenues have largely been projected to stabilize in the last state revenue report, lawmakers are still weighing major cuts to keep the budget balanced. 
Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, questioned Ehlers’ cost estimate, noting that other states’ estimates have been much higher, as well as the analysis by the nonprofit Tax Foundation. 
Idaho officials have cited estimates on the cost of adopting all the tax changes that ranged from $115 million to around $400 million, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
“We have to get the fiscal impact down first before we can proceed, so that we know exactly what the impact is,” Gannon said. 
 The timing of tax conformity may impact Idaho Tax Commission 

Ehlers’ bill also adopts the same retroactive timing of the federal changes. For personal taxes, people may deduct expenses going back to Jan. 1, 2025. For the business research and experimentation deduction, the changes are retroactive to 2022. 
This would not only have a more immediate impact on the state’s revenue, but it also would have a more immediate impact on the state agency that administers tax policy. 
In a summary document created by the Idaho State Tax Commission, obtained by the Sun through a public records request, the agency said adoption on 2025 taxes will mean the commission must “immediately redesign forms, direct software vendor updates, and provide revised training for tax professionals.”
“This will also result in taxpayers having to file amended returns,” the summary document said.  
Idaho Legislative Guidebook: How is the state budget set?

The document said that if the state chose instead to adopt the changes effective Jan. 1, 2026, the commission would have nine months to a year to complete those tasks. 
“The agency will have time to communicate the changes to taxpayers, and fewer taxpayers will have to file amended returns,” the document said. 
Asked why he chose to use the retroactive to 2025 date, Ehlers noted that some of the changes expire in 2028, such as the no taxes on tips or overtime. 
“If we don’t allow them to take it in 2025, then they’re missing one of the four years,” Ehlers said in an interview. “So that’s like 25% of the benefit; they’re only going to take it for the three years. So, we wanted to make sure that they got the full four years of the One Big Beautiful Bill.” 
The business deductions that go back to 2022 also did not concern Ehlers. He said that the revenue dips the state saw in November were likely due to businesses already changing behavior under the assumption that the state would adopt that tax deduction. Staff from the Division of Financial Management echoed this prediction during a previous hearing on the state’s economic outlook and revenue. 
He said he was confident the Tax Commission could adjust to the changes in time for people to pay their 2025 taxes. 
“We’ve made it happen in the past in a (significantly) reduced timeline,” Ehlers said. “We’ve done it every year, and we can do it again this year.”

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)In 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared that the role of a state attorney in Florida is to “apply the law and enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws you like and which laws you don’t like.”
Now critics are asking if the same goes for the state’s attorney general, James Uthmeier.
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Uthmeier announced in an advisory opinion that he wouldn’t enforce approximately 80 state laws that he alleges are unconstitutionally race-based, prompting a furious response from Black Democrats at a press conference Thursday in Tallahassee.
One of those legislators, Sen. Mack Bernard, D-West Palm Beach, argued DeSantis should remove Uthmeier from office, citing the precedent he set in 2022 when he suspended then-Hillsborough County Democratic State Attorney Andrew Warren.
“I’ve been a lawyer for over 23 years in this state of Florida and that as a lawyer, you’re supposed to follow the laws, and the laws that were passed by this Legislature, by this body, the House and the Senate, are the laws of this state,” Bernard said. “And if the attorney general does not want to follow the laws of this state, I’m declaring that I think that the governor should remove him today.”
Warren is now responding to Uthmeier’s advisory opinion and the fact that DeSantis is unlikely to do anything to Uthmeier, his former chief of staff and hand-picked choice to succeed Ashley Moody in the AG’s seat.
“The hypocrisy of the governor and flunkies is off the chart,” Warren told the Phoenix in a text message. “They’ve falsely accused others of selectively enforcing the law while treating the Constitution like a suggestion box. It’s abhorrent to lecture us about the rule of law while rewriting it in crayon.”
What DeSantis said when he suspended Warren
In comments during a press conference in Tampa announcing his suspension of Warren on Aug. 4, 2022, DeSantis criticized the prosecutor for “picking and choosing” which laws to enforce, referring to his pledge to not pursue charges under new state laws criminalizing abortion and gender transition treatments, as well as policies not to prosecute some low-level crimes.
“The role of the state attorney is to apply the law and enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws you like and which laws you don’t like,” as reported at the time by WTVT-Fox 13 in Tampa. “This is a law-and-order state. We’re not going to back down from that one inch. We’re not going to allow locally elected people to veto what our state has decreed through our legislative process.”
The governor went on to say, “When you’re saying you’re not going to enforce certain laws that you don’t like, that’s neglect of duty. … That quite frankly is incompetence as defined in Florida law.”
Warren legally challenged his 2022 suspension in federal court. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle ruled that DeSantis had violated the First Amendment in removing Warren because of political differences and anticipated “political benefit” to the governor. Hinkle added, however, that he lacked power to reinstate Warren.
Warren appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which in January 2024 ordered Judge Hinkle to reconsider because the First Amendment protected some of the justifications that DeSantis used in removing Warren from a job he’d been elected to twice as state attorney for Hillsborough County. The DeSantis administration then asked for a rehearing in front of the full appeals court panel of 12 judges.
Warren chose to run again for state attorney in Hillsborough County in November 2024, but lost to Republican Suzy Lopez, whom DeSantis had appointed to replace him.
In January 2025, that appeals court finally ruled, saying that Warren’s legal challenge was now moot because his term had ended.
Bills filed this legislative session would address some of the laws that Uthmeier has declared are unconstitutional, such as SB 1662, filed by Stan McClain, R-Ocala, which would prohibit executive government agencies from using racial or gender preferences or quotas when making certain decisions.
Another measure, HB 1189, by Rep. Judson Sapp, R-Green Cove Springs, would remove provisions requiring the governor to consider appointees to certain commissions reflecting Florida’s racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, and prohibit executive agencies from considering racial or gender preferences or quotas when making hiring decisions.
Neither has been heard yet in committee.
Meanwhile, Warren is now serving as the deputy legal director at Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to strengthening American democracy. On Friday he filed a piece on MS NOW’s website about special prosecutor Jack Smith’s appearance on Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of state lawmakers advanced legislation Friday asking voters to put restrictions on eminent domain in the state constitution, after the measure’s supporters argued South Dakotans need stronger protections than the law banning eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines adopted last year.
Eminent domain is the power to take private property for public use, with just compensation to the landowner. Although eminent domain is often used for water pipelines, electrical transmission lines and other infrastructure, it’s been a divisive issue in South Dakota the last several years because of a proposed multi-state carbon capture pipeline that would pass through the eastern part of the state.
The Legislature’s House State Affairs Committee voted 10-3 on Friday at the Capitol in Pierre to send the new eminent domain resolution to the full House of Representatives. If passed by the House and Senate, the measure will go on the ballot for the November general election.

Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, introduced the bill. He told lawmakers the resolution is meant to “revert the power of eminent domain authority to the government and public use only.” He said the current law allows eminent domain for “tax revenue and economic development,” and argued South Dakota should “revert it back to the way it was supposed to be.”
The constitutional amendment would add language to the state constitution that reads, “Eminent domain may not be exercised for the purpose of transferring private property to a non-governmental entity solely to promote economic development or increase tax revenue without the provision of a public use, purpose, or utility.”
Amanda Radke, who farms and ranches near Mitchell and opposes eminent domain for carbon pipelines, said the amendment would “eliminate the predatory practices of private companies who come to take things against the will of the people of South Dakota.”  
“This isn’t a change to the constitution,” she said. “This is fortifying what the founding fathers intended when it came to property rights.” 
Pacific Legal Foundation policy counsel Emily Amin, of Nashville, said property rights “mean very little if the government can override them whenever it believes a different private use might generate more tax revenue.”
Iowa House sends CO2 eminent domain ban to Senate

Opponents, including water and electric utilities and various business groups, warned that the language is unclear and could trigger lawsuits and uncertainty for essential infrastructure projects. 
Darla Pullman Rogers, representing rural electric cooperatives in the state, said changing the constitution could “inadvertently or indirectly affect our ability to exercise eminent domain,” raising questions about projects tied to economic development, such as electrical service for data centers.
Brett Koenecke, lobbying on behalf of investor-owned electric utilities, said the proposal is “confusing” and could “consign people to litigation to figure out what this means.” He said the clarity opponents were looking for would have to be sought in a courtroom through lawsuits. 
South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Ryan Budmayr said the current system works, calling the amendment “unnecessary,” arguing it “sends the wrong message” to businesses that South Dakota is not “open for opportunity.” 
American Petroleum Institute Midwest Region Director Mike Karbo said the measure could hinder oil pipeline connections and jeopardize job creation and economic benefits.
Committee member Rep. Greg Jamison, R-Sioux Falls, asked if the amendment would bar eminent domain for running an electric or water line to a project that was built for economic development purposes. 
Gosch said he believed it would not. He argued the resolution is “pretty clear” in seeking to ban eminent domain that’s solely “to promote economic development and increase tax revenue,” and he told the committee that approving the resolution does not amend the constitution. 
“You’re simply saying, ‘I trust my voters, I’m gonna let them decide,’” Gosch said. 
The proposed carbon capture pipeline through South Dakota is a project of Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions. The five-state pipeline would capture carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska and transport it to an underground sequestration site in North Dakota, to capitalize on federal tax credits incentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. The project has been granted permits in other states, but those have been subjected to legal challenges, and South Dakota regulators have twice denied permits for the project.
Landowner opposition to the project in South Dakota culminated in the Legislature’s passage of a law last year banning carbon pipelines from using eminent domain. Iowa’s House of Representatives sent a similar bill to the Iowa Senate this week.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Spencer-Gosch-2025-adjusted-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 13:56:36.599040

Rep. Cody Maynard, R-Durant, proposed multiple bills aiming to regulate AI, including House Bill 3546 which would prohibit the technology from having personhood status. 
“AI is a man-made tool and it should not have any more rights than a hammer would,” he said. “We’re starting to see stories of people trying to marry AI companions. There’s a lot of confusion going on where people are asking, do these systems rise to the level of sentience?”
Maynard said he wanted to “get ahead of the game” with this legislation and ensure that businesses cannot shift blame for any unlawful actions onto AI to escape punishment. 
As an example, he said companies using AI in self-driving cars in cities around the U.S. could potentially shift the blame for a car wreck onto the technology rather than taking responsibility. 
“I thought it was just critical that we need to get out in front and just go ahead and say it’s not a person, and therefore, companies can’t shift off any accidents onto the AI,” Maynard said. 
He said he’s also heard stories about minors who either committed suicide or self-harmed after talking with AI chatbots and this legislation would ensure that companies would be held responsible for whatever the artificial intelligence said to the child. 
Similar legislation to prohibit AI from reaching personhood status has passed or been proposed in other states, including Idaho, Utah, Washington, South Carolina and Missouri. 
Maynard also has a bill specifically focused on regulating how AI chatbots can interact with minors.  
While Maynard said the goal of his legislation was not originally to address AI copyright issues, he said it could potentially hold companies liable if AI plagiarizes or uses copyrighted work without permission. 
He said he’s talked with other lawmakers and most agree that there need to be “realistic and reasonable” safeguards for AI. 
“The question is always, what does that mean and what do we think is reasonable,” Maynard said. “So we’ll find out as we kind of move through session. These are starting spots, they’re not end points. … We need to be talking about it, and hopefully we can come up with agreed solutions that will help everyone in our state.”

(Photo by Meghan Riley)A lawsuit filed by more than 15 conservation organizations, spanning well beyond the borders of the Treasure State, says that the federal government has stalled in its plans to save wolverines, and asks a court to compel the United States Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to lay out specific plans to protect the threatened species’ habitat, the first part of the conservation project.
Biologists and conservation organizations have long lobbied scientists and politicians to place the wolverine on the Endangered Species List, as a “threatened species,” a designation that focuses on a species’ habitat and ranges. The Biden administration did that in February 2023. After an animal or plant is placed on the list, federal law allows the government a year to determine its range — the places that need to be protected and given special consideration in order to stop further losses. The federal government may extend that time by one year, if it needs, according to the lawsuit.
However, more than two years have passed and the conservation organizations say that the federal government is violating its own laws by not moving forward on the process, even as the Trump administration looks to remove protections for other species, like grizzly bears and gray wolves.
“The service has yet to initiate the process of designating critical habitat for wolverines,” the lawsuit said. “The service is not actively working on a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for wolverines.”
The lawsuit said that organizations included in the lawsuit have been commenting, and reminding the federal government,  about the deadline. Now, they say the courts have the power to act and compel the federal government to begin the process.
“The (FWS) determined wolverine warranted listing under the ESA, primarily due to ongoing and increasing impacts of climate change and associated habitat degradation and fragmentation,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said science proves wolverines need the snow of high elevations in order to den and rear their kits. Those areas are being impacted by both climate change and more human encroachment, the lawsuit states.
FWS estimates that 50 wolverines occupy the Idaho/Montana linkage area and 63 are in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, as of Nov. 2023. Furthermore, it estimated just a few more than 200 wolverines in the Lower 48 states beyond those in and around Montana’s ranges.
“Wolverine populations, though widespread, were relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada,” the lawsuit said.
The groups say that the Service has not been able to provide any documentation that process has even begun, now more than two years after the designation.
“Wolverines are just hanging on—down to roughly 300 individuals. They deserve and desperately need all the protections guaranteed by law after being recognized as threatened, including critical habitat” said Matthew Bishop, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center. “Having areas set aside as critical habitat is a major—if not the most important—factor in helping threatened and endangered wildlife recover. Given wolverines’ small population size and climate change quickly shrinking the snowy habitat they rely on to survive, time is of the essence.”
The groups who are suing the federal government include: Friends of the Bitterroot, WildEarth Guardians, Friends of the Wild Swan, Swan View Coalition, Oregon Wild, Cascadia Wildlands, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Cottonwood Environmental Law Center, George Wuerthner (as an individual), Footloose Montana, Native Ecosystems Council, Helena Hunters and Anglers Association, Wilderness Watch, Trap Free Montana, and Friends of the Clearwater.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Wolverine-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-23 13:56:36.599040

Eight regional volunteer working groups were tasked with implementing the state’s conservation plan for the iconic, embattled species before they were dismissed by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department this week.
The post Wyoming abruptly defunds, dissolves sage grouse conservation groups after 21-year run appeared first on WyoFile .","State wildlife officials on Thursday informed eight regional groups tasked with safeguarding the largest, most important population of sage grouse remaining in the world that their funding and existence had run its course. 
Word of the working groups’ dissolution was conveyed by a letter emailed to their roughly 105 members and shared with WyoFile. Wyoming would be “forever grateful” for their “hard work and dedication on behalf of sage grouse,” Game and Fish Deputy Chief of Wildlife Justin Binfet wrote to the volunteer cohort before delivering the news that “the time has come to conclude the work.” 
The letter described changing times as the reason for the groups’ termination. Funding for the groups, which supported annual conservation projects, once came from the Wyoming Legislature’s general fund, but since 2018 has come from Game and Fish. Last year, the agency spent $295,000 on the effort. Policy work is handled primarily by the statewide Sage Grouse Implementation Team, though the local groups have helped identify proposed changes to Wyoming’s protective sage grouse “core areas” in recent years. 
“While there is still work to be done with sage grouse and their associated habitats, it is time to rethink how we incorporate local involvement and knowledge into our management process,” the letter stated. “We are also a more connected society than we were 21 years ago, allowing for multiple avenues to include local knowledge in our processes.” 
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department declined an interview for this story.

Tom Christiansen, a former Game and Fish safe grouse coordinator and longtime member of the Southwest area working group, had heard rumblings of the groups being disbanded for a couple of years. The retiree remarked they had a “good, long run,” and he wasn’t upset about the decision, though he does worry it ultimately will hurt sage grouse. 
“The biggest concern is … this will be one less source of funding,” Christiansen said. “Also, the research dollars that the groups provided to keep the science going was significant. I don’t know that it’s going to get backfilled by anybody.” 
Joe Bohne, a former Game and Fish biologist who sat on the Snake River group, shared similar thoughts. He wasn’t in favor of the state’s decision, but also wasn’t surprised. Many of the local groups’ functions were redundant to the statewide Sage Grouse Implementation Team. But not all, he said.
“A lot of the working groups coordinated the lek surveys,” Bohne said. “Who will do that coordination if there isn’t a working group?”

Former Gov. Dave Freudenthal convened Wyoming’s eight local sage grouse working groups in 2004. At the time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was weighing whether to protect the embattled bird with the Endangered Species Act, which could have had major implications for Wyoming energy development and the state’s coffers. 
Five years earlier, in 1999, Wyoming signed a memorandum of understanding with eight other western states that ultimately led to more than 60 local working groups across sage grouse range, according to a 2017 peer-reviewed paper about the groups authored by Christiansen. 
The local groups’ mission was to implement regional sage grouse conservation plans. They were described as a critical component of achieving Wyoming’s overarching sage grouse conservation plan.
“The statewide plan is largely reliant on implementation by local working groups,” the statewide conservation plan says. It described the groups as “essential to conservation of sage grouse in Wyoming.”
(Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Over their 21 years, the eight groups steered funding for 377 projects, and “played a crucial role in sage grouse conservation,” Binfet wrote in the termination letter. 
Apart from directing funding on-the-ground work and scientific research, the groups at times strategized big picture conservation. The Snake River working group, which oversees the small, isolated Jackson Hole population, once helped draft plans for emergency import of birds after numbers dwindled to less than 50 males, though it was later halted by a statewide working group.
In the heavily drilled and disturbed Powder River Basin, the local group’s efforts would have assisted in strategizing ways to keep an especially vulnerable sage grouse population viable. 
Wyoming houses nearly 40% of all the birds remaining on the planet, and the species has been in persistent decline — numbers fell 81% over a recent 53-year period. Especially western parts of the state are considered a stronghold.
“This is the most contiguous habitat available range-wide,” U.S. Geological Survey research biologist Peter Coates told WyoFile in 2021. “It’s a lot of uninterrupted habitat.”
Oil and gas wells and greater sage grouse range are overlaid in this 2017 map. (Wyoming Oil and Gas Commission, Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
The economic stakes of sage grouse conservation in Wyoming are high. Fossil fuels and other extracted resources that have buoyed the state’s economy for generations often overlap with sagebrush-dominated areas, including the best of the best grouse habitat. That reality “poses many challenges,” Christiansen stated in the 2017 paper.
“Given these pressures,” he wrote, “undisturbed landscapes in Wyoming are unlikely to persist without proactive conservation planning.” 
To help offset the loss of its sage grouse working groups, Wyoming will begin hosting an annual “sage grouse summit” that “may rotate across the state,” according to the Game and Fish letter. The state agency is also exploring ways to “meet and incorporate public feedback” into its policies, ”honoring the spirit” of the working groups. 
Not all members are sad to see the regional groups disbanded. Retired biologist John Dahlke, who’s been a part of the Upper Green River Basin group since its formation, told WyoFile he was incidentally preparing a resignation letter Thursday when he learned of the news. Over the years, he’d grown “disappointed” with how the volunteer body lacked infrastructure to achieve its conservation plans.
“I think the local working groups in general are a sham,” Dahlke said. “They give the impression that all ideas are on the table. They’re actually not, because it only takes one dissenting vote to kill any project.”
But Dahlke also cited good work achieved by the Upper Green group. Its members helped talk Sublette County into fighting cheatgrass, he said, and they supported effective projects that reduced sage grouse fence strikes and helped improve wet meadow habitat critical to sage grouse chick survival.

(Getty Images)LAWRENCE — Six viral diseases — including COVID-19, the flu and norovirus — have been found at high concentrations in Lawrence wastewater as Kansas communities face peak flu season.
COVID-19, influenza A and B, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and norovirus have all been detected at high concentrations in Lawrence wastewater within the last three weeks. 
Wastewater data indicates trends of illnesses spreading within a community but does not correlate to exact case numbers, with doctors saying it’s normal to see high concentrations of respiratory illness during flu season. 
“Wastewater data does not measure individual cases, but it provides a reliable picture of how much virus is circulating in a community,” said Veronica White, preparedness and epidemiology coordinator for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health. “This data captures viral genetic material shed by everyone using the sewer system. One factor that may be contributing to the higher concentrations of respiratory viruses seen in Lawrence’s wastewater is its larger population.”
Lawrence is also seeing an early peak in influenza B compared to the rest of the country. Positive flu tests spiked the last week of 2025, with 32% of total flu tests coming back positive, according to data from the University of Kansas Health System.
Some health care providers such as Watkins Health Center at the University of Kansas are requiring masks for all visitors, patients and staff due to a “record surge in respiratory illnesses,” according to a sign at the front door.
White said early rise in the flu doesn’t indicate a more dangerous flu season, but rather earlier circulation of the virus than usual. 
“Identifying this trend early through wastewater data allows people to take preventive steps, such as getting vaccinated, monitoring symptoms, and staying home when sick,” White said.
Wastewater data also indicated that a newer strain of COVID, known as the XFG or the Stratus variant, has accounted for 82.5% of positive COVID samples, with concentrations increasing by 25% in the last month. The variant has also been increasing nationally, White said.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director for Infection Control and Prevention program at University of Kansas Health System, said there are still large populations of people across the state who have not received a flu shot.
“There have been a large number of people ill and circulators too in our communities. But (the flu) still remains at a high level at this point in time,” Hawkinson said. “There have been extremely low numbers of people not getting the vaccine. We know that we can help prevent this and people’s chances of severe illness and death with it.”
Steve Stites, chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System, said that vaccines are incredibly safe and effective.
Hawkinson said flu symptoms include fever, cough, congestion, body aches and a sore throat rather than stomach bug symptoms, with the definitions often getting mixed up during flu season.
Wastewater data has also indicated that Salina is seeing medium concentrations of the same illnesses, except for influenza A, which is considered to be at a high concentration.
“Based on the data, we expect viral activity to continue in both Lawrence and Salina over the next few weeks,” White said. “As we move through flu season, we anticipate seeing elevated influenza activity reflected in the wastewater, especially as the season approaches its typical peak.”
Medical experts continue to advise washing hands, covering coughs and not going into large public spaces when sick to prevent illnesses from spreading.
“You can still go get the flu vaccine,” Hawkinson said. “It’s still recommended, and you can do it now to protect yourself from infection.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1441010937-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 13:37:13.572534

Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville would prohibit people from seeking election to federal positions in the U.S. House and Senate if they hold dual citizenship or are not a natural-born citizen, meaning they were born in the United States or were born abroad to parents who are U.S. citizens. The measure is being sponsored in the Senate by state Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County.
Garrett, who is running for Tennessee’s 6th Congressional District seat, filed the bill Friday, saying in a release it sets a “clear and uniform eligibility standard” matching the requirements to run for the presidency and designed to support citizenship principles and public confidence.
It is one of roughly a dozen bills Republicans have filed this session aimed at immigrants, though this one singles out U.S. citizens.
“Tennesseans should have full confidence that those serving at the highest levels of government put America first. If you want to represent our state in Washington, being born in the United States should be a basic qualification. That standard already applies to the presidency, and it should apply to all federal offices. This legislation ensures Tennessee is represented by leaders with an unquestioned allegiance to our nation and do not hold dual citizenship from foreign adversary nations,” Garrett, an attorney, said in a statement.

If you want to represent Tennesseans in Washington, you should be born in the United States. On my watch, Tennessee will never send an @IlhanMN to Congress. I’m ready to take this fight in the State House- and I won’t stop until we carry that momentum all the way to Congress. pic.twitter.com/IMjt5JkSmN

To serve in the U.S. House, a person must be at least 25 years old and a citizen for seven years, in addition to living in the state where elected. A person must be at least 30 and a citizen for nine years to serve in the Senate.
Federal lawmakers determined that a seven-year citizenship would enable foreign-born citizens to take part in the government while making sure they had learned about the country and weren’t likely to be influenced by loyalty to their birth land, according to an overview of the House qualifications clause.
Vanderbilt University political science professor John Geer predicted such a bill would meet a court challenge if it becomes law because, while the Constitution says presidents must be natural-born citizens, that requirement doesn’t apply to Senate and House members.



				Nashville attorney Daniel Horwitz, a constitutional expert, also said Friday the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled “that the framers intended the Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications for Members of Congress, and that the framers thereby ‘divested’ states of any power to add qualifications.”			


MTSU political science professor John Vile said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the qualifications for federal office are “exclusive.” In other words, additions and subtractions can’t be made to them, he said.
Vile cited Powell v. McCormack, a 1969 case in which the Supreme Court found that Rep. Adam Clayton Powell of New York should be seated in Congress as long as he met the constitutional requirements for being a member. The House voted to deny Powell from taking office in 1966 after he was charged with misappropriating funds and abusing the court system.
The fact that the Constitution’s framers required the president to be a natural-born citizen, but not members of Congress, shows that they thought about the implications of citizenship when setting qualifications, Vile added.
A 1995 Supreme Court case out of Arkansas also found that states can’t put term limits on federal candidates, according to Vile, showing that states can’t set qualifications for federal positions.
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in that case, U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, “In the absence of a properly passed constitutional amendment, allowing the individuals states to craft their own congressional qualifications would erode the structure designed by the Framers to form a ‘more perfect Union.’”

Nashville attorney Daniel Horwitz, a constitutional expert, also said Friday the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled “that the framers intended the Constitution to be the exclusive source of qualifications for Members of Congress, and that the framers thereby ‘divested’ states of any power to add qualifications.” Consequently, the legislature lacks the authority to impose more qualifications for congressional candidates, he said.
“It certainly cannot impose new qualifications that contravene the Constitution’s unambiguous text,” Horwitz said.
Asked about the constitutionality of his bill, Garrett said in a statement, “It is fully within the bounds of the Constitution for states to decide on candidate qualifications for nominating parties in primary elections. This bill ensures that if you want to run as a party affiliated candidate for Congress or Senate, you must be a natural-born citizen of the United States and denounce any prior allegiance to another country. There will never be an Ilhan Omar representing the Volunteer State.”
Omar, a U.S. House member of Minnesota who was born in Somalia, is being targeted by President Donald Trump, who called for an investigation this week into her accumulation of wealth. 
Garrett’s bill doesn’t mention primary elections or selection by parties for a congressional seat.
State Rep. John Ray Clemmons of Nashville called Garrett’s bill unconstitutional and “nuts.” 
“I’m frankly tired of these posturing radicals wasting our time and taxpayer resources with their political posturing and nonsense when we should be laser-focused on lowering costs of living, fixing our roads, increasing access to healthcare and balancing an inflated budget,” Clemmons said in a statement to the Lookout.

Federal officials, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, do not have absolute immunity from state prosecution. 
Vice President JD Vance claimed agent Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, has absolute immunity because he was engaged in a federal law enforcement action. Although federal officials have some constitutional shields against state prosecution, the immunity isn’t absolute.
An analysis published by the University of Wisconsin Law School says a constitutional principle known as the Supremacy Clause doctrine protects federal officials against prosecution when they are “reasonably acting within the bounds of lawful federal duties.” Going beyond the scope of duties, violation of federal law or egregious or unwarranted behavior can open doors for state prosecution.
As MinnPost reported, any state or local attempt to prosecute Ross would likely face opposition from the Trump administration. But the federal government is unlikely to be able to outright stop it.


This fact brief is responsive to conversations such as this one.

You can read more about the section here.

One of the most dangerous pronouncements to come out of Washington in recent weeks was the decision to pause all federal funding for child care.
After a sleepless weekend for everyone connected to child care in Mississippi – parents, center owners and directors and staff – updated federal rules governing the receipt of these funds have now been released. According to the federal Office of Health and Human Services, funds are paused for certain states. Mississippi is not one.
However, Mississippi families are currently experiencing problems with the reenrollment process required by the state Department of Human Services to receive funding for child care. There is confusion related to the acceptance of paperwork to reenroll. Some child care providers indicate there are eligible children who were enrolled receiving funding and others not.
Mississippi has a finite amount of money allocated by the federal government which is placed by the state Department of Human Services in a child care payment program.

The state could allocate additional funds to the program as legislators did in the 2025 session. The $15 million allocated by the state is more than in the past, but a token amount when considering the total needed. Since the Department of Human Services is not utilizing the federal funding it could to serve all qualifying children, a system has been developed that accepts applicants based on the date they tried to enroll and not those recently attempting to reenroll. The current number of children reported on the waiting list is almost 20,000.
As a non-traditional student myself, I would not have been able to attend college without access to child care. A divorced mom of a 3-year-old, my attendance at the University of Arkansas would have been impossible without the campus child care program. Without money saved from a job I quit so I could attend school full-time and without family support, I would still be in the Arkansas Delta watching the cotton grow and employed in a low wage job.
This was over 50 years ago, and I would like to think the investment in my education paid off. Today’s investment in educating non-traditional students is even more important given the need for well-trained individuals in all fields of engineering, medicine, science, business, education and the list goes on. Child care is a critical part of the equation that equals success.
Some child care programs do not accept federal funding and rely solely on tuition payments to remain operational. In Mississippi, however, it is estimated that just over 50% of child care programs receive some level of federal funds, in addition to tuition payments provided by parents. As centers strive to operate, they plan and budget using funds from both tuition payments and the Department of Human Services programs. Without a stable income, it is impossible to project how and if monthly bills will be paid.
The federal funds are restricted for use by working families whose incomes fall below established eligibility financial thresholds and/or students who attend school and work. Children in foster care and those who have a ruling indicating they need special services are also eligible.
Families must submit income documentation annually and provide several documents specific to the child at enrollment and reenrollment. These documents are listed on the state Department of Human Services website.
Families with incomes higher than those who qualify for federal funds are still at risk of being impacted by the lack of federal/state support. Child care centers must pay the bills that are due and salaries must be paid regardless of cash flow. All employers and families utilizing child care should voice concerns to state legislators and the state Department of Human Services. All families can be impacted when child care centers close because of lack of funding.
In Mississippi, state funds are available that could be allocated to assist working families by keeping centers open so people can work. Currently, there are approximately 20,000 eligible children on the wait list who could be served if Human Services utilized funds already earmarked for working families and those in training.
Recruiting businesses to come to our state has proven to be successful. What measures will be taken to make this a state young families choose to live or stay in to fill the new positions? Without a family-friendly response from state leadership, child care centers will close, care for certain age groups will disappear and providers will leave the profession, creating an even greater access crisis for parents.
No child care means no workers. No workers means no production. A pause or lack of child care can also interfere with training and schooling, delaying non-traditional students’ ability to get a job.

Coloradans have elected only one Republican governor in the last 50 years. Democrats have won every statewide election held in the last eight years by an average of more than 10 percentage points, and are widely expected to gain ground in a favorable midterm election year. Democrats have strong majorities in both chambers of the Legislature.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet are facing off in the Democratic primary for governor. 
Griffin, a military veteran and CEO from Colorado Springs whose campaign website says he is a center-right candidate, said he thinks he’s the only candidate who can work across the aisle and with younger voters. 
Kirkmeyer, who serves on the Colorado Legislature’s powerful Joint Budget Committee and has been in the state Senate since 2021, said her experience will set her up to succeed as governor as she looks to make budget cuts across the board.
“As a state senator, I will tell you I’ve done everything I can in the minority to make our state better, but I would say to you one party control in this state has made a mess of our state and has not made things better,” Kirkmeyer said. “If you want to know what not to do, just look at everything that they have passed in the last seven years that have been pushed through this House, this Senate, and this governor that are all led by Democrats.”
Mikesell, who was the last county sheriff in Colorado to have a so-called 287(g) agreement with federal authorities, allowing his office to detain people on civil immigration violations after the Colorado Legislature passed a law banning the practice, said he would put law enforcement first if elected governor, since “law enforcement’s under assault all across the state.”
“I don’t need the National Guard to take crime away from the state,” Mikesell said. “I need law enforcement that’s willing to not be sued by a state attorney general. That has to stop today. Those threats are killing law enforcement and your ability to have a safe place to live in Colorado.”
Oltmann said the state government does not represent or help everyday people, and he said “you just need to DOGE the entire Colorado government,” referring to President Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Having cast doubt for years on the security of elections, he reiterated baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election and Colorado’s mail-in voting system. 
While Oltmann said he would pardon former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters on his first day in office because she was “railroaded” and subjected to “political persecution,” the other candidates were split on whether they would commute her sentence or pardon her. Peters was found guilty of attempting to influence a public servant and other crimes related to her role in a 2021 security breach in the elections office she oversaw and sentenced to nine years in prison.

Kirmeyer said “you have to be fair and consistent” and that there are processes that must be followed to receive a pardon. Mikesell would commute Peters’ sentence, because he said people who commit violent crimes receive less time than Peters did.
Griffin said he wouldn’t pardon Peters if she committed a crime, but he wants to see larger reforms of the justice system and said that “she would be back home anyway because we have entirely too many moms and too many dads that have done nonviolent crimes and can be out and actually doing something for society.” 
Griffin and Mikesell both said they don’t support Trump’s blanket pardon of people convicted for their actions during the Jan. 6 insurrection, and that such cases should be considered on a case by case basis. Mikesell emphasized that law enforcement officers were injured on Jan. 6. 
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat who is term-limited, has maintained that he will review any request for a pardon or commutation for Peters as he would any other request. In a recent interview with CBS Colorado, he described Peters’ sentence as “harsh.”
Bipartisanship
Colorado voters have backed Democrats “not because the Democrats are so good, the GOP is so bad,” Griffin said. He said Republicans need to be able to have open dialogue with Democrats so they can understand each other and accomplish shared goals. 
“Not every Democrat is your enemy. Not every Republican is your friend,” Griffin said. “We just need to be approachable. You need to be respectful, and you need to be strategic, and I think I have a background to get that done.”
Colorado is not a blue state, but rather an issue-based state, Mikesell said, and Republicans have “missed our mark on the issues that have really meant something to the people every single day.” He said candidates have to appeal to voters on both sides. 
“When these Coloradans come together and we want something done that benefits all of Colorado, we seem to get it done,” Mikesell said. “We did it through COVID, we did it through fires, we’ve done it through floods, we’ve done it through a lot of different things in Colorado. But we do that as Coloradans, not just as Republicans and Democrats.”
Kirkmeyer said her experience working across the aisle in the Legislature shows that she can lead the state and represent its large unaffiliated voter base well. She said 80% of the work at the Capitol is not partisan, and she’s worked on bipartisan issues like balancing the budget, funding education and cutting property taxes. 
Oltmann pushed back on Kirkmeyer touting bipartisanship, asking her, “How do you brag about anything that’s happened in the state of Colorado by compromising with the people across the aisle?” He said none of the compromises made at the Capitol have helped people in Colorado. Kirkmeyer said Oltmann “obviously” doesn’t know how working at the Capitol works.
Candidates that both parties put forward “have been terrible” and haven’t represented the people, Oltmann said. He said Colorado needs to “get rid of machines and mail-in ballots” and that there is a lack of faith across the country that elected officials “are put there legitimately.”
“I think when we get to a place where we have free and fair elections, well, this state was never blue and it will return to its original roots with lots of people that are in this room that have been here for generations,” Oltmann said. 
Oltmann is a leading figure among far-right election deniers and was instrumental in spreading a baseless conspiracy theory that Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems helped rig the 2020 election. 
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Asked specifically about his calls to execute his political enemies and people he disagrees with, Oltmann said if someone is found guilty of treason, “they should hang.” He again doubled down on claims that the 2020 election was stolen.  
“It has nothing to do with disagreeing with people,” Oltmann said. “If you commit treason, the penalty for treason is death. If you don’t like it, change the law.”
Working with the Trump administration
The Trump administration has frozen billions of federal dollars allocated to Colorado, including funding for child care and social service programs. 
Trump wants Colorado to be responsible with those funds, Oltmann said, and the president cut them off because the state is not handling them responsibly. He said if Colorado has a Republican governor then those funds would “unfreeze themselves.” 
As a Republican, Kirkmeyer said she’d be more welcomed to have a conversation with the president to work through how to actually help citizens in the state. 
“I think what’s been happening for the last year is we’ve got a governor and an attorney general who thinks it’s a great idea every week to do another lawsuit against the federal government instead of going and sitting down and trying to talk to the president and work through these issues,” Kirkmeyer said. 
After Colorado has sued the Trump administration more than 50 times, Mikesell asked “would that not make the federal government want to help us?”

Griffin said the state should be able to sustain itself, but he also would have no problem talking to the president about what the people of Colorado need from the federal government. 
The candidates all agreed that the state government needs to downsize, with each offering different ideas on how to achieve that goal.    
Kirkmeyer and Mikesell both said they want to undo “sanctuary” policies that prevent law enforcement from working with the federal government on immigration enforcement. 
Cutting housing regulations is the best way to drive down housing costs in the state, according to Mikesell and Kirkmeyer. Oltmann suggested getting rid of property taxes entirely. Griffin wants to restrict corporations that have bought up homes and get those homes back to individual ownership.

Myer’s Rural Health Transformation Plan cited the Milford Wellness Village as a real-world example of how bringing services together improves care.
MILFORD, Del. — Long before Delaware unveiled a sweeping strategy to strengthen rural healthcare, Milford was already demonstrating how integrated, community-based care can work.
The Milford Wellness Village, a locally rooted healthcare campus serving older adults and families, has been publicly highlighted by state health leaders and rural health advocates as an example of the kind of coordinated care model Delaware hopes to expand as part of its broader rural health strategy.
While the state’s recently released Rural Health Transformation Plan outlines system-wide goals rather than naming specific facilities, officials and advocates have pointed to the Milford Wellness Village as a real-world illustration of how bringing services together can improve access, reduce fragmentation and keep care closer to home.
For Milford residents, the recognition reinforces something many already believe — their community is quietly helping shape the future of rural healthcare in Delaware.
A Collaborative Model That Works
The Milford Wellness Village brings a range of healthcare and support services together on a single campus, including skilled nursing, rehabilitation, outpatient care and other wraparound services designed to support patients and families across different stages of life.
Lon Kieffer, executive director of the Milford Wellness Village, said the model’s strength lies in collaboration.
“When healthcare providers work side by side — sharing information and coordinating care — patients get better outcomes,” Kieffer said. “That’s true for seniors, but it’s also true for caregivers, working parents, people managing chronic conditions and families who need help navigating the healthcare system.”
Kieffer said the integrated approach helps reduce barriers that often prevent people from seeking care.
“Instead of disconnected appointments in different locations, people receive care that’s coordinated, supportive and easier to access,” he said. “That leads to better health, fewer emergencies and a better experience for patients and families.”
Vision That Built the Foundation
Community leaders credit the long-term vision behind the Wellness Village as a key factor in its success.
Meir Gelley, who played a central role in developing the campus, was honored in 2025 with the Community Star Award during a National Rural Health Day event recognizing individuals who demonstrate exceptional commitment to improving healthcare access, innovation and community partnerships in rural areas.
According to organizers and public officials, Gelley was recognized for expanding services for older adults and underserved families and for helping establish the Milford Wellness Village as a community-based model of integrated care. Leaders also cited his efforts to address provider shortages, transportation barriers and healthcare gaps across Kent and Sussex counties.
A Local Success With Statewide Relevance
Delaware’s Rural Health Transformation Plan focuses on improving access to care in underserved areas, strengthening the healthcare workforce and reducing reliance on hospital emergency rooms — challenges that are particularly acute in rural communities.
Health officials have said models that coordinate services locally, similar to what has been developed in Milford, align closely with those goals.
Milford Mayor Todd Culotta said the Wellness Village reflects a broader vision for the city’s future.
“My goal is to make Milford a center for healthcare in Kent and Sussex counties,” Culotta said. “What’s happening at the Wellness Village shows the role Milford can play in meeting the region’s healthcare needs.”
What It Means for Milford Families
For local families, the impact is tangible. The campus allows older adults to remain close to family, familiar neighborhoods and trusted caregivers rather than traveling long distances for rehabilitation or ongoing care.
Coordinated services can help reduce gaps in care, improve chronic disease management and prevent avoidable hospital visits — outcomes that become increasingly important as rural Kent and Sussex counties continue to grow and age.
Pride in What Milford Built
As Delaware works to strengthen healthcare access across rural areas, Milford’s experience is now part of the broader conversation.
For residents, the recognition is less about policy language and more about pride — pride in a community that invested in people, supported families and caregivers, and built a model that continues to draw attention from leaders working to improve healthcare statewide.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news_featured_1.jpg,,,2026-01-23 12:57:02.611592

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) speaks at an Oct. 2, 2024 Trump/Vance campaign event in Auburn Hills. | Kyle DavidsonRepublican opponents of U.S. Rep. John James have spent much of the 2026 election cycle questioning his competitiveness in the GOP side of the gubernatorial race, but a new ad hits on a potential vulnerability for James: his loyalty to President Donald Trump.
The ad was produced by Michigan First Principles, a group reportedly run by a Republican consultant with a penchant for siding with Republicans who have criticized Trump in the past. It hits James square in the eyes over his decision to run for governor despite Trump expressing some public displeasure over his bid.
But others noted the group’s connections to Republican power player John Yob and attorney W. Alan Wilk, a close former associate of independent gubernatorial candidate Mike Duggan, leaving some to cast blame on Yob and Duggan for stirring up the discourse.


Both Yob and Duggan’s campaign told Michigan Advance that they were not behind the ad. Other reporting appears to point more toward political consultant Doug Stafford as being responsible for the ad. Stafford has advised both U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, two Republicans from Kentucky who have not been shy in recent years to criticize Trump in key areas. In the case of Massie, the representative has been a driving force in exposing Trump’s tight connection to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and the effort to prevent the numerous files from criminal cases against Epstein from being released.
Still, the rumor mill persisted on whether Yob was really pulling the strings.
James’ campaign quickly followed that attack with an ad of its own, highlighting the ways in which James was loyal to Trump and his second-term agenda. James’ campaign told Michigan Advance that the ad was already in the creative content flow and was not a direct response to the Michigan First Principles ad, but some did not see it that way, including Michigan Democrats, who labeled the skirmish as emerging intraparty divide over James, who has positioned himself as the GOP frontrunner.
Seeds of the ‘disloyal’ James attacks started last year
In June 2025, Trump held a news conference when he signed James’ bill prohibiting the state of California’s electric vehicle mandates. James delighted in the ceremony on X, but Trump later ribbed him for deciding to run for governor instead of running for reelection in Michigan’s 10th Congressional District, a fairly safe Republican seat and helping Trump maintain his Congressional majority.
Trump jokes that GOP won’t let James seek Michigan governorship without a good replacement

Trump for months has lamented that Republicans needed to hold the House for fear he might be impeached if the chamber flips to Democrats in the 2026 midterms.
The Michigan First Principles ad highlights that interaction between Trump and James last year, then insinuates Trump had saved James’ career by endorsing him for Congress in 2024 after he lost his bid for the U.S. Senate against stalwart Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters in 2020. The ad then notes the endorsement came in spite of James saying two years prior that Trump was not fit to lead because of his commentary on disregarding parts of the U.S. Constitution that the president didn’t like
While James ultimately cozied back up with Trump and has been a key mouthpiece for his political agenda during his second term,, the ad makes it seem as though James was never loyal to Trump, and that his new loyalty cannot be counted on if things go awry from Trump in the face of a potential Democratic blowout in 2026.
James swings, but don’t call it a comeback
In the heat of the fight, James, on Thursday, dropped an ad to highlight the fact that he is leading in some key polls and stood with Trump “every time,” even though his past public statements show otherwise.
He also tied his candidacy for governor as a hedge against Democrats going after Trump and his agenda in Congress, or rather a wall against them impeaching him again if the Democrats succeed in flipping Congress. That’s despite governors having essentially no  say over whether a president gets impeached in the U.S. House and Senate, and that the ad at times reads more like a Congressional district campaign hit than one for governor.
Still, the campaign said it was not a direct response to what Michigan First Principles put out and instead speaks to what James can bring to the table for Michigan.

President @realDonaldTrump is doing his part to Make America Great Again.
Now it’s our turn to MAKE MICHIGAN GREAT AGAIN. To do that, we have ONE JOB: DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS!
Our mission is clear and failure is not an option.

A springboard for Perry Johnson?
Meanwhile, in Michigan, with Stafford being reported to be behind the Michigan First Principles ad, political observers of all stripes pointed to Michigan First Principles’ connections to not only Yob and Wilk, but also potentially Perry Johnson, who ran for governor in 2022 before being tossed off the ballot in a fake petition signature scandal and then an abortive presidential run in 2024.  
Yob worked for Johnson during his gubernatorial bid and it was rumored that the anti-James ad could be a soft springboard for Johnson to potentially enter the gubernatorial fray, and with support again from Yob.
The Wilk connection was a little more solid: The Detroit News reported Wilk, an attorney, incorporated Michigan First Principles, as well as another group, Put Progress First, supporting Duggan’s bid. It was reported that Wilk also worked on Duggan’s previous mayoral campaigns.
The News also reported, however, that the company who had been placing the ad buys for the Michigan First Principles hit had the same P.O. Box as AdVictory, based in Grand Rapids, which was Yob’s company and is now associated with political consultant Adam Meldrum.

Is the White House lashing out at James?
Yob has close ties to the White House, and some also perceived the attack on James as potentially coming down from upon high due to Trump’s frustrations with him not staying in Congress. He told the Advance that it wasn’t his doing, but his statement didn’t pull any punches.
“I join many Republicans in agreeing with President Trump’s concerns with John James’ candidacy and therefore support the direction of the advertising, but it isn’t my group and I refer questions to the people running it,” Yob said.
Some saw that statement as a veiled expression of Trump’s growing frustration with James, which might be growing so large that the White House would give the greenlight to its operatives with Michigan ties to start hitting back at James.
The Advance asked the White House communications team if any of that rumor mill was even remotely true, but a message seeking comment was not returned at the time of publication.
Duggan had no role and wants James to stay in the race
As the advertisement landed, James’ campaign surrogates went on the attack, including Tori Sachs, a longtime Republican consultant and pundit who currently works as an adviser to James’s campaign.
On X, Sachs said it was her read that the ad was a tag team job between Duggan’s team and Johnson’s allies.
“Both want to block John James – the strongest GOP candidate – from the general election. James is the ONLY Republican leading Democrats in the General Election polls & the only one who can lift a weight without falling over,” Sachs wrote. “The old Detroit/Lansing political machine that wrecked our state continues to churn. Time to end it.”
Andrea Bitely, Duggan’s campaign spokesperson, told the Advance that Duggan’s team was not behind the ad. She also jabbed at Sachs in an X post of her own, noting that the campaign views James as a Republican it can beat if he ends up winning the nomination.
“Based on what we’ve seen from the James campaign so far, the last thing Mike Duggan wants is for John James to lose the Republican nomination,” Bitely wrote.

Her comment was a reference to numerous attacks other Republican gubernatorial candidates, like Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt and former Attorney General Mike Cox, have lobbed at James. Both candidates have accused James for not campaigning enough in Michigan, evidenced by him skipping debates and not appearing at key GOP functions where donors and grassroots activists mingle together.
Michigan Democrats also got a jab in during the back and forth, noting that both James and Duggan will be in Traverse City on Friday for the Northern Michigan Policy Conference.
“John James and Mike Duggan are storming into Traverse City ensnared in chaos as accusations have flown this week and the airwaves are blitzed with attacks on James,” said Michigan Democratic Party spokesperson Derrick Honeyman in a statement. “It’s clear that James is panicking and desperately trying to show his loyalty to Trump, while Duggan has continued to remain silent on Trump’s disastrous policies as he cozies up to Trump and MAGA megadonors.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PA026798-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-23 12:37:48.294385

Gas stations in Christian, Logan and Simpson Counties have posted advertisements that say “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Learn more at Mayday Health,” Coleman’s office said in a Friday press release. 
It did not list which gas stations will be investigated under his suspicion they “could be participating in the unlawful mailing or delivery of abortion pills into Kentucky.” They have 20 days to respond to his subpoenas. 
Kentucky Today reported in August that Mayday Health launched the ad campaign at rural gas stations in Kentucky and West Virginia.

The Lantern has asked Mayday Health for comment on the ads and investigation. 
“Out-of-state activist groups who are targeting the vulnerable here should be on notice: Keep your illegal pills out of our Commonwealth or face the full weight of the Attorney General’s Office,” Coleman said in a statement. “These deadly and unlawful pills cannot be allowed to continue flooding into Kentucky through the mail, and we will thoroughly pursue every lead to hold bad actors accountable.”
A 2022 law passed by the Kentucky General Assembly says abortion medication can only be provided by a physician who is “a nonsurgical abortion provider.” 
“It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer, distributor, physician, qualified  physician, pharmacy, or any other person to intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly dispense, prescribe, or distribute any abortion-inducing drug … to a pregnant person via courier, delivery or mail service,” that law says.

Oct. 29. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. On Friday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a federal antitrust lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan against several petroleum companies and a leading oil lobbying group accusing them of violating federal and state-level antitrust laws.
Nessel’s lawsuit alleges BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute for alleged violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act and the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act.
The announcement comes two days after a group of Republican attorneys general issued a warning letter accusing the climate activist group Ceres of antitrust violations by coordinating efforts to pressure financial institutions and corporations away from investments into fossil fuels, calling the group “a ringleader of the ‘climate cartel.’”
According to Nessel’s suit, the fossil fuel defendants acted as a cartel to restrain trade and preemptively limit competition from renewable energy in both transportation and the primary energy market. 
Specifically, Nessel’s suit accuses the defendants and other co-conspirators of decades long efforts to abandon renewable energy products; use patent manipulation and litigation to hinder market competitors; suppress information concerning the once-hidden costs of fossil fuels and the viability of alternatives; infiltrate and knowingly mislead information-producing institutions; surveil and intimidate watchdogs and public officials; and use trade associations to coordinate market-wide efforts to divert capital expenditures away from renewable energy. 
“Michigan is facing an energy affordability crisis as our home energy costs skyrocket and consumers are left without affordable options for transportation. Whether you own a home, a small business, or run a large corporation, rising energy and transportation costs harm everyone,” Nessel said in a statement. “These out-of-control costs are not the result of natural economic inflation, but due to the greed of these corporations who prioritized their own profit and marketplace dominance over competition and consumer savings.”
In 2024, Nessel put out the call for proposals for attorneys and law firms to serve as Special Assistant Attorneys General to pursue legal action on behalf of the people of Michigan for climate change impacts caused by the fossil fuel industry. 
Nessel selected Sher Edling LLP, DiCello Levitt LLP, and Hausfeld LLP to pursue this action. According to the Department of Attorney General, each firm entered into contingency contracts for their work, meaning the state will not pay any expenses for their efforts, with the firms receiving compensation as part of a share of any financial relief awarded through the lawsuit.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_2076-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 12:37:48.294385

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — For the second quarter in a row, Nebraska’s federally measured Gross Domestic Product grew by about 5%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
On Friday, the BEA released its report on statewide GDP growth for the third quarter of 2025, which includes tallies for July, August and September. The report showed that Nebraska’s GDP grew 5%, tying the state with Iowa and Vermont for the 13th-highest GDP growth over that time.

“The data is in — and Nebraska’s economy is knocking it out of the park,” Gov. Jim Pillen said in a social media post celebrating the BEA report Friday.
The real GDP nationally rose about 4.4% for the quarter, making it the highest overall growth so far in 2025.
In 2025, Nebraska’s GDP has been a tale of extremes. In Q1, Nebraska tied with Iowa for largest losses of GDP at 6.1%, but the state bounced back in Q2, seeing its state GDP grow about 5.2% — the sixth highest growth nationally.
Although Nebraska’s overall GDP is up for 2025, state tax revenues haven’t mirrored that growth. Nebraska’s tax receipts for July, August and September were a mixed bag, but altogether posted a net decline of roughly $15 million compared to prior economic forecasts.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In the ongoing 60-day legislative session, state lawmakers are working to adjust the state’s two-year budget to fill a projected $471 million budget deficit. That goalpost may move even farther when Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board meets in February, as the latest tax receipts for November and December are down about $46 million.
“January’s receipts will be quite telling,” said State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Revenue Committee. “Then the forecasting board, which meets on February 27 … that will be very telling. That will determine our destiny for the rest of the session.”
Even though the latest tax receipts are down, von Gillern added that the full impact is relatively minor compared to Nebraska’s overall budget. The state’s general fund appropriations are set at about $5.5 billion per fiscal year.
Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said many factors contribute to GDP growth and the state’s monthly tax receipts, but not all of them align with one another.

For example, the BEA report notes that increases in agriculture added to several states’ GDP growth, including in neighboring states Kansas and South Dakota, which saw the two largest growth rates for that quarter.
While Nebraska has an expansive ag industry, Patent noted that the state’s tax receipts incorporate collections from all industries.
Still, Patent said, Nebraska’s GDP growth will be a positive driver that could help balance the impacts of lower-than-expected tax receipts. She said her office incorporates GDP changes as a factor in the reports they present to the state forecasting board.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said Nebraska’s GDP growing 5% is a very good sign that the state’s economy is stable.
“More economic activity means more sales taxes and more income taxes in the long run,” Clements said. “That’s really reassuring to me.”

The search is part of Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones’ promise to take politics out of higher education and defend Virginia’s students by recruiting and hiring talented legal professionals. Jones was sworn into office, along with Gov. Abigail Spanberger and Lt. Gov. Ghazala Hashmi, last Saturday.
The positions are at the University of Virginia, George Mason University, and Virginia Military Institute, all of which have been subject to federal scrutiny for their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as U.S. Department of Education leaders attempt to align higher education institutions nationwide with the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration.
Spanberger appoints 27 to university boards, orders study of selection process

UVA and George Mason have been the subject of multiple federal investigations. 
“Virginia’s world-class institutions of higher education are integral to spurring innovation, building the workforce of today and tomorrow, and driving economic growth,” said Attorney General Jay Jones in a statement. 
The Trump administration’s “continued politically-motivated assaults” on Virginia’s academic institutions have sought to “tarnish their reputations and undermine their ability to successfully prepare our students for the future” over the past year, Jones said. 
“Virginians made it clear this past November that they want leaders who will fight back against this federal overreach, and this national search delivers on that promise,” Jones said.
In recent days, the Washington Post reported that Jones removed university lawyers at George Mason and VMI.
Former Attorney General Jason Miyares similarly removed university counsel in 2022, with the office stating at the time it is common for a new attorney general to appoint counsel who share their philosophy.
Jones’ office said postings for higher education counsel have been advertised in several nationally recognized higher education associations to find “top legal talent to represent our institutions and protect their integrity.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s top elections official says her office has confirmed that more than 99.9% of Utah voters are U.S. citizens and has removed an additional noncitizen from voter rolls after finding four earlier last year. 
Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson released findings from an ongoing review Friday as Republican state lawmakers push for tougher enforcement of a prohibition on noncitizen voting in state and federal elections. 
“The bottom line is, there is not a widespread problem,” Henderson said. “You hear people say hundreds or thousands — it’s just not.”
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

Henderson’s office began the review last year to identify any noncitizens on the state’s voter rolls and find weak spots or mistakes that could allow that to happen. She said it identified one person who was ineligible to vote but registered anyway, although that person did not cast a ballot.  
Prior to starting the current review, the office last year found four people managed to register to vote when a state website inadvertently allowed people to proceed even if they acknowledged they were not U.S. citizens. 
“As soon as we found out, we immediately got it reprogrammed, and every clerk was supposed to check, verify the citizenship anyway,” Henderson said in an interview.” But obviously, you know, some slipped through the cracks. Four slipped through the cracks that we were able to catch and remove.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Friday’s public memo, she said the office compared voter records against driver’s license data, which records citizenship status. The review found 99.9% of more than 2 million voters are citizens, Henderson said. 
However, the status of more than 70,000 voters was still unclear, so the office consulted a separate federal database and confirmed all but 12% — or 8,836 — were citizens. Staff in her office reviewed the remaining voters’ information and narrowed the number of those they could not immediately verify were citizens to 486. 
The office wrote to everyone in that group last week and requested they update their forms by Feb. 1, Henderson said; 52 have responded. Many are older and began voting long ago, she said, before the state required a driver’s license or social security number to register. Typos and misspellings may help explain other cases, she added. 
How the office responds to any who don’t write back “largely depends on what happens with legislation this year,” Henderson said. 
She said the review process demands a careful approach to balance finding and removing people who aren’t eligible to vote while also not removing those entitled to vote, which she noted violates federal law. 
“It’s also a lousy thing to do,” Henderson said in the memo. 
In 2022, to Henderson’s surprise, a county clerk marked her as a noncitizen and rendered her voter registration inactive, she said in the memo, “simply because I was born overseas. This was not done maliciously; it was the result of a too-aggressive scrubbing of the county’s voter rolls that inappropriately purged eligible voters born outside the United States.”
Henderson was born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force. She did not identify the county or the clerk’s office that removed her name.  
If it could happen to the state’s second-in-command and the chief election officer, she wrote, “who else might be wrongly caught in such an overzealous dragnet? We did not want to repeat my former clerk’s mistake.”
The initial phase of the review focused on active voters born outside the United States, Henderson said. The next will examine inactive voter data and those born in the U.S. but for whom the state has incomplete information.

We need strong Republicans who will stand up for common sense, defend America-First principles and fight back. We need leaders from the real world, not more career politicians. As a Republican leader and small business owner, I believe now is the time to step forward.”
In her announcement, Cordell said she would focus on defending President Trump from partisan impeach attacks, cutting taxes, protecting the right to life and women’s sports, and restoring parental rights in education, among other priorities.

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)A bill to provide free meals for North Dakota students failed by two votes in the state Senate on Friday, likely leaving the decision to a statewide vote. 
House Bill 1624 failed in the Senate 24-22. It had passed the House 55-38 a day earlier. 
The Together for Free School Meals coalition is gathering signatures to put a constitutional measure requiring that the state provide free school meals. If the petition drive is successful, the issue will be on the ballot in November. 
“Providing school meals at no cost is one of the most effective, research-backed ways to strengthen academic performance, reduce stress on families, and give every child a fair shot. That’s why I’m committed to helping move this forward because feeding kids isn’t just good policy, it’s the right thing to do for their future,” Robin Nelson, chair of the measure’s sponsoring committee, said in a statement after the vote.  
Opponents of the bill in both chambers argued that the money needed for free school meals could be better spent elsewhere, such as expanded property tax credits. Some argued that providing free meals is socialism and pointed to other state-supported programs that provide meals to needy families. 
Senators also argued against rushing through a bill just to head off a ballot measure, even if a change in the constitution ties the hands of the Legislature. 
Sen. Mark Enget, R-Powers Lake, said there is an advantage to leaving the issue up to a statewide vote.
“If we face that outcome, it is the people themselves that will need to recognize and choose to place this financial noose around their necks. They themselves will bear the burden of making a financial harmful decision that ultimately forces the state to raise taxes to cover the ever growing state budget,” Enget said during the lengthy floor debate. 
Supporters of the bill sought to maintain legislative control of the school lunch program and the funding it needs. They also argued it would help families with rising costs. 
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, would have provided $65 million to provide free meals for the next school year.  He said seeing the results of the program in the first year would help the Legislature make adjustments the next time it meets in regular session in 2027.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The federal government has moved detained immigrants out of Maine’s largest jail as of Friday morning, a marked shift after the jail had been a detention hub during President Donald Trump’s second term so far. 
While this comes amid U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s heightened activities in Maine, the people known to have been detained during the operation so far were not being held in local jails but instead sent out of state soon after apprehension. 
“Folks are having issues with being able to locate their loved ones,” said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition.
Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions.  
On Thursday, The University of Maine’s School of Law’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic, which has helped provide legal support to more than 300 people held in the county jail during Trump’s second term, began receiving frantic calls from detainees telling their counsel they were being moved. 
Anna Welch, the founding director of the clinic, has heard from jail staff that there are no longer any immigration detainees in the facility as of Friday morning, though one person the clinic has helped is still showing up as in the facility, according to ICE’s detainee locator. 
Based on that locator, people have since been sent to the Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin, New Hampshire; the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island and the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. But the locations for the majority of women removed from the jail are not yet clear, and Welch said they may be sent to Louisiana, based on conversations her co-counsel has had with detainees. 
This is not the first time these people have been moved, as Welch and other attorneys said the majority of those that had been in the jail had not been apprehended in Maine and were instead moved from other facilities. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE and Cumberland County Jail did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the removal of people from the jail nor where the federal government is otherwise holding people detained during its Maine operation.
The abrupt removal from the facility comes after Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce publicly questioned on Thursday the agency’s priorities after ICE detained one of his corrections officer recruits. Joyce said the recruit had a “squeaky clean record.” 
Unclear where new detainees are being held
Since the Trump administration launched its operation in Maine on Tuesday, local organizers and legal groups have tried to gather details about who has been taken and where they’re being sent, while Gov. Janet Mills and other Democratic officials are demanding transparency from the Trump administration, which has not been communicating with Maine leaders and shared few details of its plans. 
With sparse information about who has been detained overall, and up to 48 hours for detainees to be entered into the tracking system, little is known about people’s whereabouts. 
As of Wednesday, Cumberland County Jail hadn’t had any new bookings this week for federal immigration detainees. Before they were moved out, there had been 64 immigration detainees in the facility, with nine total new bookings in January. 
Cumberland and Androscoggin County, which includes Lewiston, are the areas that have had the most ICE activity so far, based on reports verified by community organizers, though federal agents have also been seen elsewhere in recent days.
Androscoggin County Jail has only had one person with immigration related charges booked this week, but that person was brought in on Tuesday by the Lewiston Police Department on local charges. Police told the jail upon arrival that the person also had a federal detainer, meaning he’ll be held for ICE if he makes bail. 
Two Bridges Regional Jail in Bath has held the second-most immigration detainees throughout Trump’s second term, but it’s also had no new immigration-related bookings since the heightened operations in Maine, intake supervisor Corporal Aaron Smith said. 
The facility has five ICE detainees, but they’ve been there for an average of 301 days, with the shortest length of time being 272 days and the longest being 318 days, Smith said. They were all transferred to Two Bridges from other facilities, so it is unclear how long they’ve been in detention overall. 
A pattern of moving immigrant detainees
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, expects people already out of state could be moved again to more remote detention facilities. That’s the pattern that has emerged out of Minnesota. In that case often to a facility in Texas and more recently, in some cases, then to New Mexico. 
Down South is where the largest detention facilities are. That was the case even before the Trump administration pumped more money into them through the spending bill passed in the summer.
It’s also more difficult to get attorneys to those sprawling, more remote areas, said Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union. 
In Maine, someone was moved out of state this week hours before a federal judge had ordered ICE not to do so. 
On Tuesday, ICE detained Yanick Joao Carneiro of Portland, an asylum seeker from Angola, at a routine immigration check-in without a warrant, according to the petition filed by his lawyer.
U.S. District Court Judge Stacey Neumann ordered ICE to explain why they arrested him. Instead, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Concannon argued in his filing that Neumann no longer had the authority to rule on Carneiro’s case because he’s in Massachusetts.
The majority of immigration detainees that had been held in Cumberland County Jail were not Maine residents and were not detained in Maine, according to attorneys providing legal assistance. Jail records don’t provide that insight, though, as records only indicate the overall agency that’s the arresting body.  
But, according to attorneys, most appear to be transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too. 
Federal authorities may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but legal experts say regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch. 
The use of Cumberland County Jail to aid Trump’s mass deportation agenda became clear in the spring when public records requested revealed the facility had increased detentions for federal immigration authorities. 
The jail has since faced mounting pressure from community members to end its contract that permits such detentions. The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal Service since July 2010. Under this contract, Cumberland County Jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.
The Cumberland County Board of Commissioners pushed off their decision, and the state Legislature is now considering a bill to clear the path for the contract’s termination.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4501-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 11:37:23.744204

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Advocates and survivors of child sexual abuse are urging legislators to pass Erin’s Law, which requires K-12 schools teach about body safety and sexual abuse prevention at an age-appropriate level once per school year.
Members of Protecting Kansas Children from Predators introduced the bill to members of the House Education Committee Thursday with hopes Kansas joins the 38 states with Erin’s Law on the books. Co-directors Kim Bergman and Tess Ramirez received support for the bill from both Republicans and Democrats on Thursday, with plans to continue talking to legislators. 
“It became our mission for the year to focus on Erin’s Law to prevent children from being abused,” Bergman said. “Prevention is important. Kids start talking after these presentations. Getting kids comfortable reporting can prevent other children from being abused.”
Erin Merryn, whom the law is named after, has traveled across the country for 15 years speaking to state legislators about implementing the law in schools. Merryn testified for Kansas legislators in 2013, but the law did not pass that year. 
“It’s 2026 and Kansas has still not passed my law, yet 38 other states have,” Merryn said. “This is teaching kids the difference between safe and unsafe touch, safe and unsafe secrets. What you’re teaching your first graders is not what you’re teaching sixth graders.”
Bergman and Ramirez said that legislators  seem open to the bill this time, after having both Republicans and Democrats express support for a potential hearing. 
“This is not a party-affiliated bill,” Bergman said. “We had support from both sides. I think this is more likely to pass if we’re not pointing a finger at one party or the other. This is the first year we’ve been pushing Erin’s Law in a while, and Republicans have been taking it really well.”
Rep. Rebecca Schmoe, an Ottawa Republican, sees this bill as a way to ensure child predators have no “safe haven” within the state. 
“Erin’s Law represents an age-appropriate, proactive step in what is too often a reactive battle against child abuse,” Schmoe said. “Empowerment through education breaks the silence, prompts early disclosures to stop ongoing harm, and safeguards our most innocent and vulnerable before abuse occurs.”
If passed in Kansas, school boards would have to select the curriculum for their district and teachers would be required to have special training in recognizing warnings signs of sexual abuse. The Erin’s Law foundation offers its own free curriculum as well as a list of other resources for parents and educators.
“We think the best choice for schools is to have a local child advocacy center come into schools and do a presentation themselves,” Bergman said. “Some places in western Kansas won’t have that, but that’s why Erin’s Law curriculum is a great option. It’s free but also understands that every community is different.”
While curriculum decisions are generally left to the Kansas Board of Education, House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard said the topic is too important for lawmakers to overlook.
“If we’re not putting this in curriculum for teaching, the longer we act like it’s not happening, that is how you end up with people learning on their own or sex abuse happening because they don’t know what boundaries and appropriate limits are,” Woodard said. 
Merryn said typically red state lawmakers criticize the law and its curriculum claiming it’s sex education. In reality, the curriculum focuses on creating boundaries, how to talk to a trusted adult and how to identify grooming, she says.
“This is not teaching kids about changing your gender, how to have sex. What an abortion is, you name it,” Merryn said. “Anyone that wants to look at it can view my curriculum, and it’s free. There’s no reason to not want kids to learn this. Anyone that’s still skeptical, parents can opt their children out.”
Merryn said that children who are abused often exhibit behavior signs that teachers can catch to get them the help they need. One lesson per year outweighs skepticism of the curriculum when you see the effect it can have on a child’s life, she said. 
“Look at the consequences of what happens when a kid is abused,” Merryn said. “Nobody knows what’s going on at home. Children that are being abused or taking up far more time in our classrooms, being a disruption and acting out. Just because you talk to your kids about this, doesn’t mean your best friend or your children’s best friends’ parents talk to their kids about it.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/P1170700-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-23 12:37:48.294385

(Photo courtesy of the S.C. Department of Motor Vehicles)COLUMBIA — Anyone planning to fly needs a REAL ID or other accepted form of identification to avoid paying fees at airports starting next month, the Department of Motor Vehicles warned this week.
Starting Feb. 1, adults who do not present a REAL ID, passport or military ID will have to pay a $45 fee to get through airport security.


What do I need for a REAL ID?

Proof of identity and citizenship, such as a government-issued birth certificate or unexpired U.S. passport.
Two proofs of address. This could include an unexpired South Carolina driver’s license, a utility bill showing name and address, state or federal tax records, a current lease agreement, and/or a letter delivered through the U.S. Postal Service. The addresses on both items must match.
Proof of all legal name changes, if applicable. This could be a court order or divorce decree, a government-issued marriage license or an unexpired passport.

Source: South Carolina DMV


REAL IDs are required only to fly, get on a military base or enter a secure federal building. They are not required to drive, vote, access federal benefits or enter non-secure federal buildings, such as a post office.
Getting a REAL ID, which has a gold star in the corner, requires more paperwork verifying a person’s identity than a standard ID. The cost for most South Carolinians is $25, the same as renewing a standard driver’s license.
Nearly 69% of IDs in circulation in the state meet the requirements for a REAL ID. Around 1.4 million South Carolinians have IDs that do not qualify, said DMV spokesman Mike Fitts.
Anyone planning to travel should plan ahead. The DMV no longer prints IDs at branch locations. Receiving an ID through the mail can take up to two weeks.
Congress passed the law requiring REAL IDs to standardize identification in 2005, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks that killed about 3,000 people in New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania.
For 12 years, South Carolina refused to comply, before reversing course in 2017 when it seemed enforcement would begin. But federal officials kept pushing back the start date until May 2025.
Even then, travelers with only a standard ID could go through additional security screening.
The $45 fee travelers will have to pay starting Feb. 1 is for the TSA ConfirmID process, which Travel Security Administration officials use to attempt to verify the identity of a traveler.
People planning to fly can complete the process online ahead of time and bring a printed or electronic copy of their receipt to show the TSA officer at the airport’s security checkpoint. The process can take up to half an hour.
Confirmation of a traveler’s identity is valid for up to 10 days, so anyone returning to the airport within those 10 days has to pay the fee only once.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/REAL-ID-Sample-Image-1024x640.png,,,2026-01-23 11:37:23.744204

The protest took place the morning of “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom,” a general strike supported by Minnesota unions, progressive faith leaders and community activists. Proponents are encouraging all Minnesotans to stay home from work, school and refrain from shopping — disruptions of normal orders of business to protest the presence of federal immigration agents in Minnesota.
Demonstrators at the airport were standing or kneeling on the roadway outside Terminal 1’s departures area and led away by law enforcement.
Jeff Lea, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said in an email that the airport “worked in advance with event organizers to best accommodate their right to freedom of expression while also ensuring uninterrupted operations.”
“When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1,” Lea wrote. Lea said he could not yet confirm how many arrests were made.
The airport arrests were just one of several protests planned around the metro.
Thousands of people are expected to bear the subzero temperatures and march in downtown Minneapolis Friday.
Demonstrators are starting at The Commons Park at 2 p.m. in Minneapolis. The march will end at Target Center, where small businesses, faith leaders and unions are planning a rally at 3 p.m.
Over 700 businesses have said they will be closed Friday to support the “ICE Out” day, according to Bring Me The News, which is keeping a running list.

The National Weather Service also predicts ice accumulations of a little less than half an inch for southern Indiana and central Kentucky that could lead to power outages and tree damage. 
During the storm, which is forecast to hit overnight Friday and last through the weekend, “travel could be nearly impossible,” the National Weather Service reported.

For people who “must travel” during the storm, the National Weather Service recommends keeping an extra flashlight, food and water in the vehicle. After the initial snowfall, the National Weather Service forecasts drops in temperature to single digits next week. 
“This is a serious storm that will likely cause dangerous conditions on our roads and potential power outages, which is why we are doing everything we can to keep Kentuckians safe,” Beshear said in a statement. “We ask that everyone does what they can to prepare now. Run any necessary errands before the storm, avoid traveling while conditions are dangerous and have weather alerts turned on to stay informed.”
Beshear’s office said the administration is prepping warming centers throughout the state and will have water supplies and generators. 
His state of emergency order allows for activation of the National Guard  to “protect life and safety, to continue essential public services and to prevent undue loss and suffering.” 
Beshear also activated price gouging prohibitions, which prevents the price of goods from being “grossly” inflated during the emergency. Any incidents of price gouging should be reported to Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office here.

Why she can’t go to school, and why he can’t work.
“The only thing we tell her is that soon everything will be over. Everything will be over soon, and she’ll go back to school like before,” Frank said in Spanish.
The truth is, no one knows when the federal siege will end. It may not be soon.
U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who calls his officers “troops,” said “this mission is ongoing until there are no more of those criminal illegal aliens roaming the streets.”
Frank — who asked that he be identified only by his nickname to protect his identity — is originally from Mexico but has lived in the United States for more than a decade.
He has a pending application for what’s known as a U visa, which are available to victims of human trafficking, domestic abuse and other serious crimes, so they can cooperate with law enforcement without the fear of being deported.
The Trump administration has pushed to eject U visa applicants, which is why Frank’s lawyer has advised him to keep a low profile. Other immigrants in similar situations have been detained and deported, all while following the rules.
Frank knows a dozen people who’ve been deported — several in just the past couple weeks, including a co-worker on a construction job site.
His kids, three of whom are U.S. citizens, switched to online school. He stopped going to work, and he and his wife never leave the house together, lest they both be detained and separated from their children.
Frank, who has no criminal record save a couple traffic tickets, is the main breadwinner for his family. They’ve been able to live off savings, although he recently had to ask his mother in Mexico for help.
“We still don’t have enough, but we have a little bit to survive on,” he said.
‘Reckoning & Retribution’

The aggressive campaign of sweeping up immigrants has driven tens of thousands of people like Frank into hiding.
The Trump administration claims they are targeting the “worst of the worst” criminals in the country illegally in the “largest DHS operation ever” with some 3,000 federal agents in Minnesota.
Their ranks far surpass the several hundred agents sent to the Chicago area despite Minnesota having a much smaller population and far fewer immigrants without permanent legal status. Pew Research estimates 130,000 out of Minnesota’s roughly 6 million residents are undocumented, a relatively small percentage compared to states like Texas and Florida — contrary to Vice President JD Vance’s recent claim that Minneapolis has the “highest concentration of people who have violated our immigration laws.”
Launched in December under the stated goal of combating Medicaid fraud, the operation followed a high-profile state and federal investigation into social services fraud that involved mostly Somali American defendants. The case drew years of local media attention before being amplified by right-wing outlets and, eventually, by the president himself.
“Do the people of Minnesota really want to live in a community in which their are thousands of already convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners, dangerous people from foreign mental institutions and insane asylums, and other deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention,” Trump posted to Truth Social on Jan. 13, promising the day of “RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”
The Department of Homeland Security says it’s arrested some 3,000 undocumented criminals in Minnesota since December — and 10,000 in the past year — although the figures strain credulity and the agency hasn’t provided a full list of who those people are.
Instead, DHS has periodically released curated lists of mug shots including many of those who were already in custody in state prisons.
The operation has ignited fierce resistance from residents and Democratic officials that’s grown into a crescendo since an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old unarmed woman, in her car in south Minneapolis. Many Minnesotans grew further outraged when the Department of Homeland Security called her a “domestic terrorist,” while the U.S. Department of Justice yanked local investigators off the case. A week later, federal immigration agents shot a second person after a case of apparent mistaken identity, setting off clashes between law enforcement and protesters.

Gov. Tim Walz, whose office was subpoenaed by the feds for documents related to state immigration enforcement, appealed directly to Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “end this occupation,” as has virtually every elected Democrat in the state including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey whose appeal was, “get the f*ck out.”
Neither has any influence with the Trump administration besides, and Walz has become a lame duck since announcing early this month he won’t run for a third term.
As Democrats wait for proven vote-getter Sen. Amy Klobuchar to announce a run governor, the resistance to Trump’s siege has not come from politicians but from everyday Minnesotans — practiced in protest since even before the police murder of George Floyd — using a decentralized but well-organized system for spotting and harassing federal officers and giving aid to people who need it.
Minnesotans have reacted with an unbending resistance befitting people who are accustomed to withstanding the bitter cold. The state’s Midwestern progressivism, civic activism, volunteerism and tight familial and social networks serve as crucial infrastructure of the rampart against the federal presence.
Assaults on citizens
Each day brings a new news story about a lawful resident being handcuffed, sometimes beaten, and whisked away in an unmarked vehicle, unable to reach family members.
A Minnesota-born, Somali-American woman with no criminal record was shoved to the ground by ICE agents outside her apartment in St. Paul and called a racial slur on a Wednesday morning.
Nasra Ahmed, 23, says even though she showed agents her ID, she was detained for two days, including being shackled in a hospital while undergoing an MRI after suffering an apparent stress-induced seizure.
Just a few days later, at least eight masked federal agents broke down the door of a U.S. citizen with no criminal history in East St. Paul and arrested him at gunpoint in front of his 5-year-old grandson. (The Associated Press reported this week that “federal immigration officers are asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant.”) 
Video taken by a neighbor show officers leading the man, ChongLy Scott Thao, outside in 10-degree weather wearing only a pair of blue boxer briefs, white crocs and a plaid blanket draped over his shoulders. He was detained for about an hour in a vehicle before agents dropped him back off at home.
DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said he matched the description of two men with criminal convictions at Thao’s address, but Thao hardly looks like either of them, save for being Asian, and said he doesn’t know either man. One of the men turned out to have been in prison since 2024.

ProPublica reported in October — months before Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota — that immigration agents have detained more than 170 U.S. citizens.
Federal agents are also targeting the roughly 5,600 refugees in Minnesota who have yet to receive permanent residency as part of “Operation PARRIS” — Post-Adminision Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening. It has entailed arresting refugees with no criminal records who are complying with the federal government’s rigorous screening process including more than a dozen health and background checks.
Countless other lawful residents have been stopped and asked to show identification just on the suspicion of looking like an immigrant.
“In every situation, we’re doing targeted enforcement,” Noem said when asked why Americans are being asked on the street to prove their citizenship. “If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are.”
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison alleged federal agents are racially profiling people — which DHS denies — in a lawsuit filed with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeking to end the operation.
Evidence supporting the allegation abounds.
Journalists have witnessed federal immigration agents check random non-white people’s documents outside big box stores, electric vehicle charging stations and bus stops. Agents even demanded the papers of a Latino couple whom they rear-ended (both are U.S. citizens).
Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said while he has worked well with ICE in the past, his department is now receiving “endless complaints about civil rights violations” including from members of his own police force who aren’t white.
Federal agents boxed in one of his officers — a U.S. citizen — while she was off-duty and demanded to see her papers, Bruley said during a news conference with other local law enforcement leaders. The agents had their guns drawn and knocked the off-duty officer’s phone out of her hand, leaving only after she identified herself as a police officer without comment or apology.
“Our officers know what the Constitution is. They know what right and wrong is. And they know when people are being targeted. And that’s what they were,” Brule said.
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told the New York Times that federal agents have stopped police officers’ family members, though “they’re not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish.”
Many people of color in the Twin Cities now grab their passports before leaving the house — a previously unthinkable and unacceptable necessity of life in the modern United States.
The aggressive papers checks, which a court may very well determine are unconstitutional, are driven by a perverse incentive structure that rewards officers for the number of arrests they make, even if the people they detain are later released, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Pervasive fear

The terror the federal occupation is inflicting on immigrants — regardless of their legal status — is apparent in missed school days, doctors appointments and work shifts.
Schools, hospitals and churches have traditionally been off-limits to immigration agents, but Trump lifted the restrictions on immigration enforcement actions at sensitive locations that provide essential services in one of the first immigration policy directives of his second term.
Minneapolis Public Schools canceled school for two days after federal agents came to the high school that houses the Spanish immersion program during dismissal, hours after an ICE agent killed Good. They tackled people, handcuffed two staff members and released chemical irritants outside the school. A Border Patrol spokesperson told KARE 11 the skirmish happened after bystanders interfered with federal agents making an arrest next to the school.
In St. Paul, federal agents briefly pulled over two unmarked contract vans carrying students and staff to school in mid-January. The stops ended without incident but nevertheless frightened students and parents.
In Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, school officials say federal agents have detained four students in two weeks, including a 5-year-old boy and his father after returning home from school and a 10-year-old and her mother on the way to school.
“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our children,” Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public School District superintendent, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
School districts across the Twin Cities metro have noted a drop in attendance from students from Latino and other immigrant families. In St. Paul, at least one-fourth of students from Spanish-speaking homes have missed every day of school since Dec. 12.
Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools have both responded by offering virtual learning options for students who don’t feel safe coming to school. It’s a better option than no school at all, and yet students still haven’t recovered from pandemic-era learning loss.

Medical providers have also reported many of their immigrant patients have stopped showing up to appointments. Diabetics are rationing insulin. Jaundiced babies are missing treatment. Mothers are laboring in hiding.
ICE agents have entered hospitals, including Hennepin County Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital in Minnesota, without judicial warrants to guard detainees needing medical care around the clock over the objections of medical staff.
One is Alberto Castaneda Mondragon, who suffered a life-threatening brain injury shortly after being detained by ICE, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf. He doesn’t remember how he was injured and has been medically sedated since being hospitalized, but an agent told medical staff “he got his sh*t rocked,” according to the lawsuit.
ICE’s presence has sent a chilling effect throughout the hospital — on both patients and staff.
Medical staff, elected officials and immigrant rights activists held a news conference decrying ICE’s presence in the hospital in early January, and two days later DHS subpoenaed the hospital’s employment records to audit workers’ employment eligibility, which one Hennepin County commissioner called “retaliatory.”
Immigration lawyers have reported a surge in similar audits at businesses across the Twin Cities — including a St. Paul toy store with a handful of part-time employees  — making the federal siege personally painful for business owners who might otherwise be immune from immigration operations.
Businesses that rely on immigrant workers — and customers — across the economy are all feeling the effects of the siege.
A new underground relief network

The siege on Minnesota has ignited a relief effort on the scale of a natural disaster response, albeit under the glaring eyes of the federal government.
Churches, schools and coffee shops have become pop-up collection centers for food and other necessities that are distributed to immigrant homes.
A trans-owned sex toy store in Minneapolis called Smitten Kitten has become one of the major distribution centers, with boxes of Kleenex and Kraft Mac and Cheese and Campbell’s soup piled up next to displays of leather harnesses and wooden paddles.
Anne Lehman has been working around the clock since putting out the call for donations on Jan. 10, directing volunteers and a steady flow of donations.
Lehman wears hoop earrings with 3D-printed whistles that people drop off by the bagful every couple days to arm observers with what’s become the signature symbol of resistance. One whistle says “Go home passport bro” and the other “beta male repellant” — they’ve gotten a fair amount of use, too.
“We all know that ICE is f*cking dweebs. They’re just cosplaying their ‘Call of Duty’ game, but they’re also actively terrorizing and traumatizing my city,” Lehman said.
People are welcome to come pick up donations right from the store, or Lehman sends it on to larger collection sites at churches and trusts it eventually makes it to people in need.
They don’t track where all the food and diapers and tubes of toothpaste go, which adds a layer of security for the people they’re trying to help.
Lehman says Smitten Kitten has gotten the attention of federal agents, and fears if they started making deliveries from the store they could unintentionally lead immigration agents to vulnerable families.

Eventually the supplies end up with families like Raquel’s.
Raquel and her husband, Jesus, have lived in the United States for more than 20 years. She works as a house cleaner, he as a roofer. They own a home in the northern suburbs where they’re raising their two kids.
But their deeply rooted lives in Minnesota became suddenly precarious under the Trump administration and his focus on Minnesota. Raquel and Jesus — who were granted anonymity to protect their identities — have had pending U visa applications for several years.
She stopped going to work in the cities, where ICE has focused much of their attention. It’s been a hit financially, although some of her clients have continued to pay her to help make ends meet. One brings her groceries.
But the suburbs aren’t free from ICE either. Her best friend’s brother was just deported with his son while doing construction work in the suburbs.
While her kids are still going to school, she stopped taking them to the mall or out to eat. She’s had to instruct them not to answer the door, and while she and her husband never leave together.
“Because in case we both get detained, my kids are at risk to be alone,” Raquel said. “We don’t have family here.”
Her boss has let her use her vehicle, since ICE can pull up vehicle registrations and appears to be targeting people with Hispanic last names. Her husband checks ICE activity online crowdsourced by an army of volunteer observers to try to avoid places where they’re active.
“We spend more on gas but that doesn’t matter to stay safe,” he said.
A growing resistance

Twin Cities residents have been turning out every day to monitor ICE activities. Car horns and whistles have become a constant in parts of the cities, alerting immigrants to lock their doors and citizens to come out and film.
Walz has encouraged Minnesotans to keep their phones handy to record any federal activity, creating a “database of atrocities” to serve as evidence in future prosecutions.
Bystanders have documented numerous instances of federal agents brutalizing people, including a border patrol agent kneeing a man in the face several times while others hold him down.
Some residents have taken to driving around the metro looking for ICE vehicles — tinted windows and out-of-state plates, usually — and then tailing them to observe, but also to distract them and slow them down.
“The more time they’re trying to get away from us, the less time they’re spending searching for people to abduct,” one patroller, Patty O’Keefe, told the Reformer.
Neighborhood group chats dedicated to tracking ICE movements regularly reach capacity at 1,000 members, while a group that trains people to be ICE watchers is looking for larger venues.
It’s become a cat and mouse game, but with the roles frequently changing.
Federal agents, in an effort to evade observers, have taken to switching the license plates on their vehicles — a crime in Minnesota, the state Department of Public Safety reminded Noem in a letter.
Sometimes they’ll lead the observers to their own homes — apparently using a law enforcement database to connect license plate numbers to addresses in an effort to intimidate observers.

They’ve also threatened and detained people for following them. O’Keefe was recently dragged from her car with another observer, Brandon Sigüenza, and detained for around eight hours before being released without charges.
Federal agents have responded to crowds of observers and hecklers with aggressive force — tackling people, spraying them in the face with chemical irritants and deploying enough tear gas to cause coughing fits in a several block radius.
High-ranking leaders on the ground have not just encouraged these tactics, but participated in them. Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, threw a can of gas in a melee that broke out when a crowd formed around a federal convoy driving slowly through a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis.
The show of force came just hours after the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge’s ruling in a case brought by the ACLU that sought to stop federal agents from detaining and tear gassing people engaged in peaceful protest or observation.
Resistance to ICE has gone mainstream, at least in the core cities, where businesses have plastered signs telling federal agents they’re not welcome without a judicial warrant. Scores of unions, businesses and organizations are expected to participate in a general strike on Friday.
Homeland Security posted on social media that Border Patrol agents have been struggling to find a place to go to the bathroom in Minneapolis because at each gas station they are turned away or met with groups of angry residents.
The weather hasn’t cooperated either. A steady accumulation of snow has thawed and refrozen several times as temperatures yo-yoed between unusually balmy 40s and bonechilling sub-zeros, glazing sidewalks and city streets with ice.
Federal agents have beached their SUVs and cars in slush and snowbanks across the metro, often having to call in back-up to be pushed free.
ICE agents slipping on ice has become its own genre on social media and a source of schadenfreude for many opposed to their presence.
One particularly viral moment was captured from several angles by bystanders: a Border Patrol agent in a black balaclava runs down the street before hitting a patch of ice that sends both feet skywards before he lands on his back. Observers can be seen jumping in celebration as he turns around and jogs back to his unmarked black Chevrolet Suburban.
The clip was set to praise music, mixed in ice-on-ICE compilations, and played multiple times to a cheering audience of Saturday Night Live.
Every day, protesters line the street outside the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, which briefly appeared on a list of federal buildings to be sold last year during Trump’s DOGE era and is now serving as home base for Operation Metro Surge. The office building, which houses offices for DHS, Veterans Affairs, and Fish and Wildlife Services, now serves as a short-term detention center for immigrants and protesters, who’ve described sordid, overcrowded conditions.

On a recent Saturday, several hundred protesters yelled “Shame!” and “Get the f*ck out of here!” at the steady stream of masked agents in SUVs with out-of-state license plates coming and going.
An agent in a Kia Soul with Michigan plates blew kisses over his mask as he left the building. The masked passenger of a Hyundai Tucson with Illinois plates filmed protesters on his cell phone as they pulled into the gated compound.
Eric Lofdahl of St. Paul was there shaking a small copy of the U.S. Constitution at the agents driving by, as he had been for the past few days.
“The First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, 14th Amendment… these are things that this administration doesn’t care about,” Lofdahl said.
The atmosphere is often neighborly — people hand out slices of pizza, cups of hot coffee and handwarmers.
But the appearance of law enforcement have led to frequent skirmishes and arrests, including of a person dressed in a unicorn costume.
The federal government has delivered a forceful crackdown on protesters — who they call rioters. On Thursday, longtime civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong and two other activists were arrested for protesting during a church service where one of the pastors is an ICE field director. Attorney General Pam Bondi called it an attack on a place of worship.
The White House sent out a digitally doctored photo of Levy Armstrong that showed her crying and her skin tone a darker hue.
‘For us, it’s always been the safest state’
The federal incursion is activating residents who haven’t previously been very political as it infringes on their daily lives.
Ana Alarcon, a U.S. citizen, was at the laundromat early one Sunday morning with her kids when two ICE agents came in and started questioning her. Another time, she was leaving a Mexican grocery store with her husband, a permanent U.S. resident from Mexico, and saw ICE agents stopped in traffic, studying her license plate.
“You never think Minnesota would be what it’s like now,” Alarcon said. “For us, it’s always been the safest state.”
Her daughter turned 18 this month, but they didn’t have a big party because most of her friends didn’t want to leave home.
Alarcon now carries her passport with her all the time and doesn’t let her husband leave the house alone. He doesn’t speak fluent English, and she worries he won’t even get the chance to show his papers before being detained. Also, if there’s two of them, one will be able to record it on their phone.
“We’ve noticed that if there’s only one person in the car, the agents tend to take their phones or knock it out of their hands,” Ana said.
She doesn’t want to be mistaken for being afraid, however. Certainly not in front of a federal agent, because she has nothing to hide.
So, for the first time, she started going to protests.
“Being afraid … it’s like venom. It’s like a sickness,” Alarcon said. “We have to get out and not show them we’re not afraid.”

U.S. outdoor recreation brought in more money in 2023 than in past years, accounting for 2.3% of gross domestic product, according to the most recent Outdoor Recreation Satellite report from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The “snow activities” subset had an economic impact of $7.7 billion to the national economy in 2023.
In Connecticut, winter sports accounted for 1.2%, or $66,172,000, of all economic impact brought in from outdoor recreational sports in 2023. Colorado, California and Utah saw the most value added to their economies from snow activities.
Connecticut ranked 28th for the percentage of economic impact generated from snow activities. 
Connecticut is home to four ski resorts and has multiple opportunities for snowmobiling and other winter activities in the state. However, snow sports do not bring a large amount of money to the state’s economy compared to other outdoor activities like boating, RVing and hunting.
The Connecticut Tourism Office curated a list of winter activities for residents and visitors to participate in this season. While traditional snow sports made the list, some mountains offer less conventional winter activities like snow biking and snow tubing.
The list also recommends some winter hikes, which would fall under hiking, not snow activities, even on a snowy day.
For those who would prefer to stay warm, numerous recreational indoor activities were also listed, including rock climbing and an indoor ropes course.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/aAIOe-how-much-economic-impact-did-snow-activities-have-in-2023--1024x710.png,,,2026-01-23 11:37:23.744204

A bill could be to the Senate within a week.","The House of Delegates chamber from the gallery. (File Photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)It’s full speed ahead for a legislative effort to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts.
Just three days after a five-member gubernatorial advisory committee voted 3-2 to recommend a congressional redistricting plan that would hobble the one Republican-held district in the state, a bill has been drafted and will be introduced in the House at Friday morning’s session.
The bill, sponsored by Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), who was a member of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission, is based on a “concept map” approved by the commission.
The bill is expected to be referred to the House Rules Committee, which late Thursday scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Monday. There is no agenda yet for that hearing, but an expedited process for Wilson’s bill could have it out of committee and back to the House floor as early as Tuesday. That would put it on track for a final vote by midweek and referral by next Friday to the Senate, where opponents have vowed to kill the plan.
The House introduction is a speedy turnaround from Tuesday, when the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission met in private and voted 3-2 to recommend a “concept map” to the General Assembly. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, a Republican, voted against making a recommendation.
Moore’s redistricting commission recommends ‘congressional map concept’

The concept map makes changes to all eight congressional districts, but it makes the most-severe changes to the 1st District — the state’s lone Republican district, held by GOP Rep. Andy Harris.
Currently, the district includes the entire Eastern Shore before stretching into Cecil and Harford counties and part of eastern Baltimore County. The conceptual map would recast the district by cutting off part of the upper Shore and instead pushing the district across the Chesapeake Bay into Anne Arundel County, where it would stretch north and west into Howard County to include a portion of Columbia.
The changes increase the number of liberal Democrats into the district. The change, in theory, would make it harder for a conservative Republican like Harris, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, to retain the seat.
But the concept map has problems.
None of the eight districts in the concept would pass judicial review. Population has to be as close to equal as possible in each of the eight districts to meet the “one person, one vote” standard, but the map as drawn varies by more than 1,000 people between the largest and smallest districts.
The bill introduced in the House Friday is expected to address that issue by shifting district lines to “zero out” population discrepancies.
The quick turnaround comes as the state braces for what could be a major snowstorm over the weekend, with Gov. Wes Moore declaring a state of preparedness Thursday ahead of the storm.
The latest forecast called for accumulating snow, sleet and freezing rain to the state. The National Weather Service put the region under a winter storm watch Friday, with the storm expected to start Saturday and stretch through most of the day Sunday.
It is unclear how the weather may affect the meetings Monday. The scheduled Rules Committee hearing leaves open the possibility of a virtual meeting if weather prevents lawmakers from making it back to Annapolis.

Marijuana can’t pass over state lines because it’s still federally illegal, and state law mandates that all marijuana must be grown within the state. 
However, there is one year after a licensee passes a commencement inspection when the state essentially closes its eyes and puts its hands over its ears on how a cultivation facility starts its inventory. 
It’s called the immaculate conception rule, and six facilities were fined up to $500,000 from breaking it last year. 
A spokesperson for the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation said regulators “discovered some licensees believed they were permitted to bring in clones or tissue cultures as well as seeds on an ongoing basis. However, this practice is a violation of seed-to-sale tracking regulations.”
To keep up with customers’ preferences and demand, these companies had been bringing in clones, or starter plants, and tissue cultures, which is a form of in-vitro propagation, of popular plant varieties from other states
“In lieu of penalties or other enforcement action, these violations were resolved for amounts ranging from $50,000 to $500,000, depending on the circumstances,” said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which oversees the cannabis regulation division.
The licensees that saw the biggest fines are major players in other states as well, including the companies behind Good Day Farm and High Profile.
The combined fee for four cultivation licenses representing Good Day Farm and Codes, which share management, was $347,495. The facilities are located in Columbia, Carrollton and Chaffee.
For High Profile, it was $500,000 at its O’Fallon cultivation facility.
Two smaller cultivators also saw fines of $20,000 and $50,000.
None of the licensees who were fined by the state returned The Independent’s request for comment.
 The ‘mother plant’

Cultivation facilities in Missouri are approved to grow marijuana plants, and the harvest is sent to a manufacturing facility that then makes pre-rolls, edibles and other products.
Oftentimes, cultivators will develop “a mother plant” to collect clones, or cuttings, from the plant and put those into their own pots. Those are genetically identical to the plant that they’re cut from.
But where does the mother plant come from?
For a facility’s first year, the “rules and law are silent on how that occurs,” Cox said.
After that, the facilities can ask the state for permission to bring in seeds for “ongoing inventory needs,” she said, or get clones from other licensed cultivators located in Missouri.  
But the state fined several licensees last year for not sticking to those rules, sending a clear message to all Missouri companies that they have to grow plants from seed or get starter plants from their competitors. 
Ryan Schepers, instructor for St. Louis Community College’s cannabis program, said as a “plant nerd,” he doesn’t believe starting from seed is a necessarily difficult thing — or a bad thing for the industry’s innovation.
“I think a lot of the cultivation centers are set up to care for already established plants, and that would be a little bit of a challenge,” he said. 
But it’s nothing the “well versed” plant growers working in the cultivation centers can’t handle, he said. The main challenge is the delay in production, he said. It will take about a month to six weeks for a cannabis plant to start to be well established, he said, but they’ll be “pretty hardy plants.” 
“Clones are obviously much easier to deal with,” he said. 
But tissue cultures involve a small amount of cells to get started, he said, and that process can take about as long as seed sprouting.
He understands that it’s difficult for companies to align the plant growth time with the need to keep up with trends in other states. If a product is selling really well in California, he said, “of course we’re going to try to get that same thing in Missouri.”
However, he said it can disincentivize cultivation centers from trying new things. For the sake of his students, he hopes the emphasis will shift to breeding and innovation. 
“We, at St Louis Community College, really emphasize that our students be plant scientists who focus on cannabis,” he said.
Innovation can be difficult when the federal and state laws are rapidly changing, he added.
The Independent asked if the state would consider a variance for licensees to get clones in the future to keep up with popular varieties. 
“The department was considering guidance from the DEA that indicated clones may no longer be considered marijuana under federal law due to low Delta 9 [THC] concentrations,” Cox said.
However, she said recent changes to federal law “may change the status of seeds and clones.” She was referring to restrictions on hemp that were passed as part of the federal spending package last year and will be effective in November.
“So the department will need to follow how federal guidance,” Cox said, “and interpretation develops over the next year before it makes any changes to rules or processes.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_5788-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 10:38:24.724469

Photo credit: Charlotte Mae EllisonIt’s been 50 years since acclaimed Montana author Norman Maclean published “A River Runs Through It,” a mesmerizing memoir that has become one of the most iconic works associated with Montana.
The novella and film adaptation — starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt — introduced millions to the state’s landscapes through a poignant look back at family, grief and fly fishing.
Soon, another generation of audience will be able to find their own meaning and connection to the work through a new medium — opera.
As the first work commissioned by Opera Montana, “A River Runs Through It” will premiere this fall in Bozeman, following a multi-year effort to adapt the novella to the operatic stage. 
“When we had the opportunity, because of relationships internally, to bring ‘A River Runs Through It’ to the stage, we knew it was time to commission our first full opera,” Susan Miller, General Director of Opera Montana, told the Daily Montanan. “It’s such a meaningful story to Montanans, and has, for better or worse, changed our state in so many ways. But we knew we could tell a story not only relevant to Montanans, but a universal story about family, and how do you help somebody that won’t accept your help or doesn’t let you in.”
Opera Montana began thinking about bringing the story to the stage in 2022, as the opera was just getting back to producing full main stage shows again following the pandemic. 
Matt Foss, stage director and one of the two librettists — the person who writes the text of the opera — for the show, had been in conversations with the Maclean estate for a while about turning the work into a play. Over time the idea morphed into an opera. 
“I had very little ideas of how to make an opera, but a very good idea of where to go to find that out in Opera Montana,” Foss said. 
Foss comes from a theater background, including with Montana’s Shakespeare in the Park, but he initially worked as a biologist with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. It was while working across the state’s landscapes that he fell in love with Maclean’s work. 
“I care about this story, and each time I read this book, something changes, and yet there’s a foundational experience that is so acute and specific that my hope is that we can tell the story in an interesting and impactful that allows for that experience,” he said. “I want it to be excellent in hopes of someone in the audience having an experience like I did in my terrible first basement apartment in Red Lodge when I first read the novel, or sitting up on Line Creek Plateau, making notes in the margins on my breaks.”
Once the rights for the adaptation were secured, Opera Montana’s artistic director, Michael Sakir, said putting the rest of the creative team together was easy. 
Kelly Rourke, a nationally-acclaimed figure in the opera world, was brought into the project as co-librettist and Zach Radler was brought on as the composer. 
Between the three of them, “they were able to distill Norman Maclean’s novel into a great opera,” Sakir said. 
“As you can imagine, it takes just so much longer to sing something than it takes to say something, and so to avoid a nine-hour opera for a relatively thin novella, they had to take some creative license. They have in some ways, not modernized it, but updated it with a contemporary lens,” he said. “The core of the story is still there. The focus on family and faith and fly fishing is still there, but they’ve given more agency, for example, to the female characters.”
Among the challenges of altering the story to a new medium, was the style in which Maclean wrote his novel. “A River Runs Through It” is nonlinear, with Maclean, in his 70s when he wrote the book, narrating the story decades after the fact. 
“One of the great strengths of the book is its narrative voice, but a voice removed by decades, to me, is not what works for opera,” Rourke said. “We decided pretty early on that we wanted to keep the story immediate, which meant that we had to let go of some amazing sentences and ideas and reflections. But, just to say, we do lean into what this art form does really well.”
“Opera’s great strength is visceral emotion. You know, using your body as a resonating chamber at the very extremes and sending that human voice out to hit the audience in the sternum,” Rourke continued. “This story is so emotional and beautiful … and especially as a story of grief, that can feel very present and very potent for exploring in opera.”
 
Opera Montana was established in 1978 to engage and inspire the community through opera, musical theatre and educational engagement. 
 Opera Montana is currently in its 48th season and will be performing the Tony-award winning musical Ragtime from Jan. 23 through Feb. 1.


While opera might seem like a daunting medium for a first time consumer, Miller, the general director, said “A River Runs Through It” is very approachable, which fits with Opera Montana’s mission. 
“There are no rules about going to the opera. You don’t have to dress up but you can dress up if you want to,” Miller said. “We try to make it an incredibly welcoming space. And this particular production will be for all ages.”
Miller and Sakir said their choice in composer for the 90-minute production was also key to making the show accessible to audiences who might not otherwise attend an opera. 
“We recognize that with a story like ‘A River Runs Through It,’ we’re going to be bringing in a lot of new people into the opera world, and the last thing we want to do is alienate them,” Sakir said. 
He described the work of composer Zach Radler as equally “unapologetically romantic and uniquely sincere,”  and “tuneful and catchy.”
“There will be ear worms that the audience leaves the theater humming after seeing the show, which is just something that you never come across these days,” Sakir said. 
Radler told the Daily Montanan the style is a little bit of a crossover between opera and musical theater. Radler says audience members will be able to hear the influences of jazz, bluegrass, and Montana composer David Maslanka, and hopefully pick up the motivic themes of individual characters. 
“There’s a lot of freedom in the opera,” Radler said. “There’s a straight-up country tune in the middle of this, which is just great.”
“A River Runs Through It” features a cast heavily drawn from Broadway stages and the Metropolitan Opera. There are 24 musicians and seven principal singers. 
Sakir said casting the show was “an embarrassment of riches that we got to choose from,” with the directors hearing enough incredible auditions to cast the show “six times over.”
Baritone Schyler Vargas stars as Norman, the recently married eldest brother; tenor Michael Kuhn is Paul, the youngest brother, a newspaperman, gambler, and an artist with a fly rod; soprano Christine Taylor Price is Jessie, Norman’s fierce, funny, loving wife; tenor Ryan Bryce Johnson is Neal, Jessie’s brother; mezzo-soprano Megan Marino is Heidi (“Rawhide”), a local woman who fancies Neal and believes in love; mezzo-soprano Phyllis Pancella is Clara, Norman and Paul’s mother; and bass-baritone David Pittsinger is John, Norman and Paul’s father, a Presbyterian minister.
Due to professional obligations on stages around the east coast, the full cast has only been together briefly for workshops — with the first sing-through with orchestra coming up in March — but there was a concerted effort to bring everyone to Montana to get a full sense of the setting that is so essential to the novel’s story, which included a full-cast guided fly fishing trip. 
In a statement, John Maclean, son of Norman and an author himself, said he understood the challenge of turning a well-known literary classic into an opera. 
“The reward is a fresh perspective from a talented cast and writers who explore themes of love, loss – and fly fishing, of course – to bring the familiar characters to new life,” Maclean said. “My father would have been delighted to see his story on stage and his words, often only a heartbeat away from poetry, turned to song.”
“A River Runs Through It” will premiere at the Ellen Theater in Bozeman in September, and there will be additional performances in Missoula. 
Montana PBS will be filming the production and will air it at a later date as well. 
A special preview performance and workshop will take place in March at National Sawdust Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, featuring Maclean, reading passages from his father’s novella paired with the corresponding musical pieces from the opera.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Brothers-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 09:56:31.872329

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska had fewer overdose deaths in 2024 than in the year prior, and state health officials are working on ways to continue to reduce that total in the future.
In all, 339 people died from drug overdoses in 2024 Alaska, a 5% decline from the record high of 357 hit the year before, according to an annual report released by the state Department of Health.
Alaska’s decline was not as dramatic as the nationwide drop in overdose deaths.
Nationally, the 2024 death total was nearly 27% lower than the total for the previous year, continuing a declining trend that followed several years of sharp increases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Overdose deaths, as measured in total numbers, peaked in the U.S. in 2021, according to the CDC. As measured by rate per 100,000 people, they peaked in 2022.
It is not yet clear whether Alaska’s decline in fatal overdose rates will catch up to the national rates or even if the state’s decline will last, said Jessica Filley, an epidemiology specialist with the department.
“I think it’s too early to say if this trend is going to continue,” said Filley, speaking on Thursday during a break at the annual Alaska Public Health Association Summit in Anchorage.
If the trend does continue, several factors may be responsible, she said. One of those factors could be the wider use of naloxone, an overdose-reversal medicine, she said.
Distribution of the emergency medicine has increased substantially in recent years, said Tim Easterly, coordinator of a Department of Health program that provides naloxone kits to people who might be treating at-risk Alaskans.
When the program started about eight years ago, it distributed about 8,000 kits annually, Easterly said at the health summit. In the past two years, it has distributed more than 40,000 kits annually, he said. “So this program has grown. And, unfortunately, we continue to see demand, steady around that 40,000 kits per year,” he said.
Naloxone kits are provided to schools around the state under a law enacted in 2024, for example.
Filley, in a presentation at the conference, described some state efforts to try to use a more holistic approach to prevent overdose deaths.
The state’s medical examination process includes an overdose committee that gathers information not just from official documents like toxicology reports, but also from family members, healthcare providers, first responders and other people who can fill in the backstories of overdose victims.
Those reviews reveal life stories that can contain complex and interwoven challenges that preceded the overdoses. Some victims had complex mental or physical health problems that did not get addressed. Some had traumatic experiences in childhood. Housing insecurity and homelessness also emerged as a factor in some cases, she said.
Reviewing each case took hours; the committee reviewed two every quarter, or eight in the past year. Using those reviews, the committee compiled some recommendations for more comprehensive prevention and treatment.
One of the committee’s recommendations, Filley said, is for “more integrated peer support” and more coordination of case management across different settings, including healthcare facilities, treatment facilities, parole operations and interactions with first responders.
Another recommendation is for better education about trauma, including from experiences in childhood that may have long-lasting effects, she said. “We definitely have some cases where there’s evidence that the decedent experienced trauma or adversity in childhood,” she said.
The committee also recommended more education about dangers from substances other than opioids, including alcohol. While opioids have received heightened attention in recent years and are implicated in most fatalities, there are many cases where victims are abusing multiple substances simultaneously.
Statistics from the state’s annual report show that only 35% of overdose deaths between 2020 and 2024 involved a single drug. The most common combination in fatal cases over those years was a blend of synthetic narcotics like fentanyl with psychostimulants, the state report said. Examples of psychostimulants are amphetamines and cocaine.
There were twice as many fatal overdoses among men than among women in 2024, similar to ratios in the four preceding years. By region, Anchorage had the highest rate of fatal overdose per 100,000 people over all years from 2020 to 2024, according to the state report. In 2024, Anchorage had about two thirds of the state’s overdose deaths, even though it has about 40% of the state’s residents.

Kristey Williams testified about a bill she co-sponsored to create two fiscal integrity auditor positions to provide better oversight of expenditures. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)  TOPEKA — A proposal adding two positions to increase oversight of state agencies and make sure they’re spending money as the Legislature intended met with concerns about confidentiality and whether problems could be identified in time to make a difference. 
The House Appropriations committee on Thursday heard testimony about House Bill 2427, which proposes adding a fiscal integrity auditor position. The auditor could access state fiscal technology systems and track expenditures at state agencies, said committee vice chairwoman Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, who testified at the hearing. 
Although the bill requests one position, Williams said it will be amended to request two, one for the House and Senate. That would double the fiscal note on the bill, which is just more than $225,000 per year, she said. 
Williams, who is co-sponsoring the bill, said the auditor position would make sure dollars allocated by the legislature are spent appropriately. 
The goal would be for fiscal integrity auditors to identify spending issues that would allow the Legislature to more quickly see when funding wasn’t being used consistent with laws’ intent. The goal would be to give legislators time to take action, such as clawing back funding or retroactively make adjustments, she said. 
“We pass our budgets, but then we don’t really know or have the ability to follow up on those expenditures,” Williams testified. “Once we look at the expenditures, it’s too late to do anything about it if it’s not in alignment with legislative intent.” 
It’s not always possible to get access to expenditure reports and fiscal information as legislators, said Rep. Adam Turk, a Shawnee Republican, in response to questions from other committee members about whether the auditor position is necessary. 
“I hear a lot of these questions coming from the other party and all it tells me is they clearly do not understand what it takes as a chair of these budget sub-committees to get information,” he said. “You say simply ask. Well, I’m telling you, I’ve asked repeatedly, time and time and time and time again, from institutions, from agencies, from everybody, and we don’t get the information.”
Turk said the lack of fiscal information hurts the legislative decision-making process. 
“We don’t get the acute information that we request, we do not get it in a timely manner to make coherent decisions, and we need it,” he said. “ We get the information several years down the road after the money’s already spent.”
Rep. Henry Helgerson, D-Wichita, said lawmakers have ceded their authority to state agencies and need to take it back. 
“That’s the real problem in this. We have gotten out of the habit of going back and holding the agencies accountable and asking specifically, how’d you spend the money last year, what did you spend it on, was that the intent, and are we getting the outcomes this year after the money’s been spent,” he said. “The Legislature has moved in the direction of giving more and more authority to the agencies to shift money around.”
Even though he’d like to see more oversight and accountability, Helgerson said he wasn’t sure if auditor positions were the way to change the situation.
Rep. Jo Ella Hoye, D-Lenexa, raised the issue of ensuring individuals in the auditor position maintain confidentiality because of their access to private data. She referenced news this week from the federal government that two Department of Government Efficiency employees downloaded Social Security numbers and improperly shared them.
Williams said a confidentiality agreement could be written for the position to ensure data privacy, and she noted that’s standard for state employees who have access to fiscal data.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Williams-appropriations-1024x648.jpg,,,2026-01-23 09:36:58.311439

Though California is a relatively safe place for transgender youth, LGBTQ advocates warn that efforts to eliminate policies safeguarding transgender kids — led by right-leaning states and the Trump administration — may change that.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, a handful of California’s policies may be at risk of being reversed or undermined as lawsuits challenging transgender protections play out in court. Two major cases are:
Student athletes: The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing a case based on a pair of lawsuits challenging Idaho and West Virginia’s bans prohibiting transgender women from playing on women’s teams. Legal experts say the high court appears poised to uphold states’ rights, allowing them to keep the ban. 
Because California allows students to play on school-sponsored sports teams that align with their gender identity, a ruling upholding states’ rights would also uphold California’s policy. But it could also embolden the federal government to penalize states for protecting transgender athletes. Last year, President Donald Trump said he would withhold federal funding from schools that allow transgender females to play on girls’ and women’s teams.
Parental notification: In 2024 Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law banning schools statewide from requiring school staff members to inform parents if a child identifies as transgender without the child’s consent. 
After the law went into effect, a pair of teachers from Escondido sued the state, arguing that it “violates their faith and ethics,” according to the law firm that filed the suit on behalf of the teachers.
A federal judge sided with the teachers in December, but the state successfully requested a temporary injunction on the ruling while it prepares an appeal. The plaintiffs have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reject the stay and implement the ruling immediately, but the court has yet to issue a decision.

How helpful is $200 million?

In his latest budget plan, Newsom earmarked $200 million to revive California’s rebate program for electric cars. Based on previous rebate models, that might not go very far, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
Using the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program model that ended in 2023 — which offered rebates of up to $7,500 toward some electric and hybrid cars — Newsom’s proposal would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales, a CalMatters analysis found.
That’s not going to be enough, said Christopher Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air: “Two-hundred million for a mass-market program will go very quickly.”
Chavez also warned that in the time it takes to approve the budget and set up a new program, consumers may not get rebates until 2027.
Shortcomings from previous incentive programs are also renewing questions from experts and lawmakers about who should get the money. State regulators ended the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program over concerns it benefited higher-income buyers, and while California had programs aimed at low-income buyers, advocates say some of these programs weren’t adequately funded.

Tijuana River cleanup efforts inch forward

A bill to speed up the doling out of funds from a multibillion-dollar climate bond cleared a legislative hurdle Thursday, advancing out of the Assembly’s appropriations committee, reports CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan.
The measure by Assemblymember David Alvarez would lift some regulations tied to Proposition 4, a $10 billion bond that voters approved in 2024 for water, wildfire and other climate resistant projects. The Chula Vista Democrat said he wanted to accelerate the release of Prop. 4’s money to address the sewage pollution issue in the Tijuana River, which affects his district. About $30 million from the bond is expected to be used for the river’s cleanup efforts, and Alvarez said his bill could help speed up funding by up to 18 months.
Over the past two decades, California voters have approved billions of dollars in bonds, some of which going toward projects that have been mired in regulatory obstacles that delay timelines and balloon costs. In 2014, for example, voters passed Prop. 1 to allocate $1 billion for a water storage project in the Sacramento Valley. It remains under construction.
The bill is backed by local governments and environmental groups, and has no formal opposition. It is expected to go before the Assembly for a floor vote next week.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Corrections aims to cut its turnover rate by 12 percentage points in the next year, in part by offering recruits a better idea of what they’re in for.
The number of open security staff positions has plummeted in recent years, Corrections Secretary Nick Lamb told the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee on Thursday at the Capitol in Pierre, from a high of 27% in late 2022 to 5% today. 
But security staff turnover has nearly doubled since 2020, from 17% to 33%. Around 70% of the department’s 971 correctional employees work on the security side.
Reducing the turnover is one of what Lamb called the agency’s “wildly important goals” for the coming year. 
When asked by Sen. John Carley, R-Piedmont, why people are leaving, Lamb said age and prior experience are major factors.
“This work is not for everyone,” he said.

Increased starting pay for security staffers, from $17.89 a few years ago to $25.50 an hour today, has helped the agency recruit people to serve, he said, but “we’re having a hard time retaining them.”
About 45% of those who leave officer positions do so within their first six months, he said.
The department plans to work through ways to give recruits a better sense of what the work might be like upfront, Lamb said, possibly through videos on day-to-day operations.
At the moment, officers have a four-week training academy in the classroom, 40 hours of orientation and 40 hours of on-the-job training. 
Some moves in that direction began before Lamb’s arrival in November, Director of Operations Amber Pirraglia told the committee. The agency began to assign field training officers to follow new employees through their first six months of work and “really through their first year.”
“That is something we’ve implemented in the last year that’s been very successful, and hopefully we’ll see a better retention rate with those new officers,” Pirraglia said.
‘Kids’ overseeing inmates
Gov. Larry Rhoden hired Lamb as secretary following the resignation of Kelli Wasko last fall. Lamb came from Iowa but also worked in prisons in New Mexico and Illinois.
He told the committee he more or less stumbled into a career in corrections “because I needed a job.” He was a high school dropout who “made mistakes,” he said, and earned his GED after completing basic training with the Army. He would eventually earn a master’s degree in behavioral medicine.
Back in 1994, his GED and military training were just enough to qualify him for a prison job in southern Illinois, Lamb said. That was a win for him as a young father who’d been making around $4 an hour in a factory that was set to close.

He grew to love corrections, he said, because “you can save a life” by talking to and listening to inmates. 
“I got to realize that inmates are people, too,” Lamb said. “God does not make trash.”
The big difference between Lamb’s experience and that of some current staff members at the penitentiary is that prison jobs didn’t go to teenagers at the time in Illinois. There was too much demand for those positions for older adults.
The story is different for South Dakota’s prisons in 2026, Lamb said.
“I’m here to tell you that I’ve got 18-year-old kids working the galleries at night, with adults,” said Lamb, using a term for the tiered floors of inmates at the penitentiary. “God bless them. They’re going to make mistakes, but that’s what we have now.”
The security work being done by those younger officers is more difficult in some ways, as well, he said. He pointed to K2, a drug typically sprayed on pieces of paper that killed most of the eight men who died of drug overdoses in South Dakota prisons last year.
“We didn’t have the synthetic cannabinoids that we have now that’s so hard to detect,” Lamb said, using the technical term for K2 as he tapped a pad of paper. “It could be on this piece of paper right now, and I wouldn’t know it and you wouldn’t know it.”
Nursing shortage
There are fewer open security staff positions than the department has seen for years, but the story is different for correctional nurses.
The agency took over correctional health from the Department of Health in July 2023. 
Brittni Skipper, the director of finance for corrections, told the committee that 58 of the DOC’s 175 clinical positions are open.
South Dakota outpaces neighbors in fatal prison overdoses

“That’s clearly not covering the open shifts we have for clinical, so to cover those shifts we have to have existing staff work overtime, or we contract for nurses,” Skipper said.
The state budgeted $4.6 million for traveling contract nurses for 2026. That’s up from $4.2 million in 2025 and $3.1 million in 2024. Another $279,000 was budgeted for overtime for clinical staff.
There are incentives in place for nurses, Skipper said, among them a student loan repayment plan and a $10,000 hiring bonus, paid in two $5,000 installments in a new correctional nurse’s first two paychecks. The nurses have to stay for two years to keep the bonuses. 
Nurses also get an extra $7.50 an hour at clinics that are “below minimum staffing levels.”
Last year, Skipper said, the state paid $10,000 bonuses to 29 employees, 15 of which are still employed. The state requests the $10,000 back if the nurse leaves before two years are up, and Skipper said the agency has been repaid in each case.
Rep. Jack Kolbeck, R-Sioux Falls, mentioned South Dakota’s push to train nurses at public universities in recent years and asked Skipper if having more nurses in the state has made a difference.
“Are you getting the applications?” Kolbeck said.
The state hired a recruiting agency to look for nurses, Skipper said, a strategy that worked well with security staff recruitment. The same agency reached out to 400 nurses last year, got replies from 13, and only five of them were interested.
“The reason that they noted for that is because they don’t want to work in a correctional facility when they could be in a hospital or a clinic,” Skipper said.
Pay for nurses is “similar” to what a hospital might offer, Skipper said, but “we just can’t compete with what contract nurses pay.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3214-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 09:36:58.311439

Some California policies are in jeopardy.","In summary
Lawsuits and Trump administration policy changes are targeting trans athletes, bans on outing by school staff and health care. Some California policies are in jeopardy.


California has taken steps the past few years to protect transgender young people on the playing field, in the classroom and in the doctor’s office. But a handful of federal court cases and new policies could threaten those protections.
A case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court could affect transgender students’ right to play on sports teams that align with their gender identity. Another case — possibly headed for the Supreme Court — could overturn California’s law banning school districts from requiring staff to “out” transgender students to their parents. And in December, the federal government said it would crack down on health care for transgender minors.
“We are witnessing a widespread, concerted, strategic attack on trans people existing in public spaces and in particular, trans young people,” said Dale Melchert, senior staff attorney for the Transgender Law Center, a nonprofit law firm based in Oakland. “The religious right is targeting trans people, and we know that these cases and policies are going to have a critical impact on trans young people, who are already such a vulnerable minority.”
The legal moves and policy shifts follow President Donald Trump’s vow to eliminate rights for transgender people, a topic he brought up frequently during his campaign and addressed in his inaugural speech. It was among his first executive orders.
Youth sports and transgender athletes
The case related to youth sports is based on a pair of lawsuits filed by transgender women in Idaho and West Virginia, states that prohibit athletes from playing on teams that don’t align with their gender at birth. California is one of about 23 states that allow transgender girls and women to play on school-sponsored women’s and girls’ teams.
The court heard arguments earlier in January and is likely to announce a ruling in June. Legal experts expect the court to uphold states’ rights to prohibit transgender women from playing on women’s teams, but it may leave the door open for states to set their own policies. 
In that case, “California would be fine,” said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for LGBTQ Rights.
But that doesn’t mean the case wouldn’t affect California in the future. It could strengthen future legal efforts and federal proposals to restrict states’ abilities to protect transgender athletes, Minter said. A year ago, Trump said he would withhold funding from any school that allows transgender females to play on girls’ and women’s teams; a Supreme Court ruling on the issue could make it easier for the federal government to follow through on the threat. 
Parental notification policy in doubt
In a case directly affecting California, a pair of teachers from Escondido, near San Diego, sued the state over its recently enacted law prohibiting schools from requiring staff to notify parents if a child identifies as transgender. The teachers said the law “violates their faith and ethics,” according to the Thomas More Society, the nonprofit law firm that filed suit in U.S. District Court in Southern California on behalf of the teachers.
A federal district court judge agreed, and ruled in favor of the teachers in late December. The state immediately asked for and received a pause on the ruling allowing the law to remain in place while it prepares an appeal, but the plaintiffs asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reject the pause and implement the ruling immediately. The Supreme Court hasn’t yet issued a decision.
“Right now, California’s parental deception scheme is keeping families in the dark and causing irreparable harm. That’s why we’re asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene,” Paul Jonna, an attorney for Thomas More Society, said. “The state is inserting itself unconstitutionally between parents and children, forcing schools to deceive families, and punishing teachers who tell the truth.” 
Attorney General Rob Bonta is hopeful the court will uphold California’s law.
“We are committed to securing school environments that allow transgender students to safely participate as their authentic selves while recognizing the important role that parents play in students’ lives,” said Jordan Blue, spokesman for the Attorney General’s office. “We look forward to continuing to make our case in court.”
California’s law stems from a policy adopted by a half-dozen school districts over the past few years that would have required teachers and other staff to inform parents if a child uses different pronouns, names or other signs that they identify as transgender. The districts said that parents have a right to know if their children are undergoing such a significant change.
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, as well as many lawmakers and advocates, said the policy endangers transgender students because students might not be “out” at home, and their parents might not be supportive. Transgender students are far more likely than their peers to become homeless, often as a result of family rejection, according to the nonprofit advocacy group The Trevor Project. Advocates also said the policy places an undue burden on teachers, who must act as “gender police.”
The issue has propelled at least one school board member to statewide prominence. Sonja Shaw, president of the Chino Valley Unified school board, is running for state superintendent, largely on the issue of parents’ right to know if their child is transgender. Shaw is a Republican.
Access to health care
Meanwhile, in December the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would bar hospitals from performing gender procedures on children. California health officials pushed back, telling hospitals that they must comply with state laws and continue offering gender care to minors, regardless of what the federal government says.
“We will continue to stand with transgender youth, their families and health care providers, and we will continue to fight the federal administration’s cruel and inhumane policies,” they wrote on the state’s Health and Human Services website.
On the mental health front, the state in July said it would train its counselors on the 988 suicide-prevention hotline to address issues specific to LGBTQ youth. The move came after the Trump administration cut funding for such services.
‘It’s heartbreaking’
Just over 3% of young people identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. They’re more likely to drop out of school, suffer from mental health challenges like anxiety and depression, and commit suicide, according to The Trevor Project. High-profile court cases and heated rhetoric only make matters worse, said Jorge Reyes Salinas, spokesperson for Equality California, which advocates for LGBTQ rights.
While California remains relatively safe for transgender youth, at least for now, Salinas expects right-leaning states and the federal government to continue to ramp up their anti-LGBTQ efforts. A proposed ballot initiative in Nevada, for example, would require any school that receives state funds to identify sports as male, female or co-ed. 
“The trans community is being used as a scapegoat. The right is continuing to use trans people as a tool for igniting fear and hate, putting young people at risk in the process,” Salinas said. “It’s heartbreaking. Students feel trapped, like everyone is against you.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/121924-Riverside-Trans-Gender-Athletes-GETTY-AP.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-23 08:37:27.637556

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)President Donald Trump is replaying 2020, in the same city, blocks from the same intersection. This time he is unleashing everything to try to win. That is the only measure of success for the egoist. He sees the same governor as his opponent, the same mayor as a thorn in his paw. That’s why his administration launched a criminal investigation against them, even after six Minnesota federal prosecutors reportedly resigned in protest over the (non) investigation of the killing of Renee Good. This time, he is using every federal lever to escalate the conflict with Minneapolis and Minnesota as an accelerant to his authoritarian takeover. Gov. Tim Walz was right when he said in his address that Trump, “wants more violence on our streets.”
“We cannot give him what he wants,” Walz said. There are reports that 1,500 active duty military are on standby for deployment to Minneapolis.
The future of our democracy — or its grim alternative — is being decided on the streets of Minneapolis and cities and towns across this country. 
The killing of Good has been uniquely radicalizing for tens of millions of people across America. Americans saw themselves in the face of Good, who was killed, according to an autopsy, by a shot to the left temple. “I am not afraid of you.”
I was in Powderhorn Park and on East Lake Street on Jan. 10. Twenty thousand demonstrators peaceably assembled and made their free voices heard — f*ck included. Signs read, “We don’t have enough salt,” “ICE out of our schools,” and “federal agents are domestic terrorists.” Indigenous dancers performed with drums.
“I want Trump to know Somali-Americans are always going to be here,” said Fahad Mo, 26, at the protest. “Immigrants are always going to be here.”
Mo is Somali American and part of the Cedar-Riverside Protection Alliance, working to protect the Somali community in the neighborhood.
The federal shooting in north Minneapolis further escalated things. Tear gas. Pepper balls. Rubber bullets. Trump’s men desperately want to start a riot on their own terms. On Jan. 15, Trump again threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act.
Shawn Jackson was accidentally caught in the middle on Jan. 14 with kids in the car. Flashbangs triggered the air bags. Tear gas caused the baby to stop breathing and Jackson started CPR resuscitation before the kids could make it to the hospital.
The videos of unconstitutional violence are self-evident. Most Americans know that racism and sexism are not patriotism. More and more parent groups and Bible studies across this country are becoming volunteer organizing committees. According to YouGov polling in the days after the killing of Good, only 28% of U.S. adult citizens thought the shooting was justified.
The narrow path forward out of fascism will take coordination and an unbreakable determination to avoid escalation to violence. That only would serve the interest of accelerationists like Trump and Stephen Miller who would see the world burn to rule over the ashes.
There exists a delicate balance between checking Trump and showing resolve, and not giving a pretext for the activation of regular troops under the Insurrection Act. Trump either looks up to you or down at you; there is no equality in negotiation.
A large coalition including Faith in Minnesota, Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, Unidos, and partners are organizing a general strike, rally, and march in Minneapolis on Friday. We are allied against occupation. 
Building a coalition requires working together with folks with whom we may disagree on many things. It’s more important in the current environment that we all agree immigrants are our neighbors, that we all have humanity and dignity, that we are going to stand up for each other, and that we support civil liberties and human rights more broadly.
Courage takes patience to build up a tolerance for danger. The more broad a coalition of allies, the more people who can gain courage, both on the streets and in the halls of power. Many look forward to Democratic leaders like U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer mustering the courage to see reality as many already do, but they are not going to get to where we need to go without added momentum.
You can join demonstrations on Friday and in the days and weeks and months ahead. Find food shelves to drop off supplies to. Volunteers are needed to drive groceries to families in hiding. There are also local groups organizing at-home laundromats. If you are trained and willing to take on much greater risk, neighborhood watch is critical. Being an observer — including recording incidents and blowing whistles — can help deescalate and prevent violence. Evidence of unconstitutional violence will have its day in court.

San Diego’s new paid parking at Balboa Park has sparked widespread backlash as museum visits dropped and residents complained about the additional cost to access one of the cities most iconic spaces


For decades, parking lots at San Diego’s Balboa Park were packed, with lines of drivers snaking through lanes in search of a rare open spot.
Last Saturday there were plenty of open spaces, and on Wednesday several lots were half empty, while people lined up behind kiosks to pay newly imposed parking fees.
This month San Diego city imposed the first parking fees for the century-old cultural site, provoking confusion and contempt. Museums reported that visitation dropped 20% immediately, vandals defaced the meters and San Diego County mayors urged the city to reverse the unpopular policy.
“The negative impacts paid parking on Balboa Park have been immediate and they have been measurable,” Jessica Hanson York, executive director of the Mingei Museum and president of the Balboa Park Cultural Partnership, which represents the park’s museums, said at a press conference Wednesday. “Our visitors are feeling it and our cultural institutions and our museums are feeling it across the park.”
San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria has said the parking fees will provide stable revenue for the park and its museums, and help close a city budget gap of roughly $300 million this fiscal year and $110 million next year. 
“Mayor Gloria, with the support of the city council, made the difficult decision to put the program in motion last year to create a dedicated source of funding so that Balboa Park, the city’s crown jewel, remains a special space for future generations,” Dave Rolland, a spokesman for Gloria, said in a statement to CalMatters. “We understand this is a major change, but it is a necessary one.”
Instant backlash
The parking program got off to a rocky start. The city’s current estimates for parking revenue this year are now about a quarter of its original goal. Meanwhile museum directors warn that lost admission fees could far outweigh the gains, as the new fees hinder access to the park.
“I think we’ve always looked at parks of our city and region as a little more sacred than a way to balance the budget,” said Jim Kidrick, president and CEO of San Diego Air & Space Museum. 
Even free days took a hit. On Tuesdays the park offers free admission to select museums for San Diego County residents. This month, participation dropped 25 percent compared to January last year, making it the lowest “Free Tuesday” attendance in a decade, said Judy Gradwohl, president and CEO of the San Diego Natural History Museum.
Park staff and volunteers are exempt from fees, but they have to park in distant lots.  Museum officials said that’s a safety issue for staff who work nights and a burden to volunteers.
“My volunteers are almost exclusively senior citizens, and they bring trains and tools and everything that they use daily to operate the layouts,” said Michael Warburton, executive director of the Model Railroad Museum. “It’s a challenge for them to bring all these things, and then find a place to park.”

The San Diego City Council is feeling the pressure. Two council members who voted for the program now call for suspending resident parking fees. Councilmember Stephen Whitburn, whose district includes the park, voted against parking fees, arguing they would discourage families, students and seniors from visiting. He’s redoubling his opposition now.
“People are missing out on the enjoyment and cultural enrichment of the park, and the museums are losing revenue that pays for their exhibits and staff,” Whitburn said in a statement to CalMatters. “I would like to see the city council come to a consensus on repealing the fees and restoring free parking in Balboa Park.”
Lawrence Frank, a professor of urban studies and planning at UC San Diego who studies transportation policy, thinks the change is inevitable. Frank, who studies negative health effects of car culture, said the new parking fee system could deter driving and encourage public transit and walkability around the park.
“It’s reasonable,” he said. “It’s comparable to what’s done elsewhere. It’s not unique. What’s unique is to provide it for free.”
San Diego is not alone in revisiting policies for free park access. Last summer the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to impose parking fees at Golden Gate Park to raise money for its Recreation and Parks Department. Meanwhile, the Trump administration eliminated free admission to national parks on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth, while adding President Donald Trump’s birthday to its calendar of fee-free days.
The crown jewel of San Diego
San Diego set aside 1,400 acres for Balboa Park in 1868, to create an urban space similar to New York’s Central Park, dedicated a decade earlier. In 1915, Balboa Park hosted the Panama-California Exposition, and its iconic Colonial Revival architecture took shape with sprawling plazas, Spanish arches, carved facades and Moorish tiles. 
The park now hosts 17 art, science and history museums along with the San Diego Zoo. They range from the San Diego Natural History Museum with mastodon and megalodon skeletons and the San Diego Air & Space Museum featuring an Apollo command module and historic aircrafts, to the San Diego Museum of Art and the free Timken Museum of Art, showcasing European old masters. 
Smaller venues such as the San Diego Model Railroad Museum and international cottages cater to specific hobbies or cultures, while performing arts groups, a bridge club and lawn bowling offer recreational activities.
It’s also a meeting place for thousands of San Diegans who walk, picnic or sightsee every day.
“I see people walking their dogs, pushing their babies and meeting up with friends for coffee,” Hanson York said.

The traditionally free parking has been a draw, Joyce Miller, a San Diego resident and volunteer with San Diego Police Department, said at the park Saturday.
“When we patrol here, everyone who talked to us said it’s the best place to go because the parking’s free,” Miller said. “It’s such a plus for us in San Diego and such a good tourist attraction.”
The park’s maintenance and operations are paid through the city of San Diego’s general fund, but Gloria wanted to create a direct funding stream. He originally proposed a plan that he estimated would bring in $11 million for the current fiscal year. The city council revised that upward to $15 million, then scaled back the timeline and fee structure, leading to a revenue estimate of $2.9 million this fiscal year.
‘People are really mad‘
Museum directors chafe at news that parking revenue won’t be added to the park’s budget – at least this year – but will backfill general fund expenditures, so the city can use that money for other purposes.
Parking meters cost $2.50 per hour and day rates range from $5 to $16. It’s less than commercial lots, which can cost upwards of $30 per day in San Diego. But for people who visit Balboa Park weekly or even daily, it’s excessive, critics complain. It adds insult to injury for people reeling from inflation, and for San Diego city residents it’s piled onto new trash fees, water rate hikes added to the  already high cost of living.
San Diego has regularly ranked among the most expensive housing markets in the country, and a recent analysis found that only 1.6% of San Diego homes are affordable for the typical household. Gas prices in California are about 50% higher than the rest of the country and San Diego prices as of Thursday were 20 cents higher still, at an average of $4.40 per gallon, according to AAA.
In San Diego city, voters narrowly approved a measure to charge homeowners for trash pickup, which was historically paid by the city. But the eventual cost – $43.60 – was at least 50% higher than earlier estimates of $23 to $29 per home. Meanwhile city residents can expect water rates to rise 14.7% next year and 14.5% in 2027. 
In another source of contention, the council approved a tiered fee structure, with lower rates for San Diego city residents and full fees for everyone else, including people in other parts of San Diego County. 
A group of mayors from other cities protested that Balboa Park is a regional resource. 
“I’ve been to Balboa Park my entire life, and it’s a regional asset,” San Marcos Mayor Rebecca Jones said. “Parks should be free. The people that utilize parks the most are the people that really need them, people who live in multi-family housing.”

Visitors arriving at Balboa Park on Saturday fumed about the new fees.
“I despise it,” said Caden Mays, a kinesiology student at San Diego State University. “So many of the exhibits are free, it’s a shame to make parking cost.”
The chaotic roll-out of the parking fees only added to public animosity. Kidrick, of the Air & Space Museum, described the program as ill-conceived and “autocratic.”
“Somebody must have done an internship for six months with ACE parking,” he said.
San Diego city residents had trouble signing up for the local discount, and many visitors struggled with glitchy parking kiosks that gave confusing instructions, rejected credit cards or bounced users back to the start page as they tried to pay.
In retaliation, vandals defaced at least 10 pay stations by spraying foam sealant into card and coin slots, said Officer Terrell Totten, a spokesperson for San Diego Police Department. Those cost $400 each to repair.
In other incidents people smashed the pay station screens, spread green paint on them and smeared feces on one, he said.
“There has been a lot of controversy over paid parking at Balboa Park as of late, but that does not give individuals the right to destroy the meters,” he said in an email to CalMatters.
What’s next?
Frank said the city could get public buy-in on the fees, but only if it invests the money in park programs and access, such as public transit to the site.
“It seems highly reasonable to me that parking be charged, but there should be some accountability for the use of the money to make sure that it benefits the park and the public,” he said.

He acknowledges he’s in a minority. Neighbors have walked away from him when they hear that he agrees with charging for parking at Balboa Park.
“These people are really mad about it,” he said. “Really, really mad.”
To soften the blow for regular users, San Diego has offered yearly passes at $150 for city residents and $300 for other park visitors. 
As of Monday, the city issued 2,405 passes, including 2,236 to city residents, said Rolland, the mayor’s spokesperson. Gloria also said he would review results of the parking fee program, and adjust as needed.
Peter Comiskey, Executive Director of the cultural partnership, urged Gloria to revise the parking program immediately, pointing to museum directors’ warnings that lackluster parking revenue and declining visitation create a downward spiral. 
“That downward spiral could quickly become a death spiral, all over a few dollars in parking revenue,” Comiskey said. “As a region, as stewards of this historic cultural district, this cannot be allowed to happen.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012126_Balboa-Parking_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-23 08:37:27.637556

Assemblymember David Alvarez is pushing a proposal to get Prop. 4 dollars out the door faster more than a year after voters approved the state’s biggest climate bond to date.


A Democratic lawmaker is pushing a proposal to speed up $10 billion in funding for climate programs more than a year after voters approved Proposition 4, the state’s biggest investment yet to combat climate change.
Assemblymember David Alvarez of Chula Vista introduced Assembly Bill 35 to cut certain regulations tied to Prop. 4 to more quickly disburse the billions of dollars voters approved for water improvements, wildfire and drought preparedness plans.
The bill, which advanced from the Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday, would  exempt Prop. 4 funding from review under the Administrative Procedure Act, which dictates how state agencies follow rules and regulations and can cause lengthy delays in implementing programs.
California voters have approved a slew of multibillion-dollar bonds over the past two decades, some of which have faced longs delays from regulatory obstacles that balloon costs. Voters in 2014 approved Proposition 1, allocating $1 billion for a water storage project in the Sacramento Valley that remains under construction. Yet a proposal to speed up building high-speed rail by streamlining permitting failed in the Legislature last year despite voter approval of the $10 billion bond to construct it nearly two decades ago.
For the environment bond, the largest portion of the money, $3.8 billion, has been approved to go toward updating drinking water systems and drought resistance. 
Alvarez has said his bill is a priority for addressing sewage pollution in the Tijuana River, which affects his district along the U.S.-Mexico border, and could provide as much as $30 million for cleanup projects near the river. The legislation could also help speed funding of other climate projects by 12 to 18 months.
“The exemption is not new or unprecedented,” Alvarez said. “The urgency is especially real in my district where communities have endured years of sewage pollution.”
The bill is supported by local governments and environmental groups such as the Wilderness Society and National Audubon Society. There is no formal opposition.

Opponents of the climate bond at the time criticized the amount of debt taxpayers would take on. They also cited likely project delays and a lack of accountability about where the money would go. It is expected to cost taxpayers $16 billion over 40 years to pay off, according to a legislative analysis.
Last year, lawmakers allocated $250 million from the $10 billion bond toward unrelated projects in their districts as the state faced a budget deficit and slashed social services and state positions. Some of those earmarks included $50 million for a redwood trail in former Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire’s Santa Rosa district and $1 million for an interactive water exhibit at a Santa Barbara museum in the district of Democratic Sen. Monique Limón, who represents the area and currently leads the state Senate.
Voters approved Prop. 4 with the expectation it would quickly address climate-related issues and this bill would help accomplish that, Alvarez said at a committee hearing last week.
The Wildlife Conservation Board, one of the state agencies expected to receive funding from Prop. 4, had a quarter of its $339 million allocation go toward additional earmarks for special projects in lawmakers’ districts, like $16 million to prevent urban development on San Julian Ranch in the district of Santa Barbara Assemblymember Gregg Hart, a Democrat.
AB 35 would not affect the earmarks lawmakers approved from the bond.
Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican who led the opposition to Prop. 4 in 2024 and criticized its subsequent earmarks, is among 30 co-authors of the bill from both parties.
“It’s my job to make sure San Diego participates in any of this type of funding,” Jones said. “AB 35, in my opinion, is good government. Because its purpose is to eliminate delays and waste in getting these processes removed.”

Will students benefit?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/school-management-overhaul-newsom-budget/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom dropped a brief and vaguely worded section into his State of the State address earlier this month, suggesting an overhaul of how California’s vast public education system is managed. “It’s long overdue that we modernize the management of our educational system,” Newsom said, “and so in the budget I’ll be submitting tomorrow, […]","Gov. Gavin Newsom dropped a brief and vaguely worded section into his State of the State address earlier this month, suggesting an overhaul of how California’s vast public education system is managed.
“It’s long overdue that we modernize the management of our educational system,” Newsom said, “and so in the budget I’ll be submitting tomorrow, I’m proposing that we unify the policymaking by the State Board of Education and the Department of Education, allowing the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to align our education policies from early childhood through college.”
The budget’s passage on this was longer, but still failed to explicitly say what Newsom had in mind.
The proposal cited two reports that bemoaned the multiple, often overlapping and sometimes competitive, state and local entities that govern the schools. One was California’s so-called Master Plan for Education, published in 2002, and the other was from Policy Analysis for California Education, or PACE, a multi-university think tank, that had been issued just weeks earlier.
The budget proposed to “move oversight authority of the management of” the state Department of Education and local districts under the California Board of Education.
Thus, without saying so directly, Newsom would strip the elected state superintendent of schools of managerial authority over the state Department of Education, relegating the officeholder to an ombudsman or advisor. Management would be vested in the Board of Education, which is appointed by the governor, and an appointed executive director.
“These changes will strengthen governance of California’s education system to provide coherence and meaningful accountability to address the needs of students, parents, teachers, school staff, and administrators,” the budget proposal declared.
The current superintendent, former state legislator Tony Thurmond, complained that he was not consulted about what would be a major overhaul of responsibility for a system that serves nearly 6 million students and is the largest single portion of the state budget. 
“This governance proposal doesn’t establish any structures proven to move the needle on student outcomes,” Thurmond, who is running for governor, said, “and instead shifts authority to implement TK-12 education programs away from the official who California voters have elected to lead our state’s public schools.”
It’s apparent that Newsom’s administration had been laying the groundwork for the power shift — or power grab — long before the State of the State address. The PACE report issued in December was part of the process. It called for exactly what Newsom proposes.
“California’s education governance system is a complex network of agencies and entities designed to serve the most diverse and expansive TK–12 population in the United States,” the PACE report declared. “This system incorporates state, regional, and local levels of authority, each tasked with specific responsibilities and oversight. At its core, the structure seeks to balance statewide education goals with local control and accountability. 
“However, its complexity often results in overlapping responsibilities, fragmented authority, and challenges in ensuring streamlined decision-making.”
PACE issued a statement backing the change from Michael Kirst, the state’s foremost academic authority on education and architect of the school finance overhaul, the Local Control Funding Formula enacted in 2012 under then-Gov. Jerry Brown.
Kirst called it “a new vision and a dramatic overhaul” that would address a 19th century governance structure.
“The lack of fundamental change since then has hindered education progress,” he said.
Politics aside, Newsom’s proposal would streamline governance that is now opaque and fragmented, and shields the system’s many points of authority from accountability. However, by vesting almost total authority in the governor and his or her appointees, it will be more difficult for a governor to escape accountability if educational achievement, which now languishes, doesn’t markedly improve.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/092324_Oakland-Schools-AC_LA_CM_30.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-23 08:37:27.637556
,California,2026-01-23 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom wants $200M for EV rebates. Experts say it’s not enough to fix California’s slump,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2026/01/california-ev-rebates-trump/,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $200 million proposal to revive the state’s EV market would reach only a fraction of buyers, raising fresh questions about who should benefit and whether limited incentives can meaningfully move a slowing market.","In summary
California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $200 million proposal to revive the state’s EV market would reach only a fraction of buyers, raising fresh questions about who should benefit and whether limited incentives can meaningfully move a slowing market.


California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $200 million plan to revive the state’s stalling electric-car market faces several fundamental problems: It isn’t enough money, it may not reach consumers quickly enough and the state hasn’t decided whether to subsidize – or exclude – wealthier buyers.
The Newsom administration’s budget proposal — rolled out after President Donald Trump dismantled federal electric vehicle incentives and blocked California’s clean-vehicle mandate — would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales. That CalMatters estimate assumes the state follows the model of the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which offered rebates of up to $7,500 toward some electric and hybrid cars before the California Air Resources Board ended it in 2023.
So far the administration has released few details about the proposal, leaving experts and lawmakers circling a basic question: Who should get the money?
“It is better than nothing, which is what a lot of things are getting right now,” said Mars Wu, a senior program manager with the Greenlining Institute, which advocates for investments in communities of color. “How far that $200 million goes really depends on how the program is going to be structured.”
A small incentive in a huge market
California’s electric car market is one the governor celebrates on the world stage. While at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland earlier this week, Newsom highlighted that California has surpassed 2.5 million clean car sales, saying the achievement came after the state “invested in this future when others said it was impossible.” He framed the number against a modest goal to get 1.5 million clean cars on the road, set more than a decade ago.
California officials remain confident the state’s policies will succeed in pushing the transition to electric cars. Even as sales have slipped, EVs will drive future electricity demand, according to a long-term forecast approved Wednesday by the California Energy Commission.
But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers. A CalMatters analysis found the incentive would cover only one out of every five EV sales, assuming similar sales to last year, and the same average rebate level as the state’s last mass-market rebate program.
Advocates are also raising concerns about how quickly the money can get to consumers. Christopher Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air, a California-focused advocacy group, warned that the proposed rebates may not reach consumers until 2027, given how long it takes to approve the budget and to set up a new program. If the funding only lasts a year, the program would leave out buyers who need time to plan or save, he added.
“It’s not going to be enough — just to be blunt about it,” Chavez said. “Two-hundred million for a mass-market program will go very quickly.”
The proposal comes as the latest sales numbers show an electric car market slump. Nationally, the loss of the uncapped, popular federal tax credit has accelerated manufacturer write-downs and sales declines as automakers adjusted to a tougher EV market.
In California, the slowdown has pushed the state further off course from its climate goals: even before Congress and President Trump blocked its vehicle mandate last year, California was struggling to hit a requirement that 35% of new cars sold in 2026 be zero-emission. Last year electric and other zero emission cars made up about 23% of new car sales in 2025, down from roughly 25% the year prior, California Energy Commission data shows. 
Sales slowed down dramatically at the end of the year, when EVs and other clean cars accounted for just under 19% of new car sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 — the lowest quarterly share since mid-2022.   
The Newsom administration will likely lay out the details of its proposal in a draft bill tied to the state budget. The Clean Vehicle Rebate Program would be “the foundation we’d be building from,” wrote Lindsey Buckley, an air board spokesperson, in an email, adding that the goal would be to deploy the $200 million “as soon as possible to support the market.”
Buckley said it is “speculative”  to predict the impact of a new EV incentive or how quickly the money would reach consumers.

With limited funding, advocates say the question of who qualifies for the rebates becomes critical.
“What we really don’t want to see is that money going towards higher-income folks for whom it would just be kind of like a bonus coupon,” said Wu, of the Greenlining Institute.
Fast or targeted: lawmakers face a choice
How the Newsom administration and lawmakers design the state’s next EV incentive will determine how quickly the air board can deliver rebates — and whether the program avoids recreating past inequities. California ended its last, broad EV rebate program in 2023 over concerns it benefited higher-income buyers. Targeting lower-income drivers delivers the greatest benefits because they tend to drive the most, and switching to EVs saves them money on fuel and maintenance, said Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley.
But income-based “means testing” can slow programs down, requiring income verification and layers of bureaucracy that eat up funding and discourage participation. 
That’s a critique of one California program aimed at low-income buyers, Clean Cars 4 All, which offers grants to help drivers trade in older, more polluting vehicles for cleaner alternatives. As the state moved from budget surplus to deficit, the Newsom administration and lawmakers never adequately funded it, advocates say.
Lawmakers provided no new funding in the 2024–25 budget year, and in the current budget cycle, the state provided only about $45 million through a combination of funds and one-time budget actions, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That falls well short of a sustained, long-term commitment, said Chavez, of the Coalition for Clean Air.
“It’s become — especially as the budget has become more difficult — more of a secondary priority, which is unfortunate,” he said.
Competing ideas, no clear consensus
California’s EV problem has no shortage of potential solutions — only disagreement over which one to choose.
Some policy analysts argue the state should focus on first-time adoption. A recent brief from Atlas Public Policy found that incentives are most cost-effective when they bring a household’s first electric vehicle into the garage — because once a family owns one EV, it is far more likely to buy another.
Elkind, of UC Berkeley, said a simpler approach — a point-of-sale rebate tied to lower-priced vehicles — would be easier for the air board to administer while avoiding subsidies for high-income buyers.
“If it’s just tied to the price of the vehicle, that’s pretty straightforward,” Elkind said.
Some lawmakers told CalMatters the air board should tightly target the rebates to communities most affected by pollution and transportation costs. State Senator Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, said incentives should focus on communities that suffer the most from air pollution, “so as to increase the bang for air quality buck.” 
Senator Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, said new incentives should go to the people “who are most burdened by transportation costs and drive the most.”
Fewer easy EV buyers in California
California needs to design its next rebate program well because its most eager EV buyers are gone and the state now faces a harder, more price-sensitive market, experts said.
“California is one of the first states to sort of get into that mainstream market: and it’s a harder market to convert,” said Loren McDonald, a Danville-based EV analyst. Potential buyers now expect seamless charging and balk at waiting 30 to 40 minutes. They also are not keen to install home chargers or pay more upfront. Many, he says, stick with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.
“We burned through the innovators and the early adopters — those people who want to save the planet, those people who make good money,” McDonald said.

Jan. 22, 2026. | ScreenshotPresenting the results of their May 2025 audit of the Branch Office Division of the Michigan Department of State, the state Auditor General’s office on Thursday explained four primary findings and areas for improvement in the division to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on General Government.
One significant finding, explained Kaitlyn Snyder, a senior audit supervisor in the Office of the Auditor General, was that the Branch Operations Division “did not always maintain documentation to support it complied with the applicable REAL ID and enhanced driver’s license and identification card security requirements.”
REAL ID refers to a driver’s license or state identification card that has been verified with proof of U.S. citizenship and proof of legal residence in the U.S. They are distinguishable by the gold star in the upper right-hand corner.
Based on a random sample of 60 branch office transactions from across the state, 12 of which were related to REAL IDs, the auditor general’s office noted that the division did not maintain documentation to support six of the 12 transactions — six were missing a copy of the applicant’s proof of Social Security number, while five were missing a copy of the applicant’s proof of residency.

Christina Anderson, chief of staff for the Secretary of State, explained the Department of State processes that allowed this to happen, adding that in December 2024, TSA audited the department and found that the practices were in line with federal regulations. 
“When we are processing a REAL ID transaction, we scan all documentation, we check it against federal databases, including a social security number, and we retain images of all documentation except for the Social Security number,” she said. “The reason for that is a database that has a scanned copy of the social security numbers of 10 million Michiganders is an extremely high cybersecurity and security risk.”
In response to questions from Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), Snyder added that the audit results did not necessarily mean that the proof of residency and Social Security number were not provided during the transaction, just that the records were not available after the fact for auditors to examine.
Another finding was related to customer service concerns, especially surrounding wait times and responsiveness. Based on a sample of 13 branch offices out of the 131 total, Snyder explained, wait times were not consistently tracked — in some branches, it was based on when a person entered the office, while in others, it was based on a person went to the service counter. 
Anderson explained that those discrepancies are based on variance in staffing levels across branches — 80 of the 131 branches do not have greeters, she said.
“If you visited one of our Secretary of State branches recently that’s a more busy one, you’ll notice that there’s a greeter right when you walk into the door, who will greet you, who will check you in for your appointment,” Anderson said. “For the branches that do not have a greeter station, the fact is, we don’t have the staff there to have someone that’s meeting someone at the door, and so that is the result. That’s why we had these different methods of what the start time is.”
Anderson also highlighted that customer feedback, now largely sourced through a survey sent after an office visit by survey company Qualtrics, was very positive — though the auditor’s report only identified 44% of comments as positive. 
Maddock also cast doubts on the validity of the comments, especially those coming from Google, however, saying, “I think your positive reviews are a scam.”
Anderson pushed back on that, noting that the office does not generally rely on Google Reviews, referring again to the Qualtrics system. 
“The 36,498 folks who have responded have given us a 4.6 overall satisfaction rating. 92% have said that they were satisfied, or very satisfied,” she said. “We’ve gotten a 4.272 click friendliness rating, and 94% of respondents said we were able to solve their problems on the first visit.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-11.35.34-AM-scaled-e1769105255132-1024x570.png,,,2026-01-23 08:37:27.637556

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)A long-shot bill looking to discourage immigration authorities from pursuing immigrants in “sensitive areas” like churches and certain health care facilities, and prohibiting them from wearing masks during their operations, hit an unsurprising dead end Thursday.
Sponsored by Democratic Sen. Nate Blouin, SB136 was held in the Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Criminal Justice Committee in a 6-3 vote after debate in front of a packed room of people on both sides of the issue. A two-thirds vote is required to revive the “ICE Out” bill, which it is unlikely to get from the Republican-majority committee.

Blouin, who is among the wide pack of Democrats running for Utah’s new, blue Congressional District 1, harkened to the state’s history welcoming people seeking a better life and preserving sovereignty from federal control as he addressed the committee. 
He said he hoped putting some guardrails on immigrant apprehension efforts would help Utah avoid the chaos and violence playing out in Minnesota.
“This bill creates guidelines for state employees and facilities and requests that federal agents operating in our communities follow them to avoid creating confrontations like the one that recently happened in Minneapolis that ended with the murder of Renee Good,” Blouin said.
The bill would have prohibited state and local law enforcement from assisting federal authorities with immigration enforcement operations in “sensitive areas” including houses of worship, libraries, courthouses, or a government facility providing physical or mental health care, shelter, or legal services (but not including detention facilities). 
It also would have barred immigration agents from wearing masks during operations.

Blouin faced pushback from Republicans on the committee. Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, called masks essential to keeping federal authorities safe and preventing doxxing — drawing skeptical laughter from some in the audience and a stern reminder from the committee’s chair, Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, that interruptions would not be tolerated.  
Supporters who spoke in favor of the bill said requiring immigration authorities to uncover their faces would encourage them to have calmer interactions with the public and use less aggressive tactics.
They also called for health care facilities and houses of worship to be safe spaces for all in Utah.
“As a deeply religious person and a member of the dominant religion here, I want everybody to be able to worship in our temples without fear,” said Magdeleine Bradford. “I want all of my friends who attend different language wards … those who go to Spanish-speaking wards or Portuguese-speaking wards should be able to worship without fear of deportation.”  



Let us know what you think...


 


Sheriffs in the crowd voiced their opposition to the masking restrictions in the bill, and told the committee they want to be able to cooperate with federal authorities.
“We find that the better relationships we have, the more input we have in the way they act within our communities, and that’s beneficial,” said Kane County Sheriff Tracy Glover, who is also president of the Utah Sheriff’s Association.
Blouin closed by saying he believes the measure would prevent state resources from contributing to enforcement efforts that are “creating fear, that are raising constitutional concerns, that are undermining community trust.”
“I’ve been in many different locations lately where folks have raised this concern of federal law enforcement running roughshod in our communities in all sorts of circumstances,” Blouin said. “So this protects sensitive and public spaces. It ties cooperation to due process and valid judicial authority. It doesn’t stop federal law enforcement, but it does limit our state’s role in it, which I think is something that we have generally tried to say that we agree with here in Utah.”

(Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)Durham Public Schools is conducting an ongoing investigation into the actions of a school principal and two administrators indicted on felony obstruction of justice charges for their roles in a case involving a six-year-old autistic girl who was allegedly tied to a chair by a teaching assistant at an elementary school, Superintendent Anthony Lewis said Thursday. 
Two of the three were also indicted for possible perjury in connection with the incident, which occurred at Eno Valley Elementary School in Nov. 2024.
Law enforcement officials believe the principal and administrators “obstructed the investigation and prosecution” by not responding to records requests in a complete and timely manner. School officials might have also broken the law requiring immediate reporting of suspected child abuse to authorities, law enforcement officials said in court documents.  
“As a first step, we are investigating this matter thoroughly because when we’re talking about the safety, the well-being of our scholars, there’s only one path forward, and that is, we must act with urgency, and we must cooperate fully,” Lewis said. “If we fail to do that, we must indeed hold people accountable.”
None of the three accused educators immediately responded to interview requests.
Durham Public Schools Board of Education chair Bettina Umstead and vice-chair Millicent Rogers called the allegations in the indictments “alarming” in a statement released late Thursday.
“We are committed to understanding what occurred and holding individuals accountable where appropriate,” they said..
A grand jury found there is enough evidence to bring criminal charges against Eno Valley Elementary Principal Tounya Wright, Durham Public Schools senior executive director of employee relations Ayesha Hunter, and Tanya Giovanni, deputy superintendent of administration.
All three have been suspended with pay pending the outcome of the district’s investigation, Lewis said. 
The superintendent made his remarks during a Thursday morning press conference at which he read from a prepared statement. He didn’t take questions, citing “confidential personnel matters” and an “ongoing investigation.”
The district’s investigation is being conducted by Tharrington Smith LLP, a Raleigh-based law firm that represents the district. The investigation is separate from any being conducted by law enforcement officials, Lewis said. There is no deadline for completion of the investigation, he said.
In response to the indictment and investigation, the district is taking steps to establish systems to standardize how it logs and stores legal documents, how it manages and creates investigative files and how it notifies its legal counsel of requests for records, Lewis said.
He also spoke about establishing “regular communications” with the Durham County District Attorney’s office to strengthen its partnership and relationship and to ensure the district is “fully cooperating with investigative efforts.” The district has a meeting scheduled with an assistant district attorney next week.
Annual training around child abuse will be enhanced and a “little more robust” than in past years, Lewis said.
“This is beginning with immediate retraining for our principles and administrators,” Lewis said. “We’re also providing retraining to our exceptional children’s staff, administrators and others to reinforce expectations when it comes to physical contact and restraint.”
Durham Police named two former Eno Valley Elementary School teaching assistants in a December 2025 search warrant that allowed Durham Police to search the school district’s central office and digital records. Charges were filed against only one of them in connection with the alleged abuse of the six-year-old autistic girl, but those charges were dismissed by the Durham District Attorney’s office in November.
Meanwhile, Wright, the school principal, was indicted on three potential charges of felony obstruction of justice and one potential charge of perjury. Hunter potentially faces six charges of felony obstruction of justice and two charges of perjury. Giovanni was indicted on five counts of felony obstruction of justice. 
Court records show Giovanni had a court appearance Wednesday and bond was set at $10,000. Hunter and Wright were arrested this week and court records show each posted bonds of $5,000.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Durham-Central-Offic2.jpg,,,2026-01-23 08:37:27.637556

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday passed a bill that would require app stores to have age verifications for minors.
HB 161, sponsored by Chris Sells, R-Greenville, requires app store providers to take action regarding age verification, parental notification and data protection.  It passed the chamber on a 103-0 vote.
“HB 161 is about protecting children online and putting parents back in control. App Store is a gateway to what our children are exposed to online,” Sells said on the House floor “This bill basically does two things, puts parental permission before apps can be downloaded to a child’s phone, and it requires that the apps age rating be accurate when related to the apps.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under the bill, app store providers must request users for their age and verify it using commercially available methods or by using an age verification system that complies with the bill, either someone who is believed to be the parent or guardian confirming the age or using information collected during the account’s creation and usage. The same measures are in place for pre-installed apps.
If an app store provider determines that a user is a minor, it must require the account to become affiliated with a parent account; get parental consent before the minor can download, purchase or make in-app purchases and allow the parent or guardian to withdraw consent at any time.
According to the bill, data collection and processing will be limited to verify ages, obtaining parental consent or maintaining compliance records. Transmitting the data will use “industry-standard encryption protocols” to ensure confidentiality.
App store providers and app developers cannot use terms of service against a minor unless parental consent has been given, mislead parents in the parental consent disclosure or share data between the provider and the app developer except for as required by law.
If passed, the bill would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2027.
Sells filed a similar bill last year during the 2025 legislative session that sparked debate. Opponents of the bill said imposing the bill is unconstitutional and the state should instead invest in media literacy courses for minors.
Utah passed a similar bill to Sells’ last year and a federal judge blocked an age verification law in December for violating the First Amendment. According to Bloomberg Law, these types of bills have concerned app stores because of uncertainty on how the laws will be enforced.
Representatives on both sides of the aisle voiced their support for the bill.
“I support this bill. I’m familiar with the process of not only the creation of apps, the full stack development and interaction with the app store, and I think this is a great bill and a step in the right direction,” Rep. Ernie Yarbourgh, R-Trinity said to Sells.
Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, also voiced her support for the bill.
“I think we need more controls, certainly with these apps, with the companies, regardless of the new social media platforms,” she said.  
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said that while she supports the bill, she wanted to ensure that there are consequences for app sponsors and developers after children have downloaded the apps.
“The complaints that I’ve seen is that after all of that, these children are working on these apps and things appear all of a sudden that shouldn’t, that the app sponsor is held accountable and the app developer [too],” Moore said.
The House tacked several amendments on to the legislation. Rep. Prince Chestnut, D-Selma, proposed an amendment adding provisions to in-app purchases and authorizes the attorney general to “bring an action for a violation as a deceptive trade practice.” 
“For instance, if there was a violation of this particular law, that there were businesses that were concerned that if you do that, then lawyers would be able to come in and file, individual actions in courts and in which would potentially, arguably, could drive up the cost of doing business,” Chestnut said on the House floor. “And so to try to consolidate all that power into the Attorney General’s office because that is part of what [Attorney General] does, is look out for consumer interests and consumer protection.”
Chestnut called the in-app purchase measure a “Chick-fil-A amendment.” 
“They don’t want to have a situation where every time you know a young person tries to go and purchase a sandwich that their parents have to agree to that each time,” he said.

(Photo by Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for People's Action Institute)An expensive therapy praised as the gold standard for helping autistic children gain the skills they need to become self-sufficient is being limited by insurance companies as autism diagnoses in America have more than doubled in the last decade. 
In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control estimated the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder for 8 year-olds at 1 in 31, up from 1 in 69 a decade earlier. 
The costs associated with applied behavioral analysis (ABA), a widely-used, but expensive therapy that experts say improves outcomes for children with autism, is generally paid for by insurance. 
According to providers and the Governor’s Council on Developmental Disabilities, since the beginning of the year, an unknown number of autistic children in Nevada have been denied ABA benefits, or were required to pay more for the services they need, such as one-on-one help from an aide — a registered behavior technician — during school hours. The technicians work under the supervision of a behavioral analyst, adding to the expense of the therapy. 
Insurance companies determine the extent of ABA benefits, including reimbursement for one-on-one assistance, based on each child’s individual challenges, says Amy Novak, the owner of a school that serves autistic children. 
Novak says she began hearing “rumblings before winter break” from parents who said insurance providers intended to deny ABA benefits to children during school hours.
“It’s a medical necessity,” observes Novak. “How can the insurance company decide when they receive it?” 
Many children on the autism spectrum lack the skills to attend school, says Novak. “They go to ABA for six to eight hours per day. They go to speech, they go to occupational therapy or whatever recommended intervention, typically using their medical insurance.” 
Affected policies, according to providers and parents, are from UnitedHealth Care, one of the largest insurance companies in the nation, and its subsidiaries, including Health Plan of Nevada and Sierra Health.
Novak attributes the newly-imposed limitations on benefits to “corporate greed” and worries other providers will follow suit.
In 2024, ProPublica reported that cutting ABA benefits is part of UnitedHealth Group’s “secret internal cost-cutting campaign that targets a growing financial burden for the company: the treatment of thousands of children with autism across the country.”
In 2024, UnitedHealth reported record revenue of $400.3 billion. Net income for the year was down 36% from the previous year. The company announces its 2025 earnings next week. 
UnitedHealth subsidiaries in Nevada also offer Nevada’s public option, the Battle Born State plans,  as well as Affordable Care Act-compliant insurance, and Medicaid plans.
A UnitedHealth Care representative said late Thursday the company would investigate the concerns of providers and the Governor’s Council. 
The Nevada Division of Insurance and the Silver State Exchange, which administers ACA plans, did not respond to inquiries. 
‘Unsustainable financial hardship’
“While families reasonably anticipated premium increases for 2026, what they encountered instead were last-minute, undisclosed changes to coverage,” Catherine Nielsen, executive director of the Governor’s Council on Developmental Disabilities, told state lawmakers at an interim meeting of the Health and Human Services Committees in early January. 
Nielsen says the Governor’s Council is reviewing whether HPN’s “limitation on ABA benefits complies with state and federal requirements.”
Employer-sponsored plans have “remained comparatively insulated,” Nielsen wrote in a letter to Nevada’s state and federal lawmakers. ”The result is a two-tiered system in which children’s access to medically necessary care depends not on clinical need, but on how their parents obtain insurance.”
Interruptions in ABA therapy for young children “can contribute to regression, delayed progress, and increased need for more intensive support later,” Nielsen told lawmakers during the early January committee meeting. “For families, sudden changes in coverage or costs may jeopardize employment stability and household financial security.” 
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s spokeswoman Lauren Wodarski said the senator “believes this underscores the need for stronger oversight to prevent insurers from shifting costs in ways that effectively block access to care.”
Nielsen wrote to lawmakers that families relying on government-subsidized plans, including Affordable Care Act marketplace plans and Medicaid, “appear to be bearing a disproportionate share of these cost increases, network reductions, and access limitations.” Families, she added, are reducing hours of “medically necessary therapy” or absorbing “unsustainable financial hardship” to maintain the care.
Nevada families currently pay an estimated $2,945 in annual out of pocket costs for an autistic child, according to ProPublica. 
Families in a number of states have had access to ABA compromised as states cut Medicaid benefits to save money. Nevada officials, however, contend Medicaid benefits for ABA remain intact.  
“Nevada Medicaid has a robust coverage policy for this service, which reflects feedback from provider and community stakeholders. There have been no recent changes to this coverage, and none are currently planned,” Nevada Health Authority Chief of Staff Allison Genco Herzik said via email. 
Herzik said there are currently no waitlists for Medicaid recipients to access authorized ABA benefits from managed care organizations. Families experiencing difficulty accessing service should reach out to their managed care plan or the state’s district offices, she said.  
Nielsen of the Governor’s Council says Herzik’s statement “does not fully reflect the documented realities families are experiencing,” adding that  families’ experiences “and the state’s own internal acknowledgements indicate that meaningful access barriers still exist, even when formal waitlists are not captured in managed care reporting.” 
State staff, she said, in response to requests for information from the Autism Treatment Assistance Program, disclosed: 

 There are currently 156 children on the program waitlist due to staffing capacity, with wait times under 90 days;
 Caseload capacity is a “significant constraint. Only one new Developmental Specialist was approved for the biennium and that position will not be available until year two”;
 The state does not track how many children are unable to secure an ABA provider or provider-level waitlists. As a result, the conclusion that there are no waitlists reflects a data gap rather than confirmed access; and,
 State staff have confirmed a provider shortage driven primarily by workforce limitations. Some providers have paused or exited participation due to staffing challenges or administrative oversight requirements.

“Experts estimate that around 37 million children in the United States rely on Medicaid for health care, therapy, and other services,” the Nevada Autism Center wrote on its website last year. “For most disabled children, Medicaid is the only option they have available to be able to afford their needs.”  
The cost of ABA services for Medicaid recipients have “skyrocketed,” according to Herzik, who says  Nevada Medicaid paid $75 million to providers for ABA therapy in 2025, up nearly 350% since 2021. 
“To be clear no changes have been made,” Nevada Health Authority Director Stacie Weeks said Thursday night. “Such changes would require state public workshop/feedback and federal approval if we were to make changes. At this time, we are experiencing the opposite of what the Council is reporting which is a spike in utilization and costs for these services.”
Nielsen cautions that “increased utilization and spending do not necessarily indicate timely or equitable access, particularly for early intervention-aged children or families navigating provider scarcity and coordination delays.”
Nielsen says she’s working with the state to obtain answers, but has not received clarification. She says Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office is aware of the situation.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate passed a bill Thursday morning that bans the use of an education strategy known as the three-cueing system.
SB 168, sponsored by Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, codifies the Alabama State Board of Education’s May 2024 ban of the method. Three-cueing is a teaching strategy affiliated with “balanced literacy,” a compromise between whole language and phonics-based instruction that became prominent in the 1990s, according to the Hechinger Report.
“We made a lot of progress in literacy in the state. We moved from 49th to 34th in reading, and letting go of this would make sure that we are using the science of reading in our teaching methods in our schools,” Chesteen said on the floor of the Senate Thursday morning.

Mark Dixon, president of A+ Education Partnership, said in an interview Thursday afternoon that three-cueing creates “an illusion of progress.” 
“Meaning that if you’re taught using three-cueing, you’re guessing, you’re using the pictures around it,” Dixon said. “When the pictures go away, in later grades, then suddenly students realize they can’t read.”
Dixon said that often leads to teachers having to reteach using the science of reading. 
The Science of Reading is an interdisciplinary body of research about reading and issues of reading and writing. The Reading League’s definition includes phonemic awareness and letter instruction as instructional practices but not emphases on larger units of speech, such as syllables.
Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena, has sponsored similar legislation over the last few years, but it has not received a vote in the Senate. Dixon said he hopes starting in the Senate will help it pass.
“Three-cueiing is not some harmless strategy. It actively interferes with how children learn to read, and we need to be very clear that this has no place in Alabama classrooms,” Dixon said.

The United States’ national parks have an inherent contradiction. The federal law that created the National Park Service says the agency — and the parks — must “conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife … unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.”
That means both protecting fragile wild places and making sure people can visit them. Much of the public focus on the parks is about recreation and enjoyment, but the parks are extremely important places for research and conservation efforts.
These places contain a wide range of sensitive and striking environments: volcanoes, glaciers, sand dunes, marshlands, ocean ecosystems, forests and deserts. And these areas face a broad variety of conservation challenges, including the effects of climate change, the perils of popularity driving crowds to some places, and the Trump administration’s reductions to park service staff and funding.
As scholars of recreation who study the national parks and teach a course on them, we have seen the park service make parks far more than just recreational opportunities. They are living laboratories where researchers — park service personnel and others — study nature across wide-ranging ecosystems and apply what they learn to inform public and private conservation efforts around the country.

Returning wolves to Yellowstone
One of the best known outcomes of conservation research in park service history is still playing out in the nation’s first national park, Yellowstone.
Gray wolves once roamed the forests and mountains, but government-sanctioned eradication efforts to protect livestock in the late 1800s and early 1900s hunted them to near extinction in the lower 48 states by the mid-20th century. In 1974, the federal government declared that gray wolves needed the protections of the Endangered Species Act.
Research in the park found that the ecosystem required wolves as apex predators to maintain a healthy balance in nature.
In the mid-1990s, an effort began to reintroduce gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park. The project brought 41 wolves from Canada to the park. The wolves reproduced and became the basis of a Yellowstone-based population that has numbered as many as 120 and in December 2024 was estimated at 108.
The return of wolves has not only drawn visitors hoping to see these beautiful and powerful predators, but their return has also triggered what scholars call a “trophic cascade,” in which the wolves decrease elk numbers, which in turn has allowed willow and aspen trees to survive to maturity and restore dense groves of vegetation across the park.
Increased vegetation in turn led to beaver population increases as well as ecosystem changes brought by their water management and engineering skills. Songbirds also came back, now that they could find shade and shelter in trees near water and food sources.

Black bear protection in the Great Smoky Mountains
Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most biologically diverse park in the country, with over 19,000 species documented and another 80,000 to 100,000 species believed to be present. However, the forests of the Appalachian Mountains were nearly completely clear-cut in the late 1800s and early 20th century, during the early era of the logging industry in the region.
Because their habitat was destroyed, and because they were hunted, black bears were nearly eradicated. By 1934, when Great Smoky Mountains National Park was designated, there were only an estimated 100 bears left in the region. Under the park’s protection, the population rebounded to an estimated 1,900 bears in and around the park in 2025.
Much like the gray wolves in Yellowstone, bears are essential to the health of this ecosystem by preying on other animals, scavenging carcasses and dispersing seeds.
Water preservation in the Everglades
The Everglades are a vast subtropical ecosystem located in southern Florida. They provide drinking water and irrigation to millions of people across the state, help control storm flooding and are home to dozens of federally threatened and endangered species such as the Florida panther and American alligator.
When Everglades National Park was created in 1947, it was the first time a U.S. national park had been established to protect a natural resource for more than just its scenic value.
As agriculture and surrounding urban development continue to pollute this natural resource, park professionals and partner organizations have focused on improving habitat restoration, both for the wildlife and for humans’ water quality.
Inspiring future generations
To us, perhaps the most important work in the national parks involves young people. Research shows that visiting, exploring and understanding the parks and their ecosystems can foster deep connections with natural spaces and encourage younger generations to take up the mantle of stewardship of the parks and the environment as a whole.
With their help, the parks — and the landscapes, resources and beauty they protect — can be preserved for the benefit of nature and humans, in the parks and far beyond their boundaries.
An alligator protests her nest in Everglades National Park in 2015. The average American alligator nest size is 38 eggs. An estimated 24 hatchlings will emerge from nests that survive predation or flooding. By end of the first year, only 10 of the alligator hatchlings will still be alive. To help their young survive, mother alligators will often guard the eggs during incubation, release them from the nest upon hatching and escort them to the relative safety of the water where she will continue to guard them. Baby alligators stay with their mother for the first year, until she will need to protect her new young. (Photo courtesy of the National Park Service)

(Getty Image)Like many of you, I have watched our utility bills creep up the last three years through no fault of our own. Indeed, my husband is a hawk at turning off lights, watching the thermostat and making energy-efficient decisions.
But our bill has still ballooned — with the cooling and heating seasons delivering truly astounding bills.
One analysis found that bills from Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities shows went up 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.
So, I was excited to hear that House Republicans would be tackling utility affordability.
But the bill won’t help all Hoosiers.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission oversees eight electric utilities and 17 natural gas utilities in the state, according to the commission. However, more than 100 municipal and Rural Electric Membership Cooperatives have withdrawn from the commission’s rate jurisdiction. That includes my provider.
No shortage of suggestions heard to improve electric service affordability measure

Kerwin Olson, executive director of the consumer-focused Citizens Action Coalition, estimates up to 20% of Hoosiers aren’t protected by regulators — about one in five Hoosiers.
“The rationale is largely that those customers are taxpayers and constituents or voting members and can take complaints directly to the utility. Their only recourse really is common courts if they are not satisfied,” he said.
Olson thinks it’s fair in the context of investor-owned utilities needing more oversight. He does wish some of the state rules on deposits, late fees, reconnect charges and efficiency programs applied to all utilities.
But that’s a fight for another day.
Legislative efforts
The rest of you should be watching House Bill 1002.
Most of the bill doesn’t do anything to reduce or control your gas and electric bills. It instead provides ways to cope with them. But that doesn’t mean those provisions aren’t important.
The bill would do the following:

Require an electricity supplier that is under the jurisdiction of the IURC to offer a low-income customer assistance program that provides financial assistance to low-income residential customers for the payment of monthly bills for utility service.
Block service shut-offs to those customers during dangerously hot months. This protection already exists for cold-weather months — another time when bills jump but disconnection could harm Hoosiers.
Put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans. These plans level out your monthly bills so that your costs are more consistent. But they don’t control or lower them. And ratepayers could opt out of the program if they want.

The one section that could have a positive future impact is performance-based ratemaking.
It’s a newer concept, under consideration in other states, that would tie future rate increase requests to specific metrics. The Indiana bill would pair the new multi-year rate plans with performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.
Lawmakers may also look at peak load demand or environmental sustainability.
It’s unclear if the incentives would be enough to truly impact future rate increases, and customers wouldn’t see change for several years. But it’s a worthy discussion to have as Hoosiers struggle with higher costs.

Gov. Mike Braun is hoping to move the needle by revamping IURC’s membership and targeting rate hikes that pad company profits at the expense of ratepayers.
“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utility companies accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” he said during his State of the State speech.
“And it’s why I appointed three ratepayer-conscious members, now constituting a majority, to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission — to make decisions in the public interest to ensure utilities provide service at just and reasonable rates.”
Between the executive and legislative efforts, it’s my hope that Hoosiers will start to see the cost curve bend to a more reasonable level after years of increases.

Under the terms of the proposed constitutional amendment sponsored by House Speaker Jon Patterson, sales tax could be imposed “on transactions involving any goods and services” and the revenue would be exempt from the prohibition on using money generated from a tax on fuel sales for state needs other than highways. 
Missouri has earmarked money from taxes on motor fuels for highways since 1928.
That is not the intent, Patterson said in an interview with The Independent on Thursday, the day after he filed a revised version of the proposal that fixes earlier errors and expands on limitations intended to prevent a windfall of new revenue for state and local governments.
“There is absolutely zero intention on my part to see any increase in the motor fuel tax,” Patterson said.
An amendment to his bill will be prepared to make that explicit, Patterson said. The reference to how taxes on motor fuels are used is intended to prevent a new sales tax on fuel, Patterson said, not to divert money from highways. 
“The purpose of that whole paragraph is to say, ‘no, the motor fuel tax is not part of this,’” Patterson said.
Gov. Mike Kehoe, in a brief interview, declined to comment on imposing sales tax on fuel. He said he had not read Patterson’s proposal.
Missourians, who would have to vote on Patterson’s proposal, don’t want to pay more for gasoline, said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, at his weekly news conference.
“They’re going to be upset,” Beck said. “I think they’re going to be upset because there’s a lot of this.”
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, D-Affton, discusses Democratic opposition to eliminating the state income tax during a Thursday news conference. Beck was joined by Sens. Angela Mossley, D-Florissant, left, and Steve Roberts, D-St. Louis (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Kehoe and Republicans who control the General Assembly have made eliminating the state income tax on individuals their top priority for the year. Patterson’s proposal, which is expected to receive a public hearing next week, does not specify a sales tax rate to replace the income tax.
Missouri currently charges 4.225% on taxable goods other than food from groceries and vending machines. Of that, 3% is for general revenue, generating about one-fifth of the $13.4 billion in general revenue collected in the most recent fiscal year.
Local sales tax can double or almost triple the basic state rate.
The version filed Wednesday is Patterson’s second attempt. A constitutional amendment he filed last week had a drafting error that misstated which article contains the limit on the use of highway funds.
Patterson’s new proposal asks voters to grant lawmakers broad authority to expand sales tax to currently untaxed goods and services. Services such as accounting fees for tax preparation or car repairs are not currently taxed, and goods currently exempt include prescription drugs and home utilities.
In his State of the State Address, Kehoe said he wants to target “monthly subscriptions and digital services like online advertising, e-books and AI platforms that fall outside our current sales tax base.”
Lawmakers are also authorized by Patterson’s proposed amendment to set revenue triggers that would reduce, and then eliminate, the individual income tax as early as Jan. 1, 2031.
Other provisions would:

Exempt the tax legislation implementing the proposal from revenue lids that require tax increases to be submitted to voters.
Require local governments to adjust local tax rates downward to offset any increase in revenue from the broader sales tax base.
Reduce the constitutionally imposed sales taxes for conservation and state parks and soil conservation, 0.225% total, to make revenue from the new tax base equal the average of recent years.
Keep in place income taxes on corporations and other businesses, as well as allow income taxes on estates and trusts.

The exact list of things to be taxed, and the rate needed to replace current revenue, will be decided later, if voters approve his amendment, Patterson said.
“The people and their elected representatives will come together and decide, No.1, if they even want to do this, and if they do how they’re going to do it,” Patterson said. “But it’ll be the people and their elected representatives doing it together.”
Asking voters to trust Republican leaders to get the details right is irresponsible, Beck said. The GOP has rushed and made mistakes on tax cuts, congressional district maps and state budget estimates, he added.
When a bill eliminating the income tax on capital gains passed last year, it carried an estimated price tag of about $160 million in the current fiscal year and ongoing cost of $111 million The actual revenue cut is about $500 million in the current year and $350 million annually.
The mistake in state budget estimates was a $250 million math error in the forecast for how much the state would have on hand at the end of June 2027.
“The whole tax scheme in general, I’m just going to be honest with you, is ill conceived,” Beck said.
Missouri’s two largest population centers are on the state’s border and people who can shift purchases over the state line to avoid taxes will do so, Beck said.
“I don’t see this as an economic driver for the state,” Beck said. “I don’t see this as helping anything.”
Mike Kehoe says Missouri is falling behind. His solution: more tax cuts

Gasoline prices are one of the most visible barometers of the economy, rising after disruptions or when there is high sustained demand and falling when supplies are plentiful or purchases fall off in a recession.
Missouri fuel taxes have increased 12.5 cents per gallon since Oct. 1, 2021, and stand at 29.5 cents a gallon. 
Missourians consume about 4.1 billion gallons each year, generating approximately $1.2 billion in highway revenue.
That fuel, if sold at $2.50 per gallon, would generate about $435 million if subject to the the current state sales tax. The price of a 15-gallon fill-up would increase from $37.50 to $39.10.
Republicans have been cutting state income tax rates since 2014, when the top rate stood at 6% for taxable incomes greater than $9,000. The top rate is now 4.7%. Two future cuts, bringing the rate down to 4.5%, are already on the books and will take effect if general revenue growth hits certain targets.
Missouri collected $9.2 billion from the individual income tax before refunds in fiscal 2025. Generating the same revenue on the current sales tax base would require an additional sales tax of about 8.5%.
Those funds pay for public schools, prisons and medical care for more than 1.3 million people, among other state services.
The goal, Patterson said, is to replace a tax structure put in place in the 1920s and 1930s with one that fits modern economic activity.
“It really needs to be modernized,” Patterson said. “And this is something that you’re seeing, not just in red states or blue states. A lot of states are looking at modernizing their tax system.”
The lack of details on what will — and what won’t — be taxed is a big problem, Beck said.
“They’re taking (income tax) away,” Beck said, “and they’re saying the legislature knows better than the people, just like they’ve done in the past.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125_patterson1-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-23 07:37:06.208706

(Getty Images)A proposal to amend Indiana’s Constitution to allow judges to deny bail for certain “dangerous” defendants moved one step closer to the ballot Thursday after getting bipartisan support from the Senate.
Lawmakers approved Senate Joint Resolution 1 in a 43–2 vote, sending the legislation to the House. If greenlit by that chamber, too, the proposed constitutional change will appear on the November ballot for final consideration by Hoosier voters. Democrat Sens. Lonnie Randolph, of East Chicago, and Greg Taylor, of Indianapolis, cast the only “no” votes.
Supporters say the change would give courts flexibility to prevent violent crime, but critics have warned it could open the door to bias and abuse in Indiana courts before a person is convicted.

If ratified, the amendment would alter Article 1, Section 17 of the Indiana Constitution, which currently guarantees bail for all criminal defendants except those charged with murder or treason when “the proof is evident or the presumption strong.”
Under SJR 1, however, a defendant charged with other offenses could be held without bail if three conditions are met: the defendant poses “a substantial risk” to any other person or the community; the state proves by “clear and convincing evidence” that no release conditions would reasonably protect public safety; and “the proof is evident or the presumption strong.”
Resolution author Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, told colleagues that the measure is one of three bills this session “that work in harmony with each other.” 
Senate Bill 3, which sets the exact language voters will see on the ballot, additionally passed out of the Senate on Thursday in a 36-9 vote, largely along party lines. 
Senate Bill 2 advanced to the House earlier this week and would further add due-process protections in statute if the constitutional change is approved.
“In more than half of the states, courts can order at least some dangerous suspects held without bail — but not in Indiana,” Koch said. “SJR 1 amends the Indiana Constitution to allow courts to hold dangerous suspects without bail if releasing them from jail would threaten the public.”
Bail tied to ‘risk,’ not just charges
Koch noted that federal courts already deny bail to defendants in some cases and argued Indiana should have similar tools. 
“In order to protect Hoosiers from violent crime,” he said, the amendment would give Indiana’s criminal justice system “the flexibility to use a policy that most of the country already enjoys.”
“This is about the people of Indiana and their safety,” Koch emphasized.
During floor debate, Taylor pressed Koch on whether the amendment would allow bail to be denied even when a defendant is charged with a nonviolent misdemeanor.

Koch maintained the change “doesn’t relate to the charged offense. Rather, he said, “it is a dangerous risk assessment of that offender.”
Taylor called that distinction troubling, though.
“It’s not based on the charge — it’s based on the person, which makes this even more egregious,” Taylor said. “If you don’t think there are some judges out here that may have bias in their community of certain people, then you haven’t been to court in Indiana.”
Still, Taylor acknowledged the amendment process ultimately puts the question in voters’ hands. 
“I don’t like the premise of this constitutional amendment,” he said. “But I do like the fact that the people of the state of Indiana will have a chance to actually chime in on this issue.”
Koch pointed to multiple Indiana cases in which judges were required to release defendants on bail despite serious safety concerns.
“In these cases, the judges had no choice but to release these suspects because of the current constitutional language,” Koch said.
He declined to name specific Indiana counties but described a 2022 case in which a man charged with domestic battery — already on probation and facing multiple pending cases involving different victims — was released on bail and later killed his girlfriend before taking his own life. 
Koch also cited two similar 2023 cases involving repeat violations and subsequent homicides.
“My colleagues,” Koch said, “let’s send this matter ultimately to the voters later this year.”
How the constitutional amendment process works
Indiana requires proposed constitutional amendments to pass two separately elected General Assemblies before being submitted to voters. SJR 1 was first approved in 2023 and cleared part of its second legislative hurdle with Thursday’s vote.
If the amendment gets full approval from the House, a public question will appear on the November general election ballot, where it must receive approval from a majority of voters casting ballots to take effect.
Per language in Senate Bill 3, Public Question 1 would inform Hoosiers that, “Currently, under the Constitution of the State of Indiana, a person charged with murder or treason is not entitled to be released on bail if the proof is evident or the presumption strong.”
Voters would then be asked a yes or no question: 
“Shall the Constitution of the State of Indiana be amended to provide that a person charged with an offense other than murder or treason is not entitled to bail if: (1) the proof is evident or the presumption strong; and (2) the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that no release conditions will reasonably protect the safety of any other person or the community.”
Lawmakers clashed over the proposed ballot language on Thursday.
While Sen. Rodney Pol , D-Chesterton, said he supported allowing voters the ability to weigh in, he questioned whether the public question’s wording adequately conveys how broadly bail denial could apply. 
“The penalty that is involved is dire,” Pol said, arguing that the language does not make clear that defendants charged with nonviolent or misdemeanor offenses could still be held without bail if a judge deems them dangerous.
Koch responded that he intentionally worked to keep the ballot question “accurate, but also as brief as I could and as neutral as I could.” He warned, too, that a longer or more detailed summary could confuse voters or skew their understanding of the issue.










This is about the people of Indiana and their safety.


– Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford


Taylor additionally argued the question is “leading” and fails to tell voters “the whole story.” He drew parallels to past constitutional amendments that produced unintended consequences. 
Indiana lawmakers have debated changing the state’s constitutional right to bail for years, framing the issue as a balance between public safety and civil liberties. 
Supporters argue the current system forces judges to release defendants who pose clear risks, while opponents warn expanded detention authority could disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
“You can’t expect me to stand here and trust the court system with the lives and the freedom of my people,” said Taylor, who is Black. “You may feel safe with a judge determining if you’re dangerous — if you’re a danger to the public and other people — but I’ve been through it before, buddy.”
“I’ve been picked on because I look dangerous,” he continued. “The bottom line is (we should) respect the fact that my community deserves the true question on a ballot, just like yours.”

(Photos by Anne-Marie Caruso/Hal Brown)When Andrew Macurdy and Vincent Kearney were campaigning for the state Assembly last year, voters complained repeatedly about New Jersey’s notorious unaffordability.
The two Democrats said they empathized. Kearney’s a cop whose wife has worked as a custodian, school lunch server, and crossing guard. Macurdy’s children, ages 2 and 4, are in day care.
“It’s like having a second mortgage,” Macurdy said.
Voters weren’t clamoring for election law or campaign finance reform, Kearney said.
“They’re like, ‘Lower my taxes, fix the trains, fund my schools.’ In priority order,” he said.
In November, Macurdy and Kearney flipped Assembly seats in the 21st Legislative District that Republicans had held since 1992, part of a Democratic wave that gave Democrats a supermajority in the Assembly and a third consecutive term in control of the governor’s seat. The district includes towns in Middlesex, Morris, Somerset, and Union counties.
Both new assemblymen say affordability will be their chief mission in the Legislature, which kicked off a new two-year session last week. Macurdy and Kearney were among 12 first-termers elected to the 80-member lower chamber.
“People in my district don’t really want to hear about partisan politics. They want to hear about people who want to build consensus, who can solve problems, and who can try to improve people’s lives on things like getting the cost of living under control and getting to the root causes of why costs go up,” Macurdy said.
Beyond affordability, both also say they’d like to bring more accountability and transparency to Trenton, where lawmakers have hacked away at both in recent years by weakening the state’s public records law, revamping campaign finance statutes, and eliminating public notice requirements.
Macurdy is a former federal prosecutor who now works in private practice in New York City, primarily representing whistleblowers, so he has seen how expensive workplace fraud and misconduct can be. He also was a senior staffer in the New Jersey Attorney’s General Office, where he was one of the architects of Arrive Together. That program pairs police with mental health professionals to reduce the risk of violence when they respond to people in mental crisis.
“Accountability and transparency in government are extremely important, because we need to be doing whatever we can to make sure our government is being done as efficiently and effectively as possible,” Macurdy said.
Kearney, who also was a Garwood councilman until he resigned earlier this month to take his Assembly post, helps handle public records requests for the Union County Sheriff’s Office and co-founded Garwood Live, which has live-streamed government meetings since 2018.
“I’m a big transparency guy. If I do my job right as a cop, there’s no defense attorney that can lay a glove on me. If I’m doing my job right in politics, I shouldn’t have a damn thing to hide,” Kearney said.

 An early loss sets a political path
Kearney credits the late Assemblyman Alan Augustine — whose Assembly seat he now occupies — with sparking his interest in state politics.
Kearney lost his father, a career cop, to cancer just few weeks before he graduated high school. When the family applied for survivor’s benefits, officials wouldn’t pay because of an error in his pension paperwork. A friend suggested they ask Augustine for help.
“We couldn’t make our mortgage payments. We were getting ready to lose our house,” Kearney said. “Augustine takes the meeting and hears my mom out — but he can’t get anywhere either. And he’d been an assemblyman for a while at that point, like he had some juice.”
So Augustine, a Republican, wrote a bill to bolster pension payouts for police and firefighters, Kearney’s mom testified in support of it, and then-Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed it into law in 1996.
“That ignited my interest in state government, and I always followed what the Legislature did from that point forward,” Kearney said.
Kearney went into law enforcement like his dad, working as an emergency medical technician, 911 dispatcher, an officer at Kean University, and now a sheriff’s detective and firearms instructor in the police academy. He is also municipal chair of Garwood’s Democratic committee.
He said he had always heard that “cops and politics don’t mix,” but he learned he needed to be able to operate in that sphere because politicians are the ones who craft budgets, write laws, and appoint prosecutors.
“As I go through my career, you see things sometimes go sideways, or the law just hasn’t caught up to what’s going on, so you get the idea of: ‘Maybe I could write the laws.’ And so here we are,” he said.
Kearney, who has twin 13-year-old sons, will serve on Assembly’s state and government committee.

 From upholding laws to writing them
Macurdy has worked in the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey, and for three state attorneys general (Gurbir Grewal, Andrew Bruck, and Matt Platkin), jobs that prohibited political service.
A Harvard grad, he joined Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight, a Manhattan-based law firm, in 2023, and that cleared the way for him to consider running for office. Calling voters and canvassing for U.S. Sen. Andy Kim (D) during Kim’s 2024 campaign cemented his resolve to go into politics himself, he said.
“As a prosecutor, upholding public safety, executing the laws, is really important work. But at the end of the day, it is our legislatures that are making the laws and are in a position to make systems more efficient, more fair, and more effective at a more systemic level, and so that is really the work that I’m interested in,” Macurdy said.
He won on his first try. He and Kearney ousted Republicans Michele Matsikoudis, who had served two terms, and Nancy Munoz, a 16-year incumbent who was the chamber’s highest ranking Republican woman.
“Voters were definitely looking for change. They’re frustrated with government and feeling like politics is not working for everyday people,” Macurdy said. “That’s another reason that called me to run. I have little kids. I just want people in government who are thinking about the long term and making investments in our future generation.”
Beyond tackling affordability broadly and child care, energy, and health care costs specifically, Macurdy aims to focus on improving NJ Transit and persuading his legislative colleagues to change their budgeting process, which critics have blasted as rushed, packed with political giveaways, and not transparent.
“There’s a structural deficit, and we’ve run a multi-billion-dollar deficit for the last couple of years, so I think that responsible budgeting is extremely important,” Macurdy said. “People want to know they’re sending good stewards of taxpayer money down to Trenton.”

(Courtesy of Rivian)Washington state lawmakers have tried and failed to erase Tesla’s status as the only electric vehicle maker allowed to sell directly to consumers in the state. 
Now, one of Tesla’s chief competitors is prepping to take the case to voters. 
Electric truck manufacturer Rivian has pledged $4.6 million to get on equal footing with Elon Musk’s EV giant. 
A committee calling itself the Washington Coalition for Consumer Choice and Innovation is pushing a ballot measure to open that opportunity to more electric vehicle makers. 
State law blocks car buyers from purchasing electric vehicles directly from the manufacturer, so they’re forced to instead buy through dealerships. Tesla has been the sole exception to that law for over a decade. So while Rivian and luxury EV brand Lucid have showrooms in Washington, they can’t sell vehicles through them. 
In a statement, the coalition said it “believes that all Washington drivers should have the option to test drive and purchase the vehicle of their choice.”
“We are currently pursuing a November 2026 ballot measure to make these choices available to Washington consumers,” the statement continues. “We believe the majority of voters will agree with us that Washington’s outdated car sales laws should be updated.”
What organizations and businesses make up the coalition is unclear. 
The group has brought on California-based Winner & Mandabach Campaigns, a leading consultancy focused on ballot initiatives. The firm has worked on a number of Washington state measures, including the successful opposition to Initiative 1631 levying a carbon fee on emissions. Its website boasts of a 90% win rate for its ballot measure campaigns.
To qualify for the ballot, initiative campaigns must turn in at least 308,911 voter signatures by early July to the secretary of state’s office. The office recommends submitting at least 390,000 signatures to allow for invalid ones. The coalition’s proposal didn’t appear to have been filed with the secretary of state late Thursday.
Last year, legislation to allow companies like Rivian and Lucid to sell directly to consumers stalled in the state House. A coalition of environmental and business groups argued at the time that opening up the market would speed up sales of electric vehicles and help the state meet its goal of reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector.
Car dealers fearful of losing business have strongly opposed these efforts. The 2025 legislation died in a legislative committee chaired by a Democratic lawmaker who owns car dealers, Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland. But Walen said that didn’t play a role in the bill’s demise, saying it just lacked support.
Walen faced a complaint to the Legislative Ethics Board alleging a conflict of interest, but the board found no basis for it, noting a similar bill passed the committee in 2024 while Walen was chair.

“Rather than Respondent favoring her outside employment interests over her legislative duties as is alleged in the Complaint, it appears that there has been and continues to be a general lack of support for these aforementioned bills,” the ethics board determined.
The Washington State Auto Dealers Association declined to comment on the proposed ballot initiative.
In November, voters will also get to weigh in on an initiative seeking to bar transgender athletes from girls’ sports. The secretary of state’s office on Thursday confirmed that the measure, sponsored by the conservative organization Let’s Go Washington, received enough signatures. The agency is still verifying that another Let’s Go Washington ballot measure, dealing with parental rights for families with kids in public schools, qualifies for the ballot.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/manufacturing-Rivian.jpg,,,2026-01-23 07:37:06.208706

Thomas/Getty Images).KANSAS CITY — A longtime Missouri health regulator testified Thursday that abortion clinics were subjected to heightened scrutiny that had little to do with health or safety concerns, acknowledging under questioning that the extra attention was not tied to a greater risk of noncompliance.
John Langston has worked for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services for more than 30 years and appeared as a witness for the state Thursday in a trial over abortion regulations. His responsibilities have included managing regulatory compliance for health care clinics such as ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and rural health clinics.
When Langston was asked by attorneys for Planned Parenthood if the increased focus on abortion facilities was unrelated to their likelihood of noncompliance with health and safety standards, he paused for several moments, then replied: “I would say that’s true, yes.” 
Abortion facilities used to fall under the category of ambulatory surgery centers until the Missouri Legislature voted to designate them as a separate entity for regulation in 2017. Langston was then responsible for inspecting the three Planned Parenthood clinics providing abortions under those new standards. 
While approximately 120 ambulatory surgery centers in Missouri are scheduled for unannounced inspection every three to four years, the three abortion facilities were required to be inspected annually.
He testified on day 8 of a 10-day bench trial over Missouri’s Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP, laws, one of which is the law that created those separate rules for abortion facilities. The state’s Planned Parenthood affiliates and the ACLU of Missouri sued to strike down the laws, claiming they are now unconstitutional under the state’s reproductive rights amendment approved by voters in 2024. 
The licensing requirements law was temporarily blocked by a court order issued by Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang, who is also presiding over the bench trial.
Langston said in a deposition that he asked the department to assign someone else to the abortion facilities regulation because it was taking up an “inordinate” amount of his time.
“It was a no-win situation from both sides,” Langston said.
Abortion safety takes center stage as Missouri trial enters second week

Most of the complaints against the facilities were unsubstantiated, Langston said, and were often made by the same groups of protesters who frequently stood outside of the clinics and tried to talk to anyone going inside.
That included the inspectors. When the health department staff arrived at the facilities, he said, protesters would take pictures of the car and follow them, and tried to talk to the women especially, thinking they were patients at the clinic.
Dr. Randall Williams was the state health department director at the time, and had previously testified publicly that he was a “pro-life” OBGYN who had never performed an abortion. Langston and William Koebel, who took over the abortion facilities inspection responsibilities after Langston, both testified that Williams was heavily involved in any investigation of complaints and any deficiencies found at the clinics.
In 2019, the state threatened to shut down abortions at the St. Louis Planned Parenthood, the last to perform them before the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision in 2022. The letter denying the clinic’s license renewal was signed by Koebel, who said several “deficiencies” forced the state’s hands.
Several of those deficiencies were related to the statutes requiring providers to inform a patient of their fetus’ gestational age before performing an abortion, and requiring fetal tissue to be submitted to a pathologist within 72 hours. Other deficiencies were related to dust and peeling laminate.
Since the law is blocked by court order, Koebel said they have not performed any abortion facility inspections since the ban was overturned. If the judge decides to permanently block it, he said the department will have no authority to investigate complaints of abortion facilities.
The clinic in St. Louis, as well as Columbia and Kansas City, resumed procedural abortions in 2025. Medication abortion remains unavailable.
Of 25 states with TRAP laws on the books, 14 have facility licensing requirements akin to surgical centers, and eight of those, including Missouri, have rules governing the size of hallways and rooms inside the clinic, according to the Guttmacher Institute. This means that the majority of states with abortion clinics do not have such requirements. 
During the first week of the trial, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Emily Wales was asked if she believes any of the current regulations should stand. She replied: “What we want is for things abortion-specific to be regulated in the same way any non-abortion business would be.”
Many private OBGYN practices take patients who are insured by Medicaid and Medicare. In doing so, they are subject to oversight from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In 2024, Missouri banned Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving any Medicaid reimbursements for low-income patients.
Any practicing OBGYNs in Missouri, including those who perform abortions, must be registered through the Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts.
Koebel said abortion facilities would still be subject to regulations under the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, as well as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, the quality standards for lab testing on humans.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner).A pared-back proposal that will continue the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program, but without allowing for new land acquisition, passed the Assembly on Thursday, eliciting critical reactions from Democrats who said it won’t uphold the legacy of the program.
The Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship Program was initially created during the 1989-1990 legislative session and signed into law by former Gov. Tommy Thompson. With the goal of preserving wildlife habitat and expanding outdoor recreation opportunities throughout the state, the program has authorized state borrowing and spending for state land acquisition and for grants to local governments and nonprofit conservation organizations. It has traditionally received bipartisan support in Wisconsin as it has been reauthorized several times over the years.
Two GOP bills, coauthored by Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), passed the Assembly in a 53-44 vote along party lines. The bills would extend the program for an additional two years, but in a limited form.
Under the amended proposal, the Knowles-Nelson program would be reauthorized until 2028, but the money set aside would mostly be for maintaining land that has already been purchased under the program.
The program’s land acquisition provisions have been essentially stripped in the legislation. 
A previous version of the GOP bill would have authorized the program until fiscal year 2029–30. Gov. Tony Evers in his 2025-27 state budget proposal had called for investing over $1 billion and reauthorizing the program for another 10 years. Republicans rejected the proposal. 
Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) blamed the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the state of the proposal.
Wisconsin lawmakers for years exercised control over what Knowles-Nelson projects received funding through the state’s powerful Joint Finance Committee. Members of the committee could anonymously object to a project and have it upheld for an indeterminate amount of time.
The program and the power of the committee became the focus of a fight over the balance of power between the governor and lawmakers, with the state Supreme Court ruling in 2025 that the Joint Finance Committee did not have the authority to hold up spending through anonymous objections. 
Sortwell said that the DNR should not be able to buy land without oversight from lawmakers.
“I don’t support their ideas to turn our authority of the Legislature over to unelected people,” Sortwell said. “We can build this up and do more things with it but let’s make sure we don’t lose what we have today. We can maintain the program. We can go ahead and make sure that we can keep the lands that we already have in good condition and continue moving forward.” 
Under the amended version of AB 315, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would only be able to obligate $1 million for land acquisition — a cut from $16 million. The $1 million could only be used for the Ice Age Trail. The bill would also allow for DNR to obligate $9.25 million for property development and local assistance — a cut from $14.25 million. The program would also limit the amount that could be obligated for recreational boating aids to $3 million. 
The amended version of AB 612 provides the funding for the program, the reduced amount of $13.25 million each year.
The bill would also require that large projects get approval from the full Legislature and limit grant or in-kind contributions for a project to 30%. 
The DNR, under the bill, would also need to conduct a survey study of all of the land that has been acquired under the stewardship program including an inventory of all land acquired with money, proposed project boundaries and land acquisition priorities for the next two to five years, and proposed changes. The survey would need to be submitted to the Legislature in two years.
Recipients of a grant would also need to submit a report to the DNR on how the money was spent, and it would need to be publicly published. 
The program is set to expire on June 30, 2026, without a reauthorization from the Legislature and Gov. Tony Evers.
Ahead of the vote on Thursday, Team Knowles-Nelson, a coalition of Wisconsin environmental conservation organizations, fishing and hunting advocates, trail builders, bicycle enthusiasts and others, said in a letter urging lawmakers to vote against the bills on the Assembly floor that they don’t propose a “workable path forward.” 
“These bills include virtually no funding for land acquisition. Land trusts and local governments would have no dedicated ability to acquire land for either purpose — a fundamental departure from the program’s core mission,” Charles Carlin, the director of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit land trust organization Gathering Waters, said on behalf of the coalition. “While the bills provide habitat management grants to nonprofit conservation organizations, they impose an impractical framework. The grants are limited to habitat work on lands already owned by the state or local governments, excluding nonprofit-owned lands. This restriction undermines the collaborative conservation model that has made Knowles-Nelson successful for over three decades.” 
During debate on the two bills, Democratic lawmakers said the bills were inadequate and would not preserve the intent of the program. 
Rep. Vinnie Miresse (D-Stevens Point) declared that “every time Republicans amend the Knowles-Nelson proposal, it seems to get worse.” 
“Without land acquisition, Republicans have neutered this program and rendered it Knowles-Nelson in name only,” Miresse said. He added that lawmakers’ attitude of treating people with different opinions as a “threat” is how legislation that “ignores history, disregards broad public support and turns a shared legacy into just another talking point” gets a vote.
“They chose the extremes, and that choice will cost the state a program that Wisconsinites overwhelmingly support,” Miresse said. 
Rep. Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis) said the bill is not a compromise, but is instead “table scraps.”
Rep. Supreme Moore Omokunde (D-Milwaukee) talked about being a “birder” — someone who watches and observes birds as a hobby.
“We had the option to do a cost to continue… and it was rejected, and that disheartens me because when I go to places like Horicon Marsh when the birds are coming in, are migrating in, and I get to see goldfinches — there’s nothing like watching a chimney swift swoop down and try to get some food, or when you’re out and just walking around and navigating a red-winged blackbird swoops down tries to peck you in the head because it thinks that you are a crane trying to steal its eggs,” Moore Omokunde said. “We need to provide these opportunities for so many people in the state of Wisconsin to enjoy this.”
Republican lawmakers argued that the proposal was better than the Knowles-Nelson program ceasing to exist.
Rep. Dean Kaufert (R-Neenah) said that the bill isn’t perfect but is a compromise that will allow the program to continue into the future. He added that it would “help preserve some of our beautiful natural areas” for future generations to enjoy.
“Sometimes we get caught up in partisan politics, but let’s not make this about partisan politics. This bill deserves strong, bipartisan support,” Kaufert said. 
“I would rather take half a cookie today, rather than no cookie today to make sure that we can continue the program,” Sortwell said. “You gotta vote yes today because if you vote no, you’re saying, you know, what? I’m not willing to compromise. It’s not good enough for me, and I’m going to vote no, because I’m going to be like a little kid and take my ball and go home.”
Evers told lawmakers in a letter earlier this month that he was “hopeful” they would be able to move forward on a reauthorization proposal for the Knowles-Nelson program.
“I would be glad to sign any reauthorization proposal that appropriately supports both land acquisition and property management of Wisconsin’s valuable natural resources and public lands to secure the future of this program that is so fundamental to Wisconsin’s proud and cherished tradition of conservation,” Evers said.

Nothing proves it more than Trump’s disaster at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Rather than seeking international cooperation and peaceful coexistence for a better world, Trump unleashed his baseless fury at America’s longest-standing allies.  Those include Canada, with whom we share the longest undefended border of any nations in the world.  Toss in virtually all of the European nations, whom he derided and claimed were ripping off the U.S. and even went so far as to say they wouldn’t exist without us. 
We — and the rest of the world — have all been drenched in his foolish propaganda to simply take over Greenland because “we need it.”  But in front of world leaders, he unveiled a map showing all of Canada, Mexico, Greenland, and Venezuela as covered with the American flag, blatantly showcasing his insane belief that somehow the United States has the right to take over other countries — whether they like it or not. 
It’s worth remembering that for Trump, this is nothing new.  He made 30,573 documented lies in his first term and continues an unbroken pattern of simply lying through his teeth to the American people and our allies across the globe.  This is the guy who was known for not paying his contractors on construction projects — and now he brings that same moral vacuity to the nation and international stage. 
Closer to home, we have the stunning example of Trump’s Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, abruptly deciding to cancel the Bureau of Land Management grazing leases for American Prairie’s efforts to bring native bison — the national mammal — back to the Northern Plains.  
The benefits of bison on the landscape have long been lauded, numbering as many as 60 million across the undeveloped plains — which were healthy, productive, and supported a vast diversity of species prior to the sodbusters, cattle barons, and barbed wire fences.
Bison evolved in the Northern Plains and are far better suited to the often harsh conditions and natural predators like wolves and bears, than cattle.  American Prairie’s efforts to restore a small part of those once-thundering herds is lauded world wide. 
Well, except apparently by the Trump administration and Montana’s own benighted governor, Greg Gianforte, who facetiously paint bison as some kind of threat to the cattle industry.  How?  And like so much of their forked-tongue blather, they don’t bother to explain why they have to “save the cowboy” from American Prairie’s bison restoration efforts.  
The fact is, American Prairie has followed all the laws and regulations for their operation.  Their bison are brucellosis and disease free and they’re working with Montana’s tribal nations to restore the bison that were central to their culture and religion for thousands of years.  They also allow 25 local ranchers to run 7,000 head of cattle on American Prairie’s land — exactly the opposite of a threat to the cowboys Gianforte and Trump’s toady Burgum claim motivated the cancellation of the BLM grazing leases. 
No nation, state, or enterprise can function in the absence of trust because it totally eliminates the ability to plan, invest, and be confident in a secure future.  Unfortunately, trust is wholly absent from Trump and his administration as our allies — and Montana’s American Prairie bison restoration effort — just found out.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/American-Prairie-BLM.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 06:56:42.143382

Bradley Slagh (R-Zeeland) and 11 of his GOP colleagues in the Michigan House sent a letter to Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh of the Michigan Supreme Court urging the court to reject a proposed rule that would prohibit any civil arrests from taking place in a courthouse “while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse,” a rule that would apply to most ICE arrests. 
“This misguided proposal seems to contradict the very purpose of the court buildings themselves, which is to provide a place where laws are enforced and justice served,” the letter reads, adding that it “could make our courthouses refuges for dangerous and unlawful individuals.”
The letter goes on to call the proposed rule a violation of separation of powers, and says that should the rule be adopted, “it is difficult to see how this would not have an impact on the future funding of some court operations, as the courthouse would now be an impediment to the efficient administration of justice.”
Cavanagh letter Final
In a press release from Slagh’s office, he notes that House Republicans want to continue working cooperatively with the courts, but that ongoing cooperation could be jeopardized by this rule. 
“Courthouses exist to uphold the law, but this rule would choose to selectively ignore it,” he said in the press release. “It would turn places meant for justice and accountability into safe havens from federal law enforcement. That’s not something the Legislature can simply overlook.”
Slagh, who chairs the House Corrections and Judiciary budget subcommittee, added that he would be willing to schedule a subcommittee hearing to discuss the proposal as soon as Jan. 29. 
The proposal has already garnered significant public debate, with over 2,500 submitted online comments in the court’s public comment period, including comments in support from Attorney General Dana Nessel and state Sens. Mary Cavanagh, Jeremy Moss and Stephanie Chang, all Detroit-area Democrats. The proposal also received unanimous support from lawyers and advocates during a public hearing on the proposal.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2232883103-1024x661.jpg,,,2026-01-23 06:36:17.226737

Johnson, Kauf and Gibson will represent the U.S. and the Equality State in Italy.
The post Three Wyoming women to ski in Olympic events appeared first on WyoFile .","Jackson Hole native and alpine racer Breezy Johnson is expected to compete in the high-speed downhill in the Winter Olympics next month in Cortina, Italy, according to a Wednesday nomination announced by U.S. Ski and Snowboard. She’s the reigning world champion in the sport.
The organization also named Alta’s Jaelin Kauf, who calls Grand Targhee Resort home, to the women’s moguls team. Kauf won a silver medal in the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing and was world champion last year.
Anna Gibson, another Jackson Hole native, will compete in the first-ever Olympic Ski Mountaineering competition, a sport that grew out of skiing up and down snowbound alpine terrain, including by military patrols. Gibson will compete with racing partner Cam Smith in the mixed relay.
U.S. Ski and Snowboard said its team will be officially announced Monday. The 2026 Milano Cortina Olympic Winter Games in Italy will run Feb. 6-22.
Like the Wind
Johnson will return to a course that has bedeviled her. In 2022, she severely injured her knee in a crash on the steep and spectacular Olympia delle Tofane course that drops between two cliffs and down about 2,500 feet to the heart of Cortina d’Ampezzo.
“I know that I can be really fast on this course,” Johnson said in a taped message sent during training. “I know that it has burned me in the past, but I also know how well I can ski it.
“I’m taking the good and the bad and really using all of that experience to put together the run that I know I can on that course and really bring the journey full circle in Cortina.”
Johnson wears the bucking bronco on her helmet as part of the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort logo.
“The bucking horse on my helmet reminds me of the toughness of the state, the toughness of the people there and my toughness.” Breezy Johnson
“When I race with the bucking bronco, I feel like I’m very grateful to the community that helped raise me, that helped support me through so many tough times,” she said. “They always say that people are jealous of the end goals, but not of the journey they got you there.
“I feel like Jackson has been with me through that journey,” she said. “They’ve supported me through the journey, and so having the bucking horse on my helmet reminds me of the toughness of the state, the toughness of the people there and my toughness.
Wyoming is a proud state, she said, and Jackson an incredible community. Her family now lives in Victor, Idaho, part of the greater Teton community, where her mother is an attorney and her father a construction manager.
“I think so much of [how] those mountains have shaped me. We’re so much more than the rectangle that we were known for around the world.”
From Alta to altitude
Jaelin Kauf will be competing in her third Olympics, traveling from her hometown of Alta — population 650 — to the altitudinous world stage in front of millions at Cortina. She said she’s excited to take part in the debut Olympic event of dual moguls, in which skiers go head to head, along with her regular moguls run.
She’s the reigning world champion in both events.

Despite being clothed in winter garb, she was recognizable.
“I definitely took some photos with some people and kids,” she said.
At the last Olympics, she was alone in China. No spectators were allowed at the Yanging National Alpine Skiing Center because of COVID policies.
Instead, Teton Valley, Idaho folk, who live below Alta, and residents of the Wyoming town gathered for a watch party at the Tetonia Club, owned by her father Scott Kauf. “It sounds like it was awesome,” she said of the event.
This time, she’ll have slopeside support.
“There are like 30 to 40 people, maybe more, going over there this year,” she said of the venue in Italy. “I have high school friends, obviously my family, a pretty big support group, which should be awesome.”
Television may show a lone skier as Kauf bounces through the bumps, but there’s more.
“It’s me skiing on the hill, but I’m not doing it alone,” she said. “It takes a village, a community. I’m definitely going to be feeling the love.
“I have a lot of Wyoming pride,” she said. “It’s really cool to represent our state on the Olympic stage at the highest level of the sport.” Wyoming, after all — Grand Targhee Resort — is “where all the love and passion started,” she said.
It’s a privilege, she said, “to represent such a tiny Wyoming town on such a big stage, and be able to be a bit of inspiration for kids across the state of Wyoming, whatever their passion is.”
Fourth Olympic dream
Ski mountaineering became Anna Gibson’s fourth Olympic dream only half a year ago. When she was about 10, growing up among mountain-mad athletes in Jackson, she skied alpine racing events on the local slopes.
In high school, she strode and skated along the valley’s cross-country ski courses and ran track. At the University of Washington, she ran on a record-setting relay team. Two years ago, Gibson went to the U.S. Olympic trials in the 1,500-meter event, getting as far as the semifinals.

In each discipline, she grasped at a vision of the five Olympic rings, a symbol of unity. In traveling to Italy, she’ll bring the U.S. into a Eurocentric sport that’s now spreading across the continents.
“This form of skiing was kind of born in that part of Europe,” she said. The “skimo” relay combines uphill climbing on skis that have “skins” — originally animal skins — attached to the bottom to prevent sliding backward. Then there’s a steep section where the athletes climb while carrying skis on a backpack.
That’s followed by more uphill skinning, then a downhill run. The mixed relay involves a team of one male and one female, each completing a set course twice.
Most Americans “don’t know anything about skins and how skimo works,” Gibson said. They think of skiing as exclusively a sliding event, even though some cross-country events include uphill sections.
In Jackson Hole, however, where you can’t go far without running into a mountain, “going uphill, it’s normal,” she said. Legions of alpinists skin or boot up backcountry hills and mountains daily in search of untracked powder or a thin-air summit.
“Everybody in Jackson lives like that,” she said. “You just do stuff because it’s exciting and outdoors.”
Skiing, including skinning uphill, started with her parents, Gibson said. Among other things, they established and operated the landmark Pearl Street Bagels in Jackson, while skiing above town in their free time.
Gibson recalls skinning up the Gros Ventre Run at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort above Teton Village with her dog, Puzzle. Going uphill was against the rules, but things were looser then, she said.
“I didn’t recognize skimo as something I would do,” she said. “I was mostly enjoying the action of going out and doing it with my family.”
Gibson has a month before her race. She’s been in Jackson Hole, trying not to become obsessed with the Olympics. She has one more race before Italy.
“The biggest challenge is more mental than physical,” she said. “I’m trying to figure out how to quiet all the noise and intensity — treat it like any other race.
“I’m trying to soak up all the energy in Jackson and share this experience with the community,” she said. “Jackson and Wyoming as a whole have taught me the joy sports can bring.”

So far, winter 2025-’26 has been an odd one: unseasonably warm and dry along Wyoming’s valley floors, but snowy in the western mountains. 
The post A tale of two Wyoming winters appeared first on WyoFile .","Mary the pudelpointer hadn’t jumped in open water in months, but on Monday took advantage of an ice-free Bull Lake while her humans were unsuccessfully angling.  
Less than a year old and still relatively stupid, the sleek black pup persistently shivered in the hours that followed and perhaps regretted her decisions. 
But Mary was lucky in one regard: She got to make a choice about going swimming in late January in western Wyoming. At low elevations, the Equality State is experiencing its most snow-free and ice-free winter in 17 years — a timespan that exceeds most dogs’ lives.  
“2009 was the last year that the non-mountainous areas were this bare,” Wyoming State Climatologist Tony Bergatino told WyoFile in an email.
Although the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and Bighorn Range have near-average snowpacks as of late January, non-mountainous parts of Wyoming haven’t been this bare in nearly two decades. (Wyoming State Climate Office)
This winter’s snowpack is shaping up to be about the opposite of the “inverted” snowpack from winter 2022-’23, Bergatino said. That year, an especially deadly one for wildlife, the valley floors in southern Wyoming and into the Wind River Basin held “massive” amounts of snow, he said. 
Now it’s nowhere to be seen. The overwhelming majority of low-lying areas in the state have a snowpack that’s less than 5% of normal, Wyoming State Climate Office maps show. 
The mountains are an exception.

Although just 55 miles from Bull Lake, the trail network is nearly 3,000 feet higher and the snowpack high in the watershed is heftier than the norm for this point in the winter. (Jordan Schreiber)
Just two days before Mary’s frigid swim, she romped down groomed, frozen trails while her humans cross-country skied on Togwotee Pass. 
The snowpack in the western mountains is “pretty good,” Natural Resources Conservation Service Hydrologist Jeff Coyle said. Elsewhere in Wyoming’s high country, it’s more marginal.
The Wind River Basin, where Mary swam and romped, even has an above-average snowpack, at 112% of the long-term median, SNOTEL data shows. 
In terms of water supply come next summer, the high elevations are “really where the snow counts,” Bergatino said.    
There are some pitfalls to a complete lack of low-elevation snowpack, though. Typically, snow helps insulate the ground, mitigating deep freezes, according to Bergatino. No snow also increases the likelihood of the soil drying more — and it’s already quite parched.

Slashing the university's budget runs counter to the value Wyoming’s founders put on access to affordable, high-quality education, writes UW President Ed Seidel. 
The post A confounding crossroads moment for Wyoming’s university appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming was created in 1886, four years before Wyoming became a state. We often make note of this piece of history to show the inextricable connection between the university and this place we call home, but there is more to it than that.

Opinion

Wyoming became a state in 1890 because the people of the territory saw a need to organize a government to, in large measure, provide services to improve their quality of life. Over the years, the list of services delivered to the citizens of Wyoming by their state government — things like highways, K-12 schools, law enforcement, certain health care services, and water and natural resources management — has become what we consider basic infrastructure.
But, before all of that, Wyoming made a university. Wyoming’s founders considered higher education such an important piece of infrastructure that they created the university even before statehood. Why? Because they knew it was fundamental to the state’s future.
UW was formed under the federal Morrill Act of 1862, which called for the creation of public universities to, among other things, “promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life,” specifically emphasizing “agriculture and the mechanic arts.” The state constitution also directed that an education at Wyoming’s university be “as nearly free as possible.”
From that modest start, Wyoming elected officials have, over the past nearly century and a half, led the building of a world-class land-grant university, still dedicated to those founding principles of accessible, high-quality education, and research and service for the benefit of the people of the state. Wisely, in my opinion, they’ve also chosen to direct the state’s resources to a single flagship university, which has allowed a breadth and depth of programs that are the envy of some institutions in multi-university states.
That breadth and depth are now in jeopardy. The Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee voted Jan. 13 to cut the state’s funding of the university in the next biennium, or two-year budget cycle, by $40 million —or almost 11% of what UW receives from the state. The committee also exempted our College of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Natural Resources and College of Education from those cuts, meaning the impact to UW’s other academic colleges could be closer to a 15.4% reduction.
UW has accepted its fair share of reductions as the state’s economy has ebbed and flowed over the years, but the JAC’s vote — coming at a time when state finances are not in crisis — goes against Wyoming’s heritage of prioritizing access to high-quality education for its people. And it would force reductions in programs and services that are bound to be felt by the people of Wyoming, along with making it much harder to keep UW “as nearly free as possible.”
We have not determined exactly what we would cut if the JAC recommendation becomes law. But, to put things in context, the entire budget — including all sources of revenue, not just the state block-grant portion — of UW’s College of Business is just over $13 million per year and the College of Education almost $8 million, close to the combined total of the JAC’s proposed $20 million annual reduction.
Any perception that the university’s operations budget has grown over the past decade is not accurate. Amounts have risen and fallen with the state’s fortunes, and in times of plenty, the state has invested a lot of money in facility construction, but the UW block grant was larger in 2013 ($371 million) than it is today ($366 million), not even considering the $40 million cut proposed. And this doesn’t take into account the impact of over 30% inflation on the university’s buying power, or the fact that UW employees as a whole have not received pay adjustments since July 2023.
Simply stated, a cut of this magnitude would mean a reduction in programs that students choose and services the state relies on. We simply won’t be able to continue providing everything we currently provide.
We encourage the people of Wyoming and their lawmakers to consider just what their university does for the state. Over the past few months, a number of UW leaders have published op-eds pointing out what their units contribute to the people of Wyoming. Primarily, it’s delivering a great education to our students and the future workforce of Wyoming — but also research that boosts the state’s key industries, programs that stimulate our economy and NCAA Division I athletics programs that unite and bring pride to our people. UW is a unique place that offers opportunities for thousands of students and generates many hundreds of millions of dollars of economic impact annually.
Regardless of what the Legislature decides, we will continue striving to do those things. But this proposed $40 million cut would mean we’d be unable to do as much as the people of Wyoming need, expect and deserve. It would cause damage that will last years. That’s a confounding situation at a time when state government is not suffering financially. It’s also contrary to what Wyoming’s founders intended, to what generations of Wyomingites have built and to what future generations will need.

Long before the recent abortion decision, lawmakers defined health care as more than just treatment designed to sustain life, writes law professor Eric Muller.
The post What the Wyoming Supreme Court didn’t invent about ‘health care’ appeared first on WyoFile .","I taught constitutional law at the University of Wyoming in the 1990s. One thing I learned quickly is that Wyomingites don’t have much patience for courts that seem to be inventing rights or words to get the outcome they want. So it’s no surprise that the Wyoming Supreme Court’s recent abortion decision has been greeted by many critics as “judicial activism.”

Opinion

Their charge goes like this: The Wyoming Constitution protects each competent adult’s right to make their own “health care decisions,” but the court simply declared that abortion counts as “health care,” without any real basis for doing so. Properly understood, the argument continues, “health care decisions” are about treatments to sustain and restore life, not to end it.
That criticism misunderstands both what the court did — and what Wyoming law already says.
The court’s reasoning was straightforward. The state constitution protects “health care decisions.” Abortion involves medical judgment about a patient’s body. Therefore, abortion decisions are “health care decisions.” You may disagree with that conclusion, but it’s not exotic constitutional theory. Courts decide every day whether a particular practice fits within a general legal category. It’s regular business.
Still, the court’s conclusion is right for another reason — one the court itself did not emphasize — and it comes not from moral philosophy, but from existing Wyoming law.
When a state’s laws use the same phrase in different places, courts generally assume it means the same thing each time. (There’s a fancy Latin phrase for this, but I’ll spare you.) Otherwise, a legislature would be free to sprinkle words around the statute books and leave courts and citizens guessing which definition applies where.
So if critics insist that “health care” means only treatment designed to sustain life or restore physical health, the obvious question is: Does Wyoming law actually use the term that way?
The answer is no.
Consider the “Provider Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment Program Act” passed in 2015. That statute repeatedly uses the phrase “health care” to describe what doctors, nurses and facilities must do when a patient has clearly expressed wishes about end-of-life treatment. And what does the law require? It requires health care providers to honor a patient’s decision not to receive treatment — even when doing so will hasten death.

Abortion rights advocates wore green in support of Latin America’s Green Wave movement that signifies hope. (Milo Gladstein/Wyoming Tribune Eagle)
That is not care aimed at restoring health. It is not care designed to prolong life. Yet Wyoming law says “health care” providers have to provide it if that’s what the dying patient wants. It specifically uses that term, over and over again: “health care.”
This matters because it directly undercuts the state’s argument in the abortion case. If “health care” in Wyoming law includes respecting a patient’s decision to refuse life-sustaining treatment, then that term cannot plausibly be limited just to interventions that preserve life or cure disease. 
Seen in this light, the Wyoming Supreme Court did not invent a definition of “health care” to reach a preferred result. It applied a definition that Wyoming law has long embraced — one that treats decisions that relate to dying as much a part of “health care” as decisions that relate to living.
My argument might easily be misunderstood. I am not saying that aborting a fetus is the same as caring for a person at the end of life. Not at all. I am saying that the meaning of “health care” under one provision of Wyoming law is informed by how Wyoming law uses the phrase “health care” elsewhere.
People can disagree, in good faith, about abortion policy. But calling this decision “judicial activism” misses the mark. The court didn’t make the word “health care” mean something new. It took Wyoming law at its word.

(Wisconsin DNR photo)Wisconsin Republicans on Thursday continued their yearslong effort to reverse the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource’s decision not to quantify a specific statewide goal for the state’s gray wolf population with a public hearing on a bill that would require the agency to set one. 
The bill, authored by Sen. Rob Stafsholt (R-New Richmond) and Rep. Chanz Green (R-Grand View), is unlikely to be signed into law by Gov. Tony Evers if it’s passed, but shows how the contentious politics around wolves continue to play a major role in the state’s natural resource policy debates — especially in an election year. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, seen as the frontrunner in the Republican primary for governor, was the author of a bill recently passed in the House that would remove the gray wolf from the federal endangered species list. 
State law in Wisconsin requires that whenever the wolf isn’t listed as endangered, the state must hold an annual wolf hunt. 
The state’s wolf management plan was updated for the first time in decades in 2023. The plan was established after a two and a half year process involving an advisory committee made up of 28 member organizations and thousands of public comments. 
Prior to the current plan’s adoption, Wisconsin was operating under a plan that was first approved in 1999 and then updated in 2007. That plan went into effect as the state was working to responsibly handle the animal’s return to the state after its extirpation in the 1960s. 
Initially, the state set a  population goal of 350 wolves. 
More than a quarter century after the 1999 plan’s adoption, the state’s wolf population is estimated to be about 1,200 wolves. The 350 number that was initially set as an aspiration for a healthy wolf population has come to be seen by some hunters and farmers as a wolf population ceiling. 
But under the current wolf management plan, the DNR opted to use an “adaptive management” system which forgoes setting a specific population number. Instead, the state gets divided into zones and in each zone the DNR annually assesses the local wolf population to decide if it needs to be kept stable, allowed to grow or reduced through a hunt. 
Adaptive management is the method used by the state for most other game species, including black bear, bobcat, coyote, white-tailed deer and wild turkey. But since the plan’s adoption, Republicans have been opposed to using the method for wolves. 
Rep. Green, the bill’s co-author, said that the growth of the wolf population in northern Wisconsin is causing a number of problems, including in the area’s deer population. 
“We’d like to see a wolf management goal in place where — most of these wolves are concentrated in northern Wisconsin and we’d like to see that reduced,” Green said. “It’s been heavily impacted on our deer populations and things like that.”
Research has shown that Wisconsin’s wolves have helped cause a noticeable decline in the number of vehicle-deer collisions that occur in the state. 
At the hearing, Chris Vaughan, Wisconsin director of the pro-hunting organization Hunter Nation, complained that the wolf management plan focuses too much on the social effects of the wolf population, putting too much weight on people’s personal views about wolves. Vaughan lamented how frequently Wisconsin’s plan uses the word “social” compared to other states
But representatives of the DNR said social carrying capacity is an important consideration for biologists when managing any species. 
“Dare I say the biological part of wolf management is the easy part,” Randy Johnson, the DNR’s large carnivore species specialist, said. ”We know how to have a pretty good system of monitoring the population. The science is pretty clear about how we can move the population up and down through harvest. It is the social side of this that continues to be the difficult part of it. Everybody knows it’s a contentious issue. Some people see it different ways, some people want more, some people want less and it’s our job to try to balance that.” 
Proponents of a hard limit on the wolf population also cast their argument in social terms.
Brad Olson, president of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau, said the state should have a specific population number to assuage the feelings of farmers who are traumatized by losing livestock to wolves. 
“For those of us who live in wolf country and deal with wolves on a day in, day out basis, at times, I think the number is very important to those of us in wolf country who have these issues,” Olson said. “You haven’t been on the farms like I have where, where the mule has been killed by a pack of wolves … and I think in all of this, what we’re really missing from the legislative side, from the DNR side, is we’re missing the impact of the mental health on rural ag and those in rural Wisconsin.” 
“When compared to other species where adaptive management works, wolves sit at a completely different intersection of biology, social politics and law, where this vague management tool is impossible to apply,” Vaughan said.
Democrats on the committee questioned the prudence of changing the DNR’s management plan before the wolf has been delisted and the plan has a chance to be put to the test when a hunt must be held. 
“So if we actually could accomplish [a healthy wolf population] utilizing the tools and the science that the DNR has provided, would that or would that not actually accomplish the goal?” Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) asked.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/collaredwolf-DNR.jpg,,,2026-01-23 06:36:17.226737

(Photo: Getty Images)Thousands of legal immigrants will lose access to TennCare beginning in October as a result of new Trump administration policy, while Tennessee officials separately consider barring pregnant women without legal immigration status from accessing publicly-funded prenatal care.
TennCare Director Stephen Smith told lawmakers this week that, beginning Oct. 1, about 8,500 refugees and asylum seekers would be cut from TennCare, Tennessee’s Medicaid program. The cuts are a result of policy changes contained within the Trump Administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law earlier this year. Refugees and asylum seekers are legal immigrants.
State officials are currently examining whether a separate but related program in Tennessee, the Child Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, could begin to exclude pregnant immigrant women without legal status from prenatal care. Like TennCare, the CHIP program is a joint federal-state program; it provides low-cost health coverage for children and pregnant women whose families earn too much money to qualify for TennCare. 
“We’re looking into whether, if for example you all decided, or we decided internally that we no longer wanted to cover services related to the unborn child, whether we could do that,” Smith told lawmakers on the House Insurance Committee Tuesday. 
Smith’s remarks came in response to questions by Republican lawmakers about whether immigrants without legal status qualified for TennCare benefits. Immigrants unlawfully present in the United States are not eligible for TennCare, Smith said. 
In 2024, the cost of TennCare benefits for asylum seekers and refugees was about $20 million annually with the state government picking up about $7 million of the tab while the federal government paid the rest, Smith said.  










If you are a fertilized egg in Tennessee and considered a person, you are a Tennessean and entitled to healthcare. If that’s what the Republicans are saying, they should be on board for prenatal care.


– Dr. Katrina Green


TennCare officials did not respond to questions about plans to eliminate pregnant immigrant women from prenatal care under the CHIP program.
Tennessee has offered prenatal services regardless of immigration status through the CHIP program for more than 20 years as part of a policy introduced by former President George W. Bush. States were given the option to provide prenatal care to immigrants without legal status,  which Tennessee did under the administration of former Republican Gov. Don Sundquist, according to Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center. 
The program, Johnson said, has resulted in more healthy babies. Cutting off access to prenatal services for pregnant women without legal status would signal that “we think these babies don’t matter,” she said. 
Emergency physician Dr. Katrina Green, who has advocated for access to reproductive care in Tennessee, said she was disheartened by the discussion she observed during Tuesday’s legislative hearing.
Green noted some Republican lawmakers have long advocated for “fetal personhood” legislation defining life as beginning at fertilization. 
“If you are a fertilized egg in Tennessee and considered a person, you are a Tennessean and entitled to healthcare,” Green said. Green noted that was not her own opinion. “If that’s what the Republicans are saying, they should be on board for prenatal care. I’m really concerned they would consider cutting off care for these women that would harm future citizens as a result.”

However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for […]","SEMINOLE, TEXAS - FEBRUARY 27: Signs point the way to measles testing in the parking lot of the Seminole Hospital District across from Wigwam Stadium on February 27, 2025 in Seminole, Texas. Eighty cases of measles have been reported in Gaines county with one death reported. (Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)After a year of ongoing measles outbreaks that have sickened more than 2,400 people, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.
“It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel,” Abraham said. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
Infections from other countries, however, accounted for only about 10% of measles cases detected since Jan. 20, 2025, the official start of the deadly measles outbreak in West Texas, which spread to other states and Mexico. The rest were acquired domestically. This marks a change since the U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. Measles occasionally popped up in the U.S. from people infected abroad, but the cases rarely sparked outbreaks, because of extremely high rates of vaccination. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strongly prevent infection and halt the virus’s spread.
To maintain its measles elimination status, the U.S. must prove that the virus has not circulated continuously in the nation for a year, between Jan. 20, 2025, and Jan. 20, 2026. To answer the question, scientists are examining whether the major outbreaks in South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Texas were linked.
Health officials confirmed that the main measles virus strain in each of these outbreaks is D8-9171. But because this strain also occurs in Canada and Mexico, CDC scientists are now analyzing the entire genomes of measles viruses — about 16,000 genetic letters long — to see whether those in the United States are more closely related to one another than to those in other countries.
The CDC expects to complete its studies within a couple of months and make the data public. Then the Pan American Health Organization, which oversees the Americas in partnership with the World Health Organization, will decide whether the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status. And that would mean that costly, potentially deadly, and preventable measles outbreaks could become common again.
“When you hear somebody like Abraham say ‘the cost of doing business,’ how can you be more callous,” said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an online discussion hosted by the health blog Inside Medicine on Jan. 20. “Three people died of measles last year in this country,” Offit added. “We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 — eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of.”
Abraham said vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles but that parents must have the freedom to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, and vaccine rates have dropped. A record rate of kindergartners, representing about 138,000 children, obtained vaccine exemptions for the 2024-25 school year.
Information on vaccines has been muddied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously founded an anti-vaccine organization. He has undermined vaccines throughout his tenure. On national television, he has repeated scientifically debunked rumors that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death.
Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, disparaged the Trump administration’s focus on finding genetic technicalities that may spare the country’s measles-free status. “This is the wrong thing to pay attention to. Our attention has to be on stopping the outbreaks,” she said.
“If we keep our status, it should be because we have stopped the spread of measles,” she said. “It’s like they’re trying to be graded on a curve.”
The Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to assist West Texas during the first critical weeks of its outbreak and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to KFF Health News investigations. However, the agency stepped up its activity last year, providing local health departments with measles vaccines, communication materials, and testing. Abraham said HHS would give South Carolina $1.5 million to respond to its outbreak, which began nearly four months ago and had reached 646 cases as of Jan. 20.
If the CDC’s genomic analyses show that last year’s outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country’s status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August.
And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country’s status: “They’ll say, who cares.”
Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a reporter from Stat that a reversal in the nation’s status would not be significant: “Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread.”
Data shows otherwise. Case counts last year were the highest since 1991, before the government enacted vaccine policies to ensure that all children could be protected with measles immunization.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia has seen an increase in special education students, and in some counties, those students now account for a quarter of enrollment. 
Required services for special education students — like one-on-one aids and nurses — have impacted schools’ budgets. Federal and state education laws mandate services be provided to special education students.  
Jackson County Schools Superintendent William Hosaflook said his county has a roughly $2.8 million deficit in order to educate around 600 special education students in his district.  
“What we have to do is look at other areas. It could be our (Career and Technical Education)  courses, it could be our (agriculture) programs, it could be our band programs, but somehow we have to reduce that to make sure that we can meet our budgetary goals,” he said. 
As lawmakers contemplate a change to West Virginia’s complicated school funding formula, state schools Superintendent Michele Blatt asked lawmakers to prioritize giving counties more resources for special education students. 
“We believe that our state’s growing number of special education students that are being served in our public schools is the area where we are really falling behind,” she told members of the House Committee on Finance Thursday. “We are probably getting about half of what it costs to educate those students.”
The school aid formula is a seven-step formula that determines how much state funding goes to county school systems based on factors including the number of students enrolled in the county public school system.
While services for special education students can cost anywhere from 50% to 420% more than general education, West Virginia’s current school funding formula offers resources for only “high acuity” special cases.
West Virginia ranks near the bottom of all states for its amount of funding for special education despite the rate of special education students being the nation’s fifth highest.
“To address those needs, whether it’s staffing or the resources that have to be in place for those students. Looking at the geography, the transportation, the facilities in another area … that’s costly,” Blatt said.
She noted that public schools are currently providing special education services for students in private school or who are being homeschooled. They are also required to provide those services for students using the Hope Scholarship, the state’s school voucher program.
“Because those services aren’t available in a lot of the other school choice options,” Blatt said.
Number of special education students increasing
The number of special education students has grown nationwide due to improved identification and a better understanding of common conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and ADHD,  education experts say. 
In West Virginia, educators have linked special education needs to the state’s substance abuse crisis. Fetal drug exposure is tied to a higher likelihood of mental disorders, adverse behavior problems and needing an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).
The RAND Corporation, which presented its analysis of West Virginia’s school funding formula to lawmakers last week, recommended that the state adjust its funding formula to increase funding for special education students. 
“Districts need more resources to adequately serve students from low-income families, students with disabilities and English learners,” RAND Corporation researcher Brian Phillips told lawmakers. “These students require additional support, specialized staff and services if they’re going to have an equal opportunity to succeed.”
Ahead of the legislative session, Senate and House leadership told reporters that they expected lawmakers to focus on changing the state school aid formula.
Public school officials have said that the current school aid formula isn’t working due to West Virginia’s declining student population, the rising number of special education students and other factors. Decreases in enrollment over decades — along with waning federal pandemic funds — have caused county school systems to consolidate and lay off teachers.
“If we think we’re going to fix this in 60 days, we’re absolutely wrong,” Hosaflook said. “We have to come to the table. It needs to be superintendents. It needs to be legislators. It needs to be the Department of Ed, everyone working together for public education to fix this.”

Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, questions Arkansas Department of Education officials about school vouchers during an Arkansas Legislative Council meeting on Jan. 16, 2026. (Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)During last week’s meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council, where members were asked to pour $32 million more into Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ school voucher subsidies, Republican Sen. Breanne Davis of Russellville unintentionally drew attention to a bit of the program’s perverse financial logic.
Rep. Jim Wooten of Beebe, one of a handful of Republicans who voted against the vouchers scheme when it was approved in 2023, noted that by drawing students away from public schools and reducing student numbers, the program would also reduce their state funding. That funding is tied to a set annual per-student amount.
“I’m telling you, we are hurting public schools when we take $309 million for private schools,” he said.
But Davis, who was the chief Senate sponsor of the law creating the vouchers program, argued that the difference is made up as the state raises the amount of per-student funding districts receive.
The value of a voucher is set at 90% of that per-student amount, which means that raising it will also make the vouchers more expensive – creating a circular, double-barreled assault on the state treasury, with no end in sight.
Davis’ solution, if it can be called that, also ignores the larger point Wooten was trying to make. At some point, probably when a recession causes a drop in state revenues, legislators will be forced to make a choice between funding vouchers, which benefit fewer than 45,000 students at a staggering cost of more than $300 million per year, and funding public schools, which serve 10 times as many kids.
However, there are indications that Republican legislators are at last waking up to the threat vouchers pose to the state budget, an obvious timebomb most GOP lawmakers seemed to ignore three years ago in their rush to do Sanders’ bidding.
In a rare instance of legislators standing up to the governor on one of her signature issues, there was audible dissent during a voice vote when Sanders’ latest request for more voucher money was approved by a legislative council subcommittee, on which only Republicans sit.
And for good reason. In the state budget approved last April, $187 million was appropriated for vouchers. In June,  Sanders came back to legislators to ask for $90 million more, dipping into state reserves. Now, the $32 million tranche approved by the legislative council last week (also from reserves) brings the total to $309 million – 65% more than what was appropriated just nine months ago.
The reason for the cost explosion is that starting last fall, any Arkansas parent can get a voucher subsidy, no matter their income. But it’s also the result of a conscious decision by Sanders not to avail herself of the tool legislators gave her to prevent these very kinds of cost overruns.
One of the striking features of the debate over vouchers when they were approved in 2023 was that Sanders administration officials didn’t provide a cost estimate for the program at full implementation because, they said, there was no way to know how many parents would enroll.
However, legislators put in a safeguard to prevent the kind of budget implosion vouchers have caused in Arizona and other states: The program wouldn’t operate as an entitlement, in which the state guarantees funding for every parent who chooses to participate, but would instead enroll students only to the extent of funding made available by legislators, rationing access and putting parents on waiting lists when the money ran out.
But limits on enrollment in an ideologically driven program designed to play to the Republican base was never a politically realistic prospect. And, indeed, Sanders has refused to use this tool, insisting that every parent who wants a voucher will get a voucher, no matter the cost.
In essence, she has turned her vouchers program into an entitlement that benefits largely middle-class and higher-income families, with no restraint on the total cost, which was the very scenario Republican legislators sought to prevent.
During the subcommittee hearing, Republican Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, a reliable vouchers supporter, expressed frustration that the cost of the program had not been controlled by the budget.
The Walnut Ridge lawmaker said she wanted to ensure the state wasn’t getting into an area where it has to “make some really tough choices” on what to prioritize.
“We’re fast approaching that,” she said.
Sanders’ finance secretary, Jim Hudson, told legislators that he expects the budget request for vouchers presented to legislators during the upcoming fiscal session will be “310ish,” avoiding the raids on reserve funds seen this year.
However, that’s almost exactly the same amount spent this year and unlikely to cover increases if more students receive vouchers and the state’s per-student funding continues at the same rate.
Revelations by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and other news outlets of questionable spending by homeschool parents enrolled in the program – $600 chicken coops, karate lessons, horseback riding lessons, $2,000 laptops and Shaquille O’Neal gaming chairs – has also started to draw scrutiny from Republican legislators who pride themselves on fiscal conservatism.
During the subcommittee hearing, Republican Sen. Jimmy Hickey got Department of Education officials to make an eyebrow -raising admission that nothing prevents homeschool parents receiving vouchers from buying pricey items, ostensibly for educational purposes, and then returning them and pocketing the money.
In passing Sanders’ vouchers scheme, legislators ignored clear, available evidence that vouchers harm educational outcomes, rather than improving them. They ignored the social and financial impacts of draining away students from public schools, particularly in rural districts. But they won’t be able to ignore a price tag that continues to rise.
The budget session that starts in April will be the first test of how many Republican legislators are coming to their senses on this expensive boondoggle. 
Does Sanders have the political muscle to win this fight? Very likely. 
But the halcyon days of 2023, when legislators asked few questions and got out their rubber stamps to give Sanders everything she wanted, may mercifully be coming to an end.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wooten-1.16.25-1024x679.jpg,,,2026-01-23 06:36:17.226737

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tenessee Lookout)Former Tennessee House staffer Cade Cothren’s hopes of rising from the ashes of political despair took a dousing Thursday when the state’s campaign finance watchdog slapped him with an $80,000 civil penalty for misleading the state about a 2019 political action committee.
Attorneys for Cothren, who received a presidential pardon in December 2025 that cleared him of a separate conviction on federal fraud and bribery convictions, will appeal to an administrative law court or chancery court.
The penalties could make Cothren’s plans to run for the House District 71 seat held by Republican Rep. Kip Capley harder because if he refuses to pay the penalty he would be ineligible.
Timing is a factor, too, because it could take weeks for the Registry to issue an order, then Cothren would have to come up with the money to qualify for the election by the March 10 filing deadline. That is, unless he finds a way to wade through the courts before then. 
Registry chairman wants district attorney investigation of former state staffer’s secret PAC

The Registry of Election Finance issued penalties of $10,000 each for eight violations in connection with Cothren’s secret formation of the Faith Family Freedom Fund political action committee by persuading a former girlfriend to form the PAC and list herself as treasurer so he could run it covertly. The Registry board subpoenaed Cothren in 2022 after the woman, Sydney Friedopfer, testified that in addition to asking her to set up the PAC, Cothren told her to ignore questions from the Registry.
Cothren declined to comply with the subpoena, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and still hasn’t appeared before the board to explain the situation.
The PAC raised and spent about $7,000 in an effort to defeat now-former Rep. Rick Tillis of Lewisburg, who was beaten by Republican Rep. Todd Warner of Chapel Hill, a Cothren supporter. The committee listed a North Carolina restaurateur named Brandon Crawford as the only donor, but during its investigation that started three years ago, the Registry couldn’t turn up such a person.
Instead of showing up to testify, Cothren enlisted the help of Nashville attorneys Rob Peal and Erik Lybeck of Sims Funk for a hearing to argue that the Registry board doesn’t have the authority to penalize a person for inaccuracies about a campaign treasurer. The Registry can assess penalties only against a committee or candidate, and Cothren was neither of those, they said. Additionally, they said that in 2020 there was no definition for a campaign treasurer in state law dealing with the Registry board.
Following changes in state law, any attempt to impose new requirements retroactively would be unconstitutional, they added.
Registry sends Cothren subpoena to AG’s Office after he refuses to testify, claims the Fifth

Peal and Lybeck also raised questions about proper notice and burden of proof.
“Look, this investigation is about a treasurer appointment form filed six years ago related to a political action committee that received a single contribution and spent something in the neighborhood of $7,000,” Peal said.
It might have seemed insignificant when the Registry board dismissed a complaint filed by Tillis’ campaign coordinator alleging illegal collusion. Yet it referred the matter to the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office for a criminal investigation before putting it on hold for three years as Cothren and his former boss, ex-House Speaker Glen Casada fought federal corruption charges. They were convicted on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy in May 2025 but received a presidential pardon that cleared them.
“I also understand from my review of the media stories on this matter and the minutes that some of you may not like Mr. Cothren. You built me a tiny record on that,” Peal said. 
But he said the General Assembly didn’t delegate authority to the Registry to assess penalties against Cothren before making a veiled threat.
“This case, I promise you, is not the test case that you want us to bring in front of the appellate courts to determine” the Registry’s powers, Peal said.
Ultimately, though, Registry members Tom Lawless and Hank Fincher said the board would be “gutted” if it weren’t able to levy penalties against someone who misled the state and violated campaign finance rules.
Lawless pointed out that Friedopher was “clueless” about the matter and didn’t create any bank accounts or raise and spend money. He added that “transparency” is critical to the public.










It means that someone who completely defies the statute, never files anything … never registers for anything, spends all sorts of money, theoretically violated the campaign limits as well, we don’t have any authority. I don’t think that’s what was intended by the legislature.


– Henry Fincher, Tennessee Registry of Election Finance


Registry and ethics executive director Bill Young also told Peal and Lybeck during the hearing that under the 2020 law, which he read, treasurers also were considered liable for campaign activities, presenting a bit of a stumbling block for their argument.
The board’s final decision, in which it determined it gave proper notice for the hearing, found that Cothren was the political action committee and broke numerous state laws. In fact, he never contradicted the woman’s sworn testimony, and neither did his new attorneys, they said.
Cothren also told an FBI agent when his apartment was raided in 2022 that he formed the Faith Family Freedom Fund.
“It means that someone who completely defies the statute, never files anything … never registers for anything, spends all sorts of money, theoretically violated the campaign limits as well, we don’t have any authority,” said Fincher, an attorney and former Democratic lawmaker. “I don’t think that’s what was intended by the legislature. I don’t think that’s what the plain text of the statute is.”
Despite the board’s unanimity, if history teaches us anything, this case could drag on like a long, hot summer or, if the forecasters are correct, a foot-deep snowstorm.
Leaving the past behind
The new owners of Sen. Brent Taylor’s funeral homes in the Collierville area are distancing themselves from him and sent out a statement this week letting people know he is no longer connected with the company in any way.
“As part of our commitment to serving Collierville with compassion, professionalism and neutrality, we recognize the importance of clarity for the families who rely on us,” the company said, noting it is rebranding the company. “We understand that recent public statements and political commentary made by the former owner do not reflect the values, mission, or beliefs of our current leadership.”
Amid mixed reviews, Taylor strongly supports the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis as part of a Safe Task Force ordered by President Donald Trump, with support from Gov. Bill Lee. The Republican senator also supports creation of a state-appointed board with authority over the Memphis Shelby County School Board and has been calling for removal of District Attorney Steve Mulroy for a couple of years. In addition, he’s known for making remarks that some might find pithy but others consider demeaning.
A Fox 13 Memphis report contained a statement from Taylor in which he said he sold his business four years ago for millions of dollars and signed a non-disparagement clause.
“So, I will enjoy the money the out-of-state private equity firm paid me while I continue to Make Memphis Matter by Making Memphis Safe. The community can determine if they think the new owners run those businesses as well as I did.” 
Taylor added that the company is off to a good start because the check to him “cleared the bank.”
Collecting the money, after all, is the most important thing. Always be closing.
“Don’t do it, Ron!”
During the great – or not so great – voucher vote of 2019, House lawmakers called out to Republican Rep. Ron Gant not to flip his vote and support the bill. “Don’t do it, Ron!” they cried.
To his credit, he didn’t.
Just a year earlier, he dropped another great idea, renaming the Cordell Hull Building, meant to honor the nation’s longest-serving secretary of state, for former Gov. Winfield Dunn, whom he considers a political hero.

Dunn, though, said to this reporter that he asked Gant not to do it.
Following a short news report, Gant decided against sponsoring the legislation and laid the blame on this reporter for killing his bill. It wasn’t pretty.
Now comes a plan by Gant to name the old Legislative Plaza and War Memorial Plaza being renovated across the street from the Capitol for Dunn, according to the Tennessee Journal.
The former governor, who died in September 2024, is no longer around to express humility. 
The late Sen. Douglas Henry and former Rep. Bill Purcell of Nashville sponsored the bill naming the War Memorial Plaza in 1995 saying it was done to “appropriately honor the memory of those brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to preserve the precious freedoms of democracy and to ensure the freedom and prosperity of future generations,” the Tennessee Journal reported.
No doubt, Dunn recognized his duty, signing up for the Navy at age 17 and serving in the Pacific in World War II before becoming a reserve lieutenant in the Air Force. Yet he lived to the ripe age of 97, which is pretty incredible for someone who fought in the war and served as governor.
The question is whether lawmakers will once again holler, “Don’t do it, Ron!”
“School’s out forever”
The legislature declared Thursday that lawmakers won’t hold committee meetings or floor sessions next week in light of the snow storm expected to hit Nashville Saturday and Sunday. The House could hold some meetings Wednesday.
Will lawmakers who don’t go home sled down Capitol Hill again, endangering their lives? Will bourbon be served in the legislative library? The bigger question is: What will we do to fill the void in our lives?

We need to get ahead of them by putting in place protections for the state's energy and water resources. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Wisconsin stands at a pivotal moment.
Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and hyperscale data centers are arriving quickly, bringing enormous demand for electricity and water. The real question is not whether these investments will come, but how we manage them and who pays the costs if we get it wrong.
Families want affordable bills. Businesses want reliable power. Communities want clean water and economic opportunity. We need a  common-sense approach to guide how we respond to rapid data center growth.
An unprecedented load and a real affordability risk
The scale of proposed data centers is unlike anything Wisconsin has seen.
Just two projects, one in Port Washington and another in Mount Pleasant, have requested nearly four gigawatts of electricity combined. That is more power than all Wisconsin households use today.
Meeting this demand will require massive investments in power plants, transmission lines, substations, pipelines and water infrastructure. But under Wisconsin’s current utility model, these costs are not paid only by the companies driving demand. They are instead spread across all of us who pay electric bills, including families, farms, and small businesses that won’t benefit from data center power.
For small businesses operating on thin margins, even modest increases in electric or water rates affect hiring, pricing and long-term viability. In rural communities with fewer customers sharing infrastructure costs, the impact can be even more severe.
This concern is already becoming real. Utilities are citing data center demand to justify new methane gas plants and delaying coal plant retirements. Utilities doubling down on fossil fuels should give every one of us pause.
Why costly gas is the wrong answer
Building new methane gas plants for data centers would lock customers into decades of fuel price volatility, even though cleaner options have become cheaper and faster to deploy.
Wind, solar and battery storage can come online far more quickly than fossil fuel plants and without exposing families and businesses to unpredictable fuel costs. Battery storage costs alone have fallen nearly 90% over the past decade. 
Across the country, these tools are replacing methane gas plants in states as different as Texas and California.
There is also a serious risk that we will pay higher bills for decades, even when data centers stop using those methane gas plants. In Nevada, a major utility has acknowledged that only about 15% of proposed data centers are likely to be built. When speculative projects fall through, all of us are left to pay for infrastructure we actually never needed.
This is not ideology. It is basic financial risk management, and basic fairness.
Clean energy is the lowest-cost path
Wisconsin policymakers and elected officials need to put guardrails in place to protect everyday residents from the AI bubble that’s threatening the state. The core principle should be that data centers operate on 100% clean energy, not as a slogan, but because it is the lowest-cost and lowest-risk option over time.
A smart framework would require developers to:

Supply at least 30% of their power from on-site and Wisconsin-based renewable energy
Offset additional demand through energy efficiency, demand response – at least 25% of peak capacity and smart grid flexibility
Participate fully in utility efficiency and renewable energy programs rather than opting out
Each data center project should require a legally binding Community Benefit Agreement that clearly defines community protections and benefits, negotiated among developers, local governments, neighborhood-based organizations and underserved communities

This approach reduces peak demand, lowers infrastructure costs and protects existing customers while allowing data centers to advance.
Major companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta have already publicly committed to operating on carbon-free energy. We need to hold them to that. Wisconsin risks losing our competitive advantage if we default to gas-heavy solutions instead of offering clean, flexible grids.
Water is a non-negotiable constraint
Energy is not the only concern. Water matters just as much.
A single hyperscale data center can use millions of gallons of water per day, either directly for cooling or indirectly through power generation. In communities with limited water systems, that can crowd out agricultural use and raise residents’ water bills.
Wisconsin should require closed-loop cooling systems, full accounting of direct and indirect water use, and ongoing public reporting to ensure local water supplies are protected.
A practical path forward
Wisconsin does not have to choose between economic growth and affordability. We can do both if we insist on clear guardrails.
That means requiring data centers to pay the full cost of service, powering growth with clean energy first, and protecting water resources and ratepayers from unnecessary risk.
Data centers are coming. The question is whether Wisconsin families and small businesses will be partners in that growth or be left paying higher bills for decades to come.
If we choose smart clean power over costly gas, Wisconsin can lead.

← Jan. 15–21
Jan. 22–28

This story is part of Colorado at 150.


The column that followed, which purported to be a dispatch from “Nov. —, 188–,” told the fictional history of a future presidential campaign won by the “arch-traitor” Jefferson Davis.
“The ‘On to Washington’ that Davis proclaimed from the capital of the Confederacy in 1861, for all the blood that was spilt to prevent it, is at last, after many years, realized,” the News wrote.
The unusual editorial was occasioned by the biggest national political controversy of January 1876: In the U.S. House of Representatives, lawmakers were debating whether to grant amnesty to about 750 of the most senior ex-Confederate officials, nullifying their disqualification from office-holding under the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment.
Most rank-and-file Confederates had received similar relief in a series of general amnesty measures a few years earlier. The details of these amnesty measures, and the widespread fear they could lead to a President Jefferson Davis, would be raised again in Colorado politics 147 years later, in the trial over an attempt to bar President Donald Trump from the state’s 2024 ballot under the insurrection clause, an effort that was ultimately blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The House’s 1876 measure failed, falling short of the two-thirds majority for amnesty required under the 14th Amendment. But the broadside from the News — published by William Byers, a leading figure in the Colorado Territory’s dominant Republican Party — reflected the growing anxiety among GOP leaders about the party’s souring electoral fortunes and the future of Reconstruction in the South.
The fact that an issue like amnesty for high-ranking ex-Confederates had been taken up by Congress at all was a sure sign of the Democratic Party’s resurgence. In the 1874 midterms, Democrats had captured the House majority for the first time since the Civil War. With the country still reeling from the Panic of 1873 and President Ulysses S. Grant’s administration plagued by scandal, the opposition party hoped to follow it up with victory in the 1876 presidential election.
Colorado’s admission into the Union ahead of that election was an overtly partisan political maneuver by Republicans, who felt assured of the new state’s three electoral votes. In early 1875, the GOP-controlled Congress had passed a Colorado statehood act even as it defeated a similar measure for Democratic-leaning New Mexico, which wouldn’t be admitted as a state until 1912.
But Democrats had even made inroads in Colorado, where voters in 1874 had elected Democrat Thomas Patterson, an Irish-born Denver lawyer, as the territory’s non-voting delegate to Congress, the first Democratic electoral victory after 14 years of Republican control of the lone delegate seat.

Partisan conflict in the territory
Though Americans in the 19th century were often bitterly divided along party lines, the nature of partisan conflict was less ideological than it would later become. Differences of opinion on the major social and economic questions of the day — tariffs, monetary policy, corporate regulation, suffrage, temperance and more — existed within both parties, making partisan affiliation in the 1870s “as much about identity as issues,” writes historian Richard White.
Especially in the relatively small and remote Colorado Territory, community ties and patronage networks often mattered more to party loyalists than Republicans’ support for civil rights in the South or Democrats’ populist attacks on the national banks.
“These broad general stances … were only partly what made people Democrats or Republicans,” White writes in “The Republic for Which It Stands,” a history of Reconstruction and the Gilded Age. “Nurtured by the blood of the Civil War and deep ethnic, religious, and regional loyalties, parties demanded a richer diet than principles could provide.”
Denver, by far the Colorado Territory’s largest city, was a Republican stronghold, still controlled by the “Denver Ring” of influential businessmen, including Byers, the Rocky Mountain News proprietor, who in the late 1860s had triumphed over the “Golden Gang” to make Denver the territory’s capital and main railroad hub. Republican control of territorial offices and civil service positions under the Grant administration further solidified the loyalties of Colorado’s nascent GOP political establishment.
Southern Colorado, with its large Hispanic population, was solidly Democratic, an association strengthened by the party’s generally pro-Catholic stance in an era when strains of nativism and anti-Catholicism still ran through the Republican Party. Three Hispanic delegates to Colorado’s constitutional convention — Casimiro Barela, Jesús María García, and Agapito Vigil — had been elected as Democrats from Las Animas and Bent counties.
The Hispanos of the San Luis Valley had been the first non-native people to settle Colorado, traveling north from New Mexico to found towns like Costilla and San Luis a decade before the Pikes Peak gold rush kicked off in 1859. But since the territory’s organization in 1860 its southern counties had felt neglected and discriminated against by the government in Denver. Some Hispanos even unsuccessfully petitioned for three San Luis Valley counties to be reannexed by the New Mexico Territory.
Laws in three languages

During the 1860s, a decade in which Hispanos in southern Colorado frequently found themselves targeted by land grabs, intimidation and mob violence, Spanish-speaking delegates to the territorial assembly had fought to require the use of an interpreter in legislative sessions and the translation of all territorial laws.
They succeeded, despite objections voiced in newspaper editorials that frequently veered into abject racism, as well as the more genteel prejudices of men like Byers, who, though he advocated “treat(ing) our Spanish citizens in a fair and friendly way,” also wished for them “to become Americanized as rapidly as possible.”
At the Jan. 25, 1876, meeting of the constitutional convention, García moved to consider a resolution introduced earlier in the month by Barela, amending it slightly to enshrine in the new constitution a requirement that the “General Assembly … at each session, provide for the publication of all laws, general and special, in English and Spanish.”
Frederick J. Ebert, a Republican delegate from Denver and a member of the city’s growing German-American population, moved to further amend the proposal, “to provide for the printing of all laws in the German language, as well as English and Spanish.”
The resolution would be referred to a committee and undergo further revision, but the constitution adopted later in 1876 retained a requirement for Spanish and German translation until the year 1900, making Colorado “the only state which had at any one time parallel editions of session laws in three languages.”

Cockfighting enthusiasts in St. Landry Parish want to challenge a state law that outlawed the practice, but their efforts were dealt a significant setback Thursday.
Attorney General Liz Murrill refused to issue an opinion on whether the state’s cockfighting ban was unconstitutional. Dozens of local fans of the fowl fracases  convinced the St. Landry Parish Council earlier this month to take the issue to the state’s top attorney, KATC-TV reported. 
“It’s the long-standing policy of the Louisiana Department of Justice not to issue opinions on the constitutionality of State laws. Cockfighting remains illegal in Louisiana,” Murrill said Thursday in a statement.
Cockflighting was deemed illegal in Louisiana starting in 2008, making it the last of the 50 states to ban the practice. It is against the law to attend a cockfight, pay admission to view one or bet on the outcome. Violators can be punished with fines reaching $500 and prison time up to six months.
Proponents of poultry pugilism consider the pastime part of their cultural heritage and say it would bring jobs and tax revenue to St. Landry.
Jeff Dorson, executive director of the Humane Society of Louisiana, takes a different stance. He told KATC cockfighting is cruel, violent and should no longer be acceptable. 
“Why would anyone think it’s OK to put two animals together with knives attached to their legs, where they fight, bleed, and suffer — all so someone can walk away with a few dollars in their pocket? That’s no way to live,” Dorson said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)On Friday, Jan.16, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered Rio Grande in Nitro, West Virginia, allegedly through the ceiling. They took eight workers, including a pregnant woman. Read that sentence again, slowly. 
Perhaps an action like that doesn’t feel surprising anymore. It’s just another blip in the news cycle. But remember, this is NOT ordinary. This is NOT normal. This is not what it looks like to be living in a healthy, functioning democracy. This is unchecked state-sanctioned violence.
I’ve spoken with people who were there when ICE came and people who were there shortly after.  People watched their coworkers and friends get taken away. Witnesses say agents kicked in a door and trashed the owner’s house, which is behind the restaurant. The St. Albans and Nitro Police Departments also assisted ICE. One worker shared that ICE agents were laughing as they carried out their raid.
Last Friday, I shared on social media a simple way to support Rio Grande. That triggered hundreds of shares and an influx of comments, most of which were positive. Others said things like, “Come here legally, and they have nothing to hide,” or “If ya not here legal, then GTFO! ICE ICE baby!”
It’s tempting to turn ICE operations into a debate about laws, to treat them like an abstract policy question. Level-headed debate over policy is fair. But before we can have that debate, we must tell the truth: that ICE’s cruelty is the point.


Know your rights
What you can do as a bystander during immigration enforcement actions


When ICE climbs up on a restaurant roof, looking to make entry, they’re not just seeking to make a simple arrest. They are making a statement. They are sending a message to the entire community: “We can enter anywhere. We can take anyone. We can do it whenever we want. And you cannot stop us.”
When ICE trashes a home, that is not collateral damage. It’s also part of their message. When agents laugh while workers are detained, that laughter is not a minor detail. It is the moral center of the story. 
ICE agents’ laughter reveals what their operation wants to accomplish,  and it isn’t protecting our community. It is about humiliating people. There is a type of laughter that oozes out when someone is dehumanized so thoroughly that their fear becomes entertainment. This cruel type of laughter is not new. It appears in jails, in slave markets, in concentration camps and detention centers. It appears throughout the long history of state violence dressed up as “law and order.”
People keep saying, “It’s just the law.” But legality and justice are not the same. Laws have always been used to justify unspeakable things. 
And many of the people ICE is detaining — including undocumented people — have not committed a crime. While entering the U.S. without being inspected and admitted can be a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the circumstances, many undocumented immigrants do not enter our country illegally. They enter legally but overstay, work without authorization, drop out of school or violate the conditions of their visas in some other way. These undocumented individuals are committing civil offenses, not criminal ones. “Civil offense” is the category under which things like parking violations, lawsuits and breach of contract fall. Unless you think law enforcement should come through your roof because your meter ran out, then ICE’s recent tactics are not appropriate. 
ICE raids like the one at Rio Grande do not simply remove workers — they scare communities into compliance. They teach neighbors not to look out for one another, to turn a blind eye. They teach coworkers to stay silent. They teach people that the powerful can do what they want, and the rest of us are supposed to accept it as a normal part of maintaining law and order. 
This is how authoritarianism gains ground: not through one dramatic law, but through repeated public humiliations that change what people believe they can successfully resist. May we be unteachable students.
And may we speak honestly about the role local police play in this story. When local law enforcement provides crowd control so federal agents can carry out a raid that involves climbing on roofs, entering through ceilings, trashing homes, detaining pregnant women and mocking people while they are taken, local institutions are not “keeping the peace.” 
When local law enforcement officers participate in an action that terrorizes a local business that regularly provides them with free meals, (Yes! Rio Grande did that.) we have to ask who they are actually protecting. Because it isn’t the community members whose taxes fund their salaries, whose labor cooks their free meals. Last week, St. Albans and Nitro police placed a stamp of local legitimacy on an act of federal overreach that should shock the conscience.
And there is another temptation we need to resist: the temptation to reserve our attention solely to those who are detained. The truth is that actions like this harm entire communities. They harm the restaurant owner whose home was trashed. They harm the families who will not sleep tonight because they do not know what will happen to their loved ones. They harm coworkers who carry the trauma of watching their friends be taken. They harm children who learn early the sick lesson that some neighbors can be hunted and taken without impunity.
There is a phrase used in many faith traditions: that human beings are sacred. In the language of my own Christian tradition, we would say that every person bears the image of God. If you are not Christian, you may name it differently: human dignity, inherent worth, the irreducible value of a person. But every major moral and religious tradition agrees that people are not disposable.
I believe that people are not disposable. 
I refuse the logic that says workers can be hunted and mocked just because this administration says so. I refuse the framing that treats fear as an acceptable tool of governance. I refuse to live in a society where armed agents can come through the ceiling of a restaurant and be celebrated for it.  And I will not be gaslit into thinking I didn’t see what I saw or that people’s eyewitness accounts hold no weight. What about you? 
Last week in our community, eight workers were taken. Our response cannot be denial. It cannot be hand-wringing. It cannot be “both sides.” Our response must be solidarity. We must bear witness to the truth. We must show up for the families and coworkers left behind. We must demand legal support, pastoral care, material support, and public accountability. We must demand that local institutions stop participating in these raids.
We must remember that the only future worth living in is one where no one is hunted at their workplace, where no one’s home is trashed as an intimidation tactic, where no pregnant body is treated as collateral and where no one’s fear is met with laughter. Because if we allow this to become normal, we will become something less than human.

Dan McKee unveiled his proposed fiscal 2027 budget, the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce sent out an email blasting the governor’s support of a millionaire’s tax. 
An hour later, the Working Families Party came out with its own criticism of the governor’s income tax plan, faulting McKee for “leaving too much money on the table.”
The familiar debate over raising taxes on top earners, as Massachusetts did in 2023, has returned in full force to Smith Hill, with even more at stake thanks to federal funding cuts under the Trump administration.
Already, accusations over false information are flying as progressives and business leaders unleash contradicting narratives over the economic implications, with McKee reluctantly sandwiched in the middle. 
McKee’s plan to add a 3% surtax on state income over $1 million would make Rhode Island’s top income tax rate second in New England, behind Massachusetts, generating $67 million in revenue fiscal 2027, with $135 million in revenue by fiscal 2028. Roughly 2,300 Rhode Island millionaires would see their taxes rise from 5.99% to 8.99%, with 5,500 nonresident millionaires who work or otherwise have tax liabilities in the state also affected, according to analysis by the state budget office.
Massachusetts voters in 2022 approved a ballot measure adding a 4% surtax on income over $1 million. Since the millionaires tax, also known as the Fair Share Amendment, took effect in 2023, the Commonwealth has brought in more than $2 billion in revenue from the tax each year, exceeding estimates.
But it wasn’t until the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which threatens to decimate critical state funding and social service programs, that McKee’s administration reconsidered. 
“H.R.1 really forced our hand on this,” Brian Daniels, director for the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget said during a budget briefing with reporters on Jan. 15.
A matter of fairness 
Progressive lawmakers also see devastation down the road from federal budget cuts, which is why they view McKee’s pitch as falling short. 
“At a time when families are choosing between groceries and rent, when seniors are skipping out on prescriptions and vulnerable people are being pushed out of their health care, we cannot just shrug and say ‘that’s the way it is,’” said Rep. Brandon Potter, a Cranston Democrat.
Potter was among two dozen Democratic lawmakers who unveiled a more aggressive and expansive set of wealth and income taxes at a State House press conference Thursday. The four-bill package has not been formally introduced in the Rhode Island General Assembly yet. 
The “Fair Share for Rhode Island package” applies an extra 3% surtax to income over $640,000 — representing the top 1% of earners in the state. The package also includes three new taxes for residents and companies:

 A 1% charge on state filers’ intangible assets like stocks, bonds and annuities worth over $25 million
 A 4% tax on “passive income” like capital gains, dividends, some kinds of rent and royalty payments
A tiered tax system of up to 7.5% on local advertising from global companies with at least $1 million in gross revenue. A version of the digital advertising tax was included in McKee’s fiscal 2026 budget plan, but failed to advance amid legal concerns. It was not included in the governor’s fiscal 2027 spending proposal.

“Otra vez, estamos acquí,” — in English, “here we are again” — Rep. Karen Alzate said at Thursday’s event. Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat, has sponsored legislation increasing state income taxes on top earners every year since 2020. 
The “Fair Share” package would bring in at least $650 million in its first full year of implementation, according to analysis from various federal tax and legal sources cited by local progressives. Preliminary estimates do not include a tax on digital advertising companies, revenue for which has not been calculated.
Roughly 5,700 tax filers would pay an 8.99% tax on income over $640,000, bringing in $200 million to state coffers. Taxing financial assets over $25 million would generate another $300 million; the number of filers affected has not been calculated, although there are 243 people who have more than $50 million in collective wealth, according to research from the State Revenue Alliance. The wealth proceeds tax would generate $144.4 million, collected from 21,000 filers, two-thirds report over $1 million in annual passive income.
The number of tax filers affected by multiple tax increases under the four-bill package was not immediately available.
Mind the gap
Progressive lawmakers framed the package as a way to “right the state’s upside-down tax system,” which has capped personal income taxes at 5.99% since 2010. Under the three-tier system, anyone who earns more than $186,450 in the 2026 tax year pays the same rate.

Sen. Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat, offered a hypothetical comparison between a Newport heiress and a public school teacher. Each might bring in $50,000 in paid income in a given year, paying the same taxes despite their drastically different financial circumstances.
The gap between the wealthy and the working class is posed to widen further under federal budget cuts that will kick tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders off Medicaid, food assistance, or both.
“Without raising revenue and backfilling these cuts, people’s lives will be lost, make no mistake,” said Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat.
Higher taxes on the wealthy aims to cushion the blow, funding child care, education, public transit and health care, proponents argued. And teachers, nurses, janitors and working families would not sacrifice any more of their income to state taxes.
But local mom and pop shops might. Laurie White, president of the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce, and Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC), warned that because most of the state’s small businesses are pass-through entities, increasing income taxes on their owners will cut the money available for hiring, wage growth and business expansion.










Without raising revenue and backfilling these cuts, people’s lives will be lost, make no mistake.


– Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat


“A ‘tax the rich’ policy is, in practice, a tax on many of the home-grown businesses that form the backbone of Rhode Island’s economy,” White and DiBiase wrote in a joint commentary published on Jan. 4 on the chamber’s website.
Democratic lawmakers called the opinion piece “misleading” at the Thursday press conference. 
“The notion that there’s some small mom and pop business corner store making profits of $1 million or more, and yet struggling so much that this tax is going to put them under or damage the state economy, is hard to understand,” said Alan Krinsky, policy and research director for the Economic Progress Institute.
Small businesses stand to benefit from more aggressive taxes on the wealthy, which would put money back in consumers’ pockets to spend at local restaurants and retailers, Alzate said. 
White did not immediately return calls for comment Thursday, but the Providence Chamber sent out a second email blast after the progressive press conference to reiterate opposition to increases in income taxes.
Playing catch up?
Increasing taxes on top earners would worsen the state’s already unfriendly tax environment for businesses and some residents, DiBiase said.
“We’re relatively uncompetitive right now with respect to taxes,” DiBiase said. “I don’t think we should be going in this direction and making things worse.”
Rhode Island is already considered the 11th most progressive tax state nationwide, based on the percentage point difference between the highest and lowest tax rate, according to analysis by RIPEC.
Meanwhile, the Ocean State continues to fall to the bottom of the heap in state business-climate rankings.
While Massachusetts has not seen top earners flee and businesses fold since increasing taxes on top earners, its ability to attract and retain employers and people of wealth far exceeds Rhode Island’s, DiBiase said.
Hasbro Inc., CEO Chris Cocks cited the Commonwealth’s talent pool and burgeoning business scene as reasons for the Pawtucket company’s move to Boston’s Seaport by the end of the year.
Rep. Rebecca Kislak, a Providence Democrat, saw Hasbro leaving the state as a reason to increase taxes.
“We heard a lot last year about how we couldn’t pass laws like this because we were afraid that companies like Hasbro would move out of state,” Kislak said during the press conference. “We see that companies like Hasbro, and in fact, Hasbro, moved out of state for the better infrastructure that taxes in neighboring Massachusetts are able to support.”
Laura Hart, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, defended the governor’s proposal in an emailed statement on Thursday, describing it as a “real millionaire’s tax.”
“It is unknown what negative impacts a much lower threshold for increased taxation could have on both Rhode Island families and small businesses,” Hart said. “A lower threshold would also put Rhode Island out of line — and at a competitive disadvantage — with Massachusetts.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson were noncommittal. 
“When the legislation is introduced, it will undergo the usual thorough and public committee review process for consideration on its merits,” Greg Pare, a spokesperson for Lawson, said in an emailed response on behalf of both leaders.

(Getty Images)Colorado is at a moment of real opportunity when it comes to jobs and economic growth. As demand for digital infrastructure accelerates, data centers are emerging as one of the most significant job creators tied to the modern economy, particularly for skilled trades and technical professionals. For Colorado workers and families, this represents sustained, high-quality work that supports their ability to thrive and care for themselves and their families.
Recent coverage suggesting that the “jobs picture is mixed” when it comes to data centers in Colorado misses a critical reality of how our economy and our workforce actually function. The idea that data centers “only” create jobs during construction is not just incomplete. It undervalues thousands of skilled workers, dismisses years of high-paying employment, and misunderstands how the trades work in the first place.
Data centers create jobs at every stage of their lifecycle — construction, operations and long-term community support. Building these facilities requires large teams of electricians, engineers, technicians, and skilled tradespeople.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Let’s take a look at the numbers. It’s estimated that each large scale data center employs as many as 1,500 construction jobs for up to three years, creating on average $140,000 in total wages and benefits per worker per year, and up to 100 long-term positions for maintenance and other projects. Just six new large data centers could generate more than $2.6 billion in compensation for Colorado workers and their families. Once operational, data centers employ highly trained professionals in fields like IT, network engineering, facility management, and energy systems.
That means one data center project can generate over $428 million in total compensation during a two-year build, and more than $640 million over a three-year build. Multiply that impact across multiple facilities, and you are talking about billions of dollars flowing directly into the paychecks, pensions and health plans of working families.
A steady job paying $70 an hour is anything but a mixed picture to workers in this challenging economy. Yet some critics wave this away by pointing out that once construction is complete, a data center may employ fewer than 100 permanent workers. That framing fundamentally misunderstands the construction industry and, frankly, comes across as dismissive of the people who work tirelessly to build the infrastructure that forms the backbone of our communities.
Construction is not supposed to last forever. Tradespeople move from project to project, often over multiple years. Suggesting that three years of steady, well-compensated work somehow “doesn’t count” because it has an end date ignores how these careers are structured and how families across Colorado make a living.
And when it comes to data centers, the work doesn’t stop once construction is complete. Data centers require ongoing maintenance, repairs and upgrades, employing up to 100 permanent service and maintenance workers per facility. Think of the impact even 100 good-paying jobs can have in places like Pueblo and Craig, where closing power plants are leaving many workers without a way to support their families.
Of course, the impact of data centers goes far beyond jobs alone.
These projects bring massive investment into local infrastructure, upgrading roads, utilities, broadband and energy systems that many communities desperately need. Not to mention that they generate substantial property tax revenue that supports local schools, public safety and other public services, often in rural areas that have lost industries that once formed the backbone of their communities.
At a time when so many Colorado families are grappling with a cost-of-living crisis, a shaky economy, and an unforgiving job market, data centers represent an opportunity to invest in people and places that are too often overlooked. This isn’t about choosing between short-term and long-term jobs. It’s about recognizing the real value of skilled labor and understanding that large-scale infrastructure projects create lasting economic ripples. Data centers don’t just create servers. They create careers and economic opportunity.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)As Virginians prepare for this weekend’s winter storm that is forecast to blanket the region with inches of snow, freezing rain and sleet, consumers are asked to report suspected cases of price gouging to state authorities.
Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s Thursday afternoon declaration of a state of emergency due to the anticipated severe winter weather triggered Virginia’s anti-gouging statutes, which protect consumers from paying “outrageously high prices” for essential goods during an emergency.
Protected items and services include water, ice, food, generators, batteries, home repair materials and services, and tree removal services.
The office of Attorney General Jay Jones said shoppers who suspect they are victims of price gouging can call the Consumer Protection Hotline at (800)-552-9963, email consumer@oag.state.va.us, or download a complaint form. 
Federal agencies have warned that price gouging increases in the wake of natural disasters and Jones’ office gave guidance on spotting unfairly inflated costs.
“The basic test for determining if a price is unconscionable is whether the post-disaster price grossly exceeds the price charged for the same good or services during the 10 days immediately prior to the disaster,” the office stated in a release.
The Attorney General will investigate complaints, except those concerning gasoline or motor fuel prices. Those are handled by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
Virginia officials are projecting snowfall to begin Saturday evening and end Monday morning, with freezing temperatures expected to continue through Thursday.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)An effort to provide k-12 students with free breakfast is again moving forward in Virginia’s legislature. The bill has advanced a few years in a row but fell short of becoming law due to some legislators’ concerns over cost.
Senate Bill 4 by Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, and House Bill 96 by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, narrows the scope of free meals provided to students to just breakfast, and would have the state reimburse reimburse each school for the breakfasts they provide.
After clearing the Senate and Education Committee unanimously on Thursday, it will be further deliberated in the Finance and Appropriations Committee. Bennett-Parker’s companion bill has also been advancing with bipartisan support. 
If passed, the measures would bring Virginia in line with other states. Arkansas passed a similar law last year and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster included language to create a free breakfast program in his recent state budget. Prior to its passage in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted it as a legislative priority.
In an interview with The Mercury Thursday afternoon, Roem jokingly referred to Arkansas as a “blue progressive bastion,” given that Huckabee Sanders is a Republican and with the Republican-majority state championing the issue, Roem suspects bipartisan support for her bill can grow within Virginia’s legislature. 
It’s also part of state Democratic lawmakers’ priorities to address affordability issues — a matter that won them gains in the legislature and the governorship of Abigail Spanberger. 
Roem has carried some iteration of this bill for several years but thinks the bill has a good chance of passing this year. It’s a stepping stone to a larger priority, she said. 
“To be clear, I am using the School Breakfast bill to eventually get to breakfast and lunch,” she said, adding  that  she plans to introduce a free school lunch version next year. 
The goal to provide free lunch for students is “still super important” said Sarah Steely, director of No Kid Hungry Virginia. 
Steely, who has advocated for Roem’s previous bills, noted how the higher cost of providing free school meals in Roem’s previous bills had been a hurdle for many legislators. A focus on breakfast this year, she believes, will be more attainable while they work towards the free lunch bill.
A 2025 survey commissioned by Steely’s organization showed that 45% of respondents claimed their debt has increased in the past year due to rising costs of food. 
In the past year, 65% of respondents with families reported choosing between “buying enough nutritious food and affording other essentials, like paying for gas or transportation, utilities, rent or mortgage payments, health care for themselves or a child, education expenses and saving for retirement,” the survey noted.  
Inflation at large has strained households across the country, but Steely emphasized that middle-income and lower-income families are feeling it harder. The Federal Reserve recently indicated sticky inflation through consumer price rises. Inflation rates that were higher during the COVID-19 pandemic and had started trending down since 2022 have begun  creeping back up. 
This rising cost of living, Steely said, means having free breakfast can help families with school-age children stretch their dollars a little further. 
Steely emphasized that breakfast nourishes children and boosts their ability to focus, and the free breakfast measure can help parents make ends meet. 
“I really do think about this through the lens of supporting our parents and caregivers,” she said. “We can make their lives easier, and that is reason enough to do this bill.”

A class action lawsuit alleging that the Virginia Department of Corrections has violated its “Step Down” program by arbitrarily keeping people confined solitarily for long periods of time will be allowed to move forward, a federal district judge ruled this week. 
While Virginia does not have what is colloquially referred to as “solitary confinement,” Virginia law does have “restorative housing.” This is when incarcerated people are placed in restrictive or isolated housing, typically for safety or punishment reasons due to behavior issues. 
The Step Down program is a special type of programming for people placed in solitary housing, meant as an incentive to help them transition back into general population quarters. ACLU’s Thorpe v. VADOC case alleges that in practice, the program lacks transparency.
“Because the committee of prison staff that reviews their conduct meets in secret and does not document the rationale for its decisions, people in the program are not given the opportunity to know why they are kept in the Step-Down Program, much less respond or adjust their behavior,” an ACLU press release explained. 
After Del. Holly Seibold, D- Fairfax, and Sen. Mike Jones, D-Chesterfield, each visited Red Onion last year, they said they saw people in restorative housing unable to participate in legally-required out-of-cell time. Seibold worried that this sort of treatment could further exacerbate someone’s behavioral issues or lead to poor mental health. 
“Solitary confinement will damage even the most resilient of minds,” Seibold said in 2025.  “I can’t even imagine myself being in there for more than a few days and being able to remain stable.” 
With the recent ruling, the  litigation that was filed in 2019 can finally proceed to trial.
In recent years, incarcerated people and their families have been outspoken about concerns of racism, abuse, retaliation and misuse of restorative housing.
A state watchdog report found several of the claims “unsubstantiated,” but did not rule out racism or retaliation from among inmates’ experiences. The probe, however, was narrow in scope, as it focused on allegations stemming from a handful of inmates who’d burned themselves in late 2024. 
The investigation, conducted by Virignia’s Corrections Ombudsman, was made possible after state lawmakers created the position in 2024 to focus on oversight of prisons. The reports of inmates burning themselves either in protest or seeking transfer to another facility prompted the ombudsman to prioritize the investigation shortly after taking the job. She then spent a few months hiring additional staff before the team could conduct it. 
Published this month, the probe was “limited to relevant circumstances as specified in the complaints,” the report stated. 
But due to the information ACLU has gathered in its seven-year case against VADOC, attorney Vishal Agraharkar said that the ombudsman “will have to conduct a thorough, transparent, and far more sweeping investigation than this.”
In the meantime, with their case deemed merited, its details could emerge through the trial process before judgement is made. 
 New lawsuit alleges withholding of earned sentence-trimming credits for inmates

Virginia has not had parole since the mid-1990’s, and a relatively new law called Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits is a way that people who meet certain good behavior benchmarks can trim time behind bars off their sentences. In two new lawsuits ACLU Virginia filed in federal court, the group alleges that VADOC has unlawfully withheld credits that people have earned. 
It’s not the first time VADOC has been taken to court over the matter. The Virginia Supreme Court previously found the department kept people behind bars unlawfully. 
“Just because VDOC doesn’t like the law as it’s written doesn’t mean it can go rogue and make its own,” Agraharkar said. 
State statute dictates that people can begin earning the credits as soon as they start their incarceration and have a final conviction order. However, the suit points to a VADOC policy wherein people do not begin earning the credits until the department calculates their projected release date. 
This process can take months, meaning a person’s incarceration can take longer, and the ACLU argues it is “wasting taxpayer dollars” when people are incarcerated when they should not be. 
Despite becoming law in 2020 under previous Gov. Ralph Northam, Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits had a delayed enactment that later was stalled for another few years by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
The credits were not fully implemented until 2024, before facing fresh scrutiny from both Youngkin and former Attorney General Jason Miyares. 
VDOC has faced  three previous, successful challenges concerning its application of the credits.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy delivered his eighth and final State of the State address on Thursday to a joint session of the Alaska State Legislature, touting the accomplishments of his term and promising continued momentum, particularly for large-scale resource development.
“Even though it’s my last year, there is no slowing down,” he said, and promised to work with legislators to advance policies in the spirit of Alaska’s independence and resilience.
In a nearly 80 minute speech, Dunleavy gave wide-ranging remarks on his administration’s initiatives over the last seven years, from reducing crime to improving reading scores. He touched on economic and workforce development, as well as the advancement of mining, oil and gas projects, like the proposed Alaska LNG gas pipeline project from the North Slope to Cook Inlet. 
On Thursday, Dunleavy shared only a few details on a promised new state fiscal plan to help balance declining state oil revenues and pay for his proposed $7.75 billion draft budget this year. He said he plans to introduce a fiscal package in the next week, as well as bills focused on job training, child care and affordable housing. 
Dunleavy did not mention a seasonal sales tax proposal, as promised in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. 
Lawmakers with the House and Senate majorities expressed interest and some skepticism about his new fiscal plan after the speech, and concern around the lack of details for potential new tax proposals as the session gets underway.
“Honestly, that’s a tremendous amount of things he said he wants us to get through, so we have to do things properly and slowly and rightly and correctly,” said Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak. “And everything does take more time than you think, but we’re willing to work with the governor, and anxious to see what the specifics are of his fiscal plan.”  
House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said he is not optimistic for a fiscal plan this year.
“This is the eighth year that the governor has put a budget in front of the legislature with an over billion dollar deficit,” he said. “Yet to be contrasted this session with a fiscal plan that is going to be very controversial that none of us have seen yet.”
Dunleavy began the speech by applauding the state’s disaster relief efforts, most recently the response this fall in the devastating aftermath of ex-Typhoon Halong in Western Alaska. He noted the state has experienced 85 state and federal disaster declarations during his term, an average of one per month. 
“We can’t control natural disasters. But we can control how we respond,” Dunleavy said. “I couldn’t be prouder of how we’ve responded to these events thanks to the brave men and women that I have the honor to serve as Governor.”
Dunleavy thanked the Trump administration throughout the speech, particularly for its focus on boosting Alaska resource development, which was outlined in the president’s executive order that promised to develop the state’s resources “to the fullest extent possible.” 
He praised the Trump administration for re-opening offshore drilling and federal lands in the Arctic for oil and gas development, as well as for the millions promised for health care through the Rural Health Transformation Program. 
“Alaska is benefitting greatly thanks to President Trump, and his administration. We need to do all we can to work with our federal partners over the next three years,” he said. “We may never get this opportunity again.”

Dunleavy touted dropping crime rates and a declining unemployment rate, citing a growing economy and state population. 
“I know there’s a feeling that things can be better, and of course they can, but our economy has been getting stronger and stronger every year of my administration,” he said.
Dunleavy said his administration will continue to work on reducing crime, in part by focusing on a new partnership with the municipality of Anchorage to combat crime there. 
“Public safety has been my No. 1 priority and it will continue to be so until the end of my term,” he said.  
Support of the proposed AK LNG pipeline featured prominently in his speech, though the financing and budget ask from the legislature remains uncertain. Dunleavy applauded the gas line developer, Glenfarne, a private energy developer that owns 75% of the project while the state of Alaska owns a 25% share.

Glenfarne executives were in the House chamber as Dunleavy praised the company’s most recent announcement: that they had signed new gas sales and contractor agreements and are headed into final investment negotiations to begin construction.
“This will be the single most transformative project in Alaska since the Trans-Alaska Pipeline,” he said.
While education was a major priority of the governor and legislature last year, Dunleavy only briefly touched on the topic. He said he would like to see legislators take action on bills he’s already introduced to expand charter schools, create open enrollment, address teacher retention and expand tribal compacting, which would allow schools to be run by local Alaska Native tribes. 
Lawmakers react to the governor’s state of the state address
Republican lawmakers praised the speech and its scope. 
“I thought it was a great address,” said Senate Minority Leader Mike Cronk, R-Tok, who was especially excited about movement towards a new gas pipeline. “He tried to cover everything that he possibly could, you know, still holding that optimism of getting things done that we need to get done.
“It was good to hear his overall enthusiasm going into his last year,” said House Minority Leader Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Anchorage. “We do need to evaluate our revenue and our expenses and to really take a good look and be good stewards going forward. So I’m interested in seeing what he will promote.”
Members of the House and Senate majority caucuses echoed the interest in more details on the AK LNG pipeline proposal.
“I come from a district where people are not opposed to resource development, but we’re definitely skeptical,” said Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks. “We want to be practical, and we want to be critical, not to the point of stopping projects, but to the point of just understanding and having fair and reasonable oversight on projects.”

Others, like Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, were more skeptical about the project. “Do they have gas purchase agreements? Not that we’re aware. Do they have gas sales agreements? Not that we’re aware. Do they have financing for the project? Not that we’re aware,” he said. “So they’re talking a lot about the project, and it feels like progress, but do they have any firm commitments on any of those things? Not that I’m aware.”
“We applaud his efforts. We all want a gas line. We’re all excited that we’re as close as we are,” Edgmon said. “But there are other sorts of existential issues that we’re not dealing with here in the legislature.” 
The speech failed to address fisheries for the second year in a row. Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, praised the governor’s optimism, especially around other resources, but noted the fisheries omission on Thursday. 
“It is one of our largest employers in the state, and they’re still having significant problems after the turn down a couple years ago. So we’ll continue to have discussions with the administration and see what help we can put forward for the industry guys,” he said.
Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, said most of his constituents would like to see an improvement in the level or quality of state services. “The governor did a good job of highlighting some of the achievements from his administration, but I think in many cases, he missed the mark on the reality felt on the ground,” he said. 
“With closing small businesses, we have a summer construction season that’s not funded — for the first time in state history. We have to address that,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage. “We have a stressed fishing industry. So just a big difference between a sort of a glossy speech and the much more challenging reality on the ground that we have to address.”
But Dunleavy noted in his speech that he’s still got some time to get work done — and he’s not running down the clock.
“Contrary to what you may have heard, my time is not up until noon on December 7th, 2026,” he said. “And our time here together in this last regular session isn’t up until midnight on May 20th.”

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Department of Corrections typically has two classes of graduates from its training academy each year, one around March and one around August. But this past August, the department got so few candidates it didn’t even have an academy class and thus didn’t hire any new corrections officers, department officials told the Bulletin.
“It’s not an easy job,” Corrections Commissioner William Hart said in an interview with the Bulletin this month. “So not everybody is beating down the doors to be a (corrections officer).”
William Hart
Staffing is a long-running challenge for the state’s prison system. The department has a roughly 47% vacancy rate among corrections officers, Hart said. As a result, the department has instituted mandatory overtime and burnout is becoming a major issue for staff, Hart said.
“If somebody else bails on the next shift,” he said, “you might have to now order people over for a double because you’ve got to maintain minimum staffing to assure safety of two groups of people: one the employees that you hire, and two the inmates that we’re legally and morally responsible for.” 
Hart is new to the role of commissioner, nominated by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in August and confirmed by the Executive Council the same month. His predecessor, Helen Hanks, resigned in May.
Hart said in his short time leading the department he has implemented measures aimed at addressing the staffing shortage. The department is offering a $10,000 signing bonus to new hires, which Hart said has attracted 160 new applicants, and held a one-day hiring “blitz” in December where applicants could do all the pre-academy hiring steps — medical examination, aptitude test, etc. — in a single day.
“So far, we’ve seen pretty dramatic success,” he said, but cautioned: “This is like a big battleship. It slowly turns rather than a motorboat that quickly turns.”
He said  progress won’t be fully apparent for eight months, because that’s how long it takes for officers to complete their training at the academy.
“If you include the hiring process it’s closer to 10 to 12 months,” he added. “But eight months from the time they begin the academy process to the time they’re out on the floor, acting on their own with a mentor.”
Hart also emphasized the candidates’ challenges in the hiring process. After passing a background check, the academy brings its own challenges meant to weed out officers unable to complete the job. Then officers have to do field training.
“Provided you pass those things, then and only then are you allowed to go out on the floor and work with inmates on a one-on-one basis,” he said “So this is not an overnight cure, not a six-month cure. It’s a year cure.”
Hart estimates about 20 people will graduate from the department’s academy in March. He hopes the recruiting gains will allow the department to have another academy class sometime between August and October.
The staffing challenges are not new to the department. In June 2024, the department had a 46% vacancy rate, according to Bulletin reporting at the time. In 2023, the issue was so dire, the state deployed members of the New Hampshire National Guard to assist prison staff.
The challenges also aren’t unique to New Hampshire. North Carolina officials reported last year that their state’s system had a 40% vacancy rate for corrections officers, NC Newsline reported. Closer to home, Vermont officials told Vermont Public they had a 17% vacancy rate statewide, but for some prisons in the state it was as high as 48%. In Mississippi, a notoriously troubled system, the vacancy rate hovered around 50% last year, The Marshall Project reported.
Meanwhile, Hart lavished praise on the officers his department does have.
“I’m so deeply impressed by the commitment and professionalism of the folks who work in corrections,” he said. “Corrections is often seen as a little bit of a stepchild in law enforcement. That is completely misplaced. Corrections is law enforcement, both those first line civilians and people who are behind the walls with a certification to act as a C.O. These are people who put themselves in harm’s way, dealing with a dangerous population. It’s different than a cop who doesn’t know the population that they’re dealing with. We know that some of these folks are bad actors. Some of them made a mistake, and have to pay for it. I get that, but some of these folks are bad actors. And folks go to work every day, interact with, treat people with uncommon compassion, with humanity and dignity, every day they come to work.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dochart-1024x721.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 05:38:33.627419

(krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)Far fewer Ohioans enrolled in insurance marketplaces after Republican-controlled U.S. Congress allowed subsidies to expire at the beginning of the year. That likely means many more uninsured people.
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Jan. 12 reported that 463,000 Ohioans had purchased insurance on HealthCare.gov since the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1. 
Nearly 600,000 in the Buckeye State purchased insurance on the exchanges in 2025, the Health Policy Institute of Ohio reports. That’s at least a 21% drop in enrollment if the current numbers hold.
The New York Times last week reported that nationally, enrollment has dropped by 1.4 million, roughly a 6% drop.
The subsidies were created during the coronavirus pandemic in 2021, and are used by the vast majority of people participating in the marketplaces. Most of them have moderate incomes. 
About 70% of the people using the ACA exchanges make 250% or less of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, that’s $80,375 a year.
KFF, a health-analysis nonprofit, last year predicted that the average consumer would see the cost of her or his coverage more than double if the subsidies were allowed to expire. But after a 43-day government shutdown in a fight over extending the subsidies, Republicans in Congress voted to allow them to die.
They did so after voting last summer to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts — $1 trillion of which will benefit the richest 1% of Americans over the next 10 years and add $4.1 trillion to the national debt. At the same time, the bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and federal food assistance over the same period.
The Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimate that nationally, 4.8 million Americans will lose insurance coverage altogether in the absence of ACA subsidies. In Ohio, that would eventually add thousands of newly uninsured people in a state that already saw 600,000 lose Medicaid coverage  between 2023 and 2025.
People who don’t have insurance tend to get sicker, be deeper in debt, and die earlier, according to a 2012 report by Families USA. 
Other reports describe a downward spiral in which the stress of medical debt can cause health to deteriorate further, creating more debt and sometimes even premature death.
And emergency departments are required by law to treat people regardless of their ability to pay.
Emergency physicians warn that growing the population of uninsured Ohioans will put additional financial stress on hospitals — especially in rural areas and low-income neighborhoods. 
That will result in longer wait times, reduced service and, in some cases, hospital closures, they said.
Meanwhile, an October KFF health tracking poll found that 78% of adults thought the subsidies should be extended, compared to just 22% who said they shouldn’t.
With their expiration and plummeting ACA enrollment, some Republicans are supporting renewal. 
On Jan. 8, 17 House Republicans joined Democrats in voting for a three-year extension. They included Ohio U.S. Reps. David Joyce, Max Miller, and Mike Carey.
Despite the subsidies’ popularity, however, there is widespread skepticism that a three-year extension will pass the Republican-controlled Senate. 
A bipartisan group is said to be working on a compromise, but thus far it hasn’t produced anything.

(Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)In 2025 — for the first time — a lobbyist was paid more than $1 million to influence the actions of the Kentucky General Assembly.
Actually, reports filed with the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission this month show that two lobbyists were paid more than $1 million in 2025 for their work with the state legislature: Stephen Huffman was paid $1,153,500 for representing 25 different clients; M. Patrick Jennings was paid $1,123,988 to represent 85 clients, the reports show.
Lobbyists are, and have been for many years, the highest paid people who work in the state Capitol. Reports filed with the ethics commission show that a dozen were paid more than a half million dollars in 2025 to plead the cases of their clients with state legislators.
By contrast, Gov. Andy Beshear is paid $184,826 per year to govern the state, according to the Kentucky Transparency website. Ethics commission records show that 39 lobbyists made more than Beshear in 2025.
Kentucky Lantern has tracked the compensation of top lobbyists in recent years, and it wasn’t until 2024 that any came close to hitting $1 million. That was Jennings, who was paid $975,237 that year, according to ethics commission records.
But reports filed this month with the commission by the nearly 900 corporations, trade associations and other groups that are registered to lobby the legislature, show that the compensation of Huffman and Jennings sailed far above the $1 million mark in 2025.
Together, the nearly 900 groups reported paying more than $26.5 million in compensation to lobbyists in 2025.
‘A seat at the table’
“Businesses and organizations understand it’s important to have a strong presence through lobbying and campaign contributions so they have a chance to have a seat at the table,” said John Schaaf, a former general counsel and executive director of the ethics commission. “Whether they want a contract, regulatory relief, or a change in tax law, if a business is not on the playing field, they can’t win the game.”
Any citizen is free to contact his or her state senator or representative with a request or a concern, but if a person is paid to make a case for others to a legislator, that person is required to be registered as a legislative agent (or lobbyist) with the commission. Currently, there are 651 people registered to lobby the Kentucky General Assembly.
Some are executives of the company or group for which they lobby. For instance, executives of the largest lobbying presence in Frankfort, the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, are registered and the chamber reports the lobbying compensation of an executive based on the percentage of the executive’s time at work spent on lobbying state legislators.
But many are professional lobbyists like Huffman and Jennings who have contracts to represent the interests of many different corporations and groups before the legislature.
Huffman, who is with the lobbying firm Stoll Keenon Government Relations, declined to comment for this story.
Jennings responded with an email that said in part that he is proud that nearly 100 companies and associations have placed their trust in his lobbying firm, Commonwealth Alliances. 
“We maintain full transparency in our legislative reporting and hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards. We are proud of the work we do on behalf of our clients within Kentucky’s legislative and executive branches, as well as our longstanding bipartisan approach to advancing their interests,” Jennings said.
Stephen Huffman: Skyrocketing to the top
Huffman came to Frankfort in late 2003 as the chief of staff to the then-new Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Pence. Ethics commission records indicate he first registered as a lobbyist in 2008.
In the past decade he climbed to the top tier of highest paid lobbyists. In 2024, ethics commission records show Huffman ranked third with compensation of $773,800.
Last year, he skyrocketed to the top of the list.
His clients include large and small groups. Many clients are from the overlapping worlds of gambling and horse racing: Revolutionary Racing, The Red Mile, Keeneland Association, Jockey’s Guild, Kentucky Equine Education Alliance, and Brightstar Global Solutions.
Other clients are from energy, financial services, health care, construction, tobacco, health care, communications and local government. He represents a children’s home, a medical cannabis dispensary, a non-profit charity and a trade association that lobbies for freedom of speech on the internet. 
M. Patrick Jennings: From one-time aide to lobbyist
A former legislative aide to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Jennings is finance chairman for the Republican Party of Kentucky. He became chief lobbyist for the Kentucky Farm Bureau in late 1999. In 2004, he began as a contract lobbyist and in 2008 started the firm Commonwealth Alliances.
His roster of 85 clients includes AT&T; Kentucky Hospital Association; Philip Morris International; American Wagering – Caesar’s Digital; Ed Choice Kentucky; Tik-Tok Inc.; Parents for School Options; Vapor Technology Association; Coinbase; Carewise Health; The Jockey Club; CSX Corp.; and the Kentucky Independent Pharmacy Alliance.
Here are the Kentucky legislative lobbyists who round out the top 10 money makers of 2025, along with what they earned and a sampling of the corporations and associations that pay them:

Bob Babbage: $771,825

In past years Babbage has often been at the top of the list of highest-paid lobbyists. He heads the firm Babbage Cofounder and represents 39 clients, including Angel’s Envy, PrizePicks, Aviation Museum of Kentucky, Kentucky Interactive, and MC Global Holdings.

Sean Cutter: $763,441

Cutter is with MML&K Government Solutions, the lobbying firm started by the late super-lobbyist Terry McBrayer. He represents 67 clients, including Kentucky Distillers’ Association, Humana, LG&E and KU Energy, G20, and BusPatrol America.

John McCarthy: $763,330

McCarthy is a former chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky who currently serves as the RPK’s national committeeman. He heads the firm McCarthy Strategic Solutions and represents 122 clients, including Altria Client Services (Philip Morris USA), Churchill Downs, Kentucky Optometric Association., Glenview Trust Co., and Kentucky Financial Services Association.

Chris Nolan: $749,700

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderSecretary of State Brad Raffensperger is refusing to turn over sensitive personal information from Georgia’s voter rolls to the U.S. Department of Justice in response to the Trump administration’s ongoing legal campaign aimed at forcing state and local officials to disclose voter roll information to the federal government.
But pressure from some lawmakers and other state officials for him to turn over the data is mounting, despite Raffensperger’s repeated claims that doing so would violate state law.
In December, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit arguing that Georgia’s unredacted voter registration list was needed as part of an ongoing investigation into “Georgia’s compliance with federal election law.” 
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger appeared before lawmakers earlier this week to discuss Gov. Brian Kemp’s proposed budget for his office. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Raffensperger had previously sent Justice Department officials some of the state’s voter registration data, but he argued that state law prohibited his office from divulging the Social Security numbers, full dates of birth and driver’s license numbers of Georgia residents.
In a Wednesday court filing, attorneys for the secretary of state’s office filed a motion requesting that the lawsuit be dismissed, arguing that the Justice Department is exceeding its authority in requesting the records, that it lacks the jurisdiction to sue and that the Macon-based court in which the case was filed was the wrong venue.
“There is no basis to think that Georgia is not complying with those list maintenance requirements,” the state’s motion reads. 
The redacted records the state has sent over, the state’s filing continues, “show that Georgia conducts list maintenance to the fullest extent allowed by” federal law. 
“The (Department of Justice) does not need Georgia voter (personal identifying information) to ascertain that fact, which makes the lack of the required basis in the demand particularly telling,” the state’s attorneys wrote.
But at least some of Georgia’s state leaders are escalating their efforts to get Raffensperger to turn over the data. During a State Election Board meeting Wednesday, board members voted 3-1 to pass a resolution calling on the secretary of state to transmit the state’s unredacted voter rolls to the Department of Justice by the end of the week. On Thursday, lawmakers on the Senate Ethics Committee voted along party lines to advance a resolution urging the secretary of state to comply with the lawsuit. 
Sen. Randy Robertson, a Cataula Republican, speaks during a Senate Ethics Committee hearing. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
“The primary concern of mine is that we are not fully engaging to do this,” said Sen. Randy Robertson, a Cataula Republican who introduced the resolution. “What we are doing is we are spending taxpayers’ resources to fight something that we have not sat down and fully vetted out with the Department of Justice.”
In an op-ed published last week by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Raffensperger defended his decision not to release the unredacted data and criticised the senators who cosponsored the resolution, saying they were “putting political ambition ahead of common sense and public service.”
“This resolution isn’t about election integrity or clean voter rolls,” Raffensperger wrote. “It’s an obvious attempt to shame, intimidate and smear the secretary of state’s office for doing exactly what the law requires.”
Ethics chair Sen. Sam Watson, a Moultrie Republican, invited Raffensperger to attend the committee hearing to discuss the resolution, but the secretary of state’s general counsel Charlene McGowan declined the invitation, citing an inability to comment on pending litigation.
“I am more than happy to update the committee when this matter is no longer in active litigation,” McGowan wrote. The secretary of state’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Democrats on the committee pushed back against the resolution, arguing that there were no legal grounds to turn over the data.
“We are, with this resolution, asking the secretary of state to violate Georgia law,” said Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat.
Common Cause, a nonprofit government watchdog group, also cautioned states against turning over sensitive data, arguing that it would make Americans more vulnerable to hackers and foreign adversaries. Common Cause has filed a motion to intervene in the case.
“A national database containing your name, address, driver’s license or Social Security number and other personal information all stored on a federal server would be a gold mine for hackers inside and outside of the country,” said Dan Vicuña, who serves as a senior policy director at Common Cause.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

Georgia is among at least 44 states that have received requests from the Justice Department for their complete voter data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking the requests. It is also among the 24 states that the Brennan Center says are currently facing lawsuits for refusing to turn over all the requested data, which includes voters’ names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. In at least two of those states, the lawsuits have been dismissed by federal judges.
In September, the Trump administration confirmed that the Department of Justice is also sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens.
The Justice Department has also filed a lawsuit against Fulton County late last year for refusing to turn over voter records from the 2020 election.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As a growing number of encounters between civilians and Department of Homeland Security agents — including the widely scrutinized fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis — are scrutinized in court records and on social media, federal officials are returning to a familiar response: self-defense.
In more than a handful of recent encounters, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, has said its agents acted in self-defense during violent encounters, even as eyewitness testimony and video footage raised questions about whether those accounts fully matched what happened.
And in a ruling for a recent civil lawsuit, a U.S. district judge said federal immigration officials were not forthcoming about enforcement efforts, citing discrepancies between official DHS statements and video evidence.
“We’re now in a situation in which official sources in the Trump administration are really tying themselves quite strongly to a particular narrative, regardless of what the widely disseminated videos suggest,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University.
The cases come amid an aggressive expansion of federal immigration enforcement and increasing scenes of violent and intimidating arrest tactics. President Donald Trump’s administration has sharply increased the hiring of immigration agents, broadened enforcement operations and accelerated deportations, as protests have spread across major cities.
The use of force, paired with conflicting official statements and evidence, has raised questions about whether federal immigration officials can be held accountable and highlighted the steep hurdles victims of excessive force might face in seeking legal recourse.
States, cities are hard-pressed to fight violent ICE arrest tactics

The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to multiple requests from Stateline for comment on discrepancies between official accounts and publicly available evidence.
Since last July, there have been at least 17 open-fire incidents involving federal immigration agents — including fatal shootings, shootings with injuries and cases in which shots were fired — according to data compiled by The Trace, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news outlet investigating gun violence. A recent Wall Street Journal investigation also found 13 incidents since July in which immigration agents fired at or into civilian vehicles.
One of the most prominent examples unfolded in Minneapolis this month: Good’s fatal shooting by a masked ICE agent. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the agent, Jonathan Ross, fired in self-defense after Good, 37, allegedly tried to run over officers. Videos taken by bystanders show Good’s vehicle reversed, shifted and began to turn away from officers after one yelled and pulled on her car handle. Ross positioned himself near the hood of her car, and he began firing.
Minnesota officials later stated the footage did not support DHS’ description of an imminent threat, prompting renewed scrutiny of how the Trump administration is characterizing use-of-force encounters.
Similar discrepancies have surfaced in other cases. The Department of Homeland Security recently revised its account of a December shooting in Glen Burnie, Maryland, after local police contradicted its initial version. DHS first claimed both men injured in the incident were inside a van that ICE officers fired at in self-defense, but later said that one of the injured men had already been arrested and was in custody inside an ICE vehicle when he was hurt. The other man was shot twice and is facing two federal criminal charges.
In August, federal immigration agents fired at a family’s vehicle three times in San Bernardino, California. DHS maintained the shooting was justified after at least two agents were struck by the vehicle, but available footage shows an agent breaking the driver-side window moments before gunfire erupted. Surveillance footage from the street does not show agents being struck by the vehicle.











Official sources in the Trump administration are really tying themselves quite strongly to a particular narrative.


– César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, immigration policy expert



“I can’t think of another time in my lifetime — I’m 50 years old — where we’ve seen this sort of force in the streets in the United States,” said Mark Fleming, the associate director of federal litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center. Fleming has been an immigration and civil rights attorney for the past 20 years.
García Hernández, the law professor at Ohio State University, echoed Fleming’s point, saying that what also stands out is how often agents are deploying less‑lethal weapons in ways that would generally be prohibited — including firing rubber pellets and similar projectiles at people’s faces or heads.
In its use-of-force policy, DHS agents may use force only when no “reasonably effective, safe, and feasible” alternative exists and only at a level that is “objectively reasonable.” DHS policy emphasizes “respect for human life” and directs officers to be proficient in de-escalation tactics — using communication or other techniques to stabilize or reduce the intensity of a potentially violent situation without, or with reduced, physical force. The policy also states that deadly force should not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.
ICE, as an agency under DHS, is bound by this guidance, but the policy on shooting at moving vehicles differs from what many law enforcement agencies nationwide now consider best practices. While DHS prohibits officers from firing at the operator of a moving vehicle unless it is necessary to stop a serious threat, its rules do not explicitly instruct officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles when possible.
Use of force
A growing pattern of aggressive tactics and conflicting evidence has raised serious questions about how federal immigration agents use lethal and less-lethal force, and how DHS officials describe the incidents to the public.
In September, 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González was fatally shot during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, a suburb near Chicago. DHS claimed that one agent was “seriously injured” after being dragged by González’s car as he tried to flee. But body-camera footage shows the agent telling a Franklin Park police officer that his injury was “nothing major.”
In a statement, DHS said the agent responded with lethal force because he was “fearing for his own life” — a narrative very similar to the department’s description of the fatal shooting of Good in Minneapolis.
In recent months, DHS officials have claimed that immigration agents have been repeatedly attacked with vehicles.
“We’ve seen vehicles weaponized over 100 times in the last several months against our law enforcement officers,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during an interview with CNN this month.
In court filings related to a civil lawsuit about Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, the department provided body-camera footage and other internal records to bolster their claims of self-defense.
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

But U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis found the evidence “difficult, if not impossible to believe.” In her lengthy opinion issued in late November, Ellis acknowledged that agents sometimes encountered aggressive drivers but also found that agents treated cars that were merely following them as potential threats.
In October, an ICE agent shot a community observer, Marimar Martinez, five times during a confrontation in Chicago. DHS claimed that she rammed the ICE vehicle with her car and boxed it in, but surveillance footage does not show the agents were trapped.
Martinez survived, but the Trump administration quickly labeled her a “domestic terrorist” — the same label used to describe Good. Martinez’s criminal charges were dropped in November after the federal Department of Justice abruptly moved to dismiss the case.
In Ellis’ ruling on the civil lawsuit, she wrote that federal officials “cannot simply create their own narrative of what happened, misrepresenting the evidence to justify their actions,” and that the violence used by federal agents “shocks the conscience,” a legal standard meaning a situation that seems grossly unjust to an observer.
Ellis also explicitly questioned the conduct and leadership of Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol during the Chicago immigration operation. Bovino, who has led the administration’s big-city campaign, was deposed under oath, and in her November ruling, Ellis described him as “not credible,” writing that he “appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing ‘cute’ responses … or outright lying.”
In a footnote, Ellis also noted an instance in which an agent asked ChatGPT to draft a use-of-force report from a single sentence and a few images — further undermining the credibility of official DHS accounts.
A narrow path to accountability
Holding federal immigration agents accountable for misconduct is difficult, even as video evidence and police or court records increasingly contradict official government accounts.
With more evidence surfacing and legal claims already underway, some experts say it’s likely that even more lawsuits will emerge this year.
Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

“We should expect to see more examples, more instances in which cellphone video is used to bolster legal claims against DHS, ICE, Border Patrol and specific officers as well,” said García Hernández, of Ohio State University.
Federal officers are shielded by legal doctrines such as qualified immunity and U.S. Supreme Court rulings that restrict when people can sue federal officials for constitutional violations. In recent years, the courts have narrowed the circumstances under which individuals can bring claims for excessive force or wrongful death.
Suing individual federal immigration agents is nearly impossible.
People can, however, pursue claims against the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act if a government employee causes financial or bodily harm. These cases, which can include claims for wrongful death, face significant hurdles: no punitive damages, no jury trials, state-specific caps on compensation and protections for discretionary government decisions.
Internal DHS investigations can lead to discipline or policy changes, but their findings may not be made public.
Several state lawmakers in California, Colorado, Georgia, New York and Oregon are pursuing measures that would allow residents to sue federal immigration agents for constitutional violations. Illinois has a similar law already in place, but this pathway remains largely untested, and experts say it faces significant legal and logistical hurdles.

Central Ohio high school students are walking out to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Several students from Franklin County school districts including Worthington Schools, Hilliard Schools, Upper Arlington Schools, Westerville Schools, and Dublin Schools have walked out of school this month in protest. 
These walkouts come after more than 280 people in central Ohio were detained by ICE in one week during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched from Dec. 16-21.

“Our immigrant kids are afraid to come to school,” Columbus Education Association President John Coneglio said to the Capital Journal.
Ohio schools are required by law to provide free public education to all children, regardless of immigration status. 
The Trump administration last year rescinded a policy directive that banned ICE from operating in “sensitive areas” like schools, places of worship, and hospitals.
Some Ohio teacher unions have recently condemned ICE activity near school buildings. 
“ICE’s presence in central Ohio is causing fear, upheaval and panic in immigrant communities,” South-Western Education Association Faculty Representatives Spokesperson Emmalee Harding said in a statement. 
“This will predictably harm the school environment by causing increased absences, decreased student achievement, and parental disengagement.”
The Hilliard Education Association said denying any child the chance to attend public school is harmful. 
“Depriving any child of an opportunity to attend public school puts them at a disadvantage, making it difficult for them to gain the skills they need to contribute fully to society,” HEA said in a statement. 
The Ohio Education Association “strongly opposes any presence or enforcement actions” by ICE in or around public schools, OEA President Jeff Wensing said in a statement. 
“Schools must remain safe, welcoming spaces where every student — regardless of immigration status — can learn, grow, and thrive without fear,” Wensing said. 
“No child should be afraid to go to school, and no school employee should be placed in the position of navigating immigration enforcement. The presence of ICE in schools undermines trust, disrupts learning, and creates trauma for children and families.”
Maqueli Eldredge, a paralegal at Legal Immigration Services in Dublin, said she has not seen ICE try to detain parents when they pick-up or drop-off their children at school. 
“Sometimes people see (ICE) around the schools in the neighborhoods, but we haven’t seen ICE trying to detain parents when they take the kids to school,” she said. 
Some parents are choosing to keep their students at home and are trying to figure out distance learning, Eldredge said. 
“It’s very hard for the kids to miss school and also for the parents to miss work,” she said. 
Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people detained were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. 
Ohio House Bill 42 would require various agencies and departments, including the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce, to collect and report citizenship and immigration status to the governor. For the department, that would mean reporting how many students are citizens and how many are not citizens.
Ohio State Reps. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., introduced the bill, which has had three hearings so far and received much opposition.
“Schools are not immigration enforcement agencies,” Honesty for Ohio Education Executive Director Christina Collins said in her opponent testimony.
“Students who fear that their personal or family information could be used against them are less likely to participate in school, less likely to ask for help, and less likely to report safety concerns.”

With just one prompt, a staunch Republican can become a diehard Democrat.
Artificial intelligence can create and edit photos and videos. Fake pictures or videos of people, called deepfakes, have become more prevalent online.


Demonstrating impact of deepfakes: On the left is the original, real photo of state Rep. Adam Mathews (R-Lebanon). The photo on the right was manipulated, yet looks realistic, by reporter Morgan Trau for the sake of this news report.

“You should be able to tell someone, ‘Please take that down, that picture never happened,'” Mathews said.







Having been a victim of AI fraud himself, letting me previously deepfake him for a story, Mathews explained that lawmakers and celebrities aren’t the only targets for fake images.
“Everyone should have the dignity of themselves, and the way that they can present themselves out into the world,” he said.
Law enforcement officials in California and Arizona have opened investigations into X’s AI tool Grok for nonconsensual explicit content. Users have been able to ask Grok to undress people, including children, and put them in compromising outfits or positions.
Mathews is trying to stop this type of misinformation. He and state Rep. Ty Mathews (R-Findlay) proposed House Bill 185, which would regulate AI content.
“It’s based on protecting the name, image and likeness of everyday Ohioans, whether that’s using AI or whether that’s using Photoshop, or whether that’s using any type of image manipulation with or without AI,” Mathews said.
The legislation would allow everyone to own their image, and it would be a trademark infringement to produce malicious content without someone’s consent. There could be civil penalties of tens of thousands of dollars.
The bill also makes it a third-degree felony to create or distribute malicious AI content in order to extort the individual being deepfaked.
Any pornographic deepfakes or deepfakes of a child are completely banned, with or without a disclaimer.
Malicious deepfakes, AI meant to harm someone’s image, would only be allowed as long as they have a clear watermark that they were artificially manipulated.
Let’s show some examples:
Original photo

This is the original photo of Mathews wearing a black shirt and standing in front of a barn.
Deepfake 1 — Needs disclaimer


Manipulated by Morgan Trau.


This is a deepfake I made of him with his permission — one where he has “Joe Biden” written on his shirt. This image, created with Grok, would require a disclaimer.
Deepfake 2 — Doesn’t need a disclaimer


Expertly drawn by Morgan Trau


This is an expertly drawn “deepfake” I made of him. This one would not require a disclaimer.
“Political cartoons are totally protected; no one thinks that a drawing actually happened,” Mathews said
Reaction
The Motion Picture Association of America is opposing it, saying it goes against freedom of speech. Previously, Case Western Reserve University law professor Eric Chaffee told us that they have a point.
“Requiring these disclaimers, in fact, may be spoiling that art or forcing people to say things that they don’t want to say,” Chaffee said. “There are certainly First Amendment concerns.”
But CWRU technology professor Erman Ayday pointed out that the actual challenge with this bill would be enforcement.
“People will keep trying, you keep changing the prompts,” Ayday said. “I don’t think there’s a 100% guarantee that you can stop Grok from undressing people.”
Mathews said he hopes his bill also inspires action from tech companies to put more guardrails on AI. In recent days, X announced that it added new measures to prevent fake explicit pictures without consent.
“AI is going to continue to grow, and we need to make legislation that is not chasing where technology is now,” Mathews said.
This legislation would also get around President Donald Trump’s AI executive order. In December, Trump signed an order that would punish states from making their own regulations on AI. Because this bill is about NIL, Mathews, a lawyer, doesn’t think that Trump’s AI regulations would apply.

William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) testifies to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on his bill to ban 287(g) agreements between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration agencies.

Ford/Maryland Matters)No matter what happens with a pair of bills that would rein in federal immigration agents in Maryland, no one can say they didn’t get a full hearing.
The Senate Judicial Proceedings took five hours of testimony from dozens of witnesses Thursday, on one bill that would prohibit police from wearing face coverings while on duty and another that would eliminate agreements allowing local police agencies to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The hearing followed a rally by advocates late Thursday morning.
The bills are likely to be among the most emotional in this session, as increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics by federal agents flooding U.S. cities continue to dominate the news. But Thursday’s hearings were largely unemotional, with the biggest outbursts being the occasional rounds of applause from the lobby outside the hearing room, where an overflow crowd watched a livestream of the proceedings.
Senators spent nearly two hours on a bill to prohibit face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who are mostly masked.
The second bill, discussed for about three hours, would bar local law enforcement agencies from entering into immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. Sheriffs in eight Maryland counties currently has the so-called 287(g) agreements with ICE, under which the counties agree to hold criminal suspects for ICE pickup if the local agency determines the suspect is in the U.S. illegally.
Senate Bill 245, sponsored by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), states that no local police officers or any “agent of the state” would be allowed to enter into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.
The bill, which failed in last year’s session, comes as immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump (R) is becoming increasingly aggressive and divisive, with Smith citing the case of a 5-year-old boy being detained by ICE in Minnesota.
“Immigrants have been used as this pawn for this whole political dynamic, and ICE has been used as that tool to vilify immigrants, to stoke fear, to disrupt lives and communities and to divide us,” said Smith, the chair of Judicial Proceedings.
“We should no longer refer our precious, critical law enforcement resources to federal immigration enforcement,” he said. “Instead, our law enforcement should be relentlessly focused on public safety. That’s what this bill intends to do that.”
Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) testified in support of the bill, noting that immigrants contribute millions of dollars to the state’s economy, account for about 23% of the state’s STEM workforce and the same percentage of registered nurses.
“It’s just important to recognize that policies that promote stability and trust within immigrant communities also help protect and buoy Maryland’s economy and increase our economic resilience,” Lierman said.

But Sens. Chris West (R-Baltimore and Carroll) and William G. Folden (R-Frederick) said Maryland sheriff’s departments are not engaged in rouding up immigrants, just in holding immigrants for ICE once they’re already in custody.
“These 287(g) agreements, in fact, all they do is require that after someone has been arrested and brought into a detention facility, that arrestee is screened, and if it turns out that person is an illegal immigrant, ICE is informed. That’s it,” West said.
That may be, said Smith, but he said West glossed over the fact that some people have been arrested and turned over to ICE for minor offenses, and that there is a lack of due process for them.
“If we are in the business of doing ICE’s job for them, then that frees up other resources to do that field enforcement that we find to be so egregious in many senses,” he said.
The majority of witnesses Thursday testified in support of Smith’s bill, saying the 287(g) agreements encourage racial profiling and create anxiety and fear in immigrant communities.
The agreements “lead to local residents losing trust in the very law enforcement agencies that are supposed to protect them,” said Viviana Westbrook, state and local advocacy attorney at Catholic Legal Immigration Network based in Montgomery County. “I really hope that this year we will end 287(g) since it is complicit with all the violence and chaos and fear that ICE has been sowing.”
Some opposition
But supporters pushed back against what they say are the many misconceptions about the 287(g) program.
The eight counties with the 287(g) agreements have a strictly jail-based model and don’t handle street enforcement, they said. The work done by local authorities is done by correctional officers in a detention center who handle detainers, which are written requests from ICE that a local jail or other agency detain an individual for up to 48 hours, to give ICE time to take the person into federal custody to begin removal proceedings.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties have agreements where they can process individuals in local detention centers and then hand to ICE. The other five counties – Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington – entered into agreements last year and can serve administrative warrants in a local jail.
Carroll County Sheriff Jim DeWees, whose jurisdiction signed onto an agreement in May, said his department implemented a warrant-based model to strictly serve administrative warrants.
“You can pass this law and abolish our 287(g) agreement, but no politician or legislative body will tell me that I can’t communicate with another law enforcement agency when it comes to a matter of public safety in my community,” DeWees said.
In November, the Wicomico County Council discussed entering a 287(g) agreement, but County Executive Julie Giordano (R) suggested holding off because the General Assembly might make changes to the program. On Thursday, Giordano told the committee her county is again considering an agreement with ICE.
“This bill does not eliminate ICE. It does not stop immigration enforcement,” she said, speaking against the legislation. “What it does is that it strips counties’ and correctional officers’ and elected officials’ ability to cooperate and coordinate with federal authorities in a responsible, structured and transparent way.”
The hearing came two days after several sheriffs joined Senate Republicans in Annapolis to speak in support of the 287(g) program as an effective public safety tool in their jurisdictions, and who said they would fight any attempt to end the program.
About four hours prior to Thursday’s hearing, Smith joined members of the immigrant rights and advocacy group CASA and other community leaders at a news conference to say ICE must go. Smith rejected the argument by critics that a 287(g) ban would be unconstitutional, saying sheriffs are bound to adhere to state law.

“While they do have responsibilities and powers vested in them through their status as a constitutional officer, the legislature can curtail that,” Smith said. “The department that the sheriff resides over is also a creature of the state, and so the state can also curtail those responsibilities and those rights. So, it’s fully constitutional.”
Standing alongside Smith on Thursday was Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), sponsor of the House version of the 287(g) bill scheduled to be heard Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee.
Williams said the legislation remains necessary with what’s happening in the nation, especially under the Trump administration.
“This is one of those pivotal moments in our history as a country where what we’re seeing is unprecedented, and I think the way that we all respond is going to be in history books for our children and grandchildren to read about in the future,” Williams said.
Face coverings
Before the Senate committee reviewed the federal enforcement bill, it spent nearly two hours on Senate Bill 1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), that would ban face coverings on law enforcement officials.
The bill comes after months of aggressive immigration raids by ICE agents, who are typically masked. Augustine’s bill would prohibit officers from wearing items such as a balaclava, ski mask or neck gaiter on duty. It wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation” or when health-related matters are involved.
“Wearing masks is just simply not necessary for law enforcement to function. The wearing of masks undermines public trust,” Augustine said. “Masking within the normal course of duty has no tactical benefit, but does pose a risk to our collective public safety by creating fear and anxiety, particularly in situations that are already tense.”

Naureen Shah, director of immigration policy with the American Civil Liberties Union, said law enforcement agencies wearing masks represent tactics “of an authoritarian regime where people must watch what they say, lest they be disappeared by masked agents operating without accountability.”
After Augustine and Shaw spoke, several people could be heard clapping in the committee lobby area.
But Folden, who recently retired from law enforcement after slightly more than 30 years, said doxing has become a problem for officers on the job, such as during protests.
Neil Franklin, a retired Maryland State Police major who testified online, said he doesn’t see that as a problem, especially when federal immigration duties have been done for decades under other U.S. presidents.
“There’s no tactical advantage to wearing a mask outside of … normal performance of their duties,” Franklin said. “It’s actually a disadvantage in my professional opinion because again, it creates distrust in policing.”
Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) asked why the bill includes potential criminal prosecution of officers who violate the law. Under Augustine’s bill, an officer found guilty would be charged with a misdemeanor and possible imprisonment for up to two years, a fine to not exceed $2,000, or both. In addition, the officer must waive “all immunity in a civil action.”
Augustine said the penalties are needed “to have strong enforcement mechanisms because of the damage that this practice has on the fabric of our community and human dignity in our state…. Don’t wear a mask [and] you don’t have to worry about it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-at-Senate-JPR-hearing-1-22-2026-1024x751.jpg,,,2026-01-23 08:37:27.637556

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)When it comes to the Kansas Legislature, sometimes you have to use a wide-angle lens to catch what’s actually going on.
Hearings in the House Elections Committee this week began clearing the way for bills meant for one purpose: expanding Republican power. Committee chairman Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, may claim he wants to expand voter participation, but his record of tightening voter requirements makes one raise an eyebrow.
No, the combined effect of these bills would be to cement rightwing Republican control — not just of Kansas state government, but of city and county government as well.
How might that work? Let’s examine two bills of the many floating around committee.
House Bill 2452 would move local elections to even-numbered years. This means that elections for school board and city council would take place at the same time as elections for president, governor, and state senators and representatives.
What would be the effect of such a move? Well, Secretary of State Scott Schwab’s office had some choice words for the proposal. (He’s running as a Republican candidate for governor, in case you didn’t know.) His deputy Clay Barker laid it all out during a hearing held Tuesday.
“The bill would impose significant administrative challenges on county election officers in several respects,” Barker wrote in his submitted testimony. “The more complex the election administration, the greater the risk of administrative errors.”
He went further: “Voter fatigue could become an issue. Voter fatigue occurs when ballots have many offices, races, or ballot measures. Voters become overwhelmed and disengaged, leading to lower participation and less informed choices. Research has shown that noticeable voter fatigue begins after 5–7 voter decisions; severe drop-off occurs with 10–15 voter decisions.”
That suggests that a long ballot could lead to voters either neglecting downballot races or voting based on party alone.
Let’s pause for a moment to marvel. That testimony doesn’t come from a Democrat or liberal. It comes from a conservative Republican’s office.
That appeared to agitate Proctor, who asked Barker: “Secretary of State’s Office has no position on the value of increasing voter turnout for an election?”
Again, let’s pause to marvel. This is the Proctor, whose signature accomplishment was eliminating a three-day grace period for the state to receive mail ballots. That law cleared the way for officials to invalidate legal votes because of mail problems. He has also told audiences that in his perfect world there would be no early voting and that women stole the 2022 abortion referendum by voting. 
As late-night infomercial salesmen say, that’s not all, folks!
Another piece of legislation Proctor has introduced this session, House Bill 2494, would allow candidates in nonpartisan races to list their party affiliation on ballots. In heavily Republican Kansas, that hands a massive advantage to Republican candidates. Previously, they might have to campaign and tell voters what they actually believed. If the bill becomes law, they can just wink and nod.
Local boards and commissions have implemented nonpartisan elections because solid candidates transcend ideology politics. A school board member or city commissioner looks after the school district or city. National or state politics don’t enter into it. Or at least they shouldn’t.
Nonpartisan elections encourage voters to focus on the individuals involved and not the letter or word next to their names.
HB 2494 would change all that.
Now, lets put two and two together. How would that bill interact with the even-year election one? What does Proctor mean to accomplish in Kansas?
Every even-numbered year, Kansans will go to the polls and receive lengthy, complicated ballots. As they move down the ballot from the highest-ranking races, they will be confronted by unfamiliar offices and unfamiliar names. If they haven’t researched or been involved in their communities, those listed could just as well be imaginary.
But wait! There’s a helpful notation of Republican after several of those strange names. The voter breathes a sigh of relief, fills in the ovals next to those names and goes along his or her merry way.
The upshot is a an even more partisan government at all levels.
Either of these proposals, on their own and not promoted by Proctor, possess defensible qualities. We should make it easier for more people to participate in elections. That makes sense. Likewise, I’m not sure that forcing people to hide their party affiliation in local races makes as much of a difference as advocates might think. From my experience in municipal politics, many people involved in these races know candidates’ ideology.
The situation gives pause because of the way the bills interact and the fact that Proctor — known for misleading rhetoric — wants them. He’s running for secretary of state, and it certainly appears as though he wants to burnish his resume in advance of primary and general elections.
I reached out to Proctor for comment, asking if he was trying to elect more Republicans and promote his campaign through his committee chairmanship.
He responded: “You are a partisan hack and the Kansas Reflector is a left-wing propaganda rag.”
Proctor also posted a tweet Thursday about chairing the elections committee, declaring that “I am focused on restoring confidence in our elections by increasing transparency. And sometimes, transparency means simply listening to people’s concerns and engaging in a conversation.”
You might read that as meaning he just wants to chat about these bills and see what others think. Count me skeptical. Given his tart dismissal of my questions, Proctor sounds like a man who has made up his mind.
It’s worth seeing these proposals in the context of broader Kansas and national politics.
In August, voters will decide whether to allow state Supreme Court justices to be selected via a popular vote. This would clear the way for the court approve a statewide abortion ban and draconian cuts to school funding. Likewise, Senate and House leaders tried mightily to redistrict U.S. House seats, ousting Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.
The trend lines can glimpsed from close up or far away. Kansas leaders want people to vote, but only if they can be sure that they’ll vote for Republicans.
In a state that hasn’t always done that, it sure looks like GOP leaders are putting their fingers on the scale.

(File skyline photo from Getty Images.)During the 2024 Election, JD Vance and Donald Trump told disgusting, racist lies about Haitians in Springfield and made the southwest Ohio city a national target of hate and extremism.
Pathetic loser neo-Nazis stalked the streets, disrupted community meetings, and protested in front of City Hall. Charity leaders were harassed. Schools closed after being subjected to repeated bomb threats. Business and city leaders were threatened with violence and death.
After telling the racist lies that sparked this hateful chaos in a city of his own constituents, then-U.S. Sen. JD Vance admitted that he would “create stories” to get attention, which is how a child operates.
Now he’s Vice President of the United States.
After Haitians endured campaign lies, an Ohio town prepares for ICE

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tried to be the adult in the room.
He took to the New York Times to shoot down the lies and support the actual community — as opposed to the hate-filled fantasy portrayed by the amoral sociopaths in the right-wing media echo-chamber.
DeWine was born in Springfield.
DeWine and his wife Fran also have deep connections to Haiti, founding a school there named after their late daughter, who they tragically lost in a car accident in 1993.
Amid gang violence in 2024, the Becky DeWine School had to close down.
That current, brutal spat of gang violence stems out of a history of genocide, colonization and slavery, revolution, extortion and impoverishment, and subsequent dictatorship, instability, and violence.
I know the story of one Haitian refugee who escaped the violence there and has been in the U.S. for years under protected status.
Working multiple jobs and living modestly to save as much as possible, she had a home built for herself back in Haiti to eventually move back.
She furnished it and everything, getting it ready: a new couch, a new fridge, a comfy bed.
About two months ago, gangs broke into the home, robbed everything from it, and left it in ruins.
She now has no home to return to, just a pile of rubble.
“Self-deport,” they say: self-deport to violence and disaster.
“Illegal,” they say, as they strip them of their legal status.
During Trump’s first term, he tried to end Temporary Protected Status for refugees from Haiti in 2018 and referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole” countries. Courts blocked him.
Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has now once again set a date to end protected status for Haitian refugees in the United States, on Feb. 3.
A lawsuit against the order is before an appellate court of federal judges, but no decision has yet been given. A ruling is expected Feb. 2.
The Ohio grandma racing to help Haitian parents protect children as more deportations near

Springfield is on edge.
Look for the helpers.
The helpers at the local level are doing everything they can. They’re exhausted. They’re scared.
It’s an absolute disgrace that America has sunk so low. The community has done everything they can.
Now it’s time for Ohio’s elected leaders to do everything they can to help: Make phone calls, back-channel, use whatever influence possible to do everything possible to keep Ohio safe and peaceful.
Springfield, Ohio does not need a vengeance tour of appalling, illegal, unconstitutional, propaganda porn for right-wing internet losers from a sadistic regime.
DeWine has been public about the economic storm that would hit Springfield if the city that has spent years successfully expanding and adjusting to this hard-working, faithful community is suddenly upended by the mass deportation of 10,000 residents.
Factories will be hobbled, jobs will go unfilled, local businesses will close down, city and county revenues will plummet, churches will once again have empty pews, and neighborhoods that had been revitalized will fall again into shambles.
Meanwhile, all those horrific scenes playing out in Minnesota will come to this small Ohio town.
Open abuse of police powers violating the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Violence, hatred, chaos. A maelstrom of madness, based on the lawless whims and childish fantasies of under-trained, under-vetted, unaccountable goon squads.
This the doing of “public leaders” who are mental, intellectual, and emotional toddlers — broken people breaking the world.
They’re too weak and stupid, short-sighted and malicious to have any positive vision for humanity, so they spew forth darkness, resentment, paranoia, division, and hate.
In stark display of their sickness of soul, they delight in the pain and hurt they torment upon others.
They reject the light of truth, compassion, mercy, restraint, benevolence, tolerance, and love. They insult God.
It’s well past time for all adults remaining among Ohio’s so-called leaders to stand up to these children.
It’s time to protect the law — actual, constitutional law. It’s time to protect order. It’s time to protect Ohio’s peace. It’s time for a shred of decency.

It’s right here at home. 
Connecticut loves to brag about being a leader in education. On paper, we spend more than $22,000 per student statewide. Sounds impressive, right? But that is on average.  Walk inside classrooms in Bridgeport, New Britain, or Waterbury, New Haven and Hartford  you’ll see a very different reality entirely.

Joseph Sokolovic

The truth? Our state’s borders, while invisible, impose significant barriers. The lines between wealthy and struggling districts have created a crisis. These borders decide whether a child learns in a classroom with modern technology and psycho/social services or one where even basic resources are stretched thin.
Where you live should determine how you learn. Consider this: Bridgeport spends $18,565 per student. Just a few miles away, Fairfield spends $23,083. That’s a gap of more than $4,500 per child, every single year. Multiply that by Bridgeport’s nearly 20,000 students, and you’re looking at an $88 million shortfall every year.
And Bridgeport isn’t alone. Stamford vs. Darien? $4,400 gap. New Haven vs. Woodbridge? $2,900. These aren’t just numbers, they’re lost teachers, paraprofessionals, assistant principals, tutors, math and literacy coaches,  closed libraries, and fewer counselors for kids who need them most.
How did we get here? 
This isn’t an accident. It’s the predictable result of decades of discriminatory policy choices that tied education funding to property wealth. Connecticut’s school funding system depends heavily on local property taxes. Wealthy towns can raise more money. Poorer towns can’t.  
That gap has deep roots in history:
Redlining: In the 1930s, federal maps labeled certain neighborhoods as “hazardous” for investment, often communities of color. Those areas were cut off from mortgages and development, locking families into cycles of poverty.
Restrictive zoning: Towns adopted policies that limited who could live where, often excluding affordable housing. These zoning laws don’t just exclude people from neighborhoods they shape school student demographics. 
Property tax reliance: Because school funding is tied to property wealth, privilege gets rewarded while poverty gets punished.
Connecticut tried to fix this with the Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula, designed to consider both town wealth and student need. But the foundation amount has been frozen at $11,525 since 2013. Adjusted for inflation, it should be $16,500 today. Advocates are calling for $17,000 per student and a formula that actually reflects student need.
If lawmakers act, districts like Bridgeport could gain  millions annually just enough to match inflation since 2013, and erase Connecticut’s $972 million dollar racial funding gap. That means more teachers, mental health supports, and stability for schools that have been scraping by for decades.
What’s at Stake? Every year we delay, kids lose opportunities they’ll never get back. Libraries close. Counselors disappear. Class sizes grow. And the promise of public education, the idea that every child deserves a fair shot, dies a little more.
The time is now, with the Governor’s race looming and the legislative session beginning on February 4, we need to advocate for a foundation amount of $17,000 in order to increase the funding for our public schools, which as of today will add zero additional dollars to the Education budget next year.
Will you stand with us? Contact your legislators. Testify at a budget hearing. Share this message. Join a local advocacy group like the NAACP. Organize. Because every child deserves a fair shot, no matter their Zip code.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut should invest in programs for underprivileged youth,Maya Singh,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/connecticut-should-invest-in-programs-for-underprivileged-youth/,The benefits offered by children’s educational programs pay for themselves and are vital investments for the future of our country.,"Growing up in Fairfield County, I was privileged enough to enjoy structured summer activities. I spent my days at my town’s recreation camp with my school friends, my afternoon’s practicing my violin, doing summer math and reading packets, and my evening with my family. As I got older, I got the opportunity to go to sleep-away music camp for many years, and special family trips. Not all students have access to enriching summer activities just because of the socioeconomic status they were born into. However, all children should have access to fulfill their potential, and be supported by summer programs that enrich their learning.
I spent the summer of 2025 working as a teacher’s aide in the Horizons Summer Program at CT State Norwalk, formerly known as Norwalk Community College. The Horizons Program provides a tuition-free, year-round academic and enrichment program for under-resourced students, primarily from the Norwalk and Stamford area, aimed at closing the achievement gap. 



The summer program provided Pre-K- eighth grade students the structure of a school day, with the fun of a summer camp. Each day the children received breakfast and gathered in their classroom. The day began with a socio-emotional learning lesson, and then hour-long periods of math, science, and English commenced. A goal of Horizons is to get every student comfortable and confident with swimming. Three times a week, each class would travel to get free swimming lessons. Additionally, enrichment classes such as art, STEM, and karate were provided each week. 
In Connecticut, the academic achievement gap between lower-income students and their more affluent peers is the largest in the nation. The achievement gap is perpetuated by the “summer slide”, a phenomenon that occurs when students lose gains on math and reading over the summer, which affects their growth in the upcoming academic school year. The summer slide is cumulative. By the 5th grade, the gap in learning can be nearly three years. Unfortunately, it is under-resourced children who are most affected by the summer slide. 
Programs like Horizons are vital in closing the achievement gap. Learning of any kind in the summer helps children reinforce good habits like reading and math. The opportunities afforded to middle-class children sustain their learning during summer breaks, including parental involvement, summer reading, family trips, camps, and spending time at libraries and museums. Fortunately, with the wonderfully constructed Horizons Summer Program, and emphasis on math and reading, children from under-resourced communities have access to similarly enriching experiences as their wealthier peers. Horizons students are able to continue their joy of learning, build the skills needed for the next school year and gain confidence that they will be successful.
Horizons is an incredibly successful program. According to Norwalk State’s CEO Cherly De Vanish, Horizon’s students’ grades improve, their attendance increases by 98%, and Horizons students graduate from High School at a rate of 97%. For high school seniors in the Horizons program, 91% of them move onto college or post-secondary training.  
Programs like Horizons at Norwalk State are made possible through funding at the federal and state level, private donations, and volunteer hours. But funding for Horizons is at a plateau right now, as resources at the state level are not enough to cover expenses. The reality is that we are seeing governments struggle with budgets, resulting in funding cuts. In a personal conversation with Horizons at NC State’s Executive Director Renee Rosenbluh, Horizons has received funding from both state and federal grants since 2020. One of the largest influxes of funding included $32,370 in government grants in the 2024-2025 Fiscal Year, which covered less than 10% of total budget expenses. 
For the current fiscal year, the organization is operating under the assumption that state and federal funds for the summer program are not available. I strongly believe that the benefits offered by children’s educational programs pay for themselves and are vital investments for the future of our country. I am calling on Connecticut representatives to advocate for an increase in state funding for afterschool programs, to ensure that Horizons and other programs like it can give its students the quality summer programming they deserve.  It is incumbent on all of us citizens to advocate for these programs, vote for local leaders who prioritize equity in education, and contribute personally in whatever ways we can using our time, money, or both.

In these uncertain times, Connecticut cannot afford to gamble with its health care system.
Our state is already navigating provider shortages, higher operating costs, and tightening federal support. The most irresponsible move we could make is to embrace government-heavy experiments that have failed elsewhere. Whether it is called Connecticut Option, single-payer, public option, universal or government-run, these approaches consistently underdeliver and instead bring higher costs, fewer choices, and market instability.
As insurance brokers, we work every day with employers and families across the state and see firsthand the costly impacts of these mandates and one-size-fits-all designs. Costs are shifted, employers face higher premiums and fewer options, employees shoulder a greater share of out-of-pocket burdens, and small and midsize businesses that are integral to Connecticut’s economy lose the flexibility they need to sustain coverage.
When plan designs are boxed in by blanket rules, innovation stalls and competition withers, leaving consumers with fewer choices and diminished bargaining power. Government intervention that lessens competition doesn’t mean better care; it means the opposite.
We must also acknowledge the strain and fragility within Connecticut’s own market. Several carriers have already left the state, and today we have only three remaining in the fully-insured market – and just one carrier serving both the individual and small-group segments. 
That is not the picture of a healthy competitive market. Connecticut policymakers should be urgently examining why carriers departed, what policies or mandates pushed them out, and what reforms could bring additional competition back into the system. More carriers and more choice are the surest path to downward pressure on premiums and upward pressure on innovation. What we cannot afford is to further shrink the market and risk losing the carriers we have, lest we end up with no choice but a government-run health-care model, which is no choice at all.
Experiences from other states are a warning Connecticut should heed. Public options in progressive states like Washington and Colorado launched with the promise of affordability, but instead have struggled with higher-than-expected premiums and disappointingly low enrollment, placing stress on the private market that millions still rely upon. Single-payer proposals, meanwhile, carry staggering price tags, require sweeping federal waivers, and hinge on new and substantial revenue streams.
In an era of federal belt-tightening, the notion that Washington D.C. will backstop a state-run system is unrealistic. The result is predictable: higher taxes or deep reimbursement cuts that drive providers away, longer wait times, and fewer access points, especially in rural and underserved communities.
There is a better path. Connecticut should build on what works. Empowering employers with a range of sustainable plan options, including responsible self- and level-funded models with strong consumer safeguards, can preserve choice while effectively lowering costs. By focusing on outcomes, preventing avoidable utilization, and steering care to the most effective settings, we can deliver real savings without sacrificing access.
We share policymakers’ goal of making health care more affordable and accessible. But sweeping government-controlled systems would take Connecticut in the wrong direction at the worst possible time. The lesson from elsewhere is clear: when government concentrates control over plan design and pricing, competition diminishes, provider networks shrink, and patients wait longer for care. Connecticut should not repeat those mistakes.
Prudence, partnership, and proven reforms are what our state needs now. By working hand-in-hand with employers, providers, carriers, and brokers, Connecticut can improve affordability and access while preserving the choice and competition that protect patients. Let’s build on what’s working and keep care accessible, affordable, and reliable for the people and businesses who make our state strong.

Spencer Cox’s State of the State speech this year had hints of state policy, while again focusing on building. But now, what needs to be built the most, Cox emphasized, is “moral infrastructure.” 
In an almost 30-minute speech to members of the state Senate and House Thursday evening, Cox called for “a return to virtue,” which, he said, may mean “a return to Utah.”
In today’s Utah, that may take shape by solving challenges, like nearly half of the state’s third graders not being able to read at their grade level. Also, housing affordability struggles, and the growth of homelessness and addiction to both drugs and social media.

Utah may be “perhaps the greatest success story of the American experiment,” Cox said, ranking high on “best of” lists. “And yet, dark clouds are building all around us,” he said, describing a growing sense of loneliness and isolation, especially among young people, despite endless tools to digitally connect.  
2026 priorities 
The governor has a notable animosity against social media companies. So much so that last month he told a room full of tech executives “however much you hate social media, you do not hate it enough,” and, during his tenure, the state has sued social media companies for their “addictive” features.
This year, Cox has unveiled one bill that seeks to fix what he called a mistake the Legislature made last year — to not extend a school cellphone ban throughout the whole school day rather than just class time. 
“Phone-based childhoods are reshaping attention, sleep, relationships, and mental health — not because parents don’t care, but because this is a problem that no single family can solve alone,” he said.
Calling tech companies “the most powerful in human history,” he added he believes the role of government includes establishing “commonsense guardrails.”
“What social media companies do, without a doubt, is tyranny over the minds of our children and grandchildren,” Cox said. “And, well, us adults too.”

However, other tangible issues may also be affecting Utahns’ morale. 
“Too many Utahns are doing everything right,” but are left to wonder if they’ll be able to afford a place of their own, Cox said. 
“This weakens trust and frays the bonds that hold us together.”
He promised that Utah will not become a state of renters, calling leaders to pull every lever to increase housing supply, including zoning reforms, streamline permitting, and more support for infrastructure and innovation. 
But, still, he made a case for small government, saying building more homes “means less government, not more.”
“We will never solve all of our challenges with more laws. This great experiment in self government demands, well, more self government,” Cox said in his speech to Utah lawmakers who this week convened for a 45-day general session, where they are expected to discuss and approve hundreds of bills.
Cox also made a big mention of homelessness, an issue he has vowed to work to solve, and that has made headlines in the state with the announcement of the site of a 1300-bed homeless campus on the west side of Salt Lake City. 
He vowed to make Utah “the worst place in the country to camp on the street, and the best place to get help.” 
Saying that homelessness is growing across the nation, “driven by addiction, mental illness, and the devastating spread of fentanyl,” he committed to help break addiction and crime cycles.
“Real compassion doesn’t leave people trapped. It tells the truth and it restores agency,” he said. “Accountability is not cruelty, it is respect for human dignity.”
‘It has to mean more than words’
“Utah prides itself on being a family state. That has to mean more than words. It means showing up for families in real ways and building a future where they don’t just get by, but truly succeed,” Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla said in legislative Democrats’ response to the State of the State address alongside House Minority Leader Angela Romero.

Both Salt Lake City Democrats committed to fight to advance bills to protect access to food and health care amid federal cuts. Also, to advocate for gun safety laws, protections for the Great Salt Lake, and investments in public education in the state, in addition to other hot topics expected to be studied this session like changes to the judiciary and citizen initiatives.
“At its core, representation is about trust. When people feel seen and respected by their government, our democracy works better,” Romero said. “We are committed to building a Utah where every person knows they belong and has a voice in shaping our shared future.
But no one’s like Utah
During his speech, the Republican governor also took a moment to criticize the country’s two major political parties, saying national elected officials are “making a mockery of Franklin’s virtues, rewarding grift, rejecting decency, and wantonly tearing down the very institutions that made us the envy of every nation.”
Outrage is rewarded and attention is captured by what is loud or divisive, Cox said. And the economy is increasingly profiting from keeping people “scrolling, gambling, borrowing and consuming at the expense of their health, their families and their future.”
But, he said, no other state in the nation reflects virtue more than Utah.
“We still believe in those old fashioned concepts of order, temperance, justice, frugality, industry, humility, sincerity, and yes, even moderation,” he said. “Of course, we have flaws, and we too sometimes drift from those virtues, but I’m grateful to be surrounded tonight by people who love their enemies, still believe in our better angels and try a little harder to be a little better every day.”

Maura Healey’s final State of the Commonwealth before she’s up for reelection featured plenty of criticism of the Trump administration, plus hints of modest new action to rein in costs of living.","A YEAR AGO, when Donald Trump was on the verge of returning to the White House for a second term, the president was barely a shadow in Gov. Maura Healey’s annual address. She never said the name “Trump,” and the only mention of a US president was a passing reference to John F. Kennedy’s 1961 speech in the same room where she stood.
Not so much any more.
Healey on Thursday did not hesitate to bash Trump in her latest State of the Commonwealth speech. Life here is too expensive, she said, and the president is “making it worse.” Healey said Trump “throws tantrums like a two-year-old,” and she slammed the aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement campaigns unfolding across the country as failing to make America safer.
“In this moment, my job as governor is to provide what the federal government isn’t: stability, security, and how about a little common sense?” she said, looking out over the assembled crowd of deputies, lawmakers, labor leaders, and other guests who filled the House chamber.
Two big things have changed to fuel Healey’s more assertive, prosecutorial tone this time around. Massachusetts has now experienced a full year of impacts from Trump 2.0, from massive federal funding cuts to food aid delays to business-spooking tariffs. It’s also an election year for Healey, who is hoping to secure another term in large part by contrasting herself with a president who remains deeply unpopular with Massachusetts Democrats and independents.
The governor and Legislature will have an array of challenges to navigate in 2026. Changes in Washington are punching holes in the state’s budget, and job growth remains relatively flat.
“It’s true we’re facing real headwinds,” Healey said about the economy. “There’s certain things we know are beyond our control. We can’t control inflation. But there are things we can control, and I also want to say this: We have assets that any other state would trade for in a heartbeat.”
Healey dedicated much of her speech to now-repetitive themes of making Massachusetts more affordable and attractive families and businesses, with most of her newest ideas representing modest changes that could nibble at the edges of the affordability debate while the Legislature takes its time weighing bigger proposals.
Healey acknowledged the state’s sky-high housing costs, which polls show is a top concern of voters, but she offered few new initiatives of note. She said the administration will deploy $25 million to help 1,000 middle-income households with down payment assistance, and would put more funding toward lowering mortgage rates for first-time homebuyers through MassHousing.
The governor also pointed to fairly small-bore recent moves, like a 2024 law that makes it easier to build accessory dwelling units and a budget rider that limited landlords from passing broker fees on to renters.
When it comes the state’s high health care costs, her mention of a policy rolled out last week to cut down on prior authorization — a practice in which health insurers require pre-approval before greenlighting certain types of care or medications — drew one of the loudest applause breaks of the night. (Two even bigger cheers came when Healey recognized a pair of local celebrities: Phil Eng, the decidedly unflashy general manager of the MBTA whose steady efforts to get the beleaguered transit agency back on track have given him surprising star power, and Dropkick Murphys frontman Ken Casey, who was seated in the gallery next to Joanna Lydgate, the governor’s partner.)
Healey also signaled she will file regulations that would ban medical debt from being reported to credit agencies.
“It’s bad enough to get a huge bill when you’re dealing with an illness,” she said. “It shouldn’t wreck your credit, too.”
On another front, Healey — speaking as “someone who’s got two kids at home” — said she will file legislation in the coming weeks to impose stricter age protections on social media companies.
The forthcoming bill will largely mirror legislation Attorney General Andrea Campbell proposed last year, according to Healey’s office. Campbell also sued Meta, the giant behind Facebook and Instagram, a case that emerged before the state’s highest court last month.
“These platforms are built with addictive algorithms. They exploit our insecurities, especially our young people,” Healey said, adding that her legislation would require “parental consent [and] age verification for all of these platforms.”
Healey offered an affordability-themed appetizer to her speech Thursday morning. Hours before she ascended the rostrum, she announced a new plan to provide a bit of relief on high utility bills this winter.
The state will redirect $180 million in payments from utilities, which otherwise would have gone toward clean energy and energy efficiency programs, toward taking 15 percent off residential electric bills in February and March.
Electric utilities also plan to postpone about 10 percent of bill costs from the winter months, and instead collect that from ratepayers between April and December. All gas utilities except will do the same, with plans to collect the deferred 10 percent from May through October.
The relief is essentially a short-term fix while Healey waits for her counterparts in the Legislature to get around to her pitch for longer-term solutions.
Back in May, more than half a year before the coldest months and another round of spiking bills were set to arrive, Healey filed legislation with a suite of reforms she said would save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade.
But the Legislature, as it is wont to do, has shown little urgency getting to the topic. Lawmakers hosted a public hearing in June to learn more about the governor’s ideas. Five months later, top representatives began moving a redraft of the bill that added in controversial language to defang the state’s 2030 decarbonization goals; when those changes ran into a buzzsaw of opposition, House leaders retreated.
Representatives met behind closed doors this week to discuss a path forward for Healey’s bill, after which top Democrats questioned just how much power the state even has to rein in utility bills amid federal opposition to clean energy sources, according to State House News Service.
The State of the Commonwealth address came two days after Healey made official her reelection campaign in a video that — not unlike her speech — accused Trump of “making everything worse” and put lowering costs as a central pledge.

NEW CASTLE, Del. — A bartender has been charged after investigators determined she served alcohol to a visibly intoxicated patron who was later involved in a fatal two-vehicle crash in New Castle last fall, authorities said.
Delaware State Police contacted the Delaware Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement after a crash investigation determined the driver involved, Ashley Wright of Dover, had been at Emmaculate Sports Bar before the collision on Nov. 15, 2025.
Investigators said surveillance footage obtained Nov. 18 showed Wright displaying visible signs of intoxication while being served alcoholic beverages at the bar, located at 3800 N. DuPont Highway.
On Jan. 14, 2026, bartender Nia Jones, 30, of Bear, was arrested and charged with sale or service of alcoholic liquors to an intoxicated person, a misdemeanor. She was released on her own recognizance.
In addition to the criminal charge, the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement filed multiple liquor license violations against Emmaculate Sports Bar LLC, including allegations of serving an intoxicated person, failing to report financial interest changes, allowing off-premises alcohol consumption, refilling liquor bottles and improper license posting.
The violations will be heard by the state Alcoholic Beverage Control commissioner.
Authorities have not released additional details about the crash or identified the victim pending court proceedings.
The Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement said it works with law enforcement partners to enforce Delaware’s alcohol laws and promote responsible service in an effort to reduce alcohol-related incidents that place the public at risk.

Chris Wilson, R-Logan, speaks during a media availability with senate leadership at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on the first day of the legislative session, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)While Utah judicial leaders have been telling lawmakers the district courts have the greatest need for additional funding in order to address heavy workloads, legislators advanced a bill Thursday that would give roughly $1.5 million to those lower courts — but would also use more than $3 million to expand the Utah Supreme Court from five to seven justices. 
The Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Criminal Justice Committee voted to favorably recommend SB134 to the full Senate after changing it to call for more money for three additional district court judges in Salt Lake County, Utah County and Washington County. 
The bill — if fully funded during a separate budgeting process — would only partially answer the court system’s budget requests, which includes eight district court judges to help address the state’s overwhelmed lower courts. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Meanwhile, lawmakers are pressing forward with a priority of the state’s three most powerful Republican leaders, Senate President Stuart Adams, House Speaker Mike Schultz, and Gov. Spencer Cox, to add two more seats to the state’s highest court, which is not something the judiciary has said the courts need. 
SB134, sponsored by Senate Minority Whip Chris Wilson, R-Logan, would also expand the Court of Appeals from seven judges to nine, which is a budget priority for the judiciary.
The governor and Republican legislative leaders have said the bill isn’t aimed at “court packing” or changing the makeup of the state’s highest court to appoint justices that make decisions more in the Republican-controlled Legislature’s favor. They argue it’s to better align Utah with other similarly-populated states that have seven justices. 




State populations and supreme court sizes
Utah: 3.6 million, five justices
Wyoming: Less than 600,000, five justices
Montana: 1.1 million, seven justices
Idaho: 2 million, five justices
New Mexico: 2.1 million, five justices
Iowa: 2.38 million, seven justices
Kansas: 3 million, seven justices
Arkansas: 3.1 million, seven justices
Nevada: 3.3 million, seven justices
Connecticut: 3.7 million, seven justices
Colorado: 6 million, seven justices
Arizona: 7.8 million, seven justices




But critics, including Democrats and some legal professionals, argued that the timing and optics of the Utah Supreme Court expansion is concerning. It comes after the Republican-controlled Legislature has clashed with the courts over several rulings, especially in the state’s redistricting lawsuit which recently led to a court-ordered map that included one Democratic district and three heavily GOP districts. 
“The timing here is very suspicious,” said law professor Teneille Brown, who likened the situation to a children’s soccer game. “If you’re worried that your kid is losing and you decide to bring in some refs who are calling fouls (on moves) that you don’t like, when you then win it doesn’t make that victory legitimate, it makes a mockery of the game. This SB134 is no different. Packing the courts for political reasons is wrong, no matter which side is engaging in it.” 
In a media availability earlier Thursday, Adams and Wilson told reporters the proposed Utah Supreme Court expansion isn’t political. Wilson said the two new justices will go through the same appointment process as the existing five.
“Gov. Cox will pick and we’ll confirm, the same way we’ve done with all the other justices,” Wilson said. 
Requests from the judiciary 
A representative for the judiciary — which rarely weighs in on legislation — didn’t comment on the bill during Thursday’s committee hearing. 
However, in his State of the Judiciary speech on Tuesday, Chief Justice Matthew Durrant highlighted key budget requests for the judiciary, including $6 million in ongoing funds to train and retain courthouse staff, and more money to fund eight district court judges, one juvenile court judge, four commissioners, and at least one if not two Court of Appeals judges. 
In order to make room for two more Supreme Court justices, it would cost the state about $1.7 million in one-time money to build new chambers and modify courtroom technology, according to the bill’s fiscal note. The two additional justices would also cost more than $1.4 million in ongoing money for their salary and benefits (which would cost $793,800 for both), along with four law clerks ($557,400) and a judicial assistant ($86,200), plus operational expenses ($35,000). 
Utah Legislature kicks off 1st day of 2026 session with calls to focus on people, cost of living

Wilson’s bill also calls for $1.3 million in ongoing funding for the Court of Appeals for the salary and benefits for two new justices ($761,000 for both), and four law clerks ($557,400). 
The changes to the bill to add three more district court judges in Salt Lake City, St. George and Provo would cost more money — by roughly $1.5 million, or $500,000 per judge including salary, benefits, retirement and staff, the committee’s chair, Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, said. 
Adams, Schultz and Cox have been publicly saying they want to expand Utah’s Supreme Court for months now — but the changes to Wilson’s bill came after Durrant told lawmakers in his speech on Tuesday that the need for more judges in the lower courts is “much greater” than it is in the Utah Supreme Court.
“Today, our district courts operate in triage mode. We need your help to fix that,” Durrant said. “Each of our (budget) requests is grounded in measured, fact-based workload data. Historically, we have received funding for less than one judicial position per year. Although we appreciate any funding previously provided, at that historical rate it would take 20 years to fill the current need for judicial officers in Utah.”
Durrant also urged lawmakers to “weigh the facts and understand the data you’ve been provided, just as we have in developing our requests.” If the Legislature wants to expand the state’s highest court, “that, of course, is your prerogative,” he said.
The chief justice asked that “if you elect to fund two new justices, please do not do it at the expense of the judicial positions we have prioritized.”

“We heard from (Durrant) in his remarks about the need for lower court judges,” Adams said. “And we’re listening.” 
But at the same time, Republican legislative leaders aren’t budging on their plans to expand the Utah Supreme Court. 
Asked earlier Thursday how lawmakers will prioritize the courts in the budget — which is expected to be tight this year given GOP leaders’ appetite for another income tax rate cut, on top of the $300 million already lost due to federal tax changes — Senate Budget Chair Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton, told reporters: “There are certain things we do here we can make happen.” 
“I really believe that we’ll be able to find (money) to fix the courts,” Stevenson said. 
Stevenson acknowledged that in recent years, lawmakers have “had a lot of requests” for the courts. “Some of them we’ve been really, if I can use this word, a little stingy with.” But he added “I think it’s time” to invest more funding in the courts.
“This is an honorable attempt to try and get systemwide resources (for the courts),” Wilson said during Thursday’s committee hearing. “I think it’s time … to bring our state Supreme Court up to the same level as other states that are the same size.”
Debate 
While many who spoke against SB134 said they liked “two-thirds” of the bill because of the additional judges for the Court of Appeals and the district courts, they urged lawmakers to listen to recommendations from the judiciary itself, which hasn’t asked to expand the Utah Supreme Court. 
A retired 2nd District judge, David Connors, said he opposed expanding the Utah Supreme Court at this time “as a fiscal conservative.” 
“The amount of money that would be spent to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court is probably the least effective way to give some assistance to the judiciary right now,” Connors said. “It would be much more effective to take that money and add additional district court judges to those you’ve already agreed to add.” 
In its 2026 report to the Legislature, the judiciary cited a 2025 judicial caseload study that showed district court judicial officers “carrying an average of 112% of a standard caseload, with some districts operating at 122%.” In order to meet “statutory and judicial time standards,” that study identified a need for 12 additional judicial officers. Currently, the state has 89 district court judicial officers; that study called for at least 101.

“Workload growth continues to outpace available resources. Over the past 12 years, hearings increased by 25% and warrant activity by 190%, while the number of district court judges increased by only 8%,” the report says. 
Linda Smith, a Salt Lake City resident and a retired law professor, said “we should listen to the courts regarding what their needs are.” 
“I find them to be very honorable people who will be straight with you,” she said, while arguing against expanding the Utah Supreme Court for “efficiency reasons.” 
Smith said adding two justices to the court would not speed up decisions, but likely lengthen deliberation time because justices collaborate on opinions. She acknowledged, however, that adding more members could have some advantages, including the “possibility of having a more diverse body if you have more people, and I think that has value.”
“I don’t know that there’s a right size, I just don’t think today, with the courts’ requests, is the time to expand the Supreme Court,” Smith said. 
Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City, was the lone “no” vote against Wilson’s bill. 
“One thing that I think is clear from the judiciary is that our lower courts need resources, that the caseloads have increased dramatically, and that the resources that the Legislature is providing is not enough,” Pitcher said. “Ultimately I trust the judiciary to tell us what they need. I don’t think this is the solution.”

Weiler said he agrees with Pitcher “that the court needs more resources,” but he voted in favor of the bill. To accusations of court packing, Weiler noted that before tensions between the courts and the Legislature rose in recent years, “this was something that I was publicly exploring.” 
“But it’s expensive,” Weiler said, adding “that’s a big lift for one bill without leadership support.” 
Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, also supported the bill, even though he noted he has had concerns about “efficiency” of the Utah Supreme Court. 
“I’m not necessarily sure that adding more justices adds to that efficiency, but I do think that having more eyes on things is helpful to getting good reasoning,” he said, while also adding he believes the “most acute problem with the courts is the lack of district court judges.” 
Brammer said SB134 would grant the most new resources to Utah’s courts “in a long, long time.” He said district court judges “work incredibly hard, they’re trying their best, their case loads are out of control, and they need help.”
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, also voted in favor of it because she viewed the amendment to add three district court judges as a way to “start addressing the lower court needs.”
“This is just a first step,” Escamilla said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)State auditors found that the Maryland State Department of Education failed to adequately oversee hiring and background checks by local school systems to ensure that new hires were properly vetted and credentialed.
In an audit released Thursday, the Office of Legislative Audits also said the department may have risked millions in federal payments by not seeking federal funding reimbursement in a timely manner. And auditors were sufficiently concerned about the handling of two no-bid contracts that they referred the issue to the attorney general’s criminal division for further investigation.
State school officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. In their written reply in the audit, however, they agreed with most of the findings on local schools and said they are working to correct the issues with local school systems.
But the department disagreed with the suggestion that it had risked federal funding, saying it is working to get reimbursement but that the task has been made more difficult by mayhem at the federal level, due to job cuts and program elimination.
The audit covered a review of MSDE’s operational and financial procedures from June 1, 2021, through July 15, 2024.
The department oversees Maryland’s 24 local education agencies (LEAs), which are responsible for hiring personnel to work in local schools. The hiring process is supposed to include background checks and screenings to ensure that employees are safe to work with children.
But according to the audit, MSDE did not have a procedure in place to check whether local agencies were conducting those screenings. Meanwhile, three local education agencies disclosed that “required screenings were not always being performed,” auditors said.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

The pre-employment screenings require a “written statement by the applicant attesting they were not the subject of a child sexual abuse or sexual misconduct investigation by any employer that resulted in a finding,” the audit notes. The screening process also requires that the local agencies contact an applicant’s current or previous employer to verify that information.
The audit had a similar concern regarding criminal background checks, saying the department did not have “comprehensive procedures to ensure individuals with disqualifying criminal backgrounds were not employed at LEAs.” Disqualifying criminal backgrounds include convictions of certain offenses against minors and crimes of violence.
MSDE agreed with those findings and promised to develop regulations and procedures “to require each LEA to submit an annual attestation to the State Board of Education that it has complied” with pre-hiring screenings and criminal background check requirements. The agency also plans to “establish a new regulation requiring each LEA to annually provide a copy of its hiring procedures.”
Lost federal funds
The audit also found that MSDE did not always request federal funding reimbursement in a timely manner, risking millions in federal payments that may no longer be recoverable.
In one example, the state spent $194 million from a federal grant program from December 2023 through July 2024, but it did not request reimbursement until September 2024. As a result, the state “lost investment interest totaling at least $3.6 million from these grants that would have been earned had the funds been requested and received timely,” the audit said.
The audit also found that the education department did not request reimbursement for $20.7 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds, potentially losing those dollars too.
“During January 2024, MSDE requested and received $90.5 million from the federal government related to one grant, when it should have requested only $20.7 million,” the audit said. “MSDE advised us that it detected this error and returned the entire $90.5 million to the federal government in May 2024, but has not requested the $20.7 million that should have originally been recovered.”
Labor Department missed chance to recover $760 million in overpaid unemployment, audit says

State auditors acknowledged that recent developments from the Trump administration may create challenges for other COVID-19 related reimbursements.
In March, the U.S. Department of Education notified states that COVID-19 grant liquidation period was ending, effective immediately, which complicated retrieval of COVID-19 reimbursements. A court-ordered injunction of that federal funding freeze may allow for some of those funds to be released, but “there is still a possibility that these funds may no longer be available,” the auditors said.
MSDE told auditors in April the sudden halt to COVID-19 grant payments would result in an potential loss of at least $232 million in COVID-19 grants.
“This includes approximately $127 million for amounts expended by MSDE, and $105 million for local education agency (LEA) expenditures that were not yet paid by MSDE,” the audit said.
In its response, MSDE stressed that it has worked to get as much COVID-19 relief funding back from the federal government as possible.
“MSDE has been engaged in multi-prong efforts in recovering the COVID-19 grants from the federal government,” MSDE said. “These included direct engagement with the USED [federal department], participating in a multi-state coalition lawsuit against the federal government and engaging Maryland’s congressional delegations to impress upon the USED the importance of timely reimbursement.
“In June 2025, the USED reversed the decision to end the extended liquidation period and restored the original liquidation period,” MSDE’s response continued. “However, due to the continued layoffs and attrition within the USED as well as the federal government shutdown, the reimbursement process did not progress as quickly as anticipated.”
Non-competitive contracts
Meanwhile, another finding led auditors to notify the Office of the Attorney General’s Criminal Division about some of the agency’s contract procurements.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Auditors found that MSDE awarded about $1.2 million in grants and contracts without performing a competitive procurement process and “could not always support that the related deliverables were received.”
The audit points to two grants in 2023 where an out-of-state vendor was paid $700,000 to conduct an analysis of 138 Title 1 schools and provide intensive coaching for 27 of those schools. MSDE awarded that funding “without a competitive process when these services may have been provided by a State university,” the audit said.
MSDE could not provide documentation that the vendor conducted the analysis or the coaching services.
“Based on the questionable nature of the awards and the lack of support of the related deliverables we were able to substantiate the allegation, which we referred to the Office of the Attorney General’s Criminal Division,” the audit says. “A referral to the Criminal Division does not mean that a criminal act has actually occurred or that criminal charges will be filed.”
The contract finding started with a tip to the Office of Legislative Audits’ fraud, waste and abuse hotline, the audit said.

Responsible forest management can reduce smoke, carbon emissions and wildfire risk.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bob Warrington: Controlled burns protect Vermont’s air.","Dear Editor,
The smoke-filled, unhealthy air quality last summer reminded us all again how wildfires out West and in Canada still affect us here in Vermont. 
Beyond our exposure to smoke and particulate matter, the massive amounts of carbon dioxide released further stoke global warming and increase the likelihood of more wildfires.
Risk of severe forest fires centers on the density and dryness of the trees, shrubs, grasses and forest debris that act as fuel.

While we value trees for their carbon storage capacities, too high a level of tree density makes them compete for resources—such as water, sunlight and nutrients—rendering them weaker and creating more debris, which provides a continuous bed of highly flammable elements in the forest. 
Controlled burns and responsible forest thinning can decrease excessive fuel as well as increase resilience to extreme drought. The U.S. Forest Service estimates some 80 million acres need restoration management, but it is only conducting controlled burns on about 2 million acres annually. 
One big reason for such slow progress is that the permitting processes are unduly cumbersome, adding years to the implementation of mitigation plans.
The revised Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA), currently under consideration in Congress, removes bureaucratic permitting roadblocks that slow wildfire mitigation projects, while also protecting endangered species. 
In a rare bipartisan effort, the Senate has voted it out of committee. We urge you to contact Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., telling them we need this legislation to help protect us from smoke and particulate-filled air.
