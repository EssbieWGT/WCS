(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)If a slot machine gives skillful players the ability to win every time, is it illegal under Pennsylvania’s Crimes Code and Gaming Law?
That was the question the state Supreme Court set out to answer Thursday in a pair of appeals by the commonwealth’s attorney general’s office and Department of Revenue. 
“This court has been very clear,” Senior Deputy Attorney General Susan Affronti told the justices. “Gambling is the hope of gaining something beyond the amount played, and that’s what creates the dangers associated with gambling.”
The court has said in the past that a single feature, such as the memory game included in leading maker Pace-O-Matic’s Pennsylvania Skill games, can’t change the fundamental nature of a gambling device, Affronti, who argued for the attorney general’s office, added. 
Rather, a game’s maker must show that skill is a predominant aspect of the game, and in Pennsylvania Skill Games, the skill element is difficult, tedious and completely optional. Many players, Affronti claimed, skip it to continue betting in hopes of winning a jackpot.
But how people play the game isn’t a workable way to determine whether it’s illegal, attorney Matthew Haverstick argued. He represented Capital Vending Co., that was charged after a 2019 state police raid on Champion Sports Bar in Highspire, Dauphin County, where it had provided skill games.

Haverstick said both his clients and the commonwealth agree the correct standard, established by the court more than 40 years ago, is whether skill is the predominant factor in whether a player wins or loses. 
And Pace-O-Matic’s games allow players who lose the slot machine-style bet to win back their money plus 5%, Haverstick said. They just have to be good enough at remembering and repeating an increasingly complicated pattern of colors that one attorney involved in the case compared to the 1980s electronic game Simon.
Haverstick also argued Pace-O-Matic’s games fall outside of the definition of slot machines set by the state Gaming Control Board.
“When you look at the regs the Gaming Control Board sets what a slot machine … has to pay out,” he said, noting that the requirement is a return of between 85% and 100%. Pennsylvania Skill games allow players to win back up to 105%. “It can never be a game or slot machine rather, as defined under that statute.” 
The state agencies are challenging lower court rulings that neither the Gaming Law or the Criminal Code apply to skill games. The devices, which look like casino video slot machines, have become fixtures in corner stores, gas stations and social clubs in a billion dollar industry that developed since a Beaver County judge first ruled they’re not illegal in 2014.
The commonwealth never appealed that decision and every court that has examined Pace-O-Matic’s devices, has determined they are legally games of skill, according to the Georgia-based company.
In recent years, however, state lawmakers have undertaken efforts to pass legislation that would regulate and tax the skill game industry or ban the machines completely. Proposals during budget negotiations this year devolved into infighting among state Senate Republicans over the rate. Proposals ranged from Gov. Josh Shapiro’s call for 52%, which is the rate casinos pay, to 16%, favored by Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming), whose district is home to the company that builds Pennsylvania Skill machines.
Jason Levine, who represents a majority of the state’s 17 casinos in a brief to the Supreme Court, said the skill game question is important to casino owners, who say they lose business because of the devices. But he said it’s a crucially important question for the commonwealth and Pennsylvanians who benefit from the taxes casinos pay on slot machine revenue. 
Under the Gaming Law, in addition to supporting the horse racing industry and the state property tax relief fund, gambling revenue goes toward state government and local governments through economic and community development grants.
“The stakes could not be higher for the commonwealth and casinos as well as the mom and pop shops facing a loss of revenue,” Levine said.  “I think the thing that all of the parties can agree to is that clarity is needed from the Supreme Court.”
The justices on Thursday questioned how often players use the skill element to attempt to recoup their money. Affronti said the machines deliver a win 8% of the time and the rest of the time players have the ability to go on to the skill section, but only if they touch a button marked “follow me.”
“It’s not explained,” Affronti said. “It’s not telling you ‘press this button to use skill.’ … There’s no suggestion that’s a way to win your money back. The only way you discover that is if you, for some reason, touch there and then, and only then is the skill game explained.”
Justice Christine Donohue asked Affronti whether it’s legal to give people the opportunity to gamble.
“They can walk into an establishment and never intend to play ‘follow me.’ Just continue to put money into the machine and pull it and pull it and pull it … with the hope that their gamble will pay off and they will get the jackpot,” Donohue said.
Affronti agreed, adding that is why the court must identify the predominant aspect of the game. 
“What is the game really about?” Affronti asked “This isn’t a game of Whac-a-Mole. This isn’t a game of Skee-Ball. This is a slot machine.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/skill-games-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 19:56:49.723632

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)With tension ongoing between Utah’s Legislature and judiciary, the Utah Senate confirmed Judge John Nielsen as the state’s newest Supreme Court justice in a party-line vote.
Following this week’s 19-6 vote, Gov. Spencer Cox’s nominee thanked state leaders and his family for entrusting him with the role.
“We live in a contentious time, but it’s my hope to be a voice of reason and respect. I deeply love this state, my lifelong home. I love the law and I love the court, and I will do my utmost to ensure a legacy of trust. I pledge my best efforts and gratefully accept this weighty responsibility,” Nielsen said in his brief remarks.

Nielsen, who described his judicial philosophy as “textualist” and “originalist” at the news conference announcing his nomination, was well received by Republicans who have been quick to accuse judges of “judicial activism” in rulings they disagree with.
Democrats, meanwhile, flagged his role in some of the state’s most heated political lawsuits, including over abortion and transgender student sports participation.
Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, highlighted Republican lawmakers’ criticism of the judiciary and said she would prefer a candidate who could be a check on the Legislature and an unbiased arbiter.
While Pitcher praised Nielsen’s legal experience, she said his appointment “feels like we are injecting politics into the appointment process, and that is not our role.”
“I find him to be incredibly intelligent, but his background does not inspire much confidence with litigants or the public that we are selecting someone who will be fair, neutral and unbiased,” Pitcher said.

Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, pushed back on those criticisms, saying that in the years they have known each other since attending law school together at Brigham Young University and throughout Nielsen’s “stellar legal career,” there have been no claims that Nielsen has done anything improper or that he lacks experience.
The criticism is “not pointing to his impartiality as a judge, which has not been questioned. It’s not going to any of his qualifications. It is solely on the basis of partisanship without regard to whether or not he can be an impartial justice,” Brammer said. “Are we ready to say that ‘because you represented a client that I disfavor, you are no longer allowed to be on the bench?’” 
When Nielsen was nominated, Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant praised Nielsen’s selection and his abilities in the courtroom, which he said he has witnessed numerous times in the past 25 years.
“And in those 25 years, I have never seen a better oral and written advocate. His writing has always been impeccable, honest, to the point,” Durrant said.
The governor appointed Nielsen to the 3rd District Court in September 2024 after his work in different private ventures — including a joint firm with former Utah Associate Chief Justice Thomas Lee, Sen. Mike Lee’s brother. Nielsen also worked 11 years as solicitor general in the Utah Attorney General’s Office, and years as an adjunct associate professor at the University of Utah.
He replaces outgoing Associate Chief Justice John Pearce, who is retiring Dec. 1.

(Courtesy The Center for Land Use Interpretation)A coalition of environment and health organizations requested the New Mexico Environment Department take immediate action Thursday toward air monitoring and developing community health guidance following an explosion at an oil refinery in Artesia.
HF Sinclair’s Navajo Refinery, located in southeast New Mexico and the Permian Basin, experienced an explosion and fires on Oct. 31, which injured three and caused thick smoke to waft over the city. 
Members of the Permian Basin Climate Justice Coalition, which represents more than 20 organizations devoted to environment, health and community advocacy, sent a letter Thursday to New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney asking for the department to take action to protect southeastern New Mexicans. 
They specifically called for the department to install a permanent air monitor in Artesia; provide real-time air-quality data to the public; develop health guidance for the public in cases of industrial emergencies; hold a public meeting in Artesia within a month to let the public know the plans for air safety and monitoring; and establish a mobile air monitoring unit in the Permian Basin.
NMED stated in January 2025 that the department had secured funding for such a mobile unit through a $500,000 settlement between WildEarth Guardians and OXY USA, Inc., an oil and gas producer in the region. 
“Our coalition has documented countless spills, leaks, and releases across the Permian. When something like this [explosion] happens, people deserve truth and transparency,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Numerous studies now document the health impacts experienced by people living in the oilfields. Air monitoring shouldn’t be optional in communities surrounded by refineries and fracking sites.”
NMED Director of Communications Drew Goretzka told Source in a written statement Thursday that the department has not had a chance to thoroughly review the coalition’s letter yet. 
“Sec. Kenney and the Department are open to all community monitoring actions that can better protect New Mexican’s air quality in the wake of the HF Sinclair Navajo Refinery explosion,” Goretzka wrote.
The coalition pointed out that the NMED operates two air monitors in the Permian Basin in Carlsbad and Hobbs, but these monitors do not track air pollution around Artesia.
“The Artesia refinery has operated for more than a century, making this not a new problem but a long-ignored one,” the coalition’s letter states. “An independent air monitor in this community is beyond long overdue. No parent should have to wonder whether it’s safe for their children to trick-or-treat outside, breathe the evening air, or go to school the next morning.”
Mariel Nanasi, executive director of New Energy Economy, said in a statement that air pollutants are a known cause of asthma, mortality and other ailments, and residents in the Permian Basin “deserve” to be protected from such harms. 
“Action cannot be taken until the state acts to collect data and provide families with real-time information so they can protect themselves, their children and the elderly when ozone precursors, [Volatile Organic Compounds] and particulates rise to dangerous levels,” Nanasi said. “The state cannot continue to depend on the EPA to take action to protect its own residents. They are depending on NMED to take action.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sinclair-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-20 19:56:49.723632

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)An Idaho legislative task force aimed at improving government efficiency and cutting costs on Wednesday moved forward proposals to eliminate or merge six state entities with an estimated savings of just over $300,000 a year. 
Some of the proposals considered at Wednesday’s meeting at the Capitol in Boise either had no estimated savings or staff had not yet been able to analyze how much could be saved. 
The Idaho DOGE Task Force, named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency previously helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, held four additional proposed mergers or eliminations for further consideration.  
The ideas lawmakers advanced were: 

Eliminate the Bingo-Raffle Advisory Board and place its duties under the Lottery Commission.
Merge the Soil and Water Commission with the Department of Water Resources  
Move the STEM Action Center into the Workforce Development Council 
Eliminate the regional committees for the state Infant and Toddler Program Early Intervention Services 
Eliminate the Idaho Honey Commission 
Integrate the animal health duties of the Sheep and Goat Board into the Department of Agriculture 

The task force cannot pass legislation but will bring forward recommendations to the rest of the Legislature when it convenes for the 2026 session, which begins Jan. 12. 
Most of the decisions were unanimously approved by task force members, except for the vote to propose elimination of the Idaho Honey Commission. Sen. Carrie Semmelroth, D-Boise, and Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, voted no, with Semmelroth noting that the department staff did not consult the Honey Commission before making the recommendation.

Task Force co-chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, said he would vote to move forward the recommendation for consideration, but he thought it was “important that (the Honey Commission) weigh in, and have an opportunity to weigh in, which they will on legislation.” 
The task force held for further review the following proposals: 

Consolidate the Lottery Commission and State Liquor Division 
Merge the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Office of Species Conservation 
Eliminate community college Dormitory Housing Commissions 
Integrate the State Brand Board into the Department of Agriculture

 Proposals had varied results for saving state money 

Agency heads brought the proposals to the committee in response to an executive order by Gov. Brad Little issued in August. Some agency staff began looking into the merger or elimination proposals earlier, including Workforce Development Council Executive Director Wendi Secrist. 
Secrist in August 2024 also became director of the STEM Action Center, which is meant to facilitate educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM. 
She began evaluating the merger last summer, and her proposal indicated that the state general fund would see savings of around $300,000 a year by eliminating two staff positions.

Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, questioned how the effectiveness of STEM Action Center activities are measured and its $6 million a year total cost. 
“How can you guys as Workforce Development Council actually bring evaluational processes to this, to actually make these where they’re actually worthwhile for the state?” Tanner asked Secrist.
Lakey echoed Tanner’s questions. 
Secrist said staff is in the process of creating new ways to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs that are less focused on outputs, such as how many events were attended or how many students attended them. 
The other proposal with a cost-savings estimate came from Cally Younger, administrator of the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources. 
Younger said the idea to merge the energy office with the species conservation office existed from the time when she worked for former Gov. Butch Otter. 
In doing so, she estimated about four full-time positions could be eliminated with a savings of about $360,000 a year.
“It makes a lot of sense, because our offices serve very similar functions,” Younger said. “We both serve as liaisons to the federal government on our offices’ issues.” 
Scott asked why the species conservation office wouldn’t move to Idaho Fish and Game, and Tanner suggested eliminating the Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and instead having Younger work on those issues as a staff member in the governor’s office. 
Younger responded with concerns to both of those ideas, including that the Fish and Game’s mission was very different in dealing with hunting and fishing regulation rather than protecting endangered species, and that eliminating her office would not result in much savings because it is federally funded. 
Scott made a motion to hold the proposal in committee to consider other avenues. Tanner agreed with the motion, and said he still saw benefits of eliminating the Energy and Mineral Resources office. 
The proposal to integrate the animal health duties of the Sheep and Goat Board into the Department of Agriculture was a “revenue wash,” according to Lloyd Knight, deputy director of the Idaho State Agriculture Department. 
Other proposals mentioned Wednesday did not include cost-saving estimates. 
 Task force will continue looking into other proposals 

The task force plans to continue looking into many of the proposals, including the ones that did not move forward. 
Some of those proposals come with complications. For instance, the merger of the lottery and liquor entities may require constitutional changes, according to Andrew Arulanandam, state director of lottery and liquor. He said while the two programs share a director, they “serve fundamentally different missions.” 
The Dormitory Housing Commissions are a largely obsolete method by which Idaho community colleges may finance on-campus housing and student facilities. However, North Idaho College has a $7.2 million bond for a recreation center owned by its Dormitory Housing Commission, said Jennifer White, executive director of the Idaho State Board of Education. The bond will be active until 2046, she said. 
Co-chair Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said he hopes to plan one more meeting in December. He told the Sun the members would continue to look at agency staffing and other proposals, as well as other ideas from task force members. 
He said other issues will have to be addressed in future legislative sessions, and on Wednesday said the task force’s work is a “multi-year project.”

The Joint Revenue Committee voted Wednesday to sponsor a bill to eliminate residential property taxes, another to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss.
The post Lawmakers advance plan to revamp Wyoming’s tax structure appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee voted Wednesday to sponsor a pair of bills to eliminate residential property taxes and to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss.
The meeting in Cheyenne marked the last of the committee’s off-season work that prioritized property tax reforms and relief for homeowners. The topic has been a focal point for the Legislature since at least 2022. 
Lawmakers have already, in recent years, expanded the state’s refund program, amended the constitution with the support of voters to separate residential property into a separate tax class and capped annual increases. 
The Legislature has also added several property tax exemptions to state law — creating a complicated web in the process — but no enacted measure has been so sweeping as abolishing residential property taxes altogether. 
Meanwhile, raising or creating new taxes has historically been a non-starter for Wyoming’s Republican-dominated statehouse. But lawmakers find themselves in new territory, with some arguing that the state’s tax system needs a thorough overhaul. 
The committee also voted to sponsor several other property tax bills, including one to repeal a sunset date on an exemption for long-term homeowners, another to amend the Wyoming Constitution to allow for an acquisition-value tax system similar to California. 
How we got here 
Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide proposed abolishing all property taxes during a Revenue Committee meeting in June. 
“We need to shift to a new system,” Ide said at the June meeting, before bringing a motion to draft a bill repealing most of Article 15 of the Wyoming Constitution. 
Sen. Bob Ide (R-Casper) speaks during the Wyoming Legislature’s 2024 budget session. (Ashton Hacke,/WyoFile)
That version, if passed by the Legislature and approved by voters, would have eliminated all property taxes — residential, commercial, industrial and personal — which brought in $2 billion in the 2024 tax year. 
The committee instead approved a narrowed version of that proposal Thursday that would only eliminate residential property taxes. Lawmakers voted 9-1, with four excused, to sponsor the bill. 
Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, was the sole dissenting vote, while Sens. Stephan Pappas, R-Cheyenne, Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, and Reps. Liz Storer, D-Jackson, and Bob Wharff, R-Evanston, were excused. 
Because the bill amends the Wyoming Constitution, it requires voter approval. Meanwhile, legislation to raise sales taxes would only go into effect if the constitutional amendment passes. 
The state sales tax rate is 4%. The bill would increase it to 6%, which would be in addition to the local county sales taxes. All but one county — Sublette — have an additional 1% to 3% sales, according to Department of Revenue data. 
The bill is estimated to bring in approximately $475 million, which would then be transferred to local governments to fund local services. 
The committee voted 8-4, with two excused, to sponsor the bill. The dissenting votes included Sen. Case and Reps. Jayme Lien, R-Casper; J.R. Riggins, R-Casper; and Clarence Styvar, R-Cheyenne. Storer and Pappas were excused. 
Discussion 
“I think what we’re trying to do here is protect our citizens. That’s all we’re trying to do,” Ide said. “And a sales tax, a consumption tax is probably the best avenue to protect those citizens from what’s going on back in Washington with deficit spending and stimulus and all of those things.”
Ide also said no member of the committee had reported hearing from their constituents, “we wish you wouldn’t have lowered our property taxes.”
The committee, however, heard nearly that very thing when it met in Ide’s district in August, when about two dozen local homeowners urged lawmakers to skip further property tax cuts. 
“Don’t defund and destroy our institutions,” Lisa Jamieson, a Casper homeowner, told the committee in August, echoing others at the meeting. “I think what’s important to people like me is, I would like for our communities to remain nice places to live, and I’m willing to pay taxes to keep that going.”
Recent property tax cuts have had an asymmetrical impact on counties, as a recent WyoFile collaboration detailed. While some haven’t experienced much belt tightening, others are eyeing cuts to various public services, like road maintenance and election administration.

“Listening to all of this, it makes my stomach hurt in the sense that you are cutting off the legs of our communities and pulling the blanket out from under them,” said Beth Blackwell, the city of Newcastle’s grant and loan specialist.
Blackwell previously worked as the grant loan manager for the Office of State Lands and Investments, where she said she saw firsthand how local governments, including special districts, rely on property taxes. Moving to sales taxes — a more volatile revenue source — will make it difficult for local officials to effectively budget, Blackwell said. 
Sen. Case, an economist, reiterated that point. 
“Sales tax, they’re the most erratic of your tax forms. We already have a problem with erratic revenue streams from our minerals,” Case said. 
For others, eliminating property taxes was the type of solution lawmakers have long sought. 
“I frankly see this is the best thing I’ve heard, is doing away with the property tax,” Rep. Wharff said. “Let people actually own their homes and do away with this perpetual tax that we have to pay on our property.”
The slate of bills will now go to the full Legislature for consideration. The 2026 budget session begins Feb. 9.

Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal issued a temporary injunction Monday blocking Lee’s deployment of the national guard, agreeing with the plaintiffs that it likely violated the “terms and conditions of Tennessee’s Military Code.” But she told the state that if they appealed her ruling, which they did, she would lift the injunction during the appeal process. 
Moskal formally lifted her injunction on Wednesday.
Lee assigned members of the national guard to patrol the streets of Memphis starting in October as part of a task force created by President Donald Trump a month earlier. 
Tennessee governor to appeal ruling against Guard in Memphis

The Memphis Safe Task Force is made up of hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers working in conjunction with local law enforcement. This case does not impact its work in Memphis. 
It’s unclear how many national guard personnel are stationed in Memphis. The Memphis police said there are about 200, but recent court filings indicate more than 700 are currently there.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and several other local and state lawmakers filed the lawsuit to block the guard’s deployment, arguing that the Tennessee Constitution only allows it to be used in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” and “even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
Attorneys representing Lee and the state contend that deploying the national guard falls within the governor’s authority and that the judiciary has no oversight on the executive decision.
Moskal noted in her Monday ruling that Lee never issued an official order, putting out a press release about the deployment after Trump signed a memo creating the task force. The Tennessee legislature also never voted to send Guard personnel to Memphis, as required by law, and Shelby County leaders didn’t request the deployment.

The Conservation Fund acquired the 600-acre parcel from private landowners and facilitated a sale to the Forest Service in 2025. (Courtesy The Conservation Fund)A swath of land within the Tobacco Root Mountains that was privately owned is now part of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest after nonprofit organization The Conservation Fund facilitated a land sale this fall. 
The 600-acre inholding parcel covered the upper reaches of Dry Boulder Lakes Road including sections of trail that are the gateway to Lower and Upper Boulder Lakes. The area is now fully open and accessible to the public. 
“Connecting Montana’s patchwork of public and private lands is the kind of problem the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created to solve,” Gary Sullivan, Montana state director for The Conservation Fund, said in a statement. 
According to The Conservation Fund, the trail to reach the lakes winds through roughly four miles of alpine forest and granite basins, and provides access to high-elevation lakes with native trout populations as well as late-season hunting opportunities in the rugged backcountry of the Tobacco Roots.  
Prior landowners allowed road access to Boulder Lakes across their property through an informal agreement, and Sullivan said the owners, who preferred to remain unnamed, saw public access and conservation as a priority. 
When the landowners decided to sell the property, The Conservation Fund bought the property in 2024 as the first step to transferring the inholding to the federal government. 
Sullivan said he sees the nonprofit organization as a “bridge financier” for conservation land deals, that has worked on more than 9 million acres of land acquisitions across all 50 states.
A screenshot from Montana Cadastral showing the parcel added to the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest outlined in blue.
The organization partners with government agencies — federal, state, municipal, or county — or occasionally other nonprofits such as land trusts, to provide funding and swift action on real estate transactions. 
“In many cases, like Boulder Lakes, we’re painfully aware of how slowly government moves,” Sullivan told the Daily Montanan, adding that federal funding cycles are often years ahead of property sales. “There’s a lot of ‘Gary, we don’t have the money right now, and Congress can’t appropriate the funds for a few years.’”
“We’re nimble, we’re small, we have real estate expertise, and we can swoop in and do what we do,” Sullivan said. 
In the case of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, Sullivan said the landowners were eager to put the land into public hands, but didn’t want to wait for the wheels of federal government to come around on funding and the due diligence process required. 
Sullivan said that when The Conservation Fund steps in to make a conservation purchase like this, the organization makes sure the partner agency, in this case the Forest Service, has the property in their sights as a priority funding project. He said the average hold time for properties before they are sold to the partner agencies is roughly 12-18 months. 
The Boulder Lakes property was purchased by the organization in October, 2024 and sold to the Forest Service in September. 
“There’s always some risk we take on and always the chance of delays in every project, but we make sure we acquire properties by meeting all the due diligence standards required by our partners,” Sullivan said.
He said that another priority is land that’s considered biologically important to the greater ecosystem. 
Many of the parcels The Conservation Fund works with are similar to the Boulder Lakes property — inholdings held by private owners but surrounded by federal, state or locally-managed public land. 
In 2022 The Conservation Fund acquired another nearly 600-acre inholding just a few miles across the Beaverhead-DeerLodge Forest, selling it to the Forest Service in 2024.
Sullivan said the potential impact of private property adjacent to public lands goes far beyond the potential of development. 
“Inholdings have a much greater overall impact to the public land base than the actual acreage,” he said. “Habitat fragmentation is a problem for animals, and it’s in our interest to preserve the ecological integrity of these huge blocks of public land. 
He added that completing blocks of public land can cut down on management costs as well — arguments he uses with congressional staffers when working on securing the funding needed for an agency to purchase land. 
“If we can prevent these from being developed, it saves taxpayer money,” Sullivan said. “If there’s an access road the public is using, but the landowner isn’t spraying for weeds, that can carry noxious weeds into public land. If there’s a wildfire, the Forest Service has to defend the private property. There’s real tangible benefits to trying to acquire these properties, and that includes real cost-saving measures.”
The Forest Service acquisition of the property was done with funds allocated by the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was permanently funded in 2020 by the Great American Outdoors Act, a bill championed by Montana’s senior U.S. Sen. Steve Daines. 
“As a lifelong sportsman, protecting and promoting access to Montana’s beautiful public lands has always been one of my top priorities,” Daines said in a statement. “I was proud to pass the Great American Outdoors Act in 2020 which permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and I’m thrilled to see that access to the Boulder Lakes will be provided.  I commend the Conservation Fund for their work on this project, so that Montana’s great outdoors are accessible for all to enjoy.”
Earlier this month, the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest announced it had acquired another 396-acre on the northwest side of the Tobacco Roots along Point of Rocks Road. 
That acquisition was facilitated by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and also utilized LWCF funds. 
Sullivan applauded the work of the congressional delegation in supporting the project and making sure LWCF funds were made available. 
“Montanans love our public lands, and The Conservation Fund recognizes that we all have a role to play in protecting them for future generations,” he added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/View-from-Boulder-Lakes-Property-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

Larry Rhoden pushed back Thursday on a lawmaker’s suggestion that the agricultural industry should be more tightly regulated to improve water quality.
“Rest assured,” Rhoden told town hall attendees, “he’s going to be set straight on a few of his issues in a very kind, civil way. But I will have conversations.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said during a legislative committee meeting Wednesday that it might be time to “get serious” about new regulations on agriculture to address the state’s polluted rivers and lakes.
With so much polluted water, SD lawmaker says state can no longer ‘dance around’ ag regulations

“And that’s pretty scary for folks, especially for those that are in the community that starts with the letter ‘A’ and ends with ‘G,’” Karr said during the meeting. “We can sit here and talk about it, and dance around it all day. I think you can have some incentives, but we’re going to have to look at some restrictions as well, and regulate.”
Karr’s comments came after Legislative Research Council staff shared a report that over three-quarters of monitored river and stream miles in the state fail to fully support at least one of their intended uses — such as swimming, fishing or boating — with similar problems in many lakes.
Rhoden, a rancher, said during his Thursday town hall at the Canopy by Hilton hotel in Sioux Falls that Karr’s comments were “misinformation,” saying they were “made out of ignorance.” He added that “nobody on the planet has a bigger, more vested interest in protecting our environment and natural resources” than farmers and ranchers.
Rhoden told the media after the event that making a “carte blanche statement that we need more regulations is unhelpful, to say the least.”
Lawmakers agree water quality is an issue in Iowa

In an interview later Thursday with South Dakota Searchlight, Karr said Rhoden reached out to him to talk about the comments. Karr said he hopes the discussion and the controversy around his comments will lead to a larger conversation surrounding South Dakota’s surface water quality.
He added that he “didn’t mean to pick on ag in particular,” but that the state will “have to look at restrictions and runoff” in rural and urban settings to improve surface water quality. The agricultural community has already risen up in defense, Karr said, as he predicted in his Wednesday comments.
“There’s been a pretty strong reaction,” Karr said, “but I’m hoping it’ll bring folks to the table to say that 75% failure in our rivers and streams is something we can’t live with.”
South Dakota has “proactive” programs in place to address water quality in the state, Rhoden said, including grants to reduce livestock waste runoff into waterways. Karr said he’s been speaking with water districts for years to learn about the state’s surface water quality problems, and he played a role in the $3 million infusion into a Big Sioux River grant program with 2021 legislation.
A recent final report on that program said it resulted in 67 buffer projects spanning 83 linear miles under 10-year contracts. The buffers prevent an estimated 1,500 pounds of phosphorus, 6,500 pounds of nitrogen and 1,000 tons of sediment from entering the Big Sioux River watershed each year.
Rep. Drew Peterson, R-Salem, a farmer, told South Dakota Searchlight that farmers and ranchers in his district are “highly regulated,” conservation-minded and “pay taxes to the watershed districts to improve water quality.”

“For someone to imply we are lax, unregulated and don’t care — that’s not fair to every producer and ag taxpayer working hard on this issue, and simply not true,” Peterson said.
Glenn Muller, executive director of the South Dakota Pork Producers Council, brought up the issue at the town hall, asking for Rhoden’s response.
Muller told South Dakota Searchlight that he would prefer the state further study the issue, to identify how different sectors of agriculture and other industries affect water quality. That would help create more targeted solutions, he said.
In response to Karr’s comments, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said that “top-down mandates” can be more expensive without being more effective.
“You can go too far the other way,” Venhuizen said, “and create a lot of new burdens that don’t really get you much in terms of value.”

Johnston and Girod say they're receptive to changes in faculty workload and post-tenure review procedures at the state's six public universities. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents is preparing to vote on faculty tenure policy recommendations that set academic workload expectations and require rigorous post-tenure reviews of professors at the state’s six public universities.
The initiative would establish common points of reference in evaluating the work of hundreds of tenured faculty at the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Wichita State University, Emporia State University, Fort Hays State University and Pittsburg State University. The policy package would require one-year remediation programs for faculty falling short of expectations. It would set the stage for dismissal of people with substandard evaluations in back-to-back years.
Under the draft plan circulated to Board of Regents members and university personnel, administration leaders on each campus would retain jurisdiction over details of evaluations of tenured faculty and the provisions of self-improvement programs for anyone with recognized deficiencies. The core obligations of state university faculty would continue to revolve around teaching, research and service, but instruction of students would be the biggest factor in assessments.
“We’re looking for sort of an umbrella policy that stills shows accountability, but obviously is flexible enough that the institutions will be able to utilize it,” said Board of Regents member Alysia Johnston, who has more than 35 years of experience in community college education.
She said Wednesday during a Board of Regents meeting in Hays the new approach would answer questions about whether tenured faculty continued to find success at a level commensurate with someone of their academic rank.
The workload policy would link faculty performance evaluations to tenure status.
“This seems like a really good potential product,” said Kathy Wolfe Moore, appointed to the Board of Regents last year by Gov. Laura Kelly after serving a dozen years in the Kansas House.
Rusty Monhollon, vice president of academic affairs for the Board of Regents, said overhauling post-tenure and workload systems would make it easier for the public universities to identify on an annual basis the faculty who excelled. It would provide administrators a roadmap for addressing faculty not adhering to high expectations, he said.
Monhollon said campus evaluations of tenured faculty would “become less subjective” through reliance on tangible evidence related to teaching, research and service.
He said policy changes were intended to reinforce the values of faculty tenure, support student academic success and enhance accountability at taxpayer-supported universities. The changes weren’t designed to thwart faculty development or scholarly innovation, he said.
In addition, he said, the framework resulted from collaboration with university administrators and faculty, and drew from established practices found elsewhere in U.S. higher education.
Policy recommendations would direct state universities to produce annual reports on the process of awarding tenure, including data on awards, denials and departures among faculty. It wouldn’t alter current policy limiting tenure-track faculty probationary periods to seven years. Tenure also would continue to be awarded based on meritorious performance rather than longevity of service.
In terms of post-tenure review, each faculty member would operate with work plans adjusted annually to outline expectations. Committee of at least five people would conduct full-scale reviews of each tenured faculty member every five years.
Tenured professors receiving an unsatisfactory evaluation would be required to take part in a one-year improvement plan. A second year with an unsatisfactory rating “may lead to dismissal or reassignment,” the policy proposal said.
Each university would provide an annual report to the Board of Regents on the number of tenured faculty assessed and improvement plans initiated. It would document the number of faculty departures or dismissals.
Under proposed changes to workload policy applicable to tenured professors, each would be assigned a teaching load. Exceptions could be granted to faculty holding extension, clinical or research positions that didn’t include instructional responsibilities. Otherwise, the three large doctoral universities in Kansas would set teaching loads ranging from 40% to 55% of a faculty member’s work schedule. The three regional universities would set teaching loads ranging from 60% to 75%.
Research expectations for tenured professors would be specific to each discipline, with consideration given to involvement in development of grants, publications, graduate supervision and dissemination of scholarship. Work linked to service duties must coincide with “institutional goals,” and could include administrative responsibilities.
Biennial reports prepared by the six universities would document faculty metrics on credit hour production, graduation rates, publications and research funding.
The Board of Regents could take a preliminary vote on post-tenure and workload policies in December. If advanced, the final vote would likely be in January.
KU chancellor Doug Girod said if the Board of Regents implemented post-tenure and workforce reforms it would constitute “one of the most robust processes in the country.”
“Most of what you’re seeing in state legislatures around the country are trying to accomplish where we are today,” Girod said.
Richard Linton, president of K-State, said the university’s faculty senate would provide feedback on the plan.
“From a 50,000-foot viewpoint,” Linton said, “I think it’s headed in a very good direction.”

,DC,2025-11-20 23:42:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The Trump administration wants everyone to reapply for food stamps. What does that mean?,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-wants-everyone-reapply-food-stamps-what-does-mean,,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ call for a close reexamination of the 42 million people who receive federal food aid has befuddled advocates and lawmakers, coming mere days after recipients began to see benefits that had been stalled during the government shutdown.Details remain scant a week after Rollins during an interview on the right-wing Newsmax network first publicly broached the startling idea that every beneficiary would have to reapply for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, often called food stamps.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, asked for an explanation, referenced existing requirements and suggested more changes in SNAP rules could be in store.“Secretary Rollins wants to ensure the fraud, waste, and incessant abuse of SNAP ends,” a USDA spokesperson wrote Wednesday. “Rates of fraud were only previously assumed, and President Trump is doing something about it. Using standard recertification processes for households is a part of that work. As well as ongoing analysis of state data, further regulatory work, and improved collaboration with states.”The 2008 law governing SNAP leaves states responsible for administration. Part of that role includes periodically making sure that the low-income people in the program meet the qualifications for inclusion, but the law allows states to determine how often that occurs.“It's not clear what she would be proposing that is different from what is already happening,” said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for food assistance at the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.One interpretation of Rollins’ comments is that she would remove all 42 million individuals from SNAP’s rolls and ask them to resubmit applications. Bergh said that would lead to people losing money they need for groceries. About 40% of those enrolled in SNAP are children.“If she's suggesting that they're going to somehow redo that process for more than 40 million people who already demonstrated their eligibility and who already have to periodically recertify their eligibility, that would be pretty duplicative and would likely create pretty significant paperwork backlogs that would cause people who are eligible to lose the food assistance that they need,” Bergh said.Administration critics have suggested that, while the comments are unlikely to lead to policy changes, they introduce even more confusion for a program that was used as a political token during the record government shutdown that ended this month. Making people reapply would underscore the Trump administration’s opposition to the nearly $100 billion program, which accounts for 70% of federal nutrition assistance. USDA says the average SNAP household in fiscal 2023 received a monthly benefit of $332, or $177 a person based on the average SNAP household size of 1.9 people.“Secretary Rollins and the Trump administration have cut food assistance for 42 million Americans multiple times this year,” U.S. House Agriculture ranking member Angie Craig said in a Wednesday statement to States Newsroom. “Now, they've once again shown that they do not understand the program.”What did Rollins say?In the Nov. 13 interview on Newsmax, Rollins said SNAP was beset by widespread fraud, citing data that 29 mostly Republican-run states submitted to the department. Acquiring data from the 21 other states would give the department a way to wholly remake the program, she said.“Can you imagine when we get our hands on the blue state data, what we're going to find?” she said. “It's going to give us a platform and a trajectory to fundamentally rebuild this program, have everyone reapply for their benefit, make sure that everyone that's taking a taxpayer-funded benefit through SNAP or food stamps that they literally are vulnerable, and they can't survive without it. And that's the next step here.”In an interview Monday on Fox News, host Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins about the move to have recipients “reapply.”“Business as usual is over,” Rollins answered in part. “The status quo is no more. We know that the SNAP program is rife with fraud.”She added that guarding against fraud would help those the program is meant to serve.The comments touched off widespread confusion about what specifically Rollins meant. Asked about the initiative during a Thursday press conference, Craig, a Minnesota Democrat, said she was unclear about how it would work and predicted that Rollins would take credit in the future for the existing low rate of fraud.""We're hearing off the record that, you know, maybe people don't know what the hell they're talking about,” she said. “In fact, I think they're trying to take credit for the already very strict standards and the actual low fraud rate in the SNAP program ... So we can find no real plan there. Not even sure there's concepts of a plan there.”In response to a States Newsroom request this week for details about the initiative, USDA provided the statement that did not answer how the department would proceed or under what authority, but said Rollins was seeking to reduce fraud in the program.Spokespeople did not respond to follow-up questions, or a request to respond to Craig’s remarks Thursday.Low fraud rateProgram experts say fraud is not a widespread problem for SNAP.An April report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that retailers illegally trafficked about 1.6% of SNAP benefits from fiscal 2015 to 2017.Fraud by households applying for SNAP, which appear to be the main target of Rollins’ proposal, is even lower. According to a USDA report, about 26,000 applications were referred for an administrative review or prosecution on suspicion of fraud. That number accounts for about 0.1% of the 22.7 million households enrolled in the program, according to the Pew Research Center.“Long-standing data sources indicate that intentional fraud by participants is rare,” Bergh said.At Thursday's press conference, Craig called Rollins’ comments “bullsh*t” and “propaganda.”“Secretary Rollins goes on TV and talks about all the fraud,” she said. “This most effective anti-hunger program in our history has a fraud rate of 1.6%. It's actually one of the most effective, well-run programs in the country … The bullsh*t this administration is peddling is egregious.”More targeted reformsEven experts who advocate for reforms to SNAP say eligibility fraud is not a major issue.Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, said high-net-worth individuals can receive SNAP benefits, but aren’t committing fraud by doing so.“Some of the issues with SNAP … aren't because of fraud or abuse, but they are because of bad program rules,” said Boccia.Boccia also cited an “incentive misalignment” inherent in the state-federal program. States have little incentive to control payments because the federal government funds the program, she said.Forcing all beneficiaries to reapply would likely reduce the cost of the program by reducing the number of its beneficiaries, including by forcing out higher earners who may not consider the benefits they don’t actually need to be worth the onerous reapplication process, Boccia said. But it would also result in a percentage of low earners dropping off the program, as well as many who would be affected by the administrative backlog that would come with processing tens of millions of new applications, she said. Shutdown, the big beautiful bill, and confusionBergh said Rollins’ comments “add insult to injury” because they come after congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump signed a major tax cuts and spending law that is expected to shrink federal SNAP spending by $187 billion over 10 years. The law added work requirements for many SNAP recipients and shifted some costs to states.That was followed by the six-week shutdown that saw a dizzying back-and-forth over whether November SNAP benefits would be paid.“There has been huge amounts of chaos and confusion and disruption for both states and participants in recent weeks, largely due to the shutdown, but also because simultaneously, the administration has required states to implement many of the reconciliation bill’s SNAP cuts,” Bergh said.Craig, in her statement, also said Rollins’ comments would hurt the people who need the program.“I am astounded by the secretary's careless disregard for the hungry seniors and children who can afford to eat because of this program,” she said.Sara Naomi Bleich, a public health policy professor at Harvard University, said in a phone interview the confusion from Rollins’ comments compounded hardships produced by the Republican reconciliation law, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.“Big picture with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is that there's basically this tidal wave coming to families that have low income,” Bleich, who worked at USDA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said. “They're going to lose Medicaid. They're going to lose SNAP. There could be collateral impacts on the school meals. This is going to be a really hard time for families to navigate.”",,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star) At a Thursday campaign event with former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett from Oxford denounced the two-party system, making the case for his independent bid for governor.
Bennett, who formerly chaired the Maine GOP and left party earlier this year to announce his run, emphasized his long history working within his former party, as well as with Democrats, to pass legislation he believed in. 
If elected governor, he said he would prioritize passing reforms in favor of affordability and fixing broken systems, including capping drug prices, focusing on improving academic performance in public schools, and lowering energy costs. 
“What people want is actual, real results, and they’re not getting it from the partisan structure,” Bennett told the 50 or so attendees.
“I’m running for governor as an independent because I want to govern as an independent, and that is different,” he added. For example, serving as an independent governor would allow him the flexibility to choose the best suited members of his cabinet, he said, as opposed to having to select exclusively Republicans or Democrats.
At the event, which was held at the Cumberland Club, Bennett was endorsed by the centrist Forward Party, formed in 2020 by Todd Whitman, known as a centrist Republican, and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. The group supports independent candidates across the country at the local, state and national level that reflect its values from all parties. In 2024, the group endorsed Rep. Amy Roeder, a Democrat from Bangor.
“We want to support those that represent our values, as Rick does, and we want to find those candidates in the state and local offices,” Todd Whitman said.
Bennett is among a crowded field of contenders vying to replace Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who will be termed out. The Oxford senator’s long track record in state government drew a mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents to the event who told Maine Morning Star they support his ideas and appreciate his commitment to work across the aisle.
Voters tired of two-part system
Many people in attendance were undecided on who they will be voting for next November, and many plan to vote in Democratic or Republican party primaries in June. But many said they think highly of Bennett, and agree with his denouncement of increasingly partisan politics.  
Phil Steele and his wife Francesca Galluccio-Steele are both registered Democrats, but attended because they agreed with Bennett’s push for transparency in campaign finance. Bennett introduced multiple bills last session aiming to expand clean elections to the local level and chaired the committee behind the successful 2023 referendum banning foreign entities from spending money on referendum campaigns. 
“I’m fed up with both parties, we have to get out of the two party system,” Phil Steele said. “I don’t agree with him on a lot of issues, but I agree on getting dark money out of politics.”
Anne Butterfield, who works for Our Power Maine, the campaign to establish a public utility system in the state, said she agrees with Bennett’s ideas about energy reform and reducing utility costs for Mainers. Butterfield, also a registered Democrat, said she’s “still looking at the playing field, but the trust is really high with him.”
Ted O’Meara, another former chair of the Maine Republican Party, said he left the party several years ago and is aligned with Bennett on many issues. Bennett has demonstrated leadership through his work across the aisle, he said, such as with former U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud when the two co-led the Maine Senate, and that makes him the “kind of candidate that people are looking for this year.”
“He has demonstrated throughout his political career that he’s willing to work with anybody to find a solution,” O’Meara added. “And people are really fed up with the partisanship and fighting. They really just want solutions.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1288-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

It’s a private parcel, with a gravel airstrip and four or five buildings that make up a small worker camp. But there are no towns in sight. Known as the Johnson Tract, the property is fully surrounded by the vast Lake Clark National Park—millions of wild acres marked by the broad white peaks of a volcano, sprawling glaciers and a muddy ocean coastline patrolled by brown bears.
Beneath the Johnson Tract lies a potential fortune. For decades, geologists have eyed gold, copper and zinc deposits thought to be worth billions of dollars. But they’ve never been tapped.
Now, amid surging gold prices and rising demand for metals like copper, the prospect is generating new excitement—and concern.
A prominent Alaska mining company is leasing the Johnson Tract from its Indigenous owners, and the property, some 125 miles southwest of Anchorage, has emerged as one of the most promising mining prospects in Southcentral Alaska.
But conservationists, commercial salmon fishermen and local lodge owners fear a mine, encircled by the federal protected area, could disrupt harvests and harm wildlife, including an endangered population of beluga whales.
Getting the Johnson Tract’s minerals to buyers will require trucking ore through a now-roadless corner of the national park to a future port.
Critics point out that the bay where the mining company, Contango Ore, Inc., wants to build a shipping terminal is an important winter habitat for the endangered belugas. Concern for the whales, among other objections, led mine opponents to sue federal regulators earlier this year over a permit that Contango received to build a short access road and expand an airstrip at the site.

Still, the project is advancing.
The land is owned by Anchorage-based Cook Inlet Region, Inc., or CIRI, one of 12 Indigenous-owned regional corporations created by Congress as part of a wider land claims settlement with Alaska’s Native people in 1971.
Contango, based in Fairbanks, started leasing the land from CIRI last year. With gold prices surpassing a record high of $4,000 per troy ounce this year, the mining company is already planning new roads and a tunnel to allow underground drilling on the Johnson Tract.
If a mine gets built, both Contango and CIRI’s nearly 10,000 Indigenous shareholders are poised to profit.
“The stars might be aligned right now,” said Margie Brown, a former CIRI president who also worked for the corporation’s lands department in the 1970s, when the company acquired the prospect.
The conflict reflects a deeper tension between two competing visions for Alaska—one of environmental preservation, the other of industrial development. Both visions extend back to a time when Congress set aside large tracts of the state’s wilderness for protection but also carved out areas for resource extraction, often intended to benefit Alaska’s Indigenous-owned corporations. Rooted in a series of landmark bills in the 1970s and 1980s, the Johnson Tract saga echoes some of the state’s other, higher-profile environmental battles, including over a mining road and oil development in the Arctic.
As Contango forges ahead, CIRI is asserting its right to profit from lands long intended for development, while opponents say that mining imperils a still-wild slice of Alaska.

Among critics of the mining project is Dustin Solberg, a commercial fisherman and environmental advocate who spends summers with his family setting nets for salmon along the beaches of Tuxedni Bay, about 10 miles northeast of the Johnson Tract. Contango could one day load ore onto ships from the same shore where Solberg and other fishermen haul fish out of the bay.
Standing on a quiet Tuxedni beach one day this summer with dramatic cliffs looming overhead, Solberg imagined mining trucks rumbling down a road nearby.
“I think it would irreversibly change this place,” he said.

 A pivotal deal

The Johnson Tract fight is rooted in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
Intended to resolve disputes over Indigenous land claims in Alaska, the federal legislation in 1971 established 12 for-profit Alaska Native corporations, each owned by Indigenous shareholders with ties to a region in the state. More than 200 other Indigenous companies tied to Native villages also formed.
The act promised to compensate the corporations with nearly a billion dollars and millions of acres of land, to be chosen by the companies’ elected leaders.
Those leaders quickly moved to obtain traditional hunting and fishing grounds and areas with cultural value, but they also sought land thought to be rich in minerals and other resources that they could convert into profits for shareholders.


In the Arctic, Native corporations acquired land with oil deposits. In Southeast Alaska, they logged vast stands of cedar and spruce.
But in CIRI’s region, around Anchorage and neighboring Cook Inlet, the pickings were sparse. The southcentral region is the state’s most populous, and by the time of the settlement, military bases and wildlife refuges had been set aside by the federal government, prime real estate was in the hands of private developers and other parcels had been snatched up by the state.
“You just had so much pressure for lands within the Cook Inlet region,” said Brown, who now serves on CIRI’s board.
The corporation’s leaders argued that they were largely left with glaciers and mountain ridges — dim prospects for shareholders.

Two years after Congress approved the settlement, CIRI sued the U.S. interior secretary, arguing that his agency had not made adequate property available for CIRI to develop. Tense negotiations ensued, producing a sprawling agreement between CIRI and the state and federal governments: the Cook Inlet Land Exchange.
The deal called for CIRI to give up half the property around Cook Inlet that the corporation was entitled to under the original settlement, Brown said. Some of that foregone land would be folded into Lake Clark National Park and Preserve when Congress created it a few years later.
In return, CIRI would be able to acquire land elsewhere in Alaska, and even outside the state.

The deal also allowed CIRI to pick up some key assets around Cook Inlet, including the Johnson Tract, which the corporation chose specifically for its mineral potential. CIRI’s early leaders viewed the land swap as a hard-fought compromise, and Brown called the Johnson Tract “key to the bargain.”
“The ability to use the land in the way Congress intended is something that needs to be preserved,” she said. “It’s unfortunate that as we move further and further from congressional intent, it’s harder and harder for people to remember that.”
The Johnson Tract is really two adjacent parcels, totaling about 33 square miles. CIRI—now a huge business, with nearly $1 billion in assets—owns the minerals beneath both parcels, and the surface of the south tract, where the main deposit sits. The federal government retained surface ownership of the north tract.
Citing a provision in the land exchange, the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI the rights to transport ore through the park, with certain restrictions to limit environmental impacts. CIRI and Contango have not formally proposed building a haul road and port, which would require additional permits.
 An ‘Awesome’ Deposit

Soon after CIRI acquired the Johnson Tract, the corporation began scouring it for more minerals, seeking enough to justify building a mine.
In the early 1980s, CIRI partnered with Anaconda Minerals, a subsidiary of the global oil giant ARCO, to evaluate the prospect.
Anaconda found promising amounts of gold, zinc and copper and at one point—given the area’s prolific amount of snow—envisioned an underground tunnel or aerial tram to move ore the dozen miles from a mine to a port on the coast. But Anaconda went out of business. And aside from another unsuccessful effort to develop the Johnson Tract in the 1990s, the land sat largely dormant until 2019.
That year, CIRI signed a lease with a Vancouver-based mineral exploration company, which quickly handed over the operations to a spinoff firm, HighGold Mining Inc. HighGold spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration and drilled more than 150 core samples before Contango bought the company last year in a deal worth some $35 million.
The Johnson Tract appealed to Contango’s chief executive, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, because it seemed to be a good fit for the company’s unconventional development model, which involves shipping raw ore to a processing plant off site, rather than crushing and processing ore next to the deposit, as most mines do.
The approach avoids some of the more expensive and hard-to-permit components of a typical mine, like a mill and a big waste pond. In theory, it keeps construction costs low and makes permitting easier, Van Nieuwenhuyse said. But shipping unprocessed ore also risks higher transportation costs, so Johnson Tract’s close proximity to the ocean and shipping routes made it attractive.
“It’s an awesome deposit,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said, citing the prospect’s high ratio of valuable minerals to rock and its thickness, which he expects will make the mining process more efficient.
Van Nieuwenhuyse is a veteran of Alaska’s mining industry, having worked over the past four decades on some of the state’s most prominent early-stage projects.
He played major roles in advancing Western Alaska’s Donlin project — the state’s biggest proposed gold mine — and high-profile prospects in Northwest Alaska at the end of the controversial proposed Ambler Road. He also led development of the Rock Creek gold mine near Nome, which closed in 2008 soon after opening amid a slew of challenges.
At Contango, where Van Nieuwenhuyse was named chief executive in 2020, he partnered with the multinational Kinross Gold Corp. to spearhead the construction of Alaska’s first large mine in more than a decade, a project in the Interior called Manh Choh.
Unlike that open-pit mine, Johnson Tract would be an underground operation. Several years of exploratory drilling, permitting and engineering are expected before a final decision on building a mine, Van Nieuwenhuyse said.

The mine, according to Contango’s preliminary plans, would operate for seven years and would be small compared to other major Alaska mines. Contango would share royalties on mineral sales with CIRI, which has an option to buy as much as a 25 percent stake in the mine.
CIRI declined interview requests about the Johnson Tract, and the corporation’s executives have made few public statements about it.
The project “presents an opportunity to responsibly develop mineral resources to benefit our shareholders while respecting the environment and preserving the land,” CIRI said in a brief update last year. “The Johnson Tract project reflects decades of hard work to build a foundation of self-determination and financial stability.”
 ‘We’re Here Because it’s Beautiful’

Dustin Solberg, the fisherman and mine opponent, was motoring to a net he’d set on the west side of Tuxedni Channel one afternoon last summer when he spotted a brown bear on a rocky beach ahead.
“I think it smells the fish, Dad,” 12-year-old son and deckhand Leif Solberg called out.
Neither father nor son seemed particularly concerned. The area has so many beach-loving bears that it draws tourists from around the world for viewing and photography.
Far more worrisome to the elder Solberg is the future of the beach where the bear was roving—near a site that Contango is studying as a port.
Solberg, his family and others who fish in the channel each summer have growing concerns about Contango’s vision. They fear that a new road and industrial dock, and the traffic and noise from trucks and ships, would mar the wild character of the bay and the park around it.

As Solberg looked across the channel, it was remarkably quiet, aside from a few fishing skiffs and an occasional float plane that landed at a bear-viewing lodge on Chisik Island. Other than the lodge and a few fishing cabins, Chisik is a federally designated wilderness area, home to a prolific seabird colony.
A dozen or so crews fish commercially for salmon in the bay. Two or three times a week, from June through August, they set, pick and pull nets along pebbly beaches on either side of Tuxedni Channel, with fishing periods that can last 12 hours or more.
It’s hard labor, Solberg said, but the season moves at a slower pace than Alaska’s bigger-volume salmon fisheries, like Bristol Bay, where boats sometimes work 24-hour shifts.
“If you wanted to make money, you would fish somewhere else,” said Ann Harding, Solberg’s wife. “We’re here because it’s beautiful.”
The area has “phenomenal” mountains and a striking density of birds and bears, added Harding, a seabird biologist who sometimes fishes alongside Solberg.
The family uses a cabin a mile or two down the shoreline from where the bear had been walking. It’s a small plywood structure beneath an A-frame roof, surrounded by an electric fence to keep away curious ursine visitors. The cabin is about a hundred feet back from the water and set fully within Lake Clark National Park.
Solberg and Harding bought the structure several years ago. They don’t have title to the land beneath it or a formal permit from the park service. But the cabin existed before the park was established, and past owners had an informal arrangement with federal officials to keep using it, Solberg said.

The cabin now sits in an easement that the Department of Interior earlier this year granted CIRI for a mining port. Solberg doesn’t think his small business will amount to much of an obstacle.
“This is just a little shack that doesn’t really compete with the value of an operation like that,” he said, referring to the mining plans. “So, I don’t expect this to get in the way of anything.”

CIRI and Contango have not made a final decision about where to put the port, and a CIRI environmental document said last year that there is “considerable uncertainty” about future construction.
Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Contango mining executive, said his company recognizes the rights of the setnetters, and he believes a mine can co-exist with the fishery.
“I would ask that everybody recognize CIRI’s rights as well,” he added.
 Where Belugas ‘Hang Out’

As it gathers pace, Contango is facing opposition not just from the commercial fishermen but also from conservation groups and some tribal governments in the region.
A national group, the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Homer-based nonprofit Cook Inletkeeper and the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, a tribal government, are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for issuing a key permit to Contango.
Several tribal leaders also have raised concerns about the project and have asked the Trump administration to suspend the permit.
A core concern among those opponents is that a mining operation could threaten Cook Inlet’s beluga whales, which are treasured by many Anchorage residents and local wildlife viewers.
The inlet’s belugas—which are genetically distinct from other beluga populations—once numbered around 1,300 animals, but their numbers sharply declined in the 1990s. They were listed as endangered in 2008 and still have not significantly recovered. The population now stands at some 330 whales.
During the summer, the belugas are commonly spotted feasting on fish at the mouths of salmon-bearing streams near Anchorage. Where they go in winter has been a mystery.
But last year federal scientists announced a big discovery in a study that analyzed underwater sound recordings.
The researchers, affiliated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, identified Tuxedni Bay as the only known foraging ground for the whales between late fall and late spring. They warned that human-caused noise is a “key threat” to the belugas, which use sound to navigate and communicate, and that industrial activity could affect the quality of the whales’ habitat.
NOAA Fisheries, which led the study, declined interview requests. One of its scientists, in a press release announcing the study, said that “maintaining the status quo” may be all that’s needed to help the beluga population recover.
As Contango studies sites for a port, it’s now funding a new beluga survey by biologists working for the state of Alaska, which has often been more friendly to the mining industry than the federal government.
The survey is focused on the narrow channel where Contango is considering shipping ore, while the NOAA-led study looked more broadly at the 10-mile-long Tuxedni Bay.
“We want to know where the belugas like to hang out,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said.
One of the loudest voices advocating for the belugas and against development at the Johnston Tract is Cooper Freeman, a Homer resident and the Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The center is a 35-year-old nonprofit that aims to protect wildlife and ecosystems across the country, and it’s a participant in nearly a dozen active lawsuits in Alaska’s federal court.
In an interview, Freeman acknowledged CIRI’s right to the minerals at the Johnson Tract. But he noted that federal environmental laws still apply and argued that CIRI does not have an “absolute right” to build a mine.
In his view, the area is too ecologically rich—with its important beluga habitat and high density of brown bears, seabirds and shorebirds—to risk.
“It’s just an incredibly, biologically, intensively rich and completely intact area—one of the only remaining places like it in all of Cook Inlet,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any amount of money that’s worth destroying this place.”

There are no towns within 40 miles of the Johnson Tract—just roadless mountains, glaciers, forests and streams.
Aside from seasonal fishermen, CIRI and Contango’s neighbors include Silver Salmon Creek Lodge, a bear-viewing and sport-fishing business that’s near the mouth of the Johnson River, a dozen or so miles downstream of the mineral deposit.
Longtime lodge owners David Coray and Joanne Edney have kept loose tabs on the prospect for decades and have grown more concerned as Contango’s project advances.
In a recent interview, Coray and Edney said they’re worried that a mine could pollute the Johnson River and disrupt bear habitat.
“We understand their interest, and we understand their rights,” Edney said of CIRI and Contango. But a mining operation could come into “direct conflict” with her family’s business, she said.
CIRI declined to respond to questions about opposition to the project, and about how it’s gauging the views of its shareholders, some of whom have spoken out against it.
Van Nieuwenhuyse said Contango is committed to protecting wildlife.
“We’ll develop this deposit with minimal impacts to the environment, which we recognize as pristine,” Van Nieuwenhuyse said. “We’re all from Alaska. We enjoy the outdoors. That’s why we all became geologists.”
For Solberg, the fisherman, the convergence of competing interests in the area is “endlessly fascinating—and really complicated and really unfortunate.”
In a conversation after the fishing season, Solberg acknowledged a tension between CIRI’s rights to the Johnson Tract’s minerals and the spectre of a mine transforming the landscape and bay that his family has come to know and love.
Solberg said he feels “really torn” about the issue and that he respects CIRI’s land claims. But as one of the few Alaskans who spends long stretches of time in Tuxedni Bay, he feels obligated to speak in defense of its wildness and beauty.
“I just want decisionmakers to have their eyes wide open,” he said. “And to realize what’s at stake.”

EPA can charge up to $68,445 per day of Clean Water Act violations, but the agency lowered the charge on the basis that the feedlot had “a limited ability to pay a civil penalty.” 
In addition to the fee, Wynja Feedlot Inc., a 999-head capacity cattle feedlot, is required to apply for an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permit, construct a lined containment basin and sample discharges from the surrounding tile for possible pollutants.

EPA discovered in March 2021 that the confined animal feeding operation had been discharging wastewater through a drainage pipe that led to a “relatively permanent” tributary of the West Branch of the Floyd River. 
According to EPA, the wastewater contained high levels of bacteria, ammonia, chlorides, and unprocessed organic matter, all of which can contribute to impaired water quality. 
The feedlot did not have an NPDES permit for the drainage pipe, and according to EPA, the facility admitted the observed discharge had occurred for three consecutive days. 
According to EPA and the Iowa Department of Natural Resource fish kill database, the West Branch Floyd River has been subject to multiple fish kills in the past two decades, some of which were attributable to animal waste.
EPA concluded the facility also had “limited wastewater containment” that meant further “unauthorized discharges” likely occurred during storms. 
The consent decree was filed Nov. 17, but the facility was tasked with meeting compliance deadlines over the summer to begin the process of building runoff control structures and sampling process plans. 
According to EPA, the facility has already applied for an NPDES permit and received a construction permit to build the lined containment basin. 
EPA estimates the facility’s compliance will prevent an estimated 4.5 million gallons of wastewater each year from entering the river. The agency estimates that amount of wastewater is equal to 137,000 pounds of pollutants, consisting of total suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and oxygen demand.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)An Iowa lawyer accused of elder abuse is now suing the Henry County District Court, the county attorney and the Mt. Pleasant chief of police over a search warrant related to his financial records.
Attorney Beau Bergmann and the Bergmann Law Firm are suing Henry County, Henry County District Court, Henry County Attorney Darin Stater, and Mt. Pleasant Chief of Police Lyle Murray in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit claims Bergmann and his law firm maintained a lawyer trust account for depositing client funds at Wayland State Bank in Mt. Pleasant. According to the lawsuit, in August 2023, Murray and Stater  initiated a search warrant application for account information at Wayland State Bank. The warrant application allegedly sought access to financial statements for accounts controlled by Bergmann or the law firm.
As part of the warrant application, Murray allegedly provided the court with an affidavit stating that Bergmann had illegally taken $20,000 from a mentally incapacitated person and would not return the money. Additional references were made to $9,500 paid to Bergmann by a different client.
Murray’s affidavit, according to the lawsuit, alleged that “Bergmann either stole or fraudulently obtained money from the two victims.” The affidavit allegedly cites “two suspicious checking accounts,” without offering any explanation as to why the accounts were deemed suspicious.
Despite the fact that funds held in such accounts are not the property of the attorney who maintains the account, but are instead the property of the clients, Stater and Murray sought access to financial statements pertaining to the account, according to the lawsuit.
Based upon Murray’s affidavit, District Associate Judge Jonathan Stensvaag then approved the warrant application and signed a search warrant in the case, the lawsuit alleges.
Bergmann now claims the court was aware, or should have been aware, there was probable cause that a criminal offense had been committed.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for alleged civil rights violations related to the improper issuance of search warrants and invasion of privacy.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Lawsuit follows case alleging elder abuse
Civil court records indicate the search warrant pertaining to the mentally incapacitated individual are tied to a dispute that arose in May 2023, when attorney Steven E. Ort filed a court petition against Bergmann seeking relief from elder abuse.
In that case, Ort, who was representing the incapacitated individual’s conservator and guardian, alleged Bergmann had accepted $20,000 from the individual after that person’s financial matters were placed in the hands of the conservator, and that Bergmann then refused to return the money to the conservator.
“This is not an ordinary commercial transaction between a lawyer and a potential client,” Ort alleged in court filings, adding that the incapacitated individual “was subject to a pending guardianship and conservatorship when he first met with Mr. Bergmann (and) a conservator had been appointed by the time the check was dated and was cashed.”
Ort’s court filings also alleged Bergmann’s license to practice law had been suspended beginning on Feb. 24, 2023, and so Bergmann could not legally represent the individual at a court hearing that took place in March 2023.
“Bergmann cannot escape liability for elder abuse by asserting that his privilege to practice law somehow immunizes him,” Ort argued to the court.
In June 2023, Ort filed a motion to dismiss the case, although the available court records don’t indicate the reason for the motion.
Court records show that in December 2022, Bergmann consented to the suspension of his law license, admitting the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board had fielded “complaints containing allegations that I had violated ethical rules in my representation of multiple clients.”
In consenting to the suspension, Bergmann acknowledged the following previous sanctions:
April 2015: He was privately admonished for neglecting a client’s appeal.
July 2018: He was privately admonished on for lack of diligence in pursuing a client’s case and failing to keep his client informed.
September 2018: He was privately admonished due to unearned fees not being placed in a client trust account.
January 2020: The Iowa Supreme Court publicly reprimanded Bergmann for missing a hearing in a marriage-dissolution case and not attending a mediation session.
Court records show Bergmann’s Iowa law license is currently active.

(Photo courtesy of Kerry Stiles/University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture)Arkansas farmers receiving federal financial assistance will be exempt from paying state income taxes in accordance with state law, state officials announced Thursday.
“Not only do these exemptions provide immediate relief to our hardworking farmers and ranchers, but they also help bolster Arkansas’ number one industry,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a news release.
Commodity crop farmers are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand. Agriculture industry leaders told lawmakers in September that 25% to 40% of farmers are likely to leave the industry after this season unless they receive aid.
State lawmakers petitioned the federal government for emergency financial aid to farmers last month.
Neither Sanders’ news release nor a letter from the state Department of Finance and Administration to the state Department of Agriculture makes it clear whether Arkansas farmers have received or are about to receive the requested aid. A spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment.
In the letter dated Wednesday, Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson confirmed to Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward that farmers will not have to pay income taxes as of Jan. 1 of this year if they received aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the American Relief Act of 2025. This complies with Act 696 of 2025, sponsored by longtime farmer and Senate Majority Leader Blake Johnson, R-Corning.

Arkansas lawmakers urge feds to help farmers stay afloat in struggling industry


A provision of the American Relief Act is the Emergency Livestock Relief Program, which set aside $2 billion for livestock producers “suffering losses due to drought, wildfires, or flooding in calendar years 2023 and 2024,” according to the USDA website.
“Arkansas farmers and ranchers are the backbone of our state’s economy, and they continue to demonstrate incredible resilience in the face of extreme weather and market challenges,” Ward said in the news release. “These tax exemptions ensure that federal relief dollars go directly to helping producers recover, reinvest, and remain strong heading into the next growing season.”
Federal lawmakers are responsible for renewing a sweeping agriculture bill every five years to set both policy and funding levels for the industry. Arkansas Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman chairs the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, one of the committees responsible for drafting the farm bill.
Congress has repeatedly extended the 2018 farm bill a year at a time, but it expired Sept. 30 of this year, the day before a 43-day government shutdown began. The spending package that reopened the government last week included three years of funding for the USDA.
The federal government faces the possibility of another shutdown in January without consensus on addressing rising health insurance costs.

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A group of voting advocates filed a ballot measure to make it harder for Nebraska lawmakers to override or alter voter-passed laws or measures tweaked by referendum. 
The group, Respect Nebraska Voters, announced its push to gather signatures on Thursday. The initiative is a state constitutional amendment that would require bigger majorities to repeal or change any law passed by voters.
The measure also would require larger majorities to make changes to the requirements or processes for a citizen-led initiative to reach the ballot.  
Currently the Legislature needs two-thirds of lawmakers, or 33 senators, to vote to make those kinds of changes. The ballot measure would increase the required vote to four-fifths, or 40 senators.
Dawn Essink, a sponsor of the new ballot measure, said what prompted the proposed constitutional amendment is seeing the “anger from a lot of Nebraskans who had worked very hard on that paid sick leave initiative, among other initiatives.”
The new push comes after this year’s legislative session, in which the officially nonpartisan but Republican-led Nebraska Legislature, often with gubernatorial support and the support of at least one Democrat, prodded for changes that would have weakened or reversed some ballot measures.

Essink said the ballot initiative process was designed so that the voice of Nebraska voters is heard, but lawmakers are disrespecting voters. 
“The Legislature is taking that vote and watering it down … diluting it … call it whatever you want, but they’re changing it to their will, not the will of the people,” Essink said.

For example, advocates said, the state is currently slowrolling two voter-approved laws legalizing and regulating medical cannabis. Nebraska’s GOP lawmakers and Democratic State Sen. Jane Raybold of Lincoln successfully pushed to weaken the voter-approved law’s blanket requirements for paid sick leave by adding new restrictions and exceptions. Legislative majorities tried — and failed for now — to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases. That proposal is already scheduled to be reconsidered in the upcoming session.
Some conservative lawmakers have considered making the petition process harder because of the recent passage of more progressive measures have been passed in recent years.  
Jo Giles, executive director of the Women’s Fund of Omaha and a ballot measure sponsor, said the group wants to add “protections for the ballot initiative” and hopes Gov. Jim Pillen and conservative lawmakers support it. 
The ballot initiative process “is direct democracy,” she said. “It is letting Nebraskans vote for issues that come up, and we want them to respect the will of the people,” Giles said. 
The group organizing the new petition drive would need to gather the signatures of 10 percent of the state’s registered voters since the initiative seeks to change the state constitution.

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Pennsylvania is hoping to secure its own slice of a $50 billion rural health fund in the face of federal Medicaid cuts, with a focus on bolstering a beleaguered workforce and expanding health access for more than two million people. 
The Rural Health Transformation Fund was a last-minute addition to President Donald Trump’s summer budget bill that imposed Medicaid work requirements and cut upwards of $51 billion in funding to the commonwealth over the next decade. That new fund is worth roughly 37% of the estimated lost Medicaid funding in rural areas. 
“Pennsylvania is home to the third-largest rural population in the country, and our rural communities face unique challenges when it comes to public health and access to health care. A strong, accessible, affordable health care system is the foundation of any healthy community, and health care is essential to the economic growth, population revitalization, and stabilization of our rural communities,” said Val Arkoosh, the state’s secretary of the Department of Human Services, in a release.
The 67-page application — released Thursday, which was also National Rural Health Day — requests up to $200 million in annual funding over the next five years, totalling $1 billion. Its six focuses include: technology and infrastructure; workforce; maternal health services; behavioral health services; aging and access; and emergency medical services and transportation. 
The U.S. Department of Human Services is expected to award funding by the end of the year.

Key objective targets are: 

Access to care: More than 85% of Pennsylvanians can get a routine primary care appointment within four weeks and urgent care appointments within one week.
Digital connectivity and telehealth: More than 85% of rural hospitals and clinics will have broadband and telehealth functionality. More than 50% of rural hospitals and clinics connected via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. 
Workforce adequacy: Reduce rural hospital vacancy rates by 10% for key direct care roles. Add three new rural training programs. 
System sustainability: More than 60% of systems partnered with rural Community Health Centers for specialty care. 
Health outcomes: Reduce the number of pregnant women living in rural areas with inadequate prenatal care by 20%.


“The state did sort of have their hands tied on the different areas that they could apply for because of the way that (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) set up that funding,” said Helen Hawkey, the board president of the Pennsylvania Rural Health Association. 
She also serves as the director of the Pennsylvania Coalition for Oral Health and added that she would have liked to see more funding for dental access. But the overall investment in workforce development — a need across health care sectors — will attempt to fill in gaps across the spectrum alongside a separate state Rural Health Plan. 
“You have to have providers to have access. You cannot access health care if you have no one to provide it,” said Hawkey. “The incentives that are included in the plan — like scholarships, stipends, housing — all of those things are going to be really, really important to try to increase providers in rural areas.”
 Shoring up workforce, technology improvements

Though nearly 20% of the state’s population is rural, only 10% of the state’s physicians and hospital beds are in rural counties. 
Dentists number even fewer, with just 6% of the state’s practitioners in rural areas. 
Additionally, one-third of the state’s rural hospitals are at-risk of closing, according to The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. HAP told the Capital-Star in a statement that the anticipated funds wouldn’t be sufficient to make up for lost Medicaid funding.

Areas shaded in gray are rural areas, as defined by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. (Map from PA’s Rural Health Transformation Fund application)
“Fewer than half of the commonwealth’s rural hospitals are operating with margins necessary for long-term stability because they have been chronically underfunded for the care they provide. Medicaid is among the largest payors for many rural hospitals, yet, in Pennsylvania, reimburses only 71 cents per dollar spent providing care,” said Nicole Stallings, the organization’s president and CEO.
“This is already unsustainable but upcoming federal cuts will reduce reimbursement even more — to 64 (cents) per dollar — resulting in a nearly $1 billion direct payment cut to Pennsylvania’s rural hospitals over the next decade on top of a sharp rise in uncompensated care due to coverage losses.”
The state hopes to use the federal dollars to bolster the workforce of rural hospitals and update technology, both aspects praised by HAP and included in the organization’s September recommendations. 
The scholarships, rotations and residencies for future health care practitioners come with a five-year service commitment, prioritizing students from rural backgrounds
The state requested $239.2 million in workforce investments.
The application also pitches telehealth and virtual provider visits as ways to relieve burnout and increase access to specialists, with new technology assistance managed by a central hub. It specifically named artificial intelligence as an opportunity.

Examples include conversational AI, digital check-in tools and chronic disease prevention or management services. The Guthrie Clinic’s Pulse Center in Pennsylvania is highlighted for its use of AI in centralized digital monitoring and improved care coordination, which “ease staff workload and achieve reductions in nurse turnover and hospital costs.”
Even as practitioners report fewer hours devoted to paperwork because of AI, state lawmakers have recently sought to control the growth of AI in health care settings, citing transparency concerns.
 A focus on maternal and elder health

Mothers and mothers-to-be have inadequate prenatal care in rural areas, and nearly one-third of rural women live more than 30 minutes away from the closest labor and delivery unit. Three rural hospitals in the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, exacerbating the problem. 
The state proposes regional rural Maternal Health Hubs, places where pregnant Pennsylvanians can get comprehensive, coordinated care. The hubs will also facilitate — through face-to-face contact or telehealth — mental, oral and behavioral health care alongside substance use disorder services. 
 
Rural Pennsylvanians experience higher rates of mental illness and substance use disorder, compounded by the lack of qualified providers. The nation’s new suicide hotline, 988, continues to be underutilized in the commonwealth, with rural areas having disproportionately higher suicide rates. 
If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please call or text 988 to be connected to a crisis counselor free of charge 24/7.


“The hub model is invaluable in rural areas, where patients often face long travel distances, workforce shortages and fragmented care systems,” read the application. “The hub will augment the capacity of existing providers by centralizing key activities and expanding services where gaps exist.” 
Investments from the federal government could additionally fund: an app for new moms that connects them to local providers, telehealth and community resources; remote psychiatric and substance use consultations; and remote patient monitoring for high-risk pregnancies or postpartum complications. 
For these services, the state is requesting $187.4 million.
Expanding paramedicine services, where specially trained paramedics check on newly discharged patients, could improve recovery times for seniors and reduce readmissions. The providers can assess homes for fall risks — one of the leading causes of hospitalizations for older Americans — and assist with chronic disease management or wellness checks.
Additional dollars could be used to improve nursing home quality and staffing, which fell following the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, the state seeks $77.6 million for aging-related services. 
And while the public can expect annual state reports, staff at the University of Pittsburgh Medicaid Research Center will also provide independent evaluations, including “secret shopper” surveys to measure the impacts of rural health investments on appointment availability and wait times.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hospital-room-1024x6831762391450-1.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

The citizen nonprofit group filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of using eminent domain for carbon capture and sequestration projects. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)A group of Louisiana residents is suing Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration over state laws that allow the acquisition of private property against landowners’ wishes for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide. 
Save My Louisiana, composed mostly of resident and elected officials from Allen, Beauregard, Livingston, Rapides and Vernon parishes, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state Thursday morning in the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge. Group president Gray Musgrove joined six other local citizens in the case against the governor and state Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.
The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. A Conservation and Energy spokesman declined to comment, citing department policy on pending litigation. 
The lawsuit argues statutes on the use of eminent domain for carbon capture and storage in Louisiana law are unconstitutional. The laws “provide special privileges and immunities to private Corporations,” deny citizens their right to own property and cede judicial authority to the executive branch of state government.
There are currently 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects awaiting state approval, according to the Department of Conservation and Energy. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana.

Only one well, operated by Hackberry Carbon Sequestration in Cameron Parish, has received approval so far, with its permit okayed on Sept. 5. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana. 
Various state laws on the use of eminent domain for carbon transport and storage are listed in the lawsuit. Developers and government agencies that have successfully argued in court for the use of eminent domain to obtain property lean on the argument that the acquisition is for a greater good that outweighs the interests of the property owner. In the case of CO2 pipelines, the reasoning is that removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and storing it underground is in the interest of public health by mitigating the effects of climate change. 
Supporters of the plaintiffs disagree. They include Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, a U.S. Senate candidate who joined the plaintiffs outside the courthouse for a news conference and shared his opposition to forced land acquisitions for carbon capture projects.
“Eminent domain is designed for the public good … This is not for the public benefit,” Fleming said. “This is for the benefit of a very, very small group of people who will end up making lots of money from this.”
The issue of carbon capture has divided a Republican Party in Louisiana that typically backs the fossil fuel industry, a sector that’s shown the greatest interest in developing the technology. Some GOP state lawmakers with projects proposed in their districts have called for more restrictions on carbon capture and local approval for such projects. Gov. Jeff Landry has said he would like to see Louisiana lead the way in putting the technology to use.
“Believe me, we all support the oil and gas industry in general,” said Fleming, a Republican. “But there’s a segment that wants to make even additional money by putting burden on the citizens, and that’s where we draw the line. This is not good for Louisiana.”
Mike Slocum, co-founder of Save My Louisiana and one of the plaintiffs, said that while his group staunchly backs fossil fuels, there’s a lack of transparency between the industry and state and residents of parishes where carbon capture projects are planned.
“As we started to have [Save My Louisiana] meetings, we found that the community didn’t really know what it was,” Slocum said. “We don’t think the whole state really realizes what’s happening.”
Opponents of carbon capture and CO2 transport have concerns over safety and environmental impacts. Most hold up the example of a ruptured CO2 pipeline in 2020 that forced the evacuation of the small town of Satartia, Mississippi, that resulted in 45 people being hospitalized. Other worries include possible groundwater contamination and the potential for leaks. 
Beauregard Parish resident Mona DeFries, who owns land in Calcasieu Parish near a planned CO2 pipeline, said she feels the use of eminent domain for carbon capture is “a slap in the face” for property owners like her. Although she’s not a party in the lawsuit and hasn’t yet lost land to a project, DeFries said she supports its objectives and is concerned over environmental impacts and risk factors. 
“The safety issues haven’t been expressed clear enough for us,” she said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4037-scaled-e1763674981951-1024x818.jpg,,,2025-11-20 18:57:55.396017

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout).A group of 10 Tennessee parents and taxpayers filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging the constitutionality of the state’s new “universal” private-school voucher program.
Filed in Davidson County Chancery Court against Gov. Bill Lee, Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds and Tennessee Board of Education members, the lawsuit says the Tennessee Education Freedom Scholarship Act violates the state constitution by shifting public funds to unaccountable private schools that “openly discriminate” against students.
The program provides vouchers worth nearly $7,300 to 20,000 students in its first year at a cost of $144 million. The state’s top lawmakers want to double the program to 40,000 in its second year. 
The program has two categories of students, 10,000 set aside for those whose family incomes hit 300% of the federal subsidized lunch program, up to $180,000, and 10,000 for students with no family income requirement.
“I’ve raised nine children in Memphis, and all of them have attended Shelby County Schools,” said Apryle Young, a plaintiff in the lawsuit. “I’ve seen what our teachers can do when they have resources, and what happens when those resources disappear. We need to invest in our public schools, not abandon them.”
The plaintiffs contend the law violates the education clause of the state constitution by diverting state money from underfunded schools and preventing an adequate education for students by funding schools outside the state’s system of free public schools.
The lawsuit says the voucher program is unconstitutional because participating private schools don’t have to meet the same academic standards, accountability measures such as tests and civil rights protections as public schools.
Debate over private-school voucher expansion looms in Tennessee

Private schools can discriminate against students with disabilities, LGBTQ students and those of certain religions, all of which would be illegal for public schools, the plaintiffs say. Nor are private schools required to follow the state’s curriculum  or special education services guaranteed for state and federal law, a release says.
In addition, teachers at participating private schools don’t have to follow state certification requirements or give the state’s main standardized test, which is used to determine student proficiency and teacher and school effectiveness, the release says.
“They call this ‘school choice,’ but the choice isn’t yours, it’s the private schools,” said one of 10 plaintiffs, Crystal Boehm, a Hamilton County parent and preschool teacher. “They can reject your child for a disability, for your family’s religion, for any reason at all. Meanwhile, public schools that educate everyone are losing the funding they need.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, Education Law Center and Southern Poverty Law Center, in addition to the Southern Education Foundation and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd law firm.
Lawmakers passed Lee’s private-school voucher program in a January special session after postponing it in 2024 for lack of support.
The Department of Education released important dates Thursday for families wanting to apply for the money for the 2026-27 school year.
“In its first year of implementation, the Education Freedom Scholarship Program has been a remarkable success, and I look forward to continuing to deliver families with quality educational choices to best serve their students’ unique needs,” Education Commissioner Reynolds said in a statement.
Lee has said his only regret about the program is that it can’t be available to all students, though he is planning to try to expand it next year. 
The state estimated 66% of the students who receive the funds would be returning private-school students. The Lee administration refused to show how many of the 20,000 students receiving the vouchers attended private schools last year.

Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials said in a new release that there have been confirmed reports of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1, or EHV-1, linked to the events in Texas and Oklahoma. 
Idaho does not have any confirmed cases of the disease at this time, but state officials warned the virus is very contagious among horses and can lead to respiratory disease, abortions in pregnant mares, neurological disease and potentially the death of horses.

“Idaho has no confirmed cases of EHV-1 at this time,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials wrote in a news release issued Thursday. “Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, the Idaho state veterinarian urges horse owners, trainers and event organizers to take immediate biosecurity precautions and temporarily stop any transporting or hauling of equine to protect Idaho horses.”
Although the virus is highly contagious among horses and can be spread through respiratory particles or contaminated equipment or clothing, state officials said the virus cannot infect humans. 
As a result of the confirmed cases of EHV-1, Idaho state officials urge horse owners, trainers and event organizers who may have participated in the events in Texas and Oklahoma to contact their veterinarian or the Idaho State Department of Agriculture’s Division of Animal Industries immediately. The phone number for the Boise off of the Division of Animal Industries is (208) 332-8540.
Symptoms of EHV-1 may include fever, nasal discharge or coughing, lethargy or depression, abortions on pregnant mares or neurological changes such as stumbling, incoordination, head tilt or hind leg weakness, state officials said. 
Infected horses may take up to 21 days to show symptoms, officials said.
Additional information about EHV-1 and biosecurity recommendations is available online.

The union representing Vermont state employees is turning to two legal venues to challenge Gov. Phil Scott’s order that many of its members return to the office in person.
On Nov. 10, the Vermont State Employees’ Association filed a charge with the state’s Labor Relations Board alleging the Scott administration skirted a union demand to enter formal bargaining over the return-to-work plan, in violation of labor protection laws. The plan will require many employees to come into the office at least three days a week. 
The union also filed a separate grievance with the Labor Relations Board arguing that parts of the plan violated the collective bargaining agreement it has in place with the state.

Then, on Nov. 12, the union filed a lawsuit in Washington County Superior civil court asking a judge to bar the Scott administration from implementing its workplace plan — set to take effect Dec. 1 — until the labor board adjudicates the union’s complaints. 
The union wrote in its lawsuit that “neither the unfair labor practice charge nor the grievance is capable of being decided” by the labor board before Dec. 1. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction that allows state employees to continue working remotely.
Steve Howard, the union’s executive director, said in an interview Wednesday that he hoped the suit would at least slow the implementation of the governor’s directive. He said he thought a hearing could be held on the lawsuit as soon as next week. 
The legal challenges mark a significant escalation in the monthslong fight between the union and the administration over the plan to have state workers, with some exceptions, return to the office. The union contends that the hybrid work mandate will cause experienced employees to quit, decreasing the quality of state departments’ work. 
At the same time, administration officials say that the order will improve government services by boosting collaboration and helping to preserve institutional knowledge. They’ve argued Vermonters want government workers to be present in-person.
In a statement Thursday, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said the union’s legal challenges had no impact on Scott’s support for the plan. 
“The Administration’s decision to implement this standard is well within our authority,” Wheeler wrote. “The Governor’s position on returning to a hybrid work standard has not changed, he continues to believe human connection is an important part of employee engagement, as well as team building and learning from each other.” 
According to court filings, after the administration formally announced its return-to-work plans in late August, it wrote to the union in September requesting a meeting to discuss the plans and hear the union’s concerns. In that letter, which is attached to the lawsuit, John Berard, the state’s director of labor relations, said the plan did not need to be the subject of formal bargaining. That’s because the planned hybrid work requirement was permissible under an existing teleworking policy for state employees, he said.

But the union doesn’t see it that way. In court filings, the union contends state leaders agreed to remote working arrangements for their employees, starting at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, that did not fall under the stipulations of the teleworking policy. Those arrangements “have become an established condition of employment which the State is not free to change” without entering formal bargaining, the union wrote in an Oct. 24 letter to the state. It demanded, in that letter, that bargaining take place. 
Berard then wrote the union back Nov. 10 saying the state’s position had remained unchanged, according to court filings. That’s the same day the union filed its challenges with the state Labor Relations Board.
The legal challenges are set to play out as the state has expanded its workspace ahead of the planned return to office for many employees. On Monday, it signed leases for three new office spaces in the privately owned Pilgrim Park complex in Waterbury, which records show would be used by workers at the state Agency of Human Services.
That agency has been facing a shortage of office space at the nearby Waterbury State Office Complex, where much of its operations are based. The shortage could delay the restart of in-person work for some employees past Dec. 1, officials said previously.
The state is set to pay about $2.3 million to lease the new office space over the next five years, according to the leases.

(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images.)Washington state lawmakers next year are set to again discuss whether public sector unions can bargain over their employers’ adoption of artificial intelligence technology.
House Bill 1622 looks to require government employers to bargain with unions over the use of the technology if it affects wages or worker performance evaluations. 
This past session, the bill passed the House mostly along party lines, with Democratic support, before stalling in the Senate.
Opponents, including business groups and city officials, argued the measure would skew the balance of power between employees and managers too far toward workers. They also said the mandate could delay workplace innovation.
With hopes of getting it over the finish line in 2026, the bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Lisa Parshley, D-Olympia, brought the idea to the state’s artificial intelligence task force on Thursday. The Legislature created the task force in 2024.
“Public sector bargaining covers wages, hours and working conditions and agencies are already required to bargain any change that touches those areas, but without legislation, that bargaining happens after implementation,” said Washington State Labor Council President April Sims. “With legislation like House Bill 1622, it would happen before.”
A state law passed in 2002 prohibits bargaining over technology for classified employees of state agencies and higher education institutions. 
“The biggest technology decisions made by management was, what kind of desktop, what kind of fax, what kind of phone,” Parshley said of the era when that law took effect. “Is that fair when we have a technology that now will actually impact our workers in ways that we have not even begun to realize?”
A separate statute governing workers at cities, counties and other agencies, on the other hand, requires bargaining over technology if it affects issues like wages, hours or working conditions.
Many workers are concerned about what the rapid rise of artificial intelligence means for their job security. 
A Pew Research Center survey conducted late last year reported over half of workers are worried about the future impact of AI on the workplace and about one-third think it will lead to fewer jobs. About one-in-six workers said AI was already doing some of their work.
Maryland, for example, is partnering with AI company Anthropic to help residents apply for food aid, Medicaid and other social welfare programs.
In early 2024, then-Gov. Jay Inslee issued an executive order outlining a future for state government’s use of generative artificial intelligence. It noted that the state “seeks to harness the potential of generative AI in an ethical and equitable way for the benefit of the state government workforce.”
In line with that guidance, a September directive from the state’s Office of Financial Management requires giving union-represented state employees six months’ notice of any use of generative AI if it “will result in a consequential change in employee wages, hours, or working conditions.” Under the memo, unions can file a demand to bargain over using the technology.
“Including workers at the beginning is not a courtesy. It is a practical necessity,” Sims said. “It identifies risk. It ensures human oversight where it is needed, and it builds trust among staff, who will ultimately have to operate, troubleshoot and rely on these systems.”
The memo also mandates human review for such systems when they’re used for employment-related decisions.
Parshley called the directive an “excellent first step.” But she says her proposed law “would allow future administrations to be held accountable” by codifying the order in law.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order directing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue states that pass regulations on AI. But it’s unclear if that would cover potential laws like this one, since it doesn’t directly regulate the technology itself.
It’s the latest salvo in the debate over a federal versus state approach to guardrails on the technology. In the debate over Trump’s signature tax cut and spending law over the summer, Congress considered putting a moratorium on state-level artificial intelligence regulations. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., led the charge to axe that provision from the final law.

Santiago/Getty Images)A Northern Kentucky Republican is working on a bill that would require all Kentucky police agencies to enter agreements for immigration enforcement under a program that has rapidly expanded under the Trump administration. 
Rep. TJ Roberts, of Burlington, presented the proposal during a Thursday meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government. He argued that entering such agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would provide Kentucky police agencies with new federal resources and dollars. 
However, Democrats on the committee voiced apprehension about requiring local agencies to partner with ICE. 
“I think this really gets down to being a local control issue for me,” said Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville. “Our law enforcement agencies, I think they know their jurisdictions best. They know where their resources need to be allocated.”
Roberts later said that his bill would be “a way to ensure greater senses of community policing, of allowing it to be done and administered by the local level.” 
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly could consider the bill during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January. 
Roberts called the agreements an “incredible opportunity to provide more resources to our law enforcement community, to promote public safety and to align us with the priorities of the federal government.” He added that local police officers would be “deputized for limited immigration enforcement,” such as during traffic stops when they have “reasonable suspicion” to further investigate the driver’s or passengers’ citizenship or immigration status. 
Roberts acknowledged that while some Kentucky law enforcement agencies have entered ICE agreements, he believes “we do not have that in the areas that we need it at.” 
According to ICE’s website, 22 law enforcement agencies within Kentucky have an active 287(g) program to date. The agencies include mostly county sheriffs’ departments but also some local jails and a local police department. All of the agreements were signed this year. 
Roarx questioned what Roberts meant by not having the agreements “in the areas that need it most.” Roberts said his home region of Northern Kentucky, which has major highways, should have such agreements. He added that “it’s needed everywhere in Kentucky” and not just in the counties with current programs. 
“Once they complete that 40 hours of training that is all online, that is paid for by the federal government, these officers are deputized by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” Roberts said. “And they can only engage in this limited enforcement while under the supervision of the federal authorities in order to ensure that there is oversight, that there is accountability.” 
If approved, Roberts’ proposal would direct the Kentucky State Police and local law enforcement agencies to have a written agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The program is often referred to as the 287(g) Program. 
Under such agreements, ICE can delegate “the authority to perform specified immigration officer functions” to state and law enforcement officers, the federal agency’s website says. 
ICE expanded the number of agreements by 641% after Republican President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. However, immigrants and their advocates have argued that these agreements can lead to racial profiling and lack oversight. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced that law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) Program would be eligible for significant reimbursements starting in October. An example of that is that ICE may reimburse an agency for “the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained 287(g) officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer’s annual salary.” 
Roberts argued the agreements would bring in significant dollars to Kentucky law enforcement agencies. He added that he had been working with legislative liaisons for DHS and ICE on the legislation and it was “one of their top priorities.” 
Committee co-chair Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, emphasized that he viewed the agreements as “an opportunity to potentially utilize resources from the federal government to implement those into our local communities that we serve.” 
Democratic lawmakers took issue with the proposal. Rep. Sarah Stalker, of Louisville, said she had “a lot of concern” about deputizing officers for a new jurisdiction, particularly when news reports across the country have highlighted what many see as cruelty and abuse during arrests and mass raids. 
“I feel like this would simply exacerbate an issue that is already on its own out of control,” Stalker said. 
Before the meeting, advocacy group Kentucky Citizens for Democracy expressed concerns about Roberts’ proposal and encouraged lawmakers to reject the legislation. 
“This proposal, which strips local governments of the ability to decide their own level of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, is fundamentally unacceptable,” the group said in a statement. “Our cities and counties know their communities best. Forcing them into mandatory cooperation with ICE, given its long history of egregious and cruel actions, violence, and overly aggressive tactics, will deepen fear, break trust, and push our immigrant neighbors further into the shadows.”

“I want to state clearly the way our AML (anti-money laundering) program operated in this instance was unacceptable,” Caesars Entertainment Chairman of the Board Gary Carano told the commission. 
“We never sacrifice compliance for revenue,” Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said. “There is no customer that’s worth illegitimate profits. We didn’t catch Boyer and we should have. Full stop.”
The $7.8 million is three times the amount that Bowyer lost gambling at Caesars. 
“So any notion or concern that Caesars will somehow benefit net of a fine amount is absolutely not the case,” said Michael Somps of the Nevada Attorney General’s office. “They are paying three times more than they won over the period.”
Bowyer, an associate, and illegal bookie Damien LeForbes, lost just under $24 million at Resorts World Las Vegas, which paid a $10.5 million fine for allowing them to gamble, leaving the casino with close to $14 million in net profit, and rendering the sanction little more than the cost of doing business. 
Bowyer is currently serving a 12-month sentence for bookmaking and money laundering. LeForbes is awaiting sentencing on the same charges.
“You had an AML officer who was a senior vice president,” Commissioner Rosa Solis-Rainey said to Caesars Palace executives. “The fact that this gentleman was a bookie was brought to his attention in 2019, so that is six years before he was banned by the property.” 
Only Solis-Rainey declined to support the stipulated fine, which she said should be higher, given what she deemed to be more egregious violations by Caesars than MGM Grand. That resort paid an $8.5 million fine for allowing another bookie, Wayne Nix, to pay gambling debts with a large amount of cash. 
Scott Sibella, president of MGM at the time, lost his gaming license for failing to file an anti-money laundering (AML) report for the transaction, and entered a plea deal in federal court for the same infraction.  
On Thursday, Solis-Rainey and Commissioner Brian Krolicki conflated Bowyer and Nix, holding Bowyer solely responsible for a series of high-profile AML violations adjudicated by regulators this year. 
MGM, Solis-Rainey, had “all of the steps in place years before Bowyer infiltrated their system, and that was done through the help of a third party internally that chose to make unilateral decisions, to not follow the program,” she said, referring to Sibella and confusing Bowyer with Nix. “He (Sibella) was as much a bad actor as Bowyer.” 
Krolicki also erroneously attempted to lay all of the Strip’s money laundering sanctions this year at Bowyer’s feet. 
“This AML wrecking ball by the name of Mathew Boyer continues to wreak havoc on compliance plans down the street,” he said. ”I’m as livid today as I was during the first case. …It’s almost numbing that we continue to have this conversation, particularly because of the acts of one individual.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-10-1024x576.png,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

The state Insurance Superintendent is asking the Legislature to extend a $10 million fire mitigation program for homeowners in high-fire-risk areas. (Patrick Lohmann / Source New Mexico)New Mexico’s Superintendent of Insurance said Thursday she hopes the Legislature will continue its support of a $10 million wildfire mitigation program for homes at extremely high wildfire risk, a program she said is becoming a national model to address rising homeowners’ insurance rates and cancellations.
The Legislature gave $10 million to the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance during the session in January for grants to homeowners who live in increasingly wildfire-prone areas. The grants help owners who have “Fair Access to Insurance Requirements” plans, or FAIR plans, pay for wildfire mitigation measures.
The state’s FAIR plan increasingly provides the only option for homeowners in wildfire-prone areas. Known as the “insurer of last resort,” the plans only become available to home and property owners if they’ve been denied coverage in the private market. 
Lawmakers approved the $10 million in grants this year to help FAIR plan recipients avoid losing their homes to wildfire, but the funding expires June 30, according to the state budget. 
NM GOP and Democrats say state needs to fix home insurance, as disasters upend private market

Insurance Superintendent Alice Kane told the Legislative Finance Committee on Thursday that she is asking the Legislature to re-authorize and extend the funding, because the program shows promise and could become a national model with more time. She also said the program ranks as the largest of its kind in terms of the amount of financial support available.
“We think the whole country is looking at us as being a leader in this wildfire mitigation program,” she said. 
As of Thursday, she said 28 Otero County homeowners with the FAIR Plan were slated to receive $7,000 grants from the fund as part of a “pilot program” to fire-proof their roofs in line with the highest standards of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, a nonprofit research and testing organization that seeks to reduce property damage from natural disasters.
Kane said she hopes those roofs will all be completed by spring, and then the office will have tested a grant program that could benefit as many as 1,400 FAIR plan holders. 
“We’re hoping that the pilot program will be not just operational, but done by the first quarter this year, so we can show the Legislature that the money is being used,” she said.
Across the state, homeowner and other property insurance premiums have sharply increased, and insurers have refused to renew or even canceled policies in some areas, particularly the burn scars of the recent South Fork, Salt and Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fires.
In the private market, New Mexico’s 10 biggest insurers have increased premiums on average 50% to 60% since 2022, the chief OSI actuary has said. 
The mitigation program is just one of several big changes to the FAIR plan in 2025. During the session, the OSI approved increasing the plan’s coverage from $350,000 to $750,000. And in October, the office announced that an increase in commercial coverage limits, as well, from $1 million to $2 million. 
In October, about 7,200 residents were in the FAIR plan statewide, including 280 businesses, according to the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0116-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

The state’s third major political party, the Vermont Progressive Party, voted in an almost entirely new bench of statewide leaders at its biennial convention earlier this month.
Among them is a new party chair: Bill Hunsinger of Ripton, who serves as one of two Progressive-endorsed members of that Addison County town’s selectboard. He is the party’s first new chair in close to a decade. Anthony Pollina, a longtime state senator from Middlesex, stepped down this month from the job, which he had held since 2017.
The Progs also elected Cindy Weed, a former state representative from Enosburgh, as vice chair, along with a slate of other officials who oversee the party’s finances and direct its electoral strategy. Ahead of the convention, the party also hired a new executive director: Heather Thomas. Josh Wronski, the party’s former director, left the job in July after nine years.
In all, just four members of the party’s 17-person leadership committee are returning to their posts after the party’s convention, held Nov. 9 at the Old Labor Hall in Barre. A press release called the changes “a new era for the Vermont Progressive Party.”

Hunsinger said he wants that new era to include a stronger party presence at the most local levels of government. That means giving more candidates for selectboard and school board races a Progressive Party endorsement, he said in an interview, even though few of those seats, anywhere in the state, are filled in party-based elections. 
In Burlington — where candidates for city office do run under a party label — Progs control the mayor’s office and have a slim minority of five of 12 seats on the City Council. 
According to the party’s website, there are also Prog-backed officials in nonpartisan selectboard seats in Ripton, Brattleboro and Dummerston, as well as in nonpartisan school board seats in Burlington and the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union.
“We’re not trying to make these races partisan,” Hunsinger said Wednesday. “Just, you know — there are Progressives. We’re here. We’re reducing speed limits, and helping organize food drives and clothing drives. It’s that sort of a mentality.”
At the state level, there are three members of the Vermont House and one state senator who primarily identify with the party’s label. A number of other members of both chambers, and State Auditor Doug Hoffer, identify as Democrat/Progressives. The party often caucuses with Democrats and its platform aligns with Democrats on many issues.
However, the Progressive caucus disagreed with many Democrats, who control both chambers of the Legislature, on this year’s marquee legislation — Act 73. That’s the law that lays out sweeping changes to how Vermont’s schools are funded and governed. To be sure, Republican Gov. Phil Scott had also insisted legislators advance the law in a form he was amenable to.
Hunsinger said he wants Progs to continue taking a stand against Act 73 in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January. Burlington Rep. Kate Logan, the House Progressive leader, agreed in an interview Thursday that would be a priority for her caucus next year.
At its recent convention, the Progs passed a resolution “to petition the VT Legislature to rescind Act 73, and instead explore options to make the education portion of the Property Tax more fair and equitable in order to ensure that every owner of property in Vermont is contributing proportionally to funding Vermont Schools,” the party’s release said.
Hunsinger described his opposition to the education reform plan, which seeks to consolidate the state’s 119 school districts, as a desire to preserve local control. He charged that the Legislature has been making “broad, almost power-grabby decisions.”
“Our party is going to keep fighting for making sure that our schools are kept in our communities — and our communities are given autonomy over their own schools,” he said.
The party also passed two resolutions at its convention this month focused on major national issues. The party does not run candidates for federal offices, though it counts Vermont’s independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders among its ranks.
One of those measures “condemns the apartheid and ethnic cleansing by the Israeli State” against people in Gaza and calls for an immediate end to all U.S. government funding for the Israeli military, according to the press release. It also states “that Israeli settlers in the West Bank be expelled and the land returned to Palestinians.”
Sanders has been among the most vocal critics of the Israeli government in the U.S. Senate and, along with the other two members of Vermont’s congressional delegation, has called the country’s military campaign in Gaza a “genocide.”
Another resolution “recognizes the critical need for public resistance to and non-compliance with unlawful and unconstitutional actions” by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Hunsinger said he hopes the party can be a home for Democrats who feel that their party, at the national level, isn’t doing enough to resist Trump’s many controversial actions over the first year of his second term.
“The Vermont Progressive Party endorses all facets of resistance, including political action, protests, strikes, boycotts and other acts of non-compliance,” the resolution states, per the release. “We will work in every capacity afforded to us.”

The summit “is a way to coalesce in our movement of resistance against authoritarianism, oligarchy and oppression,” said Big Hartman, Human Rights Commission general counsel and executive director.

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Nov. 20, 2025
Human rights concerns and calls to action spanned a sweeping summit of the same name last weekend in Randolph Center, as advocates from across the state gathered to call out inequity and mistreatment, in areas from housing to policing, with an eye toward pushing Vermonters to continue to effect change.
The state Human Rights Commission hosted the three-day event, the first of its kind, largely in response to federal actions over the last several months.
“The idea for this conference really hit me like a bolt of lightning during one of many sleepless nights where my mind could not rest amidst the horror of what is happening at the national and global level,” said Big Hartman, HRC general counsel and executive director, in their opening remarks to a few dozen community members who turned out to Vermont State University’s Judd Hall on Nov. 14. At least twice that number tuned in online.
The summit “is a way to coalesce in our movement of resistance against authoritarianism, oligarchy and oppression,” said Hartman. “To strategize for solutions to the civil rights crisis that is upon us. We are not here to complain and commiserate about the Trump administration’s horrendous policies and actions, although of course a little of that is bound to happen.”
In the spirit of boosting spirits and strengthening participants’ resolve in working toward justice, the summit began by celebrating Vermont’s human rights wins over the years, such as its leadership in marriage rights for same-sex couples, gender identity non-discrimination, expansion of protections against harassment and access to housing.
José Ignacio De La Cruz of Migrant Justice spoke of his personal experiences with discrimination in Vermont that led to his and others’ advocacy work. That work resulted in a recently enacted Vermont law that expressly prohibits discrimination against immigrants in housing and in places of public accommodation, based on their citizenship or immigration status. Specifically, the new law requires landlords to accept an original or copy of an unexpired government-issued ID, an individual tax identification number or a Social Security number.
Before the law was passed, De La Cruz said, immigrants often faced discrimination because they did not have a Social Security number. He also pointed to other acts of discrimination, particularly as he and other community members in recent years began seeking employment, and subsequently housing, in areas outside of dairy farming where housing was included as a condition of employment.
For example, “when workers were leaving farms to work on sawmills or with some construction subcontractors,” they were assured there would be housing, but ultimately would find untenable conditions — such as four workers being charged $500 each to share a single bedroom, or, in the case of De La Cruz’s family member, who belongs to a queer community, being told: “You can’t have visitors at home because I don’t want the house to fill up with people like you.”
Other key voices throughout the weekend came from those who, like De La Cruz, shared their lived experience. Among them were Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal U.S. resident and Palestinian activist who last April was taken away by masked federal agents after his naturalization appointment in Colchester. During a session on Saturday, Mahdawi and one of his attorneys, Monica Allard of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, spoke of his experience.
“After 16 days in a Vermont prison, a judge ordered Mohsen to be released, allowing him to return to his communities, his studies, and his advocacy,” Allard said. “But this legal battle is not over, and the [federal] government was in court just weeks ago arguing again that it has the authority to lock Mohsen back up.”
For his part, Mahdawi, who grew up in a refugee camp in the West Bank, spoke poetically of his community of Vermonters “being as sweet as the maple syrup that we get from the maple trees,” and as connected in protecting each other. A stark contrast from life in the camp, he said, where “as a child … I never felt safe.”
He also spoke of Vermont being a place in the United States where civil rights and the constitution are protected. “Democracy and human rights are aligned,” he said, and noted that what we are seeing now are “very chilling” attacks on free speech. Mahdawi contemplated what the “future could look like for humanity” if Project 2025 — a political blueprint aimed at reshaping government in line with far-right policies — is successful.
“If they succeed in orchestrating it, and demolishing and destroying human rights here in this country, silencing people, punishing people for their speech, they will be able to do it on a much larger level,” on an international level, given the influence of the United States.
A discussion about policing
José Ignacio De La Cruz also participated in a panel centered on fair and impartial policing in Vermont, a session that frequently turned to the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the state, as well as the role of law enforcement as communities struggle to respond to mental health crises.
Among the other panelists were Vermont State Police Sgt. Daniel F. Bennett, a senior drill instructor who also serves as co-director of the Fair and Impartial Policing Committee; Lisa Ryan, community inclusion director with the Vermont Criminal Justice Council and Vermont Police Academy; and Tabitha-Ann J. Moore, an equity strategist and consultant who works with law enforcement and communities. Moore is also the founding president of the Rutland-area NAACP.
Again the topic was personal for De La Cruz, who last June, with his stepdaughter, was detained by U.S. Border Patrol while delivering food to a farm. They were held for weeks before being released following a public campaign.
He spoke of the migrant community’s fight for access to driver’s licenses years ago, but how once they had them, and were on the roads, they would get pulled over by police and end up getting turned over to Border Patrol. “Because of all the work over the past decade, I can say now that really we have changed those practices and that we’re not seeing that form of collaboration” between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities, he said.
On what it means to be a leader in fair and impartial policing, Bennett noted that VSP has long been forward-thinking. “It’s an important distinction that Vermont State Police began this [work and have taken] it seriously, prior to all the attention and the focus on this,” the sergeant said. “We’re doing a lot of cooperation with a lot of different organizational communities.”
Ryan, the VCJC community inclusion director said that Vermont is a national leader “because we walk the walk at the top, right? We are doing and acting in what we’re saying we’re gonna do. … We have a great system of community policing in the state, people getting to know their neighbors. So I think being a small state and building those relationships between law enforcement, communities, and the different agencies that law enforcement represents is so important.”
Still, the panelists addressed instances where actions on the ground do not align with policies. De La Cruz referred to instances where Border Patrol has been called on the pretext of law enforcement needing help translating from Spanish to English. “At the end of the day, the result was that the person was being detained by immigration authorities. … These pretexts [are] put in place to try to avoid compliance with policy.”

(Getty Images)A Florida Bar complaint alleging defamation was filed Thursday against a Miami Beach City Commission candidate who had long-celebrated her father — a serial killer who inspired ‘Dexter’ executed by the state in 2012 — on social media.
The complaint by South Florida filmmaker Billy Corben alleges that Monique Pardo Pope, an attorney and commission hopeful, defamed him to the Miami New Times by falsely claiming — somewhat ironically — that Corben had previously lost a defamation case.
Pardo Pope is preparing for a run-off election for the seat on Dec. 9.
Her comment came after the Times asked her about a discovery Corben had made:
Pardo Pope’s father was a pro-Nazi, anti-Black serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people in South Florida. Years after his execution, Pardo Pope called Manuel Pardo her “guiding light” on social media, promising Floridians that she planned to bring the “kind of leadership” she learned from her family to City Hall.
“Ms. Pardo Pope is certainly free to view her father as an angelic, heroic figure and she unquestionably has the right to criticize my reporting; however, she is not entitled to defame me, nor should she be allowed to ignore her professional obligations as a member of the Bar,” Corben wrote in his five-page complaint, rife with Eminem quotes and sardonic hits at the Bar for not disciplining other embattled attorneys.
“Moreover, as my reporting rightfully notes, if Ms. Pardo Pope intends to use her family history as the slightest basis for her candidacy, she should be candid with voters about the sins of her serial killer father and explain how she reconciles that history with her glowing statements about him,” he added.
Later, talking to the Phoenix, Corben stressed that his complaint is “not about the sins of the father, but about the lies of the daughter.”
What happened?
On Sep. 25, Corben, an avid critic of local Miami politics and founder of the BecauseMiami podcast, first reported that the Miami Beach candidate was related to Manuel Pardo, a fired Sweetwater police officer who dealt cocaine and systematically murdered both drug dealers and bystanders alike in the 1980s.
Pardo Pope was 4 years old when the crimes occurred.
When searching the Pardos’ Hialeah apartment, Corben said officers found a family dog named “Satan,” tattooed with a Swastika, Polaroid photos of Pardo’s victims, and a slew of anti-Black and anti-Jewish memorabilia. Pardo was executed via lethal injection after then-Gov. Rick Scott signed his death warrant in 2012.
Years after his execution, Pardo Pope offered adulation of her father on social media. He was her “guardian angel,” she wrote.
“Happiest of Birthdays to this little girl’s first true love — her Daddy. You would’ve been 59 years young today. Missing you each and everyday, mi papi bello….my guiding light in the sky, my eternal best friend,” she wrote, including a photo of him holding her as a baby.
She signed it off with his final words on the execution table, “Airborne forever, love your Michi girl.”
The Miami New Times quickly picked up Corben’s reporting, reaching out to Pardo Pope for comment (she did not immediately respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment). She told them that “Billy Corben has made a career of slinging mud, which has even resulted in losing a defamation case.”
Corben had not lost the defamation case. The case against his movie-making firm was dismissed, and Corben’s company instead filed an anti-SLAPP suit and was awarded more $180k. The law disfavors lawsuits found to infringe participation in public affairs.

They said the department’s approach and the decisions violate the Montana Constitution.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Lewis and Clark County District Court, Bull Mountain Land Alliance and the Northern Plains Resource Council both say that vague rules or, in some cases, no rules allow department officials to modify mining plans constantly without any public notice, input and scrutiny. If the court found that to be the case, it would not only violate the Montana Constitution’s provisions guaranteeing the right-to-know and right to participate in government, but also run afoul of the environmental protections enshrined in the state’s document as well.
The state’s constitution says that residents must be provided the information about governmental plans, often described as “right to know.” That includes some residents and groups being notified when changes are proposed. Another section of the constitution says that residents have the right to participate or give input at the decision making process. However, the new lawsuit said that DEQ officials are making thousands of decisions without any public notice or chance to comment. Moreover, the suit alleges that DEQ officials have created a regulatory scheme that is vague and poorly defined so that it can essentially hide information from the public until after the action is completed. Montana’s Constitutional also requires a “clean and healthful” environment for current and future generations.
Officials with the DEQ did not respond to requests for comment as of publication.
  Major vs. minor decisions 

Part of the case turns on how the state’s DEQ, which has supervisory and regulatory power over mining operations in Montana, classifies decisions, either as major or minor. Major decisions are subject to public notice and input, whereas the state appears not to apply the same processes to actions it deems “minor.”
For example, ranchers, farmers and landowners near the Bull Mountain Mine, which is operated by Signal Peak Energy, say that the mine’s operations affect their springs, livestock wells and groundwater. However, they are often unaware of actions that are being taken by the company and approved by state DEQ regulators because they are considered minor revisions to the mine’s permit.
“(DEQ’s) regulations authorizing revisions to permits with no notice or opportunity to be heard are unlawful under Montana’s public participation statutes and infringe on fundamental constitutional rights by depriving plaintiffs and their members of adequate notice of permit revision applications, agency deliberations and any meaningful opportunity to examine documents or participate in decisions of significant interest to them and to the broader public,” the suit said.
The DEQ currently defines “major revisions” or actions as those which result in:


A significant change in the post mining drainage plan;
A change in the post mining land use;
A significant change in the bonding level within the permitted area; or
A change that may affect the reclaimability of an area or the hydrologic balance on or off the permitted area.

 
Major changes must be published in a newspaper for four consecutive weeks, with the last triggering a 30-day public comment period. The DEQ also has a list of five things it does if a major permit revision is complete, and that includes public notice of the action, where documents can be inspected, and that comments can be submitted formally or informally.
However, the suit points out: “There is no public process required or prescribed by law for the proposed permit revisions that DEQ considers to be ‘minor.’”
That alone, the lawsuit contends, is problematic because it appears to be at odds with the state’s Constitution.
  Hundreds of minor changes 

The conservation groups say during the life of the Bull Mountain mine permit, the DEQ has approved hundreds of permit revisions to it without “any public notice or process by classifying the revisions as ‘minor.’” Attorneys for the groups say in the past decade alone, they’ve tracked approximately 100 which have skirted a public review process.
Even with these small changes, the DEQ prepares an environmental assessment for the minor revisions, but those don’t get posted publicly and there is no public feedback mechanism, according to the lawsuit.
“Many of the revisions approved by DEQ for the Bull Mountains Mine permit with no public process have concerned modifications to surface water control plans, mitigation plans associated with springs and livestock wells, and the monitoring and quality assurance plan — all of which are incorporated into the permit — without any notice or any opportunity to comment by either the public at large or the landowners whose water resources are the subject of the minor permit revision,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said that there’s no chance for the public to participate or even know about the revisions, one of the bedrock principles of Montana’s open records laws: That residents must be given a meaningful way to be notified and participate.
The lawsuit noted that even Rep. Gary W. Parry, a Republican lawmaker and advocate for coal mining from Colstrip, warned in 2023 that the policy was vague.
“The current definition (in Montana DEQ rules) for a ‘minor revision’ is, essentially, anything that isn’t a major revision,” Parry said on Nov. 22, 2023. “That kind of ambiguity sets the stage for uncertainty for our mining industry, and an open door for litigation against the state when the department exercises its discretion in applying this broad definition.”
  DEQ responses 

Both the Bull Mountains Land Alliance and the Northern Plains Resource Council contend in the lawsuit that they have “repeatedly raised concerns” about this policy, but have not had much feedback.
“DEQ has failed to respond meaningfully by to plaintiffs’ concerns,” it said.
Moreover, the vague approach to minor versus major changes are not backed up by other resources.
“DEQ has no publicly available guidance document, manual, policy or other written criteria governing how it determines whether a proposed revision is a major or minor,” the lawsuit said. “The vague and ambiguous regulator definitions of ‘major revision’ and ‘minor revision’ coupled with the absence of any public process for minor revisions has created a regulatory loophole that DEQ has exploited to approve hundreds of coal mine permit modifications without public oversight.”
The lawsuit claims that violations of state constitutional law require Judge Mike McMahon to apply strict scrutiny to the case, which means that the DEQ will have to show that its approach to permitting mines serves a beneficial public purpose and that it has done it in the least restrictive way.
The groups, represented by Barbara Chillcott, Melissa Hornbein, and Meridian Wappett of the Western Environmental Law Center in Helena, are asking for the court to rule the policies violate state law, and force the DEQ to provide public notice and afford the public the right to participate or comment on the process. The groups are also asking for the court to award it attorneys’ fees for vindicating constitutional rights, if they’re successful.
“By delegating to itself unfettered discretion to process permit revisions behind closed doors, DEQ violates our fundamental constitutional rights to know and participate in the operations of our government,” said Bull Mountains resident Pat Thiele, who is also a member of the Landowners Alliance. “This practice not only threatens our livelihoods here in the Bull Mountains, but erodes the rights of Montanans across our state.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG-4639-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Emmons County residents had mixed but mostly positive opinions Thursday about a project that would be North Dakota’s first-ever battery storage site.
NextEra, the company overseeing the project, is looking to build an estimated $181 million to $191 million Battery Energy Storage System project that would use massive batteries to harbor wind energy when it’s produced in excess — on days when wind harnessed by turbines exceed demand for electricity. Utility regulators will decide whether to give the proposal the final green light.
The batteries would be stored on 24 acres of an existing wind farm operated by NextEra. Storage sites are typically empty fields peppered with rows of massive, highly-secure battery units similar in size to shipping containers.
Similar projects have been popping up across the country as a way to smooth out grid congestion tied to energy sources variable generation. The technology receives production tax incentives from the federal government.
North Dakota utility regulators to consider state’s first-ever battery storage sites 

During a Public Service Commission hearing in Emmons County on Thursday, NextEra told utility regulators the storage site would have minimal adverse impacts on the area. Approximately two dozen people were in the audience. 
Michael Bettis, a fire safety engineer for NextEra, said the major potential safety threats when it comes to Battery Energy Storage Systems are called “thermal runaway events.”
Such events occur when a small portion of a battery unit fails and captures more heat than it can dissipate, Bettis said. Sometimes this occurs when water leaks into a unit; other times it’s caused by general internal system failure.
Thermal events can result in fire, but they begin by expelling hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, according to Bettis. Part of the safety response plan involves training local firefighters to let a fire burn within the storage site area because it consumes the hydrogen and the carbon compounds. 
Bettis said of NextEra’s 50 battery storage sites in the United States, there have been few thermal runaway events — none of which resulted in environmental contamination.
He also pointed to the project application, which outlines the constant on-site monitoring and procedures in place if a thermal event were to occur. NextEra later told the commission it’s been in contact with local first responders to establish a safety plan. 
The company also vowed to craft a plan for decommissioning the batteries and to provide associated financial insurance. 
North Dakota coal industry prepares to seize opportunity for growth

Public Service Commission Chair Randy Christmann previously raised concerns about the site using batteries made in “adversarial” countries, like China. But NextEra told commissioners Thursday the company has since decided to use lithium-ion batteries sourced in the United States. 
NextEra Environmental Specialist Dustin Wernicke said further impacts to the environment, such as air, water, soil and noise pollution, are minimal. He also said the company has consulted with some tribal representatives about possible discovery of cultural resources during construction.   
Around 150 construction and one to three permanent jobs would be tied to the project, the company estimates, and the county is estimated to reel in $7.2 million in property taxes over its 25-year lifespan. 
After more than three hours of discussion with NextEra, commissioners heard testimony from a handful of area residents who had varying opinions on the project. 
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, asked the commission to hold off on issuing a permit until the Legislature has time to design guardrails and a specified tax structure for the new technology.  Magrum’s district is in Emmons county. 
He said the Legislature was “left out” of the process, and too much responsibility was placed on the county during the outset.  
Pete Silbernagel, a former state lawmaker who owns a cabin near the proposed site, disagreed with Magrum’s idea of bringing the Legislature into the approval process and said the benefits to securing the grid outweigh the potential safety risks.
“You’re all well aware of the growing, increasing demand of electricity in this nation,” he said. “I really appreciate the fact that North Dakota has an all-of-the-above approach. I think this project can significantly help provide the energy that we’re going to need in the future.” 
North Dakota Transmission Authority Director Claire Vigesaa told the Monitor he supports the new technology and its ability to stabilize the grid, a sentiment shared by other residents as well as the Dakota Resource Council, an environmental advocacy group. 
“If executed in a manner that does not infringe on the rights and safety of the local community while bringing meaningful benefits to that community, this and future projects should be a good addition to the regional grid,” Mike Graalum of the Dakota Resource Council said in a statement. 
Emmons County has already approved the permits necessary to start construction. The project now awaits approval from the Public Service Commission.
According to Director of Utilities for the Public Service Commission Victor Schock, the decision will likely come in the next month or two, depending on how long it takes the company to provide information requested by the commission.  
If approved, construction is slated to begin May 2026 and be completed by December that year. 
NextEra is proposing a similar battery storage project on the other side of the state, in Burke County. The hearing for that project is scheduled for 10 a.m. Dec. 19 at the Bowbells Memorial City Hall.

There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan.","WHEN I LAID OUT my concerns in advance of last week’s annual hearings on cost trends held by the state Health Policy Commission, I suspected many across our health care ecosystem shared them. The hearings confirmed that. 
Speaker after speaker voiced anxiety about the same issues: the harmful impact of Trump administration policy changes combined with passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; the growing affordability pressures facing families, employers, and state government; the likelihood of increases in both the uninsured and underinsured; the return of double-digit premium hikes; and the precarious financial position of many hospitals, community health centers, and nonprofit insurers. 
My hope then—and still—is that we not only sound the alarm on the dire state of things, but can begin to collectively chart a course of action that lays out a plan for what to do about it all. But anyone listening last week for a clear sense of direction would have been disappointed. While there was general consensus at the hearing that it can’t be business as usual, the ideas offered up for what to do about it were piecemeal. There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan. 
The day opened with Attorney General Andrea Campbell, the lone elected official to speak. She noted the legal battles that her office is involved in with other state attorneys general, fighting against the Trump administration. She enumerated a series of conflicts: efforts to restrict immigrant rights, threats to universities’ federal research funding, actions designed to limit or eliminate access to gender-affirming care, and the battles to continue SNAP benefits during the shutdown. 
Her message was energetic, forceful, and morally clear. But like most presenters that day, despite expressing deep worry about health care affordability, she did not offer concrete solutions.  
What she did offer, though, in a positive note of encouragement about our collective strength and resilience, was an unexpected reference to Muhammad Ali—praising him as someone who consistently punched above his weight, just as Massachusetts has tried to do in health policy and other areas.  As an Ali enthusiast since childhood, that comment caught my attention. So let’s consider the rest of what unfolded at the hearing through the lens of some of The Greatest’s more memorable lines. 
“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” 
This year marked the first time pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) were required to submit written testimony and for a select group to answer questions from Health Policy Commission members. A senior executive from Eli Lilly and a vice president from Optum took the hot seat. 
Pharma companies and PBMs often glide through policy discussions with a polished narrative. Pharma emphasizes innovation, miracle drugs, and breakthroughs. PBMs describe themselves as indispensable negotiators, creating savings for employers and consumers. Their public personas “float” lightly above the messy realities of pricing, profit margins, and opaque contracting. But history reminds us that these companies can sting hard. Whether through monopoly pricing, strategic patent games, or non-transparent rebates and fees that warp incentives, both industries have figured out how to extract tremendous profits from a system they claim to be helping. 
Consider Lilly. Their representative highlighted the company’s new oral GLP-1 weight loss drug, recently approved by the FDA, which will be priced around $150 per month—dramatically less than the current injectable versions costing thousands per month. He clearly hoped for praise. What he did not highlight was that this accelerated approval came after the company struck a deal with the Trump administration involving tariff relief and expedited FDA review for this drug — likely leading to a 2026 launch date.  
Optum’s witness spoke earnestly about negotiating lower prices for certain brand-name drugs, but carefully sidestepped questions about rebate transparency. She showed no interest in discussing how PBM practices contribute to inflated list prices designed to accommodate the rebates PBMs demand. Nor did she acknowledge the well-documented steering of patients to PBM-owned pharmacies, often at the expense of independent community pharmacies.  
“Don’t count the days, make the days count.” 
The day’s standout voice belonged to Michael Levine, director of the state’s Medicaid program, MassHealth. His presentation was a refreshing blend of candor and practicality. Levine described the central challenge ahead: navigating the implementation of new work requirements and administrative hurdles created by the sweeping bill passed this summer, dubbed by Trump the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. These changes threaten to push eligible residents off the Medicaid rolls not because they fail eligibility tests, but often because they cannot easily show that they are exempt from work requirements or meet other paperwork demands. 
Levine outlined two major strategies to prevent unnecessary loss of coverage. First, the state will maximize auto-renewals, drawing on an array of state data sources to verify eligibility without requiring beneficiaries to submit new paperwork. Second, the administration plans to again partner with Health Care For All, replicating their 2023 outreach initiative to help residents complete required documentation.  
His message was clear: The period between now and January 1, 2027—the date when new rules take full effect—must be used to protect as many eligible people as possible. Levine embodied Ali’s dictum about making each day matter. 
“He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.” 
The final panel of the day surfaced the boldest ideas—though none yet sufficiently developed, let alone agreed upon. Still, the willingness to imagine some new affordability-promoting ideas was notable. 
Manny Lopes, CEO of Fallon Health, reminded the audience of the long-running success of the state’s program for frail, community-based elders who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. For roughly 25 years, this model—built on comprehensive care, integration of medical and social services, and a predictable per-member fee—has succeeded in improving health outcomes while reducing nursing home use. Lopes argued that a broader move toward such a system of total capitation could be an innovative path toward restraining spending growth and improving care coordination statewide. 
Doug Howgate of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation floated a more budget-focused concept: creating a hard spending cap for Medicaid and then redesigning payment arrangements beneath that cap to cover as many people as possible. 
Kevin Tabb, CEO of Beth Israel Lahey Health, spoke about the need to “rationalize” care across the state—implying that Massachusetts may need to close low volume health facilities,  and less duplication of certain services.   He implied that there is no ‘free lunch’: if the state wants to reduce overall health care spending it will have consequences for the care delivery system and patient access. 
Blue Cross CEO Sarah Iselin pushed for making the state’s total per capita cost growth benchmark a firm, enforceable number for the total growth of health care spending—rather than only a guiding target.  Right now there is really only a weak performance improvement process (PIP)  that can be applied to a provider whose measured revenue growth per person is above the benchmark—currently at 3.6 percent. 
In recent years, there has been little fear of any meaningful consequence for exceeding the benchmark growth rate—something that Iselin wants to change. She called for a benchmark accountability process with “real teeth and consequences” — presumably one that could even demand that monies be clawed back from market participants whose per capita revenue growth is above the benchmark. She even raised the possibility of exploring global hospital budgets—a payment model used in Maryland—if Massachusetts wants to genuinely restrain hospital spending growth. 
“A man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.” 
As the day closed, members of the commission each offered brief reflections. What united them was a recognition that the system cannot continue functioning under the assumptions of 2012, when the last major health care cost law was enacted. There was a shared sense of urgency that Massachusetts needs a more comprehensive, coherent approach to achieving better health care affordability—one capable of maintaining access while reining in costs. 
Ali could afford to wait out his opponents, leaning against the ropes, conserving energy, and striking when the moment was right. For Massachusetts health care, time is not our ally. 
The problems are accelerating faster than our solutions. The Legislature needs to recognize the urgency of the moment and that now is the time to come off the ropes and engage with purpose to stop the unchecked affordability challenges facing us all.

(Photo courtesy of Crossroads Rhode Island)The state’s housing leaders and homeless care providers are raising the alarm over a new Trump administration directive they say could put over 1,000 formerly unhoused Rhode Islanders back out on the street.
That estimate represents two-thirds of the 1,500 Rhode Islanders now living in what is known as permanent supportive housing — or housing units that provide a subsidized, stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets. 
Permanent supportive housing is a cornerstone of the “Housing First” model, which prioritizes providing immediate housing without preconditions, such as sobriety or treatment programs, to stabilize lives of residents.
But on Nov. 13, the same day the federal government reopened, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a policy change to redirect the majority of its $3.9 billion Continuum of Care funding from permanent supportive housing to transitional housing with work requirements. HUD’s new policy — it aligns with President Donald Trump’s July 24 Executive Order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” — also attacks diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
“Unfortunately, we had some warning this was the direction they were going in, but you try not to believe it until it’s real,” Crossroads Rhode Island CEO Michelle Wilcox said in an interview Thursday. “Now it’s real.”
Wilcox, who leads the state’s largest provider of housing and homeless services, fears that HUD’s changes could mean 14 residents would no longer live at the Harold Lewis House managed by Crossroads. Opened in 2006, the 14-unit building in West Warwick houses formerly homeless people ages 50 and up who have mental health issues or have been unhoused for years — with preference given to veterans.
“We’re serving high needs folks,” Wilcox said. “It’s a really great community for folks where they can have privacy and dignity.”
Wilcox will join other housing leaders outside the Harold Lewis House on Providence Street at 10:30 a.m. Friday to call more attention to the impact the cuts will have on the populations their organizations serve.
HUD has framed the policy change as a way to promote “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.”
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a Nov. 13 statement. “We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”
A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday.
Organizations that don’t rely on federal Continuum of Care grants could end up seeing fewer places to direct Rhode Island’s unhoused population if the state loses permanent housing options.
“The goal that we’ve all been working so hard together on across the state seems like it will come to an end,” said Nick Horton, co-executive director of OpenDoors, a Providence nonprofit that helps formerly incarcerated people, those struggling with addiction and other unhoused people. “This just seems like it’s destroying one of the only resources that we have to help people out of homelessness.”
A 30% cap on permanent housing spending
Rhode Island last year received over $9 million in HUD grants toward permanent supportive housing. HUD’s latest Notice of Funding Opportunity for continuum of care grants is open though Jan. 14, 2026.
Grant awards are expected to be made May 1, according to the funding notice issued Nov. 13. The funding notice limits how much Continuum of Care funding communities can spend on permanent housing to 30%. The National Alliance to End Homelessness has warned that cap will force communities and organizations to reallocate funds from permanent housing programs to less effective programs.
Based on that math, Wilcox said an estimated 1,020 of the roughly 1,500 Rhode Islanders in federally-funded permanent supportive housing could be out on the street. 
But Brenda Clement, director of housing policy research group HousingWorks RI, said she’s hopeful that drastic scenario can be avoided as the state’s own Continuum of Care board crafts its request for proposals for providers
“We’re hoping to be able to craft things so that we can continue to meet the requirements of the new restrictions,” Clement, who serves on the Continuum of Care’s Finance Committee, said. “The last outcome that anyone wants is to see more people on the street.”
Still, Clement said her preference is that the federal government stick to the “Housing First” model adopted in the 1990s.
“It helps people get into recovery, it helps people get into a better economic situation,” Clement said. “But for whatever reason, this administration does not share this philosophy.”

Ford",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-ice-official-elaborates-plan-send-kilmar-abrego-garcia-liberia,,"GREENBELT, Md. — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detailed to a federal judge Thursday plans for the Trump administration to again remove the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, this time to the West African country of Liberia.U.S. District of Maryland Judge Paula Xinis is considering whether to lift her order that barred Abrego Garcia, a longtime Maryland resident, from being removed from the United States. The case and its months of wrangling in courts in two states has generated huge publicity, both in Maryland and nationally, and has brought attention to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.Separately, as the Trump administration tries to deport Abrego Garcia, the Justice Department is moving forward with criminal charges against him of human trafficking in Tennessee.Xinis specially requested the Trump administration provide John Cantú to testify because he is a top official at ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations and previously submitted a declaration to the court regarding the State Department’s deliberation with Costa Rica’s government about accepting Abrego Garcia as a refugee. Abrego Garcia, whose deportation due to an “administrative error” cast a spotlight on President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. He is currently detained at an ICE facility in Pennsylvania.Abrego Garcia has agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, but the Trump administration last month argued before Xinis to allow him to be removed to Liberia. In August, Costa Rica’s government stated it would accept him as a refugee. As he challenges his removal to any country other than Costa Rica, Abrego Garcia has also pleaded not guilty to the criminal case in Nashville, which accuses him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Rally outsideSimilar to previous hearings at the Greenbelt courthouse, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in support of Abrego Garcia. The event included a singing group called the Rapid Response Choir.George Escobar, who will become CASA’s new executive director on Jan. 1, said it’s important for people to stand up against a “corrupt government” that seeks to take away immigrant rights, especially as the Trump administration tries to ship Abrego Garcia to various third countries.“We want to make sure that we stand here united. We want to make sure that Kilmar (and) his family understands that we are by his side,” Escobar said. “We will not let this go silently into the night.”

Maryland Del. Gabriel Acevero, a Montgomery County Democrat who’s from Trinidad and Tobago, and who has a family background in Venezuela, said his state colleagues will be working on legislation to improve immigrant rights, such as ending the 287(g) program in the state.Currently, about eight local enforcement agencies in the state have agreements with ICE that delegate certain immigration enforcement abilities to local police. But Acevero’s colleague, Del. Nicole Williams, a Prince George’s County Democrat, plans to reintroduce legislation to terminate all ICE agreements. Law enforcement agencies would have a year to do so.After the rally ended, CASA leaders handed out green postcards for participants to write down words of support for Abrego Garcia.Jacki Gilbert of Baltimore wrote on her postcard: “Dear Kilmar, We stand with you and your family. You are both a friend and a neighbor.”“This impacts my community. My culture in Baltimore City. My economy there. You got to stand with your friends and neighbors. Respect them,” Gilbert said as she choked up and shed a tear.

Abrego Garcia has deportation protections that should have prevented his deportation to his home country of El Salvador, but earlier this year he was still removed to a brutal Salvadoran prison. Because of those protections granted by an immigration judge in 2019, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept Abrego Garcia and a country where he believes he will not face harm or persecution. The Trump administration so far has floated sending him to Liberia as well as one of three other nations in Africa — Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Worries about return to El SalvadorAbrego Garcia’s lawyers have raised concerns that if he is sent to a third country, that country will then send him back to El Salvador. Cantú said that the government of Liberia has given the State Department assurance that Abrego Garcia will not face torture, persecution, and will not be sent back to El Salvador. The assurances from Costa Rica’s government accepting Abrego Garcia were “nonbinding,” Cantú said. The State Department informed him that Abrego Garcia’s removal to Costa Rica is “not an option at the moment,” he said.Cantú was pressed by one of Abrego Garcia’s attorney’s, Sascha Rand, about communications with the State Department and Costa Rica regarding Abrego Garcia.  Cantú said he had a five-minute virtual meeting with an attorney from the State Department, during which he was given a statement that Costa Rica was no longer an option for Abrego Garcia. But he could not give the judge any additional information on further communications between the State Department and Costa Rica’s government since August.“This witness has zero information about the content of the (Costa Rica) declaration,” Xinis said. “No shade on you, Mr. Cantú, you’ve been very candid with the court. The point has been made.”Rand pointed to how the assurance from Costa Rica granted Abrego Garcia refugee status and citizenship, and he asked if Liberia made those same assurances. Cantú said he did not recall. Rand asked Cantú if in his career at the Department of Homeland Security, which dates to 1997, if he has had any experience of removing someone from Latin America to Africa. Cantú said he has in the past six months under the Trump administration. Rand asked about any scenarios prior to that time.“I cannot recall,” Cantú said.Rand said that Abrego Garcia has “no objection to him being removed to Costa Rica.” He argued that the Trump administration, and its witness, have not proved that Abrego Garcia cannot be removed to Costa Rica. Order of removalAbrego Garcia’s attorneys also requested that DOJ provide the order of removal for Abrego Garcia. Cantú said he had not seen such a document.“If there is no order for removal, then there is no basis for detention,” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, another attorney for Abrego Garcia, who specializes in immigration law. DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said he does “believe there is a final order of removal.”Xinis rejected that, because no document was provided to her and the document Ensign produced for her only mentioned that Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum claim was rejected.“I am just interested in finding the order of removal,” she said. Ensign argued that because Abrego Garcia has a withholding of removal, meaning he cannot be removed back to his home country of El Salvador, that should be treated as a final order of removal. Ensign added that it’s odd that Abrego Garcia would agree to be removed to Costa Rica if he didn’t believe there was a final order of removal.“No, it’s not,” Xinis said. “It’s a concession because he's been to CECOT and back.”While at the notorious mega-prison known as CECOT, Abrego Garcia detailed how he was psychologically and physically tortured by Salvadoran officials. Abrego Garcia tried to make another application for asylum, after he was brought back to the U.S. this summer, but an immigration judge denied it. He has appealed the decision.

The case before Xinis is a habeas petition, which is how immigrants challenge their detention. Immigrants cannot be held longer for six months in detention if the federal government is not actively making efforts to remove them, a precedent set by the Supreme Court. Xinis pressed Ensign about why the “government (is) standing in the way” of allowing Abrego Garcia to be removed to Costa Rica. “It’s so odd and that’s me being really polite,” Xinis said, adding that “there is no evidence that Costa Rica is withholding their prior” stance to accept Abrego Garcia.  Xinis said Thursday would be the last hearing before she makes her decision. She said she will first decide Abrego Garcia’s habeas petition and then address the injunction that bars his removal from the U.S.“It’s not going to be a quick decision,” Xinis said. “These are weighty issues.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

Bob Wilson, a member of the Howell Township Board of Trustees, confirmed with Michigan Advance on Thursday that Meta was pushing the project. But Wilson said he and members of the board have known about the development for months now. 
Messages seeking comment from Meta’s public affairs and press office were not returned at the time of publication.
In September, Wilson took to Facebook, ironically, to say that he was one of several people in the Howell area who took a bus to New Albany, Ohio, to tour the community, which has become a hotspot for data centers, the Livingston Post reported. 
Meta has a data center in New Albany, Ohio.
Wilson said then that he believed a Meta data center could possibly land at the facility when completed with a $9 billion investment. It was his estimation that the center, if approved, would take up at least 20% of the 1,000-acre space with the remaining space for the data center.
On Wednesday, the Livingston County Planning Commission heard from locals about a decision to rezone the farm land to build the data center. The commission ultimately rejected the project and recommended that the Howell Township Board of Trustees reject the project, as well.
It’s unclear if the township board has the votes to push it forward. The board meets Thursday evening to discuss the project and is expecting a large crowd. Some have called for a six-month moratorium so the community can draft ordinances related to the project. That moratorium will be before the board this evening.
MLive also reported Thursday that Wilson confirmed Meta was behind the project. The publication also noted that the data center investment was likely $1 billion, as opposed to the $9 billion reported by the Livingston Post. Wilson further told MLive that he met with a Meta “land crew” both in person and over a Zoom call, and that they didn’t hide the ball that they worked for Meta.

In an interview with the Advance, that it was possible that the developer on the project would build the center and then sell it to a third-party, like Meta or others exploring AI, much like Google. He did say, however, that it was his understanding that Meta builds its own projects and doesn’t usually play the middle man.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/558199098_25184650887794802_5733019724495903299_n-1-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

President Donald Trump has taken his most decisive step yet toward dismantling the Department of Education, a move that will have widespread ramifications for vulnerable students and has raised concerns among education leaders and lawmakers who contend that it will create chaos and confusion for families instead of giving them the help they actually need.
His administration announced on Tuesday that it will transfer core agency functions to four other federal offices — news met with fierce criticism by education advocates who questioned its legality and said it is an abandonment of the nation’s students.
“Donald Trump and his administration chose American Education Week, a time when our nation is celebrating students, public schools, and educators, to announce their illegal plan to further abandon students by dismantling the Department of Education,” said National Education Association (NEA) President Becky Pringle in a statement. “It’s cruel. It’s shameful. And our students deserve so much better.”
The Trump administration will reassign the department’s key programs involving K-12 education, higher education, Indian education and international studies through so-called interagency agreements with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State.
The reorganization marks one of the most significant overhauls to the department since its establishment during former President Jimmy Carter’s administration in 1979. Only Congress can create a federal agency and has the sole authority to approve its restructuring or elimination.
The move to restructure the agency, Trump officials argue, will lead to more efficiency by reducing administrative burdens and making it easier to pursue objectives like aligning education with workforce readiness.
Vulnerable students stand to be uniquely affected by the reorganization with the shift of K-12 programs to the Department of Labor raising major concerns about the wellbeing of economically disadvantaged students. The Labor Department will manage programs such as Title I, which provides additional resources to K-12 schools serving such students. Labor will also administer postsecondary education grant programs authorized under the Higher Education Act with the goal of ending an estimated labor shortage of over 700,000 skilled jobs nationally.
“Moving Title I, the largest federal funding stream providing important resources to the schools serving the lowest-income students in America, to the Department of Labor makes no sense,” said Denise Forte, president and CEO of The Education Trust, a nonprofit that advocates for equity in the nation’s schools.
“The Trump administration began the process of selling off the Department of Education for parts,” Forte said in a statement. “Further diminishing these offices… and sending them off to be run by agencies that work on public health and short-term training, which lack the skills, expertise, or capacity in education, isn’t about improving student outcomes. It’s about implementing a business model that transforms students into widgets instead of human beings who need support.”
Leaders of the nation’s two largest teacher unions, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), characterized the restructuring as a betrayal of students and families.
“This move is neither streamlining nor reform — it’s an abdication and abandonment of America’s future,” AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement. “Rather than show leadership in helping all students seize their potential, it walks away from that responsibility.”
Similarly, Weingarten pushed back against the idea that the restructuring was about efficiency.
“What’s happening now isn’t about slashing red tape,” she said. “If that were the goal, teachers could help them do it …Instead, spreading services across multiple departments will create more confusion, more mistakes and more barriers for people who are just trying to access the support they need.”
Other changes affect groups of students who have traditionally needed extra support: The Department of the Interior will be the primary administrator for Indian Education programs, functioning as the point of contact for tribes and students. The Department of Health and Human Services will manage a program for student-parents in college called Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) and another related to foreign medical school accreditation standards. Finally, the Department of State will administer the Fulbright-Hays Program which awards grants to students, teachers, administrators and institutions.
It’s unclear how Native American students will fare with Indian Education programs moved to the Interior Department, an agency that manages natural resources and not the education of children. The future of the thousands of student-parents in college who rely on campus-based childcare grants is also uncertain, since moving the Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools program to the Health and Human Services Department could lead to disruptions in support for them that sidetrack their journey to a degree. Transferring responsibilities from the Department of Education to the Department of Labor undermines public education’s purpose, according to National Parents Union President Keri Rodrigues.
“At a time when the public demands transparency regarding the Epstein files, the Administration has instead launched a chaotic assault on education,” she said in a statement. “Families see this clearly: a political diversion, not a vision for better schools. Public education has never been about turning children into factory workers, it has always been about preparing creators, innovators, and dreamers who will shape the future of our nation.”
Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who serves as vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, questioned the constitutionality of the interagency agreements.
“Donald Trump and Linda McMahon are lawlessly trying to fulfill Project 2025’s goal to abolish the Department of Education and pull the rug out from students in every part of the country,” stated the Washington lawmaker, a former preschool teacher.
Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, who serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on Education and Workforce, called the shakeup “a direct assault on the students, families, and educators who depend on its essential protections.”
In her statement, the Pennsylvania lawmaker emphasized that even the education secretary has acknowledged that only Congress has the authority to eliminate the department.
“Our children deserve better than political stunts that jeopardize their futures,” she said. “And let’s be clear: an uneducated electorate isn’t a by-product of authoritarianism — it’s a prerequisite for it. We will fight back.”
Critics of the department’s makeover also said they feared that its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services would be the next to be reassigned to other federal agencies. The Trump administration has diminished their power and effectiveness through staff cuts and — in the case of OCR in particular — regional office closures that have led to civil rights cases not being investigated.
“Transferring OCR’s authority to another department that is ill-equipped to carry out its critical functions would all but guarantee that civil rights complaints will continue to be dismissed en masse without resolution,” Forte said. Such a development would disproportionately affect students of color, students with disabilities and English learners.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 21:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont taps Jeffrey Beckham to become Superior Court judge,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/lamont-taps-jeffrey-beckham-to-become-superior-court-judge/,"Gov. Ned Lamont announced he will nominate his departing budget director, Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, to become a CT Superior Court judge.","Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday he will nominate his departing budget director, Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, to become a Connecticut Superior Court judge.
Lamont, who praised Beckham for restoring confidence to the Office of Policy and Management following a corruption scandal, said his outgoing director also played a crucial role over the past three-and-a-half years in the state government’s fiscal resurgence.
The governor also predicted Beckham’s successor, Joshua Wojcik, a key health policy leader in the comptroller’s office, would continue that fiscal progress while helping Connecticut safeguard its most vulnerable residents as federal funding for human service programs shrinks.
“Jeff took over during a time of some change at OPM. I want to tell you what an extraordinary secretary he has been,” Lamont said during a midafternoon press conference at the Capitol.
“And by the way, in case you’re wondering,” Lamont added, “he looks like a judge to me. I’m just saying.” 
The General Assembly is expected to consider that nomination during the regular 2026 session, which begins Feb. 4.
Beckham, who holds a bachelor’s degree in political science and a law degree from Florida State University, would not be the first state budget director elevated to a judgeship.
Norwalk Republican Robert Genuario, a former state senator, served as Rell’s budget director from 2005 through 2010 until she appointed him to the Connecticut Superior Court.
Beckham become OPM secretary in March 2022 following the resignation of Melissa McCaw, Lamont’s first budget chief, who left to become East Hartford’s financial director, Meanwhile, her deputy, Konstantinos Diamantis, had become embroiled in a scandal involving state construction funds that ultimately led a federal jury last month to convict him on 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
He earned praise not just from Lamont for his handling of OPM, the state’s chief fiscal and policy planning agency, in the wake of that scandal.
“He restored confidence and became a measured, principled voice on fiscal matters within the governor’s administration,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, wrote in a joint statement.
Beckham, who had been OPM’s liaison to the General Assembly prior to becoming Lamont’s budget director — and who has more than three decades of experience in state agencies across all three branches of government — credited his relationships with helping to stabilize the budget office.
“I knew most of the team. I’d come up with a lot of them,” he said, adding his familiarity with the General Assembly also played an important role. “I know its culture very well. I think I was pretty well positioned. I think we were fortuitous in that. And so, I think I was a reassuring presence for the staff.”
Lamont also praised Beckham, a fiscal conservative, for his dedication to the budget caps that helped Connecticut to replace a nearly depleted rainy day fund with a record-setting $4.3 billion reserve in just eight years, and to simultaneously dedicate about $10 billion in surpluses to shrink pension debt.
“I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,” Lamont said. “You’ve been standing there every day protecting an honestly balanced budget. No more of this buy-now-pay-later stuff.”
Lamont also showed confidence in Wojcik, 43 who will succeed Beckham next month.
A veteran of the comptroller’s office, Wojcik has managed the Health Policy and Benefits Services Division since 2022, overseeing a $2 billion program budget and benefits for more than 270,000 public sector workers, retirees, dependents and other individuals.

Wojcik, who lives in Brooklyn, also served as a budget and policy analyst for the state Senate’s Democratic Caucus before his time in the comptroller’s office.
Lamont noted that his new budget director, like his outgoing one, was very familiar with the challenges Connecticut faced during the last recession, from late 2007 to early 2010 — a crisis that triggered many of the budget deficits and tax hikes of the 2010s.
“You know, in ’08, ‘09, when we lost billions of dollars in just a matter of a few months,” Lamont said to Wojcik. “You understand how important it is that not only we have an honestly balanced budget but also that we have a rainy day fund that protects our people, protects our communities.”
Sean Scanlon, Connecticut’s comptroller since 2022, called Wojcik “one of the smartest public policy minds that I’ve ever met. He has been an invaluable advisor to me and to my predecessors in the comptroller’s office. The work he has done as a leader in our agency and state include designing transformational health care policy that saves lives and saves taxpayer money and budgetary policy that led to Connecticut’s fiscal comeback. So, while I am certainly sad to see him leave our team, Gov. Lamont has made an excellent choice.”
Wojcik said he is committed to helping Lamont continue the financial success that state government has enjoyed under his administration. One of the new budget director’s toughest challenges involves negotiating with a Democratic-controlled General Assembly that tends to be more fiscally liberal than the Democratic governor.
“I’ve worked with many of them on many significant issues, particularly surrounding health care, in recent years,” Wojcik said, “and I absolutely want to be a thought-partner with the governor and [help in] trying to identify opportunities where we have general agreement.”
Wojcik, who holds a bachelor’s degree in international relations and a master’s of public administration from the University of Connecticut, added that when it comes to working with lawmakers, “We’re not always going to agree, of course, but you know, having that good and positive relationship that OPM has historically had, I plan to continue that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2385-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 17:57:52.707512

Those vehicles — part of a 252-car replacement fleet — are running years behind schedule.","THE MBTA’S long-running effort to replace its Red and Orange Line fleets faced renewed schedule pressures this fall, with transit officials highlighting a recent shift toward more consistent Red Line production as the Orange Line order nears its finish line.
Shipments of Chinese-manufactured train shells have slowed in recent months — in part because of ongoing federal forced-labor reviews — contributing to delays that pushed the builder past a September delivery deadline for the Orange Line.
Although the federal reviews have introduced uncertainty into the supply chain, MBTA leaders said the broader fleet-replacement program continues to move forward, supported by a production strategy that now places greater emphasis on keeping Red Line deliveries on track.
The manufacturer of new MBTA Red and Orange Line fleets missed the September deadline to complete all 152 Orange Line cars, after US Customs officials detained multiple shipments of train shells and components under a federal forced-labor law. Transit officials say the builder, China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation MA (CRRC), remains on pace to finish the Orange Line order by year’s end.
The MBTA expects to receive another pair of Orange Line cars on Thursday, bringing the total to 150. The final two cars are scheduled to arrive next month, closing out the 152-car order required under the contract. 
The new Orange Line fleet, which began entering service in September 2022, has been large enough to support reliable operations, officials said, allowing the T earlier this year to direct CRRC to prioritize Red Line production instead.
So far, the T has received 58 new Red Line cars, with two more expected in December. Those vehicles — part of a 252-car replacement fleet — are running years behind schedule. 
The project originated under Gov. Deval Patrick’s administration in 2014, has been buffeted by repeated manufacturing setbacks, and underwent a major contract “reset” last year that waived some penalties, lifted the contract’s value above $1 billion and set a new completion deadline of late 2027.
A new wrinkle emerged in May, when US Customs and Border Protection began holding newly shipped car shells in American ports as authorities review whether CRRC’s supply chain complies with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The 2021 law bars imports linked to forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and places a high burden of proof on importers to document that their goods were made with an ethical supply chain.
CRRC ships partially assembled shells from China to the US, where final assembly is performed at its Springfield facility by a workforce of more than 400. Components from 32 states feed into US assembly, according to General Manager Phil Eng.
US Customs’ review has required multiple rounds of documentation from CRRC. In July, Eng said the company was “in the midst of answering the last round of questions,” adding he was “very confident” the parties would navigate the review.
CRRC spokesperson Lydia Rivera told WBUR the company has maintained “rigorous compliance reviews” and that “no entity involved in these shipments is linked to any violation” of the law.
Erik Olson, executive director of the Rail Security Alliance, encouraged the federal reviews, saying, “We are grateful for US Custom’s attention to CRRC train shells and components and the materials within the full supply chain, ‘requiring full traceability of certain raw materials—down to the level of ore extraction and smelting.'”
Despite the detainments, both CRRC and the MBTA say the Springfield line continues to operate. 
Eng said this summer that enough shells were in Massachusetts to “keep the workforce working through the end of the year.” 
MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo said this month the agency “continues to work closely with CRRC MA to keep the production line moving at the Springfield plant” and “ensure that each shipment of car shells is accompanied by the necessary documentation required by US Customs officials.”
The MBTA’s October bondholder statement acknowledged the detainments and said CRRC is “working to rectify the situation.” 
The document reiterates that the full vehicle program includes 404 heavy-rail cars — 152 for the Orange Line and 252 for the Red Line — each equipped with wider doors, ADA-dedicated spaces, LCD passenger information systems, LED lighting, redundant train-control and HVAC systems and upgraded monitoring and communication technology. The vehicle investments accompany systemwide upgrades to maintenance facilities, track and signaling.
The T is approaching the long-sought milestone of completing the Orange Line replacement, more than a decade after state officials first awarded the contract. But the beleaguered Red Line program, still not half delivered, remains vulnerable to external shocks from the federal inquiry.
For now, the last two Orange Line cars are slated for December delivery, and the Red Line has a two-car delivery schedule for next month as well, as its multi-year push toward full fleet replacement continues.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transportation_MBTA_Red-Line_Ashmont-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

RJ May, who pleaded guilty in September to sending videos of children being sexually abused, faces new charges of failing to pay his income taxes.
The 39-year-old West Columbia Republican owes the state $14,637 for three years of income taxes he failed to file, according to arrest warrants the South Carolina Department of Revenue served May with Thursday. May remains in the Edgefield County Detention Center, awaiting sentencing on the federal child sexual abuse material charges.
May could face up to one year in state prison, a $10,000 fine or both for each of the three tax charges if convicted. That’s on top of the 25 to 100 years he could collectively face for all five charges of sending videos of children being sexually abused. Those five charges to which May pleaded guilty could also carry hefty penalties of up to $250,000 each.
May, a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, owned and operated Ivory Tusk Consulting, which ran campaigns for likeminded candidates. From 2022 to 2024, May earned $323,000, according to a news release. He was first elected to the House in November 2020.
Ex-Rep. RJ May failed to pay income taxes for years, SC House Ethics investigation finds

A House Ethics Committee investigation first turned up questions about May’s tax filings. The committee began its investigation in July, several weeks after police arrested May on the sexual abuse charges.
An investigation is usually the first step in expelling a House member, but May resigned his House seat in August, while the committee’s hired lawyers were still looking into his conduct. In requesting the ethics investigation, House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, asked for a closer look into May’s financials, prompting a search of his state income tax filings.
That search came up empty, lawyers said last month when presenting their findings to the committee. The committee referred any potential criminal charges to the appropriate state agency, without clarifying the agencies involved.
Whether May filed federal income taxes remains unclear. Investigators did not attempt to get those records because the federal government did not have the same obligation to participate in a state-level investigation, committee attorneys said.
Also unclear is how much money May had when a judge assigned him a federal public defender. At the time, he claimed he had no assets but his truck, and in messages from jail, he weighed selling the truck to fund his defense.
May claimed from his jail cell that clients owed him thousands of dollars he could have used to hire a lawyer to defend him in federal court. The ethics committee’s lawyers questioned whether he disclosed this to the federal judge.
May ultimately fired his attorneys and opted to represent himself. He rehired his defense team for his sentencing trial, which is scheduled to take place Jan. 14.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RJ-May-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

Today I was proud to recognize each of them for their trailblazing accomplishments and the examples they’ve set for future generations.”
This year, four women were named Torchbearers and one woman was honored with a lifetime achievement award.
Betsy Wiley received the lifetime achievement award for her public service to Indiana’s students in many areas, including school choice. She has worked to support parents’ rights to lead their own children’s education, and advocated to improve schools and outcomes for all Hoosier children, the governor’s news release said.
Monica Kelsey was named a Torchbearer for her efforts to save babies’ lives through Safe Haven Baby Boxes. Braun’s office said her work has made Indiana the national leader in preventing child abandonment.
Grace Estabrook was a member of the swimming and diving team for Penn State, and she spoke against transgender women competing in women’s sports. The news release said her voice on the issue was an important part of the national conversation and yielded significant policy changes to support fairness.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Saying Floridians need property tax relief now, former Florida House Speaker and 2026 Republican gubernatorial candidate Paul Renner is calling for the Legislature to reduce the ad valorem taxes levied by local governments immediately by rolling them back to the previous year’s levels, plus a reduction based on how much the county’s spending had increased since 2020.
The Legislature should cap future taxes to ensure local government cannot grow faster than Floridians’ incomes, he added, and require a 2/3 supermajority vote of local government for any new or increased tax or fee subject to a subsequent referendum, for voters to approve or reject.
“We don’t have to wait two years for an amendment to go on the ballot in November 2026,” he said while addressing reporters in Tampa on Thursday. “We can give people relief right this minute and that’s what I’m calling for today in the form of a rollback.”
Renner said his proposal isn’t complicated and that it’s simply reproducing what happened during a 2007 special legislative session. That’s when then Gov. Charlie Crist and House Speaker Marco Rubio agreed to reduce ad valorem taxes collected by local governments in FY 2007-08 to a specified percentage of the rolled back rate for 2006‐07.
Renner’s comments came while a select House committee in Tallahassee debated several proposed constitutional amendments to substantially reduce or outright eliminate property taxes for homestead properties that would potentially go on the November 2026 ballot. The idea has been aggressively pursued by Gov. Ron DeSantis as he heads into his final year leading Florida.
Renner said that the percentage of what would be returned to taxpayers in his proposal would depend on how much that local government has spent.
“If your county has been fiscally conservative and they’ve given some of that money back to taxpayers — as they should — then they have a smaller rollback,” he said. “If your county is one that has taken every single penny — and this has happened in many counties — you have a larger rollback. That’s up to the Legislature to look at the numbers and make a decision on what that rollback amount would look like.”
Gov. DeSantis has dismissed the multiple proposed measures that members of the Florida House debated Thursday, saying only a single constitutional amendment should go on the ballot. Renner said he mostly agreed with that idea.
“I think you need one plan that’s straightforward,” he said. “That people can look at and say, ‘Does this make my life better?'”
The 58-year-old Renner, a military veteran and former state prosecutor, concluded a nine-year stint in the House in 2024, spending the last two years as speaker. He entered the GOP contest for governor in early September, joining southwest U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds in the contest to succeed a term-limited DeSantis next year.
Although there have been rumors of other candidates entering the race, Donalds and Renner remain the top contenders going into next August’s GOP primary. “I think I am the viable alternative,” he said when asked if he considered himself the top challenger to Donalds, who has the imprimatur of Donald Trump as well as $30 million raised in his campaign coffers.
“We’re the undisputed leader as well on having a plan,” Renner added, referring to the affordability plan he released last week that includes specific proposals to reduce insurance costs, ensure that tuition isn’t increased in Florida universities, and boost healthcare (he is calling on Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act and return control to the states as well as promoting “high-quality healthcare options that put patients in control”). He also wants to end H-IB visa hires for state employees.
Renner spoke about what he deemed the legislative successes that he worked on with DeSantis and the Legislature during his term as speaker, which included his sponsorship of an expansive and controversial voucher law to provide public money for children to attend parochial, secular, and other private schools across the state, regardless of family income. That program has now expanded to 500,000 students statewide.
A recently released audit for the 2024-2025 school year found a “myriad of accountability challenges” with the school choice program, with millions of dollars in overspending as well as lack of oversight and delays in scholarship payments.
“I think you don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” Renner responded. “This is a great program, but if out of that half-a-million there are 50 or 500 that are not complying in the right way, kick them off the program. That’s enforcement. Don’t use any problems along the way to eliminate the program or redo the program.”
Despite the fact that he considers himself the main challenger to Donalds in the Republican primary, Renner says his campaign is centered on the needs of the electorate.
“I’m not running a campaign against him, I’m running a campaign for the people of Florida,” he said. “I’m putting Florida first. I have leadership that the other candidates frankly don’t have. I’ve delivered results. And again, I’m focused on people’s needs. It’s a ‘we’ campaign, it’s not a ‘me’ campaign.”

A focus of the Republican citrus farmer from Wauchula, a similar version of the bill was a casualty of late-session negotiations last year. Approaching the second and final session of his presidency, Albritton is gearing up to push his priority. 
“As we prepare to embark on a nationwide celebration of America’s 250th Anniversary, there is no better time to celebrate and renew our focus on heritage farming communities across our state and nation. The hard work and patriotism of small family farm communities not only helped win our independence but also created and maintained a robust agricultural supply chain vital to our national security,” Albritton said in a news release.
Last year, SB 110, the previous Rural Renaissance bill, passed the Senate unanimously but the House declined to pass the Senate version, killing the bill. 
“We’ve seen tremendous economic growth in urban Florida over the years, and it’s rural Florida’s turn now to grow the way we see fit,” Albritton said in a video message to a Rural Health Association event in Lake City.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with Albritton to make his proposal a national model





Additionally, some of the health care proposals included in the 2024 proposed Rural Renaissance were included in the Agency for Health Care Administration’s Nov. 3 application for $200 million in federal rural health funding.
Last year, Albritton said the bill would not impose a mandate for rural areas but instead a “buffet” of opportunities for communities to “be able to grow the way they want to” and that it’s meant to be a “hand up, not a handout,” calling it “quintessential” in what government is meant to do.





Sen. Corey Simon, a Republican from Tallahassee who represents 12 rural counties, again is sponsoring the bill. 
“Quality of life in rural areas can be impacted by access to job opportunities, education, and health care. Rural Renaissance combines enhancements to the traditional infrastructure for schools and hospitals with innovations that drastically expand opportunities for education, commerce, and health care in rural Florida,” Simon said.

The bill would increase the threshold for what a “fiscally constrained county” is from $5 million in property tax revenue per 1 mil to $10 million per 1 mil.
Fiscally constrained status is used in statute to qualify certain counties for extra support. 
The bill, like last year’s, would create the Office of Rural Prosperity within the Department of Commerce. The office would facilitate planning and connect local governments to state and federal resources. 
SB 250 would include a $1 million block grant for counties with declining populations. The grants would target population growth and be available annually until a county achieves three consecutive years of growth. 
Rural teachers would be eligible for a student loan repayment program worth $15,000 per individual over five years. 
Hospitals would be able to receive funding for mobile units for primary care, behavioral health, obstetric, and gynecological services. The bill would increase from $10 million to $35 million the Rural Hospital Grant Program.

The bill President Donald Trump signed July 4 cuts $187 billion from SNAP over the next decade, including $68 billion by 2029, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. It does so primarily by imposing additional work requirements on SNAP recipients and additional costs on states. 
Luján, a Democrat who leads a Senate subcommittee on nutrition and represents the state with the highest nationwide percentage of SNAP recipients, called the cuts cruel and unprecedented. 
“For half a century, our nation has upheld a bipartisan promise to ensure that no child, no senior, no veteran, no working family should go hungry in the United States of America,” he said. “Republicans broke that promise, and today, congressional Democrats are fighting to restore this program.”
The Food Depot’s busiest New Mexico distribution just got busier

The two-page bill Luján introduced, which 46 other senators co-sponsored, seeks simply to repeal all the provisions in the Republican bill imposing the SNAP cuts. It’s called the “Restoring Food Security for American Families and Farmers Act of 2025.”
He and other Democrats who spoke at a news conference Thursday in Washington D.C. pointed to the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold November SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, despite court rulings and a contingency plan the federal Agriculture Department had in place to keep benefits flowing during a shutdown. 
Withholding the benefits caused upheaval in the food assistance program, which 42 million Americans rely on, including about 460,000 New Mexicans. Food banks in New Mexico saw sharp increases in demand, and the Legislature stepped in to approve nearly $200 million in state funds to pay for benefits throughout January.
Now that the government has reopened, New Mexico’s Legislative Finance Committee director on Monday told state lawmakers the state was receiving all its expected federal SNAP funding. But the cuts are still in effect under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” provisions, Luján noted, which he and Democrats are hoping to stop.
“These are people across the country who you probably stand in line with when you’re checking out at a grocery store every day. Folks right now, they face the real possibility of going hungry because of the choices made by President Trump and congressional Republicans,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-20-at-1.33.12-PM.png,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A board governing the Mental Health Department on Thursday agreed to purchase properties in southwest Oklahoma City to replace the Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman. 
The cost of purchasing and renovating the three properties totals about $60 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds that the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services are required to spend by the end of 2026, an agency spokesperson said. 
When renovations are completed, the new inpatient mental health hospital complex has a potential capacity of 197 beds, a spokesperson said, which is an increase from the 120 beds at Griffin Memorial. 
The largest of the purchases is a former Sisters of Saint Mary Health hospital campus at 2129 SW 59th St., which includes a main complex, annex and warehouse, totalling over 190,000 square feet. 
A second building, at 5835 S. Pennsylvania Ave., is a vacant medical office. The agency intends to use this building as an office site for the project manager.
Chad Carden, the agency’s chief of operations, said this keeps funding within the project and allows the Mental Health Department to keep the money invested in property rather than renting temporary job site trailers. 
The third property is 1.6 acres of vacant land at 2149 SW 59th St., which Carden said is ready to build on and has the potential to be a future site at the new hospital campus. 
During the first phase of construction, the agency will prioritize opening 32 beds in an annex building by the end of 2025. 
A timeline was not yet determined for the full project to be completed. 
The Mental Health Department’s goal is to relocate all services offered at Griffin Memorial to the new campus. The hospital serves adults with severe mental illness. 
A previous effort to build the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus in Oklahoma City became too expensive and went over budget. 
Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic said the Donahue project would have cost $187 million to complete, and this new campus will save taxpayer dollars. 
While the Mental Health Department’s governing board approved the purchases, the transaction is still being finalized.

(Map made by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix via DataWrapper)Hundreds of millions in federal funding will be pumped into Florida’s rural health care delivery system in the coming months, a top health care official in Gov. Ron DeSantis’s administration promised Thursday during a recognition of National Rural Health Day.
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris said the state intends to make rural health care grant applications available in January or February, after it hears back from the Trump administration on its Nov. 3 request for $200 million in Rural Health Transformation Program funds. Harris said the federal government is supposed to notify the state by Dec. 31.
“Our hope is to get, again, maximum funding,” said Harris, appearing during an event in Lake City hosted by the Florida Rural Health Association, the Suwannee River Area Health Education Center, the WellFlorida Council, and Florida Voices for Health. 
“We’ll have to get budget authority through the Legislature to be able to tap into any funding that we’re awarded, but we’ll put out those requests for applications,” she added.
The funds are available under the One Big Beautiful Bill. Harris said the state’s application includes funding opportunities for 15 policy initiatives that address three broad areas: workforce; technology and innovation; and improving health and health access.

While she welcomed the funding opportunities, Doctors’ Memorial Hospital CEO Lauren Faison-Clark asked Harris whether the state intends to keep the money in the hands of the rural providers or award statewide grants to large outside companies.
“Many of us in the trenches are nervous sometimes when these well-intended monies come out that big vendors nationwide, vendors will come in and try to get a statewide contract for things where really what we want to do is grow the infrastructure that already exists in rural communities,” said Faison-Clark, whose hospital in Taylor County was hit by thee hurricanes between the 2023 and 2024 Atlantic hurricane seasons.
She added: “Will there be a focus on local solutions?” 
Harris acknowledged AHCA could award statewide contracts but “that’s not our preference.”
“That’s like a plan C or D,” she said adding, “So, when we’re reviewing applications that come in through the RFA [request for application] process, we’re really going to be spending a lot of time on the sustainability option.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
AHCA worked with the Florida Department of Health on the application and also solicited input from stakeholders, including issuing a formal request for information. Harris said the agency met with “many of the associations.”
The agency also looked to the Florida Legislature for insight.
Harris acknowledged that the state’s application includes ideas borrowed from the rural renaissance legislation that did not pass earlier this year. Senate President Ben Albritton championed the  effort to invest hundreds of millions in state funds to help bolster spending in rural Florida. (The Senate announced Thursday the legislation has been refiled for the 2026 session.)
Sen. Ben Albritton via Florida Senate
“We did look at the key healthcare components of it and, wherever possible, tried to pull forward those pieces,” she said.
To that end, AHCA’s application includes a $5 million request to provide start-up funding for physicians and “physician extenders” to establish practices in rural areas and commit to staying there for five years.
There’s an $18 million request to expand the use of EMS providers in rural areas. 
Harris called it a “community paramedicine” approach and said the goal is to increase use of EMS providers to help reduce hospital readmission rates and to avoid unnecessary emergency department visits. The idea is to pair EMS providers with nurses who could check in on patients who have been discharged from the hospital.
“So, that would get a collaboration with the hospital system and local paramedics to ensure that we’re able to have the impact there,” she said.
There are  67 counties in Florida. Thirty one of them are considered “rural” under Florida law. The 2020 Census put Florida’s rural population at 1,183,017 people.
Harris wasn’t the only Florida official  acknowledging National Rural Health Day. DeSantis issued a proclamation extending “greetings and best wishes to all observing” the day.
In Tallahassee for committee meetings, Senate President Albritton sent a pre-recorded video message in which he reaffirmed his commitment to investing in rural Florida.
“We’ve seen tremendous economic growth in urban Florida over the years, and it’s rural Florida’s turn now to grow the way we see fit. That’s why, during my last year as Senate president, I’m laser focused on Florida’s Rural Renaissance, a comprehensive plan to improve infrastructure and expand access to education and, yes, healthcare across rural Florida,” he said.

This story by Lukas Dunford was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 19, 2025.
MONTPELIER — Roslyn Fortin, a fifth-grader from Highgate Elementary, has been named Vermont’s first Kid Governor. More than 1,000 fifth graders across 47 Vermont schools voted this month to elect Roslyn from among the seven finalists, two of which were from the Upper Valley.
Each candidate developed a platform around a single issue, creating three-point plans to address their issues with help from the Secretary of State’s Office.
Roslyn focused on addressing homelessness.
The other six fifth-graders who were on the ballot will serve on the Kid Governor’s cabinet, helping Roslyn address homelessness, according to a Wednesday release from the Secretary of State’s Office.
They also will support each other in advancing their own platforms, which ranged from health care to anti-bullying.
The two Upper Valley fifth-graders on the final ballot, Gaelen McNaughton, 10, representing the Weathersfield School, and Westyn Danforth, 11, of Bradford Elementary School, are now on the cabinet that will have monthly meetings with the Secretary of State’s Office.


In January, the Kid Governor and her cabinet will take their oaths of office during a ceremony at the State House in Montpelier.
In a race that included no Upper Valley candidates, New Hampshire fifth graders elected Liv Crete-Sayer of Boscawen Elementary School to be their state’s Kid Governor. Liv’s platform focused on the dangers of smoking, vaping and drug use, according to a Wednesday news release from New Hampshire Civics, a Concord-based nonprofit that leads the state’s Kid Governor program.
The Kid Governor program, free to participating schools, was created by the nonprofit Connecticut Democracy Center in 2015 to teach kids about state government and civic engagement.

“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said in the video.
The video is titled, “Don’t give up the ship,” a military motto that dates to the War of 1812.
Trump accuses 6 Democratic lawmakers of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’

A spokesperson for Crow said his office has seen an uptick in threats following the video and Trump’s posts. 
“It’s very telling that President Trump and those around him think it’s criminal simply for asking people to follow the law,” Crow said in his own video released Thursday. “This moment requires moral clarity. Every American, regardless of your background, should unite and reject his calls for political violence.”
Democrats in the video include Crow, Kelly, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, U.S. Rep. Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. 
“Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” the group said in a joint statement. “But this isn’t about any one of us. This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence.”
In an interview with Fox News, Crow said Trump “has made a series of very disturbing comments and suggestions that would violate U.S. law and put our military in terrible positions.” He said the “Don’t give up the ship” video serves as a reminder to troops of their obligation to decline unlawful orders before they happen, “because then it’ll be too late.” That includes sending troops to U.S. cities “to go to war with those cities” and polling stations. He referred to “illegal military strikes” in a post on X. 
A Bronze Star recipient who achieved the rank of captain, Crow served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said Trump’s threats to members of Congress are “dangerous, unhinged and unworthy of the office of the President of the United States.” 
“We commend Congressman Crow for continuing to show unimpeachable and honorable courage, integrity and leadership in the face of such radical behavior from the president,” Murib said in a statement. “As a veteran and a public servant, he knows more than most the meaning of pledging an oath of duty to their country — certainly more than a five-time draft dodger that our president is.”

Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said water quality, especially after a lawn watering ban was issued in central Iowa over the summer due to elevated nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, is an issue she now hears about all the time. 
“There’s more folks who are paying attention,” she said. “For the people who have been doing this for a very long time, it’s an opportunity to engage those new people and those new voices in advocacy, because we can’t address big challenges unless we’re working together across broad coalitions of folks.”

Funding the trust 
The Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund was established in the state constitution in 2010, with more than 60% approval from Iowa voters, to fund parks, trails, water resources, conservation efforts and natural areas in the state. 
Despite its 15 years on the books, the trust has not accumulated any funds, because the Legislature has not levied the necessary increase on sales taxes, of which the fund would receive three-eighths of a percent. 
Nature and environmental groups have urged the Legislature to fund the trust in past years. 
Rep. David Jacoby, D-Coralville, said it “may happen” in 2026.
“I think it’s time we initiate,” Jacoby said. “… but we have to be mindful that that three-eighths was supposed to supplement what we’re doing, not replace what we’re doing.” 
Trone Garriott said constituents have asked lawmakers to do something about water quality issues in the state and funding the trust is the “number one opportunity.” 
At the same time, however, Trone Garriott said property taxes will be the “biggest issue” at the Statehouse this year. 
“Within our municipalities, our counties, there are water quality efforts that happen, and those are funded through property tax revenues,” Trone Garriott said. “Any changes to our property tax structure needs to keep in mind that there’s some really important efforts that are happening on a more local level that could be damaged if we make restrictive changes.” 
She said many local municipalities and counties are also facing the end of life of their wastewater treatment plants. There are expensive infrastructure projects that can lead to increased contaminants, like E.coli, in waterways if they fail. 
Some of these issues, such as funding the trust and creating funding for the water quality monitoring networks, can be done at the state level, but Trone Garriott said water quality work is also going to take federal-level funding via an updated Farm Bill. 
Rep. Devon Wood, R-New Market, the newly appointed chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said it will take “overwhelming feedback” from constituents in favor of the tax in order for it to pass. 
“They’re already crying out, saying that we are hurting on tax situations in other ways, even with recent tax cuts,” Wood said. “So that’s a balance we have to weigh.” 
Anna Gray, the public policy director and counsel for Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation and moderator for the Thursday panel, said Wood’s response sounded like a “challenge for all of us to up the noise and continue to grow our networks and advocacy.”

Water quality and cancer 
Jacoby said cancer is the “biggest issue” coming up for the legislative session.
He raised, and read aloud, a sign with large black text that read “It’s the water.” 
Reports list Iowa as the state with the second-highest rate of new cancer incidents and one of just two states in the nation with increasing rates of new cancers. 
“We need an honest overview of what’s causing the cancer rates,” Jacoby said. 
He advocated to fund the trust, water quality monitoring, watershed work and cancer research. 
Public health professionals and cancer researchers said at the Iowa Nature Summit on Wednesday that while there are many factors contributing to Iowa’s cancer rates, there is enough evidence linking water quality and agricultural chemicals to cancers for lawmakers to craft policies that address those issues. 
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Pella, said he can’t “get out of his living room” without talking about cancer because it has touched the lives of so many Iowans. 
He said it’s a “deep concern” in the Legislature, but not one he has personally dealt with at a committee level. He said if the “finger is pointed” at agricultural pollution, it doesn’t make sense why states like Illinois are not similarly saddled with high cancer rates. 
“Once we have apparent solutions or answers, then we can start changing policy or making policy,” Rozenboom said. “But I think most of us more have more questions than answers yet.” 
During his 13 years at the Capitol, Rozenboom said water quality has been the “one common denominator” in the issues he has prioritized.
Rozenboom was part of a group of lawmakers who helped to pass long-term funding for the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy — a plan for voluntary practice adoption to reduce the amount of nutrients that enter Iowa waterways and eventually contribute to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. He said he recognizes the “ongoing and continuing tension between agricultural production and environmental concerns.” 
He said while most Iowans know their state leads the nation in corn, pork, eggs and biofuels production, the state also leads in “water quality weapons” like bioreactors, buffers strips, grass waterways, pollinator habitat, conservation tillage and terraces. 
“That’s part of dealing with the tension between the environment and agricultural production,” Rozenboom said. 
He said he has “always acknowledged” that more work needs to be done to improve water quality in the state. 
Wood, who raises cattle and farms with her family, said there are lots of ways the Legislature can work to “modernize” conservation efforts in budgets that already exist. 
“It’s not flashy to say that we need to keep doing what we’re doing,” Wood said. “We need to do new things too, but we need to make sure that we advocate … in those boring budget line items about infrastructure, because Iowa has previously and continues to recognize water quality as an infrastructure investment.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Little Rock psychologist Krameelah Banks appeared before a federal magistrate judge on Thursday after a grand jury indicted her on 34 counts of wire fraud and making false statements this month.
Banks, 48,  is accused of defrauding Medicare and Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield of more than $500,000, according to the indictment filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Banks concealed her fraud by creating fictitious records and making false statements related to health care, according to a press release from Jonathan Ross, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Banks faces 23 counts of wire fraud, seven counts of making false statements in connection with health care, one count of lying to the FBI and one count of aggravated identity theft.
Banks owned Arkansas Behavioral Center (ABC), according to the indictment, and although she treated some regular patients, most of her patients were referrals who were seen just once for pre-surgical psychological evaluations.
The indictment alleges that from 2021 through 2023, Banks billed thousands of hours for psychological services that never occurred and routinely charged Medicare and Blue Cross in the names of patients she’d seen only once. Some of those billings included services that took place while she was vacationing in Florida and Mexico, according to the indictment.
The indictment also alleges Banks billed the federal insurance program and the insurance company for services to several deceased patients.
Banks responded to questions about disputed claims by creating fictitious records and providing nearly identical records to Medicare and Blue Cross and later misled the FBI by blaming over-billing on her calendaring software, the indictment alleges.
Banks was appointed a federal public defender at Thursday’s appearance, court records show.

Andy Beshear announced Thursday. (Screenshot)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says he will appoint a longtime Kentucky Lottery Corp. executive to lead the organization as the current president retires next year. 
Beshear during a Thursday press conference said Chief Revenue Officer Maggie Garrison would be the new president of the corporation that manages the state lottery, saying she had his “full confidence” along with that of the outgoing president Mary Harville and the corporation’s board of directors.
Garrison, who has worked in various roles with the corporation since 2011, thanked Harville for her leadership which she said led to “record sales” and “record funding for the state.” 
“We will continue to embrace new opportunities and adapt to a changing environment, one that has changed because of new technology and new player preferences,” Garrison said. “Each and every accomplishment we achieve at the Kentucky lottery directly impacts educational support for Kentucky students and their families in every county of Kentucky.” 
In the corporation’s latest annual report for fiscal year 2025, it stated it had broken for the 12th consecutive year its “all-time sales record” with more than $2.1 billion in total sales. The report also stated the lottery put more than $384 million toward college scholarships and grants. 
Harville, who Beshear appointed as the corporation’s president in 2020 as the first woman in the role, said it was her “honor and privilege to serve as the face of the Kentucky lottery.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-20-at-3.43.35-PM-1024x816.png,,,2025-11-20 16:57:24.917358

(Photo from the PSC website)The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved a four-year settlement with Florida Power & Light (FPL) Thursday for about $6.9 billion, which opponents claim is the largest rate hike in U.S. history.
The investor-owned utility, Florida’s largest with approximately six million accounts totaling around 12 million customers, said in a press release that it will enable FPL to continue to make “smart, necessary investments in the grid to power Florida’s growth — while keeping customer bills well below the national average.”
The proposed rate hike was met with fierce opposition. More than two dozen local and state elected officials sent a letter to last month to Gov. Ron DeSantis and the PSC, calling on them to reject the proposal.
The rate hike also became an issue in the race for attorney general. Former Democratic state Sen. José Javier Rodriguez, running for the position next year, called on Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to intervene in the case.
Attorneys general in places like Michigan, Connecticut, and Arizona have challenged proposed rate hikes by public electricity utilities this year, and Republican former Florida attorneys general such as Bill McCollum and Charlie Crist previously intervened in rate hikes proposed by investor-owned utilities.
However, Uthmeier declined to get involved.
‘Shameful decision’
Bradley Marshall, who represented several groups who opposed the rate hike, insisted the fight isn’t over yet.
“We look forward to reviewing the written decision and expect this case will be appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, where we look forward to presenting our case,” he told the Phoenix. “This decision hurts the people who are already struggling with higher power bills.”
Other critics blasted the PSC.
“Four years ago, FPL was awarded one of the largest rate hikes in U.S. history. Today, they’ve made history again at nearly double that amount. This shameful decision illustrates why our state energy regulators cannot be trusted to ensure that families have reliable, affordable energy,” said Food & Water Watch Senior Florida organizer Brooke Ward in a written statement.
“People are not asking for diamonds or gold — while greedy utilities keep raking in record profits, regular Floridians want to be able to afford running their air conditioners and heaters. The Legislature must pass affordable energy legislation this session to ensure fair electricity prices.”
“By approving this rate hike, the PSC has handed FPL another blank check while Floridians struggle to keep the lights on,” said Alyssa White, climate justice organizer for Florida Student Power. “This is a slap in the face to every family, student, and small business already drowning in high bills. Our communities deserve an energy system that puts people over profit, and we will continue to build the power to make that happen!”
FPL initially wanted bigger rate hike 
Originally, FPL proposed a four-year, $9.8 billion rate hike but, shortly before the PSC was scheduled to hold hearings on that proposal in August, FPL announced that it had reached an 11th-hour “agreement in principle” with what it described as a “diverse” group of organizations including Walmart, RaceTrac, Wawa, and the Florida Retail Federation. That proposal reduced the rate increase to about $6.9 billion but still maintained a return on equity of 10.95%. ROE is a measure of a company’s financial performance.
FPL’s revised proposal drew pushback from the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), designated by law to represent Florida consumers. The OPC worked with organizations such as Florida Rising and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (LULAC) and came up with their own counterproposal, which did not include any input from FPL.
Their proposal would cut the base bill by nearly half for the average residential customer compared to FPL’s original proposal, to $5.2 billion. Their proposed ROE for FPL would be 10.6%.
PSC Chairman Mike La Rosa rejected the OPC proposal on Sept. 12, saying FPL was “an indispensable party to any settlement.” He added that while their proposal could not be presented as a settlement agreement, it could be included as part of their testimony in opposition to FPL’s agreement submitted in late August.
FPL says that in 2026, its “typical” 1,000-kWh residential customer bill in most of Florida will increase by $2.50 a month, or about 2%, from the existing $134.14 to $136.64. In Northwest Florida, the typical residential customer bill will remain relatively flat, going from the existing $143.60 to $141.36 in 2026.
“We appreciate the Florida Public Service Commission’s thorough review of our rate plan,” said FPL president and CEO Armando Pimentel in a statement.
“Today’s vote enables FPL to continue to deliver some of America’s most reliable electric service and meet the needs of our fast-growing state — and we project will keep customer bills well below the national average through the end of the decade. As we begin our second century of serving Florida, approval of this plan is a win for our customers and a win for the entire state.”

“He was a giant to the end,” Liz Cheney recalls to a crowd that included Biden, Pence and Pelosi, but not Trump.
The post Wyoming son Dick Cheney remembered for integrity, loyalty, intellect during D.C. funeral appeared first on WyoFile .","In the eyes of the world, Dick Cheney is known as the most powerful vice president in America’s history — a hawkish and reticent 9/11-era figure who helped expand executive power.
But to those close to him, Cheney was a Wyoming boy to his core; a man deeply devoted to his wife, Lynne, and his daughters; a keen history scholar; an avid fly-fisherman and a proud grandfather. 
He was a man whose work took him to the White House and to world capitals to convene with global dignitaries. But he also attended his grandson’s high school football games, packed and moved his granddaughter to college, and drove another around the West as her personal rodeo chauffeur. 
“I’m pretty sure he’s the only person who ever had the title vice-president-turned-rodeo-grandpa,” his granddaughter Grace Perry told a crowd gathered Thursday in the Washington Cathedral for Cheney’s funeral.

The funeral for former Vice President Dick Cheney was held Nov. 20, 2025 in the Washington Cathedral. (Screengrab/Washington National Cathedral) 
Attendees included friends, family and politicians of all stripes, including Gov. Mark Gordon, former President Joe Biden, former President George W. Bush, former Vice President Mike Pence and prominent Democrat Nancy Pelosi — but not President Donald Trump. The Cheneys, who had public beef with Trump in recent years, did not invite him, the New York Times reported. 
More than 1,000 people were estimated to be in attendance for the service, which came weeks after he died Nov. 3 at the age of 84.
Speakers recalled a man of enormous intellect who was plainspoken and humble, unassuming and competent, decent and patriotic. 
“The vice president was always the calmest person in the room,” said Jonathan Reiner, Cheney’s cardiologist for 27 years.
They also underscored his deep and abiding connections to Wyoming. 
“I can’t think of anybody who better embodied Wyoming values than Dick Cheney,” said Pete Williams, who worked as Cheney’s press secretary for seven years and who also grew up in Casper. “He was comfortable in the saddle on horseback. He judged people by what they accomplished and what they stood for. He loved the state where he grew up and met Lynne. And Wyoming loved him back, electing him six times to the House of Representatives.”
While some politicians shed staffers in favor of bigger names as they rise in prominence, Williams said, Cheney never abandoned the Wyoming folks who were with him from the start.

(Bruce Nichols/Casper College Public Relations Department Photographs and Records. Casper College Archives and Special Collections. Western History Center).  

“When George W. Bush chose him to be the vice presidential candidate in 2000, their first campaign stop together was Casper, a demonstration of Dick’s loyalty to his home state,” Williams said. (Williams sits on WyoFile’s board of directors.)
Bush himself stepped up to the dais to recall fond memories of Cheney, a man who he noted is the only person from America’s Mountain West ever elected to national office. 
“Dick was funny and easygoing in a style that his public image never caught up with,” Bush said. 
“I wish more Americans got to know Dick Cheney in the way that folks in Casper and Cody and Laramie got to know him. Smart and polished, without airs. Courteous and approachable, seeing everyone as an equal. A gentleman by nature. And a true man of the West.”
Country above partisanship 
Cheney, who grew up largely in Casper, served as Wyoming’s sole U.S. representative in Congress from 1979-1989. It was among his many roles in Washington. At age 34, he became the youngest presidential chief of staff in history when President Gerald Ford appointed him to the post. He served as secretary of defense under George H.W. Bush, and years later joined the ticket of George W. Bush to become vice president, serving two terms.
Cheney was famously in D.C. as terrorists attacked America on Sept. 11, 2001, the defining event of his career. He later became the chief architect of the war on terror, and was criticized for the surveillance and interrogation tactics implemented under his leadership.
He and his wife of 61 years, Lynne, continued to live part-time in Jackson, and often hosted family there. They also resided in Virginia, and the family opted to hold Cheney’s funeral in the cavernous Washington Cathedral. The ceremony was not a state funeral, a highly formal, public event administered by the Military District of Washington for distinguished public figures such as former presidents.

The people who showed up — and those who did not — were closely observed by journalists who regarded attendance as a reflection of the country’s current political divisions. Four former presidents were in attendance, along with Kamala Harris and Karl Rove. Neither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance attended the service, which was reported to be invitation-only.
Cheney, in 2024, announced he would vote for Harris in the presidential election, turning against Trump and his party. This came after his daughter, Liz Cheney, publicly criticized Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. That move was considered highly consequential; Trump then backed Harriet Hageman, who unseated the younger Cheney to become Wyoming’s lone U.S. representative.  
Cheney’s Harris announcement led some Trump loyalists to distance themselves and others, formerly critical of Cheney, to warm to him. 
‘Without airs’
Bush had a big choice to make 25 years ago while looking for a VP, he recalled. So he hired a distinguished Washington veteran to help him find one: Dick Cheney. 
The men discussed the virtues he sought, Bush said: “preparedness, mature judgment, rectitude and loyalty. Above all, I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it.” 
After weeks of these meetings, he said, “I realized the best choice for the vice president was a man sitting right in front of me.” He offered Cheney the spot. Most candidates would jump immediately at the chance, he said. 
“Dick stayed detached and he analyzed it,” he said. “Before I made my decision, he insisted on giving me a complete rundown of all the reasons I should not choose him.”
The way it unfolded followed a pattern of Cheney’s life, Bush said. “His abilities were self-evident, without need of calculation or self-promotion … Even before the Cheney name reached the national stage, people always saw something in the man, solid, reliable and rare.”
The most instrumental person to recognize these qualities, Bush noted, was Lynne Cheney, who is widely credited with convincing her husband to abandon the hard-partying ways of his youth and straighten up. 
Lynne’s influence, he said, “may explain how in just over a decade, a guy can go from laying transmission lines outside Cheyenne to serving as chief of staff for the president of the United States.”
Cheney had many traits uncommon of Washington politicians, Bush said. He was undramatic and even-keeled. He did not feel the need to vocalize every thought; he was sparing and measured with words.

“In a profession of trash-talkers, he was a thinker and a listener,” he said. 
Cheney was a grateful man, Bush recalled, and above all for the three women who shared his journey: Lynne and daughters Mary and Liz. 
“As I quickly discovered in 2000, when you choose one Cheney, you get four,” he said. “His busy and purposeful life was an adventure they experienced together. In a family so close, you dread the day when the circle is broken.”
Cheney was also a devoted grandfather, and three of his grandchildren spoke of the way he cooked Christmas dinner every year for his clan, listened to their troubles, dispensed advice, took them fishing and anchored the family with unwavering love. 
Liz Cheney spoke last, recalling the long road trips she shared with her father; his fascination with the country’s founding and history; his generous support of his family and unswerving commitment to the nation. 
“He was a giant to the end, a lion of a man who loved and served this great republic,” she said.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota utility regulators have set a series of hearings on a controversial high-voltage power line, using a recent change in state law to spread out the hearings. 
The Public Service Commission on Wednesday scheduled hearings on what is known as the JETx project, a transmission line between Jamestown and Ellendale.  
The PSC will hold public hearings in the three counties along the proposed route, Dickey, LaMoure and Stutsman. 
Before the public hearings there will be two days of technical hearings in Bismarck. Project developers will use that time to go over details of the 345 kilowatt line. Otter Tail Power Company and Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. are partnering to develop, build and co-own the 92-mile power line. 
PSC approves power line despite questions about need, cost

PSC Chair Randy Christmann said in some previous high-interest hearings, members of the public have waited for hours to comment on a project while listening to the technical details.
“Many times, we’ve gone well into the evening,” Christmann said. 
He said the new system should make it easier for the public to comment. 
“I’ve always felt it was so unfair to the landowners … to sit there hour after hour,” Christmann said.  
A bill passed in the 2025 legislative session allowed for the procedure change. Senate Bill 2116 faced little opposition in the Legislature. 
Commissioner Jill Kringstad on Wednesday noted that there have been times when people have shown up at PSC hearings but left before they could provide input. 
She testified in favor of the bill that gives the PSC the option to split up the hearings. The JETx case will be the first time the split hearings will be used.
“I really like this new approach,” Kringstad said Wednesday. 
Kringstad said most hearings will likely follow the traditional format, but split hearings can be used in cases with a large public interest.

Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, said a main reason the group supported the change was hearings on the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. The PSC held several drawn out hearings in 2023 and 2024 before approving the carbon dioxide pipeline route. 
“The public would have to wait eight hours to testify after all of the technical experts were done,” Skokos said. 
Bismarck media law attorney Jack McDonald said it’s important to know that both the technical and public hearings are open for anyone to attend. 
“It’s actually a good thing for the public,” McDonald said. 
In the JETx case, the technical hearing will be Jan. 8-9 at the Capitol in Bismarck. Public hearings will be Jan. 12 in Ellendale, Jan. 14 in Edgeley and Jan. 16 in Jamestown. 
PSC hearings are typically livestreamed on the agency’s website. 
The Public Service Commission in November approved a certificate of need for the large power line. However, the project still needs a route permit from the agency. 
The JETx project received some pushback from landowners as the Legislature debated a power line zoning bill. The Legislature approved a bill that says electrical transmission line projects must follow state zoning rules, taking away local government authority.

Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,” the lawmakers said.The video was titled “Don’t give up the ship.”Does Trump want to ‘execute’ Democrats?When asked by a CBS News reporter during the daily press briefing Thursday whether the president wants to “execute” members of Congress, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt answered, “No.”Leavitt said Trump was reacting to sitting members of Congress who “conspired” on the video message to encourage active duty service members and national security officials to “defy the president's lawful orders.”Leavitt singled out the participation of Slotkin and Kelly, who respectively served as a CIA intelligence officer and a Navy captain. Leavitt also highlighted  Goodlander’s marriage to former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who served under President Joe Biden.“They were leaning into their credentials as former members of our military, as veterans, as former members of the national security apparatus, to signal to people serving under this commander-in-chief, Donald Trump, that you can defy him, and you can betray your oath of office. That is a very, very dangerous message, and it perhaps is punishable by law,” Leavitt said.During the ongoing exchange, CBS’s Nancy Cordes pressed back, saying the lawmakers specifically say “illegal order” in the video.“They're suggesting, Nancy, that the president has given illegal orders, which he has not. Every single order that is given to this United States military by this commander in chief and through this chain of command, through the secretary of War, is lawful,” Leavitt responded.Democrats decry political violence Democratic lawmakers sounded the alarm Thursday over Trump’s social media posts, accusing him of encouraging political violence.“Let’s be crystal clear: the president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials. This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious. We have already seen what happens when Donald Trump tells his followers that his political opponents are enemies of the state,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Thursday.“Every time Donald Trump posts things like this, he makes political violence more likely. None of us should tolerate this kind of behavior,” Schumer said, highlighting political violence in recent years, including the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and political assassinations just this past year.House Committee on the Judiciary Chair Jamie Raskin, D-Md., called on Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to “immediately denounce these reckless statements.”The six Democratic lawmakers featured in the video issued a joint statement, saying they “love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”“That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation. What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the lawmakers said.",,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Merv Riepe of Ralston confirmed on a radio show Thursday that he will seek re-election to the Nebraska Legislature in 2026.
Riepe is an 83-year-old U.S. Navy veteran and longtime health care administrator who represents District 12, which includes parts of Ralston, Millard and Omaha. He was first elected to the Legislature in 2014 and he returned in 2023 after losing a reelection bid to his predecessor — Democrat Steve Lathrop — in 2018.
In a campaign press release, Riepe said his re-election campaign will focus on “solutions, not sides” and on putting people over politics.
“District 12 deserves a senator who … isn’t afraid to stand up for them,” Riepe said. “I’ll continue working to control health care costs, expand access to care, maintain a balanced budget, deliver real tax relief, support public safety and grow economic opportunity for families across Nebraska.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Riepe has several times referred to his district as one of the most “purple” in Nebraska, meaning it has a roughly even mix of registered Republican and Democratic voters. According to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s latest data, the district has 8,900 Republican voters and 7,800 Democrat voters, plus another 6,500 nonpartisan voters. Ralston is an inner-ring suburb in the Omaha area.
This mixture has placed Riepe as a key swing vote who has halted a collection of controversial measures debated by the Legislature in recent years, including shifting the state to winner-take-all in presidential elections, school gender policies and abortion restrictions. He attempted to propose compromises to several of those measures, but was met with mixed results.
During his time in office, Riepe has passed several bills that adjusted various health care regulations in hopes of stabilizing health care costs for Nebraskans. Riepe said these priorities reflect his commitment to “doing what is right, not what is politically convenient.”

The slowdown is the result of a software system issue, agency spokesperson Mark Jones told Mississippi Today. 
“Our software systems are old,” he said.
Mississippians who receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits between the 14th and the 21st of each month will receive up to 65% of their November benefits on their regularly scheduled date. The remaining November benefits for all recipients will be issued separately “as soon as possible,” the agency’s website said Thursday.
Beneficiaries in Mississippi receive $183 on average in food assistance per month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Partial benefits for the average beneficiary would amount to a loss of at least $65 in aid as Thanksgiving approaches. 
The nation’s largest food assistance program was paused beginning in November after the federal government said it would not use emergency funds to pay for the program, even though benefits have continued to flow to states in past shutdowns. 
Confusion ensued after more than a dozen states sued the Trump administration for its refusal to issue benefits. Mississippi said it would begin issuing partial benefits Nov. 10 in accordance with guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that administers the program.
The state Department of Human Services announced that food assistance benefits were set to resume as normal on Nov. 13 after the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history came to an end. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT.
The state Department of Human Services awarded a contract to Deloitte Consulting LLP to improve the agency’s software system in May. Most MDHS eligibility systems were created over 35 years ago, according to the press release announcing the award. 
Jones said the software upgrades are set to be complete in 2027.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04221933/AP25307719916985.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Jennifer Copeland, executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches (File photo)Faith leaders in North Carolina used a virtual press conference Wednesday to condemn recent federal immigration enforcement actions that have disrupted daily life for immigrants and their families across North Carolina.
More than 250 people have been arrested since the operations began, and the faith leaders said their congregants have said they’ve avoided going to work, school, and even church services out of concern they could encounter federal agents.
Clergy from the state’s mainline Protestant and interfaith communities called this week’s enforcement actions “harmful” and “devastating.”
“We are not a small minority,” said Jennifer Copeland, executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches, which includes clergy from 19 denominations. “Millions of church members stand behind these speakers that you’ve heard today.”
Bishop Emily Hartner of the North Carolina Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America framed the situation in religious terms. “We draw on Jesus’s greatest commandment to love God and love our neighbor. And then the parable of the Good Samaritan, where the question is, who is my neighbor?
“When we answer that question, our Lutheran answer is, everyone is our neighbor,” Hartner said.
Speakers said some congregants have been so afraid of the enforcement activity that they have skipped church services altogether amid reports of federal agents stationed near bus stops, parking lots, and residential neighborhoods.
“Wave after wave of the way our government is functioning is doing real harm to ordinary people,” said Bishop Ken Carter of the United Methodist Church.
Rev. Amanda Weatherspoon of the Unitarian Universalist Community of Charlotte said congregations were coordinating with local organizations. She cited efforts with immigrant advocacy groups Siembra N.C. and the Carolina Migrant Network to train volunteers, share information and accompany families who feel unsafe leaving home.
Still, the faith leaders said they recognize the limits of offering protection. On whether churches might revive sanctuary practices — temporarily sheltering immigrants inside houses of worship — several noted that the legal risks had changed in the years since such movements gained national attention.
The Trump administration has also rescinded a long-standing “sensitive locations” policy that had generally barred immigration agents from taking enforcement actions at places of worship, hospitals, and schools without prior approval.
“I know that many congregations are reviewing updated legal policies around harboring and protection,” said Weatherspoon. “They are assessing what is possible and most helpful to fully protect immigrants and safeguard our congregations from legal proceedings amid these changes.”
David Smith, clerk of the North Carolina Fellowship of Friends, representing the state’s Quaker community, framed the debate as a test of core values. “We believe there is that of God in everyone. Every person on this soil must be afforded dignity, respect and due process,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rev.-Jennifer-Copeland-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Getty Images)More Arkansans will be subject to food assistance program work requirements starting Friday, after a panel of legislators approved emergency rules put forward by the Arkansas Department of Human Services Thursday.
The changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) implement work requirements on adult SNAP recipients younger than 64 and without dependents younger than 14 who are capable of working.
Previously, those with dependents 18 or younger and those older than 54 were not subject to SNAP work requirements. That changed as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress over the summer. The work-requirement provisions went into effect when the law was signed, but states had until Nov. 1 to implement the changes.
But DHS didn’t receive guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for implementing the changes until October and couldn’t promulgate the rules in time for the Nov. 1 deadline, Mary Franklin, director of DHS’ Division of County Operations, told the Advocate after the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive subcommittee meeting Thursday.
Arkansas will start implementing the changes to work requirement exemptions upon adjournment of the Arkansas Legislative Council on Friday using the emergency rule approved by the body’s Executive Subcommittee. A permanent rule will come next year.
The federal law also removed work requirement exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and those 24 or younger who have aged out of foster care.
Those subject to work requirements must work at least 80 hours a month, or be participating in education, training or volunteer work to receive SNAP benefits for longer than three months within a three year period.

Advocates have worried the changes to work requirements and additional financial burdens on states to operate the program could result in large numbers of individuals and families losing their benefits nationwide. In fiscal year 2024, 240,000 people received SNAP benefits in Arkansas, and 12.6% of the households receiving benefits had children, according to USAFacts.
Despite consistently being one of the most food insecure states in the U.S., according to USDA data, the number of Arkansans receiving SNAP benefits has fallen steadily even as poverty rates remained relatively constant. In fiscal year 2024, the number of Arkansans receiving food benefits was the lowest since 1991 and less than half of the number participating in the program in fiscal year 2013.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761149882.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A group of nine attorneys general, including North Carolina’s AG Jeff Jackson, said Thursday they had reached a settlement with the rental company Greystar. The group sued the company and several other property management firms earlier this year, alleging illegal rent fixing through the use of AI tools.
Greystar will pay $7 million to the group of nine states, Jackson’s office announced Thursday, and will stop using non-public data from other rental companies and RealPage, an AI software company, to determine rents.
“This settlement means that more than 25,000 renters in North Carolina are going to be charged fairer prices for rent at a time when housing costs are overwhelming,” Jackson said in a statement.
Under the settlement, Greystar will only be allowed to use third-party software or algorithms to price apartments under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor. The company will not share sensitive data with competitors in order to set rent prices, and will not attend meetings hosted by RealPage.
Greystar, headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, is North Carolina’s largest landlord. The company has properties in Asheville, the Charlotte metro, the Cape Fear and Wilmington region, the Piedmont Triad and the Research Triangle, according to its website.
The lawsuit against RealPage and four other rental companies remains in court. It was filed in January alongside California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and Tennessee.
RealPage is alleged to have used sensitive data to create a pricing algorithm that inflates rent and violates antitrust laws. The group of rental companies are alleged to have shared private information with RealPage and amongst themselves about prices and occupancy.
North Carolina in 2024 joined a separate federal suit against RealPage and a group of rental companies alleging antitrust violations under former AG Josh Stein, who is now governor.
That case also remains in court; Greystar and the federal government agreed to an August resolution with similar terms to the one finalized Thursday, and on Tuesday filed a joint motion with states to be dismissed from the 2024 suit.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4269-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

President Donald Trump took to Truth Social, the social media platform that he owns, to post and re-post a number of statements calling for imprisonment and even death of a number of Democratic lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, calling a video they made “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS.”
“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump continued in a second post.
Slotkin, a former CIA officer, is joined in the video by fellow Democrats including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, all military veterans and former intelligence officers, where they urge military members to “refuse illegal orders.” 
“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” Slotkin, Kelly and Crow say.  
In response to the video, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.” He followed this up with a series of “re-Truths” of posts calling the members of Congress “terrorists” and even one post calling to hang them. 
“This really isn’t about those of us who made the video,” Slotkin said in a video posted hours after Trump’s posts. “This is about who we are as Americans and how we’re going to engage with people who we disagree with.”

“We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” Slotkin and the other lawmakers wrote a joint statement. “That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.”
“What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the statement continues. “In these moments, fear is contagious, but so is courage. We will continue to lead and will not be intimidated.”
Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, also released a statement on Trump’s posts.
“Threatening death against people you disagree with is totally unacceptable and un-American—especially when it comes to lawmakers who have dedicated their lives to serving this great nation and the Constitution. Donald Trump’s abuse of power to persecute his political enemies has reached a new height, attempting to intimidate anyone who defends the promise of our country,” Hertel said. “We know Senator Slotkin will never be intimidated as she stands up for Michiganders, Americans, and the very cornerstone of our democracy. Trump’s threats today go against everything this country stands for, and every single leader, Republican and Democrat, should be wholeheartedly condemning this behavior.”

Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania joins veterans protesting the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, outside the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)This story was originally published by WESA. 
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio of Western Pennsylvania is among a half-dozen Democratic legislators accused of sedition Thursday morning by President Donald Trump, citing a video in which the legislators urged military and intelligence personnel not to obey unlawful orders.
In social media posts made Thursday morning, Trump said the Democrats had committed “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,”a crime he said was “punishable by DEATH” and that each legislator “should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. … An example MUST BE SET.” Trump also reposted posts from other accounts, including one calling for the legislators to be hanged.
“ The fact that the president’s reaction to us stating a basic principle of the Constitution is to threaten us with death, tells me everything I need to know about the importance of restating our oath to the Constitution,” Deluzio told WESA on Thursday afternoon.
At issue is a minute-and-a-half-long video released Wednesday in which Deluzio, a U.S. Navy veteran, joins U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of eastern Pennsylvania and four other Democrats with military backgrounds. They speak in rotation as they directly address military servicemembers and intelligence personnel.
“We know you are under enormous stress and pressure right now,” said Elissa Slotkin, a U.S. Senator from Michigan.
The Trump administration, the Democrats say, is pitting the military and intelligence professionals against American citizens. And while Americans trust the military, “that trust is at risk,” Deluzio says in the video. Service members swear an oath to the U.S. Constitution, but Deluzio adds, “right now, the threats to our constitution aren’t just coming from abroad. … You must refuse illegal orders.”
“Don’t give up the ship,” the Democrats say together.
The video does not identify which actions they regard as “threats to our constitution,” although Democrats have been concerned about the administration’s willingness to deploy the military to cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles. There have also been concerns about a series of military strikes on boats in international waters that the War Department, formerly the Department of Defence, has said were engaged in drug trafficking.
Deluzio told WESA that “it’s  a basic constitutional principle of the oath that you have a duty to follow lawful orders and that no service member is ever forced to follow illegal ones.” He said that “there’s no specific past act we’re pointing to, but certainly there are concerns” about what Trump may demand in the future.
“The president himself has talked about using American cities … as training grounds with active duty troops being pitted against their fellow citizens,” he added. “And so it’s an important moment to reassert that basic constitutional idea of the oaths to the Constitution.”
The U.S. Military Code of Justice requires troops to follow only legal orders: They can be prosecuted for obeying orders that are unlawful. But conservatives expressed outrage at the video, arguing that it was an open call for troops to defy commands issued by Trump as Commander in Chief. Trump amplified that message Thursday, arguing that the video was “punishable by DEATH!”
“Their words cannot be allowed to stand,” he added. “We won’t have a Country anymore!!!”
Deluzio said he hoped that reaction to Trump’s statements would be “a turning point away from this dangerous drive into political violence and authoritarianism.
“ I wish I could say that preparing for the president of the United States of America to call for my death and hanging was not something that had crossed my mind. [But] now it’s happened because this is who he is, apparently.”
“I think this is a moment where everyone — Democrat, Republican, you name it — should be condemning the president’s calls for political violence against me and others, and I think every elected Republican in Pennsylvania should be asked whether they’re going to condemn that call for violence.”
The offices of U.S. Rep Guy Reschenthaler and U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, both Republicans from Pennsylvania, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. The office of U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly said that he would not be available to comment on Trump’s remarks Thursday, but it noted that he spoke about the video itself on Fox the day before.
In those comments, Kelly professed bafflement at the video. “I get confused from time to time whether it’s Trump Derangement Syndrome or people that actually just want to pivot to something else,” he said. ” I have deep respect for those who’ve served. But … most people who’ve served don’t make an issue of things and bring it out in public like that to criticize the President of the United States.
“Why would you bring out something like that?” he added. “What purpose does that play to tell people that you don’t have to follow orders. Really? I’ve never heard that before.”
Nationally, however, some Republicans justified Trump’s remarks, arguing that he was merely stating the penalty for seditious behavior, and that the video crossed a line. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said the message was “wildly inappropriate” and “beyond the pale.”
Democrats reacted more quickly and forcefully, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, who himself was targeted in an arson attempt earlier this year.
In a social media post of his own, he said, “Not only has the president failed in his responsibility to lead this country — he is actively encouraging political violence once again, ratcheting up the real risk of danger to our elected leaders and deepening the divides in our country. The sycophants and enablers the president surrounds himself with are quick to condemn language like this when it suits their political purposes — but in moments like this, they remain silent
Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has not often challenged Trump in public, issued a social media statement of his own, saying: “I strongly reject this dangerous rhetoric. Do not threaten Members of Congress. Republican or Democrat. It’s deeply wrong with no exceptions — ever.”
In a Thursday-afternoon statement, Deluzio and the other Democrats struck a defiant note in response: “No threat, intimidation or call for violence will deter us from [our] sacred obligation” to the constitution.”
“What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the statement continues. “This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence. … Fear is contagious, but so is courage.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/veteransprotest-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Who’s accountable?,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/20/men-died-in-a-private-delta-prison-whos-accountable/,At least five people who were from out of state or outside the county have died in the past 1 1/2 years inside the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility.,"Michelle Hodges-Feek hasn’t opened the box in her living room that arrived weeks ago from Mississippi. 
She can’t bring herself to because inside are the cremated remains of her 40-year-old son, Daniel Hollan, who died Sept. 10 at a privately-run prison in the Mississippi Delta, hundreds of miles away. 
She didn’t get an opportunity to say goodbye. Months later, she has an official cause of death and a certificate, but she’s still left with questions: What happened? How or why did this happen? Who is responsible?
“Nobody cares that my son died except me, and all I got is a big box that I don’t have the guts to open yet,” Hodges-Feek, who lives outside of Kansas City, Kansas, said as she began to cry. 
One day she hopes to take a trip to Colorado, where their family previously lived, to have a memorial service for Hollan and spread his ashes. 
He is among at least five people who were from out of state or from outside the county who died in the last 1 1/2 years inside the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, a private prison operated by CoreCivic. Deaths there have left family members, like Hodges-Feek, uncertain about whom to go to for answers and whom to hold accountable. 
Hollan was convicted in Montana in 2017 and spent time in state and privately run prisons there before arriving in Mississippi in January among the first group of Montana prisoners at Tallahatchie Correctional. 
His mother sought answers and details from Mississippi and Montana prison officials, a county coroner and CoreCivic. 
It took a month for her to learn he died from an accidental drug overdose. Hollan had struggled with addiction before, but his mother believes he may have used drugs in prison to self-medicate. He had lived with chronic arthritis that affected his skin and joints and a more recent heart condition. 
To date, CoreCivic has contracted with four states, three counties, one U.S. territory and the U.S. Marshals Service to house people at the 2,672-bed Tallahatchie prison.
CoreCivic also signed a deal in February with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand immigration detention, including the use of 252 beds at the Tallahatchie facility. 
The facility houses detainees awaiting trial and the convicted, some serving up to life. A CoreCivic confirmed that pretrial detainees are housed separately from prisoners from state or federal agencies, but did not provide numbers of pretrial detainees and state prisoners. 
In the industry of incarceration, CoreCivic is one of the two largest private prison companies in the United States, operating more than 70 facilities. The Tennessee-based company reported quarterly earnings this month of $580.4 million, up from 18.1% from the prior year quarter. Tallahatchie Correctional is located in the small town of Tutwiler with a population of 1,635 – a fraction of the prison’s capacity. 
‘Is nobody responsible for these guys’ care?’
Hollan had never been to Mississippi, and it was not his decision to come. Montana prison officials, grappling with its prison population and needing to make upgrades to its main state facility, made the decision for him and 239 other prisoners when it signed a contract with CoreCivic. The state retained custody of him from hundreds of miles away.
Three years earlier, the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole ruled Hollan was not eligible for early release and needed to take a class. As he learned about his out-of-state transfer in 2025, he heard that the Arizona CoreCivic facility where Montana had already sent people offered the class he hoped to take to become eligible for parole, his mother said. 
By June of this year, Hollan was up for administrative parole review, but the board informed him by letter he was ineligible for early release again because he didn’t fulfill the class requirement. The board holds hearings and reviews for incarcerated people housed in Montana for state-owned facilities, as well as for those held out of state in private facilities like Tallahatchie Correctional. 
Hodges-Feek and her daughter, Rebecca McQuarrie, kept in touch with Hollan through several 5-minute weekly calls provided to prisoners. He shared that he had been trying to access medical care from the prison’s in-house staff for at least four months before his death.
“Is it Montana people who are watching them? Is it Montana people who are the guards?  It’s CoreCivic’s people who are the guards,” Hodges-Feek said.  “How can they pass the buck, is that legal? Is nobody responsible for these guys’ care?” 
In response, a CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd said the company is deeply saddened by the death of any person in its care, and that the company is serious about following standards and policies that its government partners expect. 
When someone dies, CoreCivic notifies the deceased’s home state and local law enforcement to conduct an investigation, Todd said. Then someone from Tallahatchie Correctional contacts the emergency contact listed in the prisoner or detainee’s file. 
“Every death is investigated thoroughly and transparently, but it’s important to note that the circumstances of each incident will dictate how the investigation is handled,” he said in a Thursday statement. “Our focus remains on doing everything possible to prevent these events from happening in the first place through training, oversight and continuous improvement in our standard of care.” 
Montana prisons spokesperson Alexandria Klapmeier wrote in an email that the Tutwiler Police Department investigated Hollan’s death and the Tallahatchie County Coroner’s Office was responsible for the death investigation.
Anthony Hawkins, the Tallahatchie coroner, confirmed he handles death investigations from the private prison, including that of Hollan and others sent from out of state or other Mississippi counties. After initially agreeing to speak, he has been unavailable for comment.

Hodges-Feek was told Hollan was found in his cell, blue in the face in the morning, multiple hours after he was last seen or heard from the previous day. She wonders if his cellmate or others had seen anything. 
She also submitted a public records request with the Montana Department of Corrections seeking copies of Hollan’s medical requests and related grievances. As of November, she is still waiting to receive those records. 
The Montana prison official who informed Hodges-Feek and his sister about Hollan’s death said it didn’t appear to be suicide, the women said. McQuarrie wanted confirmation because the youngest of her three brothers died from suicide in 2017 and she didn’t think her mother could handle losing another child that way. 
The state where a suspicious death occurs in a correctional facility outside Montana handles the investigation following that state’s legal processes and laws, Klapmeier said. Once the coroner finishes a death investigation, that official shares the information with the contract prison department and medical and investigation staff, she said.
Mississippi’s State Medical Examiner’s Office conducts the autopsies, as required by law for people who die in public or privately run prisons, jails or correctional facilities. The examination is used to help complete a death certificate, which is issued by the state Department of Health. 
That office completed Hollan’s autopsy and those of the Vermont prisoners and Hinds County detainees, said Bailey Martin, spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety, which oversees the medical examiner’s office.
Mitzi Magleby is an advocate who has worked with incarcerated people and their families in Mississippi’s state- and privately run prisons. Whenever anyone dies in prison, she said the priority should be informing families and guiding them through processes. 
“To me it’s a communication breakdown,” she said. “There’s not enough communication with these families. They’re in the dark.”
For out-of-state families like Hodges-Feek, Magleby said having to seek information from two state prison agencies and a private company is even more red tape to navigate. 
Klapmeier, the Montana prison spokesperson, said the state pays to bring the body of the deceased to their family’s choice of funeral home in the state or transport their cremation remains to the family. 
This was not made clear to Hodges-Feek. She said as her family considered the cost of bringing Hollan’s body home, her daughter and son-in-law considered taking out a loan to pay for it, but Hodges-Feek said she didn’t want them to take on that financial burden. Instead, she approved Hollan’s cremation in Mississippi.
Cremation felt like the only option to get her son home because it wasn’t clear where he would have been buried – Montana or Mississippi – if she pursued that option. 
‘The safest and most dignified option’
Two men from Vermont, which also contracts with CoreCivic, also died in the Tallahatchie facility.
At the end of February 2024, 71-year-old Alfred Brochu, who was serving life for murder, was found unresponsive in his cell and taken to a hospital where he died. He had been at Tallahatchie Correctional since 2011, Vermont media reported. 
Two weeks later in March, 43-year-old Sean Osterhout died. He came to Mississippi in 2019 and was serving up to a 30-year sentence for two charges of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child.
The Vermont Department of Corrections handled the death investigations and found that the deaths were not suspicious, said Haley Sommer, a department spokesperson for the Vermont Department of Corrections.
When a death of one of its people occurs at Tallahatchie Correctional, Vermont prison staff travel to the facility to look at circumstances that lead to the death and to consult with the medical team in Vermont about medical records, she said. From there, Vermont’s Defender General’s office has discretion of whether to conduct an investigation into a prison death.
Vermont has faced a challenge with space in its correctional facilities, and the state’s preference has been to send people out of state to reduce overcrowding at home, Sommer said.  
The state has contracted with CoreCivic since 2018, and Vermont has found that contracts with private companies like CoreCivic to be useful because the state is able to maintain custody, which includes making decisions about inmates’ medical care. 
“It is the safest and most dignified option,” Sommer said about sending inmates out of state to Mississippi and other prison facilities.

Months before Hollan’s death, Hinds County detainees Ulysses Nelson III and Christian Dyre, both 24, died within days of each other in the Tallahatchie facility. 
Dyre had been at Tallahatchie Correctional since October 2023 and was facing a murder charge, and Nelson had been at the prison since January awaiting trial for aggravated assault, domestic violence and rape, Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said. 
Jones said their deaths were believed to be drug-related because there were reports of contraband in the zone where they both were housed. He said at the time that Tutwiler police would investigate and the State Medical Examiner’s Office would conduct an autopsy and toxicology reports. 
Todd, the CoreCivic spokesman, said there is a zero-tolerance policy for anyone to introduce contraband into its facilities. The company seeks to prevent contraband from coming through such measures as searches, patrols, monitoring systems and mail checks, he said. 
Tallahatchie Correctional medical staff immediately respond to emergency calls and are equipped to provide lifesaving care such as the administration of naloxone, which is an opioid-overdose reversing drug, he said. 
Mississippi Today requested records about the men’s cause of death, but the information was not available by publication. 
In an October interview, Jones would not comment about the sheriff’s office’s working relationship with operators of the Tallahatchie facility, citing ongoing litigation around the Hinds County Detention Center. 
In 2023, the county signed a two-year contract with CoreCivic to send detainees to the private prison due to limited staff and conditions of a housing pod that has been closed down.
‘Nobody cares about these boys once they get locked up’
In the weeks after his death, Hodges-Feeks joined a Facebook group with other family members with loved ones in CoreCivic facilities in Mississippi and Arizona, including those who died there. She now knows she is not alone. 
With questions still unanswered about her son’s death, Hodges-Feek and Hollan’s sister try to remember him as a person who put others first and had a good work ethic. When tornado sirens went off, Hollan was often the first to react and tell his family to get to a safe place. As a child, he saved his own money to buy a video game console.

But Hollan also had a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This, his mother said, paired with the death of his younger brother led him to turn to drugs and alcohol, and actions stemming from their use led to prison time, his mother said. 
After completing an earlier sentence, Hollan tried to get a fresh start in Montana. Instead, he began to use drugs again, which Hodges-Feek said contributed to another prison charge. Hollan was convicted in 2017 of prostitution and received a 99-year sentence with 75 years suspended, according to court records. 
Hodges-Feek kept in contact with her son over the years as he was moved to state-owned and private prisons in Montana. 
In Mississippi, Hollan used his free weekly calls to tell his mother and sister what he was experiencing: How January rain caused flooding in the prison and the summer passed without air conditioning.
Hodges-Feek has seen how her older son, who also served time in prison, was able to turn his life around. She wonders what could have happened if Hollan had received a similar chance. 
“(Daniel) never got the opportunity,” she said. “Nobody cares about those boys once they get locked up.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20131305/MT-TallahatchieCoCorrectionalFacility-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver recently signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern about the federal government’s request for states’ voter rolls.
The Nov. 18 letter, as Colorado Newsline originally reported, was signed by 10 Democratic secretaries of state, and raises concerns about inconsistent information from the federal agencies about how they are using and sharing voter data requested from states in recent months.
The election officials’ recent letter notes that everyone who signed it—which in addition to Toulouse Oliver includes the secretaries of state from Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington—received letters requesting voter data lists—in some cases redacted lists that included “dates of birth, state driver’s license numbers, and last four digits of Social Security numbers.”
In the case of New Mexico, as Source NM previously reported, the United States Department of Justice initially reached out to Toulouse Oliver in July. She told Source NM this week the state provided the federal government with “the publicly available file that anyone has access to,” which does not include Social Security Numbers and only years of birth.
Following the requests for data, the letter says, officials heard inconsistent information about how the information would be used.

According to the letter, at the end of August in a phone call meeting arranged by the National Association of Secretaries of State, a U.S. Department of Justice representative said the lists would be used to assess compliance with the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act.
Then a DHS official named Heather Honey, in a separate meeting, said that “that DHS had not received voter data or requested it. She then suggested that DHS had no intention of using voter data.”
That information was contradicted when the Trump administration acknowledged that the Department of Justice was sharing voter information with Homeland Security to search for non-citizens.
Honey, according to the DHS website, holds a position as Deputy Assistant Secretary for elections integrity. The letter from the secretaries of states notes that Honey “has a history of spreading false claims about elections.”
She pushed to overturn Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. Now she’ll help oversee election security.

“Federal law and the U.S. Constitution are clear: states are responsible for administering elections,” the letter reads. “Additionally, transmitting this information to another federal agency raises serious Privacy Act concerns and risks improper dissemination of and access to sensitive voter data. We are deeply concerned about the inconsistent and misleading information that Secretaries have received from the DOJ and DHS and with the potential lack of compliance with federal law.”
The letter asks for answers to a series of questions by Dec. 1 about how the voter information has or will be used or shared.
In response to a query from Source NM regarding the letter, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesperson referenced a previous statement on the topic provided by a spokesperson that says:
“Enforcing the Nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the Civil Rights Division.  Congress gave the Justice Department authority under the NVRA, HAVA, the Civil Rights Act, and other statutes to ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections. The recent request by the Civil Rights Division for state voter rolls is pursuant to that statutory authority, and the responsive data is being screened for ineligible voter entries.”
Source has a pending query with Homeland Security regarding the letter and its content.
In a phone interview Wednesday, Toulouse Oliver told Source NM that she had two main concerns about the federal government’s request for voter data rolls. First: “What is the data being used for outside of verifying citizenship? That’s a big concern, because we’re not in the business of creating citizenship lists or providing information to [Immigration Customs Enforcement] that would potentially harm people who are legally here in the United States. We’ve seen from many, many news reports, there are a number of people that ICE have detained that are either US citizens or have legal status, so to me, that’s deeply concerning.”
Toulouse noted, as she has previously to Source, that she’s not worried “that there is some huge amount, if any, non-citizens on our voter registration list. What I am concerned about goes to the number two concern, which is they have insisted that we send them our data and that they do the matching. And that’s not how it works. We, the county clerks and my office, are experts in matching data for voter registration purposes, and we go out of our way to ensure that a match is an accurate match.”
Accurate matches, she said, “go beyond having the same name and birth date. Because you can have two Juan Sanchezes with the same birth date; it’s not hard to imagine in New Mexico. We have deep concerns about how they are doing their matches and what is the level of scrutiny that’s being applied to that process.”
If state officials were doing the checking, Toulouse Oliver noted, “I would trust that process a lot more than whatever mysterious process they’re doing because, again, I know that we are going to exhaust every possible resource at our disposal to ensure that when we say this person is a non-citizen and they’re on the voter registration list, that we are sure that they are and or that we have a high percentage of being sure.”
The bottom line, she said, “they’re actually using voter registration as a tool to try to find non-citizens to prosecute or persecute through their other agenda regarding non-citizens. And it’s not, in my mind, about making sure we don’t have non-citizens on the voting rolls, although that should be a goal that we all share. It’s more about using that data for other purposes.”
And while Toulouse Oliver said she doesn’t necessarily expect to receive a response to the questions posed by the letter, “If I don’t stand up and use my voice for what is right, then I’m complicit. If I don’t stand up and I don’t say, ‘Hey, this is wrong. Can you please provide us with some answers?’ then I’m not doing my job.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/elex3LR-2048x1356-1-1024x678.png,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

July 19, 2022. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.After a federal appeals court held that Michigan is not immune to legal action for its decision to revoke a Canadian energy company’s easement to operate a pipeline in the Great Lakes, the Whitmer Administration is seeking an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. 
In a petition filed on Nov. 13, attorneys for the state have asked the high court to weigh whether the state is entitled to legal immunity in cases where a private entity seeks relief that would diminish the state’s ownership and control of its own lands. 
Attorney General Dana Nessel argued the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it agreed that Enbridge Energy’s case against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Scott Bowen, the director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, fell within the exceptions to sovereign immunity, which prevents a state from being sued in state or federal courts without its consent. 
“This Court’s intervention is urgently needed because the Sixth Circuit’s rule strikes at not one, but two core attributes of statehood: a State’s immunity from suit and its dominion over sovereign lands,” attorneys for the state wrote in their petition. 
20251113124945367_Whitmer v Enbridge Petition A
Enbridge filed its lawsuit against the state in response to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s decision to revoke and terminate its permit to operate the Line 5 pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. 
Whitmer and Nessel, alongside Native American Tribes and environmental activists have raised alarms about the potential for the pipeline to rupture, with one University of Michigan researcher concluding the Straits of Mackinac are the “worst possible place” for a Great Lakes oil spill. 
While the state argued Enbridge had repeatedly violated the easement’s terms, the company argued that the governor and the Department of Natural Resources have no authority over pipeline safety matters and that the termination of their permit ran afoul of the Federal Pipeline Safety Act and the 1977 transit pipelines treaty with Canada. 
Although Enbridge was given until Dec. 17 to respond to the state’s petition to the Supreme Court, the company filed a document noting it does not intend to respond.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9924-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

Toby Overdorf speaks to reporters after a property tax meeting on Nov. 20, 2025. (Via Liv  Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Florida House Democrats found common ground with Gov. Ron DeSantis Thursday in vehemently opposing Republicans’ eight property tax proposals, all of which have passed their first committee hurdles along party lines.
The measures aim to slash most property taxes while keeping law enforcement funding intact. Although seven of the eight are proposals to amend the state Constitution, House Republicans wouldn’t mind presenting voters with all seven options on the November ballot — over DeSantis’ objections and Democrats’ fears of harming local governments.
“None of these proposals directly conflicts with another,” said Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, chair of the 37-member House Select Committee on Property Taxes. “There may be some overlap between some of the proposals, but there’s not conflict.”
DeSantis has bitterly feuded with House Republicans since Miami Rep. Danny Perez took the helm as Speaker last year. Perez, a Republican, urged his members to shift away from the dogged obedience to DeSantis demonstrated as the governor ran for president, and toward independence.
He systematically opposed DeSantis on most proposals, drawing the governor’s ire as he began to insult the GOP-supermajority House as “rotten” and recently called their property tax proposals “milquetoast.”
Overdorf told reporters following Thursday’s meeting that he’d “love to compare plans” with the governor “once we receive a plan from him.” None of the House’s proposals are, as of yet, mirrored in the Senate.
“None of the bills address that…”
Democrats joined not only DeSantis but a slew of local government officials in opposing each of the eight proposals Republicans presented. 
City commissioners, mayors, and pro-local groups spoke during Thursday’s four-hour meeting as nearly all derided the measures as potentially expensive, dangerous, and harmful to their communities.
They argued that, although each of the measures stays away from school property taxes and forbids de-funding law enforcement, the “drastic” cuts could make it difficult to fund firefighters, emergency management services, and other locally covered services largely drawn from property taxes,
Port St. Lucie Vice Mayor Jolien Caraballo said that 49% of her city’s $212.5 million general fund comes from property taxes. She claimed that if some of these proposals were enacted, it would leave her city with $108.3 million. Of that, $94.6 million goes to law enforcement.
“That [would leave] only $13.7 million to fund every other department to support our more than 263,000 citizens,” Caraballo said.
Similar sentiments were echoed by representatives from Apopka, Wauchula, and Bartow. Democrat Rep. Mike Gottlieb argued that none of the measures address spiraling housing costs.
“The real drivers of higher housing costs are limited supplies, zoning barriers, construction costs, and soaring insurance and HOA fees,” he said. “None of the bills address that.”
What are the proposals?
Here’s a list of the proposals filed by House Republicans, as the Phoenix has previously reported.

HJR 201 by Rep. Kevin Steele (R-Dade City): Would eliminate all non-school homestead property taxes. If approved by voters, the House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $14.1 billion and a negative recurring impact of $18.3 billion. Recurring means a continuing loss year after year.
HJR 203 by Monique Miller (R-Palm Bay): Would phase out non-school homestead property taxes annually over 10 years. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $4.4 billion and a negative recurring impact of $13.3 billion.
HJR 205 by Juan Porras (R-Miami): Would exempt Florida residents over the age of 65 from paying non-school homestead property taxes. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $5.1 billion and a negative recurring impact of $6.7 billion.
HJR 207 by Rep. Shane Abbott (R-DeFuniak Springs): Would create a new homestead exemption for non-school property taxes equal to 25% of the assessed value of the House. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $3.5 billion and a negative recurring impact of $4.6 billion.
HJR 209 by Rep. Demi Busatta (R-Miami): Would create a new property insurance relief homestead exemption of $100,000 — as long as the property is covered by a comprehensive “multiperil” property insurance policy. The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $6.6 billion and a negative recurring impact of $8.6 billion.
HJR 211 by Rep. Toby Overdorf (R-Palm City): Eliminates the cap on a portability transfer under Florida’s Save Our Homes benefit, allowing a homeowner to transfer their entire accumulated Save Our Homes benefit to their new home, even if that home has a lesser value.  The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $42.7 million, and a negative recurring impact of $336.8 million.
HJR 213 by Rep. Griff Griffitts (R-Panama City Beach): Would llimit the growth in assessed value of non-school homestead property to 3% over three years (it’s now 3% per year) and 15% over three years for non-homestead property (it’s 10% per year now). The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $1.7 billion, and  negative recurring impact of $5.2 billion.

HB 215 by Rep. Jon Albert (R-Frostproof): The only bill, not proposed amendment, filed. The measure would make various statutory changes including requiring a 2/3 vote for any increase in the millage rate by a local government and allow newly married couples to combine their accumulated Save Our Homes benefits, not exceeding a total of $500,000.
The House staff analysis estimates it will have a negative cash impact of $44.5 million (-$16.4 million School and -$28.1 million Non-School), and a negative recurring impact of $112.6 million (-$41.5 million School and -$71.1 million Non-School) on local property tax revenues.

(Screenshot from TikTok)The first thing they asked Fernando Vazquez was “Where are you from?”
When two unmarked SUVs full of Border Patrol agents arrived Tuesday at the Cary construction site where Vazquez, 18, is employed, the only thing he could think of was to call his dad, another worker on the site. “I just told him, run, and to hide.”
The work at the site was virtually complete, with only around 10 workers present on an average day. Because of absences — with fears of Border Patrol and ICE chilling construction sites across the Triangle — Vazquez said there were only about four people on the site, part of why he didn’t believe they would be targeted.
“I didn’t believe it would happen to me,” Vazquez said. “I was born here.”

Vazquez had left the site to buy a drink at a nearby store. As he walked back, he saw a gray Chevy Tahoe and a black Ford Expedition roll up to the site. Vazquez retreated into a fenced-off HVAC area and took out his phone to get a better look at them.
But the agents had already spotted him.
The agents who approached him wore masks, gloves, and dark glasses. At first, Vazquez reserved his right to remain silent, but when one agent began questioning him in Spanish, he started swearing at them “to make time to stall them,” he said. “I’m thinking about the workers and my dad.”
As he tried to step out of the enclosure, he said, Border Patrol agents climbed over the fence to corner him. One yanked an AirPod out of Vazquez’s ear and set it on the AC unit beside him. When Vazquez tried to retrieve it and put it back in the case, he said, the agent shouted, “Don’t touch me.”
“I’m like, ‘I’m not touching you.’ And then he said, ‘If you touch me, there’s going to be a problem,’” Vazquez said.
That was when they handcuffed him and searched him, pulling his wallet out of his pocket.
“They saw my North Carolina Real ID,” he said. “They were looking for an ID or some sort of documentation, so at that moment, they could have let me free. But no, they decided to take me.”
Vazquez was placed in the SUV with one of his fellow workers on the construction site, a young man who was crying. As they drove away, the agents continued to question Vazquez, asking him again where he was from and where he was born as they went through his wallet.
When he told them he was born in Raleigh, the agent questioning him grew angry, Vazquez said. They abruptly pulled off the road into the parking lot of a carpet cleaning company, where they dumped him, a half mile away from where they picked him up, throwing his wallet and cards out of the SUV window as they drove off.
“I have no idea why they just dropped me off,” he added. “I kind of felt like I was being kidnapped.”
His video of Border Patrol uncuffing him and driving away has gone viral on TikTok, accumulating 3 million views and thousands of concerned comments. In the video, an agent with his face covering lowered appears to lunge at the phone with a raised hand, which Vazquez said he believed was an attempt by the agent to conceal his identity.
As Vazquez left the SUV, the other detainee asked him, “Tell my brother that they got me.”
“It devastated me,” Vazquez said. “It broke my heart to realize how two brothers were being separated in front of my eyes.”
As he ran back to the site, he called his mom to pick him up. His first reaction was fear that his dad may have been taken in the other SUV. When he told her what happened, she didn’t believe him. “Until she heard me running worried and worried, that’s when she believed me,” he said.
When he got back to the site, he told his dad and the detainee’s brother, another worker on the site, what happened. “His brother was just outside in shock,” he said.
The other worker told Vazquez that another Border Patrol vehicle was still patrolling the area, so he called his mom back, warning her not to pick him up. Instead, he got the keys from his dad and drove home himself.
Vazquez’s encounter with Border Patrol comes as immigration enforcement agencies conduct large-scale raids in Charlotte, Raleigh, and surrounding areas. He was far from the only U.S. citizen to be swept up in them.
A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the incident, but said Thursday afternoon that Operation Charlotte’s Web in North Carolina has resulted in 370 arrests. “The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
Earlier Thursday, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said he had been told by federal agents that Border Patrol operations had ceased in Charlotte, though he noted that ICE will continue to operate in the area “as they always have.”
It is unclear whether Border Patrol operations in the Triangle area remain ongoing. A spokeswoman for Wake County Sheriff Willie Rowe said their office has had no communication from federal authorities.

North Carolina politicians from both parties have urged federal agents to focus their efforts on criminals instead of carrying out indiscriminate arrests.
Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) wrote in a post on X that operations should target “those who not only violated our immigration law but also pose a threat to our communities.”
“Federal law enforcement has been tasked with removing criminal offenders who never should’ve been in the U.S.,” Budd wrote Wednesday. “They should carry out this mission responsibly to ensure that violent individuals are quickly identified, detained, and deported.”
Gov. Josh Stein issued a direct condemnation of ICE and Border Patrol for “operating in the shadows” in the state on Tuesday.
“If this were targeted to going after known people who are criminals or known people who are drug traffickers who are engaged in violent crime, that would be a good thing,” Stein said after an event in Benson. “But they’re just sweeping sidewalks. They’re sweeping parking lots. They’re going into stores and churches.”
“This is causing widespread fear, widespread uncertainty,” he added. “This is not about public safety, and I wish that it were.”
Vazquez said he would advise those concerned they could be picked up to carry their documentation with them at all times. If possible, he said, don’t leave the house at all.
“If you don’t have to come outside, don’t come outside,” he said. “If you need any help, ask somebody.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CBP-Drives-Away-e1763667956759.png,,,2025-11-20 15:57:34.007033

The railroad is seen at left running through town and meeting up with the river near the top of the frame. (William Woody for Colorado Newsline)State leaders are applauding another major step finalized Wednesday toward permanently protecting upper Colorado River water flows on the Western Slope.
Members of the Colorado Water Conservation Board gave unanimous approval to an agreement between Xcel Energy and the Colorado River District, which manages water supplies for 15 Western Slope counties, to transfer two key water rights associated with the Shoshone Hydroelectric Generating Station to the district for $99 million.
The terms of that deal called for the CWCB, which manages water resources statewide, to approve the Shoshone water rights as “instream flow” rights under a state program created in the 1970s to secure water rights for “nonconsumptive,” environmental uses. The two water rights held by the small hydropower plant date to 1905 and 1940 and add up to over 1,400 cubic feet per second of Colorado River water flows — two factors that would make it the most substantial set of rights ever secured by the instream flow program.

“The importance of today’s vote cannot be overstated as a legacy decision for Colorado water and the Western Slope,” Andy Mueller, general manager of the Colorado River District, said in a statement. “It secures an essential foundation for the health of the Colorado River and the communities it sustains.”
Western Slope counties have worried for years about the consequences for Colorado River flows if the Shoshone plant, which is now nearly 120 years old, were to be bought and shut down. Located just east of Glenwood Springs, the plant has a maximum capacity of 15 megawatts, making it one of the smaller generation assets in Xcel’s portfolio.
But the “seniority” of the power station’s 1905 water right is a powerful tool in shaping regional water use — including how much of the Colorado River is siphoned off by Front Range water utilities through transbasin diversions. While the Colorado River District says its aim is to preserve the river’s historical status quo, utilities including Denver Water have voiced concerns about the effect the deal could have on their more junior water rights.
“Acquiring the Shoshone water rights for instream flow use is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to preserve and improve the natural environment of the Colorado River,” said Dan Gibbs, executive director of Colorado Department of Natural Resources. “But I also want to stress that the state is committed to ensuring that the historical use of the water rights is maintained at the status quo and we are committed to participating in any process to settle and resolve these issues for all water users.”
In addition to the go-ahead from the CWCB on Wednesday, the $99 million agreement between Xcel and the Colorado River District in 2023 is contingent on approval by a state water court and the Public Utilities Commission. The Shoshone Water Rights Coalition, made up of local governments supporting the deal, has secured $57 million in funding from its members and from the state, but it needs another $40 million from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which was included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
“Those funds remain under review by the current administration,” the Colorado River District said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, in a press release applauding the deal, called on the Trump administration to “heed the bipartisan, statewide support” and release the funding promptly.
“Thousands of Coloradans, our fish, and our wildlife depend on this water every day,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “This is another step toward finalizing a powerful tool for supporting competing demands — hydropower, environment, agriculture and recreation — while giving west slope water users more certainty about our future water security.”

Maura Healey’s desk, and what’s still on hold until 2026 now that the Legislature is done with major business for the year?","IT’LL BE A FEW more weeks until the icicle lights go up, but the holiday season has already begun atop Beacon Hill. 
Lawmakers on Wednesday concluded their final formal sessions for the year, kicking off a break of six weeks or longer. The House and Senate will continue to meet twice per week in that span, though those gatherings will be lightly attended informal sessions where only minor, uncontroversial business can be considered. 
All of the big stuff that did not get addressed before the final gavel rang out Wednesday night is now, essentially, on hold until 2026. 
So what happened with the legislation that was on the move this week? 
On the governor’s desk 
Other than half a dozen local bills or land transfers, the only significant measure to get all the way to Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday was a $2.3 billion spending bill needed to close the state’s financial books for the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
Lawmakers were, once again, late getting to the matter. State law technically requires the comptroller to file a financial report by October 31, which cannot happen until the Legislature and governor agree on a so-called closeout budget. 
For the sixth time in the past seven years, the final legislative action on the annual bill did not come until after the Halloween deadline. Comptroller William McNamara warned two weeks ago that the tardiness could prompt the federal government to “slow or withhold federal funds,” according to the State House News Service. 
Healey will get 10 days to review the measure, which injects more than $1.6 billion into MassHealth, all but $303 million of which is poised to be reimbursed by Washington, DC. 
Senate budget chief Michael Rodrigues said spending on the state’s Medicaid program — which could be upended in coming years by already-approved federal cuts — has been “growing exponentially.” 
“It’s growing much higher than predicted, much higher than the health care benchmarks that were established,” Rodrigues told reporters Monday. “That’s something that certainly has us concerned.” 
The bill also transfers $50 million toward rental housing support, provides another $12 million for free K-12 school meals, and makes $10 million in state funding available for the 2026 World Cup, as long as event organizers secure private matching dollars. 
Legislative negotiators settled on providing just $27 million for county sheriffs, withholding the majority of the funding law enforcement officials sought until after a proposed inspector general review of their spending habits. 
It’s not clear if Healey will agree with that approach or will instead push for the full appropriation she originally proposed. A Healey spokesperson said last month only that the governor would review whatever legislation she receives. 
The closeout budget has some notable policy riders, too, including language opening up access to some patient records at current and former state-run facilities and provisions decoupling vaccination schedules from the recommendations of a federal panel whose approach has created concerns among scientists. 
Approved in both chambers, but not yet to the governor 
After working through dozens of amendments, the Senate voted in favor of a major marijuana industry reform bill just after 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
The House already approved its own version of the bill back in June, and now Democrats in each chamber will need to reconcile differences between the measures before they can send a final version to Healey. 
Both bills would overhaul the Cannabis Control Commission, which has been marked by a series of controversies, and shrink its membership from five to three. They would also increase the number of cannabis licenses a single retailer could hold and boost the purchase and possession limit for recreational users. 
“This legislation is not about starting over,” Sen. Adam Gomez, who co-chairs the Legislature’s Cannabis Policy Committee, said Wednesday. “It’s about building on what we’ve learned. It’s about making sure that our laws keep pace with the current industry while protecting consumers, supporting small businesses, and advancing equity.” 
Lawmakers have not yet appointed a so-called conference committee of representatives and senators that would be tasked with ironing out a compromise version. They could do that next week, or legislative leaders could instead work more informally to come to an agreement on what to ship to the governor. 
Headed to DC 
Both branches were in alignment on action they say will protect the country from potential overreach by the Trump administration. 
Article V of the US Constitution allows constitutional amendments to be considered at a convention if two-thirds of state Legislatures request such a summit.  
Massachusetts previously transmitted requests for an Article V convention to Congress that technically remain pending, including one sent in 1977 seeking a constitutional ban on abortion, according to House Speaker Ron Mariano’s office. 
An Article V convention has never happened, but Democrats are concerned that leaving those resolutions in place could push the nation closer to the critical mass required for one, where President Donald Trump and Republicans could pursue sweeping changes to the Constitution. 
The House and Senate voted Wednesday to rescind all previous Article V resolutions adopted in Massachusetts, which legislative leaders say makes Massachusetts the 17th state to do so — putting the two-thirds majority out of reach for those who want a convention. 
“Without clear boundaries, an Article V convention could open the door to rewriting the very foundations of our democracy,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Alice Peisch. “It could jeopardize the principles that generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed to preserve.” 
The newly approved resolutions will now be transmitted to the clerk of the US House and the secretary of the US Senate.  
Through one branch, but not the other 
The Legislature operates on two-year cycles, and bills do not expire in between years one and two. So for legislative leaders in either chamber, the final flurry of activity was a chance to get a couple of priorities done and officially shift the onus to their counterparts across the hall. 
On Tuesday, the penultimate day for major business this year, the House approved a nearly $3.3 billion rewrite of Healey’s borrowing bill designed to fund campus infrastructure improvements at public colleges and universities. 
The House on Wednesday also advanced legislation aiming to rein in violence that health care professionals face at work by establishing new preventative standards and boosting reporting requirements. 
Neither measure has emerged yet in the Senate, which will almost certainly wait until the new year to act, if it does.  
Never came up  
For more than a week, it seemed like House Democrats would push for a vote on sweeping energy legislation that sought to rein in utility prices while also defanging the state’s 2030 decarbonization requirements. 
Rep. Mark Cusack, the architect of the dramatic rewrite to Healey’s energy affordability bill, said he hoped for a vote before the holiday break and that he had the backing of the speaker. 
But the proposal did not get to the House floor after all. Following immense blowback from environmental groups, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz — a top Mariano deputy — said his panel still has “a lot of work to do” before any bill on the topic is ready for action. 
“We are probably going to have to have to have a conversation at some point related to whether we can meet our goals for 2030,” Michlewitz said Monday. “I think that’s a real challenge that we’re facing, particularly when you have a federal government that is trying to thwart us at every possible turn in relation to trying to get to those goals. Having that conversation is certainly coming to a head at some point, but I do not think it will be in this vehicle as we move forward.”  
The retreat delays any action on Healey’s energy affordability until 2026.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6282-edited-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

This is the fourth large data center planned for Mississippi, with a combined $29 billion in investments. There are already two Amazon data centers being built in Madison County.  
With the current artificial-intelligence boom, companies are building data centers across the country. Many are being built in the Deep South because of its abundant land and water resources, less environmental regulations and relatively cheap energy for the power-hungry centers.
The center planned for Warren County will create at least 200 full-time jobs according to a statement from Amazon and Gov. Tate Reeves’ office. Reeves said it would be the largest private investment in Warren County’s history. Construction is expected to start in 2026.
Amazon also announced it would commit $150,000 to a new Amazon Warren County Community Program that will provide grants to local organizations.
While data centers promise jobs and tax revenue, critics have pointed out that they create very few jobs relative to the size of the investment and footprint. They have raised concerns over environmental impact, energy consumption and prices for consumers and lack of public transparency about their development or operations.

Its first round of recommendations largely involves what happens after they commit offenses, both minor and violent.
The committee met Tuesday to discuss proposals to send House Speaker Murrell Smith, a Sumter Republican who appointed the six-member panel. Most involve amending bills filed earlier this year that deal with violence and overcrowding at state-run juvenile jails.
The proposed changes to state law would reduce or eliminate time youth spend in detention centers before their case goes to trial, as well as push older, more violent teens into the adult justice system.

The committee took no votes. But committee members and staff will work with leaders at the state Department of Juvenile Justice over the next month to draft the language, Rep. Brandon Cox, the panel’s chairman, told the SC Daily Gazette.
The Goose Creek Republican said he’ll then work Smith’s office to pre-file the bills for the 2026 legislative session that begins in mid-January.
What they’re working on
Proposals include partially walking back South Carolina’s so-called “Raise the Age” law for 16-year-olds accused of violent offenses that carry a possible 30-year sentence and 17-year-olds accused of gun crimes. Instead of starting in the juvenile court system, as required since 2019, those youth would automatically be charged as adults.
Between July 2018 and June 2024, 166 16-year-olds accused of attempted murder and first-degree burglary were referred to the juvenile justice system. Of those, family court judges chose to transfer 58 to the adult system, according to data provided by the state Department of Juvenile Justice.
Following the agency’s advice, the legislative committee also wants to give family and circuit court judges more options when it comes to sentencing teens.
“Right now, we’re kind of stuck in our juvenile system,” the agency’s director, Eden Hendrick, told the legislators.
Youth younger than 18 who are convicted of murder can be sentenced to a juvenile facility for no more than 4½ years. But if they’re tried in Circuit Court as an adult, the sentence is 30 years to life, she said.

“There’s nothing in between that,” Hendrick said. “It doesn’t make any sense.”
“We know that youth are different than adults,” she added. “We should have some other options.”
There are also efforts that do away with, or at least lessen, any jail time for what are known as status offenses, such as skipping school or running away from home.
“Usually, when law enforcement’s called in the middle of the night, they have two options: detention or placing the youth in foster care,” Hendrick said. “And neither one of those are really appropriate.”
On Hendrick’s advice, the to-be-drafted legislation would also remove the possibility of pre-trial detention for juveniles charged with misdemeanors that carry sentences of 30 days or less. Such crimes include minor theft, property damage, and simple assault for a schoolyard fight.
Those are among the most frequent crimes committed by juveniles in the state over the past five years, according to data presented by State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel. In 2024, they accounted for more than half — 16,264 of the 28,128 offenses — committed by youth younger than 18.
Ideally, Hendrick said, the state would have safe places in each county to hold children until they can get before a judge. But that’s not the case, so she suggested allowing juveniles to stay home, possibly with ankle monitors, as long as they’re not a danger to the community.
The panel also wants to address sentences for children who violate probation.
More than 25K SC teens committed crimes last year. Legislators are looking for solutions.

How teens get guns
Of all the ideas discussed, only one involved guns.
It’s illegal for a teenager younger than 18 to buy or carry a gun under state law. Last year, more than 1,600 teens 17 and under were charged with illegally owning or carrying them. Most of those guns are stolen from locked vehicles, Keel testified.
Gun owners often are unwilling to report theft, either out of embarrassment or not knowing the specifics of their gun, such as the serial number, he told legislators.
The idea of penalizing adult gun owners who leave their vehicle unlocked, resulting in a stolen firearm, came up.
But only freshman Rep. Harriet Holman, R-Ridgeville, appeared willing to go there.
Holman said someone stole her husband’s gun out of his vehicle about six years ago. Because he filed a report, police ultimately located and returned it to him.
“So, if there’s some way that, when people’s firearms are stolen out of their vehicles, that they’ll report it — some incentive to tell them to report these firearms — would be very important,” said the retired Army lieutenant colonel. “That way we could have accountability on how many firearms are even out there loose like that.”
Gun owners are supposed to report theft. The so-called requirement was added to last year’s so-called “constitutional carry” law, which allows adults to carry a handgun — openly or concealed — without a permit. But there’s no penalty for not reporting, making it more of an encouragement.
That law also forbids law enforcement from stopping someone just because they see a gun. That means officers can’t stop a juvenile toting a gun for that alone because there’s no way to tell for certain whether someone’s 18 years old or 16 just by looking at them.
SC juvenile justice changeups add capacity to reduce overcrowding, violence

According to Cox, a U.S. Air Force veteran, South Carolina has a long history of not requiring citizens to report information about the guns they own to the government.
“This seems like a straightforward, common sense issue, but as the committee takes it up … we have to be very careful because of the constitutional implications,” he said.
Holman countered, “I just don’t personally see the harm of reporting something stolen from you.”
“I just think it is being responsible to allow the authorities to know that your weapon is out there and it could be being carried by a youth,” she said.
This is just the first round of legislation the panel plans to champion.
In January, the group will reconvene and attempt to come up with solutions to more complex issues that lead teens down violent paths, Cox said. That would likely include adding or expanding existing grant programs to fund community nonprofits focused on mentoring youth.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0905-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)In a split ruling that has far-reaching implications for child abuse cases, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Thursday barred prosecutors from blaming shaken baby syndrome for children’s unexplained head trauma in criminal and custody cases.
Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis, in a lengthy majority decision that five other justices joined, said the syndrome has not been generally accepted in the biomechanical community, making expert testimony about it unreliable and inadmissible in court. While child abuse is unquestionably reprehensible, the courts must ensure proceedings are fair to both defendants and their accusers, she wrote.
“Regardless of the severity or viciousness of a crime … only evidence that is sufficiently reliable and has probative value not outweighed by the evidence’s prejudicial effect may be presented to the jurors to inform their consideration of the charges against the accused,” she wrote. “That requirement extends to expert testimony, which must be properly admitted like all evidence.”
Senators propose new limits on lawsuits under NJ data privacy law

Thursday’s decision affirms lower court rulings that had declared shaken baby syndrome “junk science.”
Justice Rachel Wainer Apter penned a fiery and solo 44-page dissent that is sure to fuel the ongoing global debate about shaken baby syndrome, which is also known as abusive head trauma. She warned that “every other state” allows such testimony and “every other court that has considered the question” has upheld it as admissible.
It has been generally accepted in the medical community, Wainer Apter noted, citing endorsements by more than 20 professional medical organizations and a 2018 consensus statement by physicians and pediatric radiologists that the American Academy of Pediatrics backed.
The majority opinion places a handful of biomechanical engineers “on equal footing with the consensus perspective of every major medical society in the world and grants the former a veto over the latter. What’s more, it does so in a case about the admissibility of a medical diagnosis,” she wrote.

She added: “Judicial humility requires us to accept that we are judges, not scientists. Nor are we experts in the scientific method … In this case, recognizing that we are not scientists requires acknowledging that what the majority calls Shaken Baby Syndrome/Abusive Head Trauma (SBS/AHT), and what scientists simply call Abusive Head Trauma (AHT), is generally accepted by those who are.”
Scientific unanimity is not required for testimony to be valid, she added, citing a 1994 California appellate ruling.

In other cases where the New Jersey Supreme Court has deemed evidence scientifically deficient — including voiceprint analysis, claims that rapists share psychological traits, and height deductions based on a person’s shoe size — no major scientific association endorsed those claims, she added.

The courts should allow testimony on shaken baby syndrome and let jurors decide for themselves whether it’s scientifically sound, she wrote.
“Acknowledging a debate and granting a new trial to allow experts to dispute the merits of a particular medical diagnosis is entirely different from prohibiting a trial from taking place at all. The majority has chosen the latter,” she wrote.
 Widespread impact
Defense attorneys celebrated the ruling, saying it gives new grounds for appeal for countless people convicted in cases with no signs of impact, visible injuries, or other evidence of abuse.
A person’s liberty cannot depend on expert evidence that lacks scientific grounding, cross-disciplinary support, or methodological reliability, the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender said.
“The Constitution demands more than speculation dressed in scientific language. It requires reliable, validated, scientific evidence. And that’s what the court said,” said Danica Rue, the office’s executive director of investigations and police accountability. “I would certainly hope that people are able to now seek justice where it was not meted out earlier.”
Attorneys for the state had warned that prohibiting testimony about shaken baby syndrome in criminal cases would represent “a significant setback to public safety” and interfere with state child welfare workers’ ability to remove children from parents and guardians suspected of abuse. About 1,300 cases of shaken baby syndrome are reported in the U.S. every year, according to the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome.
Spokespeople for the state Attorney General’s Office, whose attorneys argued the case, declined to comment.
In the two unrelated cases decided by the court Thursday, authorities accused two fathers, Darryl Nieves and Michael Cifelli, of assaulting their children.
Nieves was charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a child after three incidents over a two-week period in February 2017, when his 11-month-old son became limp and appeared to lose consciousness. Cifelli was similarly charged after his 10-week-old son had to be hospitalized twice in December 2016 and January 2017 for vomiting and seizure-like behavior.
The babies, both born premature, were found to have the “triad of symptoms” typically associated with shaken baby syndrome — subdural hematomas, retinal hemorrhages, and encephalopathy, according to the ruling. But prosecutors in both cases couldn’t otherwise show the fathers assaulted the infants. The same Middlesex County pediatrician, Dr. Gladibel Medina, attributed both infants’ injuries to shaken baby syndrome.
The public defender’s office represented Nieves, who was barred from seeing his child for years while his prosecution and the appeals unfolded, Rue said.
“The impact that this decision will have on families in the state of New Jersey really cannot be overstated,” she said. “There are hundreds of people, perhaps more, who have been separated from their children, who have been criminally prosecuted and received felony convictions for this. There are people sitting in prison right now who have been convicted under this now debunked theory. So this is a tremendously important decision.”
The court’s majority said prosecutors should continue working to hold child abusers accountable — but must do so by showing physical evidence of trauma or other evidence of abuse.
Shaken baby syndrome could be considered in child abuse cases again someday “if new, reliable, scientific evidence is developed,” Pierre-Louis wrote.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker wants to codify higher standards for mental health and substance abuse treatment in prison after two audits found the state failed to properly monitor, medicate and treat many with severe mental illness. 
“I think everyone’s in agreement that we can do better,” Rep. Steve Eliason said Wednesday. 
 

 Suicide prevention resources

If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts or is in distress, call or text 988 to speak to crisis counselors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
More information and ways to connect are available at 988.utah.gov and 988lifeline.org. Counselors through the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline can help with mental health struggles, emotional distress, alcohol or drug use concerns, or if you just need someone to talk to.
There is no wrong reason to call.



Eliason, R-Sandy, said the prison already has to meet a general standard for medical care set by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. Now he wants it to hit higher thresholds from the same group that are specific to treatment. 
The pair of wide-ranging legislative audits found inmates who were deemed “acutely suicidal” weren’t constantly monitored in 2024 and 2025. Some managed to harm themselves and one person died in a suicide, auditors said.  
With help from an outside expert, psychiatrist Daniel Inouye, they also found examples of inmates getting the wrong drugs for their conditions, waiting months for an appointment, or being told to submit a request for care even though they were “out of touch with reality.” 
In response, the state Department of Corrections and the Division of Correctional Health Services said they’re putting together new policies, training and ways to review care, with plans to have some changes in place by next July and others by January 2027.   
Eliason said a majority of states contract with outside agencies for behavioral health services in prison, “which intuitively makes a lot of sense, because a lot of can be provided virtually, and they can rotate through different settings so they don’t maybe experience this high rate of burnout.”
His proposal is part of a bigger measure that would also help the state tap into more federal funding for certain prison health care and allow it to order treatment as a condition of parole, among other changes.
The bill would help cut down on repeat offenses and the need for more prison beds by helping to treat patients’ underlying issues, Eliason told lawmakers on the Health and Human Services Committee. 
The panel voted unanimously Wednesday to advance the bill to the full House for consideration during the 2026 Legislature, which convenes in January. 
“We know that it’s not a silver bullet,” said Rep. Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City. “But we’re definitely, I think, moving in the right direction.”
Audit: ‘Inmates are often abandoned’ by mental health care system in the Utah State Prison

The auditors focused on the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, which has designated housing for inmates with significant mental health needs. They said problems stemmed from a staffing shortage and a period of more than a year without a full-time psychiatrist, a delay the Division of Correctional Health Services attributed to challenges offering a competitive salary.
The prison now has a psychiatrist working 32 hours per week and making $134 per hour, along with two psychiatry fellows from the University of Utah assisting eight hours per week, said Josh Loftin, a spokesperson for the division.
The division asked lawmakers for a boost in funding last year but didn’t get it, Loftin said. It’s now finding ways to stretch its budget and be more efficient instead of requesting more.
The Department of Corrections’ former Draper location and current Gunnison site were already accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care when it comes to general health care, which includes mental health standards, Loftin said. But none of its sites have received stepped-up accreditations specific to mental health and substance abuse. 
The Salt Lake prison isn’t accredited right now because it had to reapply after moving from Draper in 2022. It is scheduled to be evaluated as part of the process next month, the soonest slot available because of pandemic delays, Loftin said.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis had recently said he was blocking a committee vote on the four Mississippi nominations over negotiations with Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi on the Lumbee people being officially recognized as a Native American tribe. Wicker is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has sway over legislation in which proponents wanted the Lumbee recognized.
The Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved Trump’s nominations of Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court, to vacant federal judgeships in northern Mississippi. The committee also voted to advance Scott Leary and Baxter Kruger, Trump’s choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively.

The nominations now advance to the full Senate.
The Lumbee is a group of indigenous people in North Carolina that has been seeking federal recognition as a tribe for over a century. But other federally recognized tribes have opposed this effort.
Language granting federal recognition of the tribe had been added to the House version of the Pentagon’s annual spending bill, but was not included in the Senate’s version, which Wicker oversees.
Earlier this month, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on the Lumbee Fairness Act, legislation now being pushed by Tillis and other North Carolina lawmakers. President Trump has also endorsed recognition of the Lumbee as a tribe.
In a recent press release Tillis said: “This issue has come before Congress many times over the decades, but never with this level of unity and support. These days, it’s rare to see Republicans and Democrats come together on anything. But when it comes to Lumbee recognition, the support is overwhelming and it’s bipartisan. We’re talking about support from President Donald J. Trump, President Biden, Vice President J.D. Vance, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Governor Josh Stein, the North Carolina General Assembly and nearly every member of our state’s congressional delegation. Here in the Senate, nearly two dozen members from both parties have co-sponsored the Lumbee Fairness Act…”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11144848/AP25197697979549.jpg,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

When a patient with dementia arrives at the hospital, the clinical priority is addressing the medical issue that brought them there. But for many, the experience of hospitalization can intensify confusion, anxiety, or agitation. At Beebe Healthcare, a new initiative is providing an unexpected source of comfort: baby dolls.
Beebe’s Doll Therapy Program, launched in January 2025, places realistic baby dolls into the arms of patients diagnosed with memory loss. Each patient receives a doll along with clothing, a blanket, and a bottle, all of which they are encouraged to keep after discharge. The dolls serve as a non-pharmacologic, person-centered intervention for dementia-related behaviors, and this has already shown strong and measurable results.
“The dolls provide patients with a sense of purpose and comfort. They feel like they need to take care of it, which shifts their thinking,” said Logan Jarrell, BSN, RN, NICHE (Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystems Elders) Coordinator at Beebe.
RELATED STORY: Senior Care: What Adult Caregivers Need to Know
For Jarrell, the program grows out of both research and personal experience. Before becoming NICHE coordinator, she worked as a bedside nurse and saw daily the gaps in diversional activities for older adults.
“I was working as a bedside nurse prior to this. My passion has always been the elderly. I saw first-hand how frustrating it was that we did not have diversional activities available on the unit,” Jarrell said. “So when a patient does start acting out or even just gets bored, we didn’t have anything to give them. We had volunteers going around with an activity card but they’re only there certain hours of day. This made things very difficult.”
Her inspiration for the idea goes back to her earliest experiences in care settings.
“I remembered back in nursery school, especially when we went to skilled nursing facilities that had memory care units, you would see a lot of older adults with baby dolls and stuffed animals and I thought it would be interesting if we could get that in a hospital,” she said.
Building the Program

The doll therapy initiative grew out of another project Jarrell launched six months earlier: Therapeutic Activity Kits. These kits, designed for dementia patients across Beebe, contain diversional activities and detailed instructions staff can use when patients show signs of distress or restlessness. While researching additional tools for the kits, Jarrell revisited doll therapy—an approach supported by evidence showing that dolls can reduce anxiety and provide a meaningful focus for people with dementia.
“In January 2025, I initiated the Doll Therapy Program at Beebe Healthcare as an extension of the Therapeutic Activity Kits initiative I began six months earlier,” she said. “The Therapeutic Activity Kits were developed to provide readily available diversional activities for dementia patients on the nursing units, ensuring staff had accessible tools and an accompanying instruction guide to identify appropriate activities for various situations.”
Jarrell said she recalled how dementia patients in care facilities responded positively to doll therapy during her nursing school clinical rotations, and wondered how it might work in an acute-care hospital setting.
Beebe partnered with Angie’s Purpose and received donor support through the Beebe Medical Foundation to launch the program. But getting it off the ground required navigating logistical hurdles.
“Implementing the program presented several challenges, including securing staff buy-in, identifying appropriate storage for the dolls, developing educational materials, and determining the best methods to adapt this intervention to an acute care hospital setting, where evidence and research are limited,” Jarrell said.
Still, she said, “the program has laid important groundwork for enhancing person-centered dementia care within the hospital environment.”
90 Patients, 89 Safety Successes
Since January 2025, the program has tracked 90 patients who received dolls. According to Jarrell, the impact has been striking.
“We’ve seen fantastic results since implementing this,” she said. “We started the program in January 2025 and to date we’ve had 85 patients throughout the whole hospital who have been given the dolls. Out of those patients, all but one did not have a physical workplace violent event, wasn’t placed in restraints, or didn’t have a fall for the rest of their hospitalization.”
A later update increased the number to 90 patients, with 89 remaining “incidence-free” after receiving a doll.
These numbers matter, Jarrell noted, because they speak directly to safety and patient well-being—two of the biggest challenges in caring for individuals with dementia in hospitals. She added that the program has also impacted internal culture.
“The program has also helped reshape the nurses’ way of thinking,” she said. “In the past, people felt it was easier to medicate the patient when you can actually just give them something to do.”
A Wider Educational Mission
Although Jarrell is the only NICHE coordinator, she has worked to ensure the program is accessible to all staff, regardless of department or shift.
She works very closely with case management team so they all have access to this resource guide that she’s created. “All Beebe employees have access to that: nurse managers, community health workers,” she said. “Although there is only one of me, I make these resources readily available so that when I’m not there, it can be utilized.”
Beebe’s intranet now houses more than 100 resources for senior care. Jarrell brings these materials to outpatient sites, health fairs, and community events, and said she is working toward a public version so families can access the information at home.
She said NICHE’s structure makes education a core component.
“NICHE is also an education program, so I have certified geriatric nurses throughout the hospital who are very well-aware of the resources so they know to advocate for these resources and diversional activities,” she said. “I also try to go to as many staff meetings as I can to educate. I try to get out there as much as I can and talk to as many people as possible to spread awareness.”
Challenges Seniors Face
Jarrell said one of the biggest barriers families encounter is acknowledging when a loved one needs help.
“A lot of people I work with struggle to admit they need help because they feel like it’s a sign of weakness when it’s really not,” she said.
She added that people don’t always know where to start or what resources exist. Patients entering the hospital are often dealing with an acute medical issue, not thinking about longer-term planning.
“That’s why I really try to harp on pre-planning,” she said, describing situations in which caregiving arrangements can change unexpectedly. Her goal is to make sure seniors and caregivers know what support is available before a crisis happens.
Family Response: “Overwhelmingly Positive”
For Jarrell, feedback is an essential part of the program. Staff record each use of doll therapy—what behaviors were present before, how the patient responded, and any additional observations. Jarrell also conducts rounds to witness the effects firsthand.
Families often witness the interventions and frequently share their perspectives.
“Families are often present and consistently share positive feedback,” she said. “Many express appreciation that the dolls are not solely for hospital use—the dolls are gifted to patients to keep after discharge, which helps maintain continuity of comfort and familiarity at home or in long-term care settings.”
All feedback is collected in a database, reviewed monthly, and shared with leadership teams.
“The ongoing feedback loop has been instrumental in refining the program and reinforcing staff engagement through visible, meaningful outcomes,” she said.
A Regional Ripple Effect
Beebe’s program is already inspiring others.
“Two of our post-acute facilities (Excelcare & Ocean Grove) have now signed on with the same doll therapy program,” Jarrell said. “One of them is even making a nursery for the baby dolls in their memory care unit.”
Christiana Hospital has expressed interest as well, and Bayhealth has reached out about learning from Beebe’s outcomes.
“It is incredibly rewarding to see this initiative extend its influence beyond our hospital walls,” she said. “Knowing that the program will soon bring comfort and meaningful engagement to residents across Sussex County reinforces the broader value of non-pharmacological, person-centered dementia care.”
Technology and Future Tools
While doll therapy may seem simple, Jarrell said technology could also play an expanding role in diversional activities.
“I do think AI and technology have the ability to help with this,” she said, noting that activity kits include a range of items families can purchase for loved ones—including tech-based tools.
“There are also projectors that project all kinds of different games on to the patient’s bedside table or wall or ceiling and they mimic the patient’s movements,” she said. “What’s great about this is you can use it over and over again.”
Beebe is also exploring dementia education simulations for nursing staff and interactive light-technology programs that promote cognitive stimulation and social interaction.
Looking Ahead
Jarrell hopes the next year brings continued growth—both in patient outcomes and community partnerships.
“Looking ahead, I hope to see Angie’s Purpose and the Doll Therapy Program implemented at Bayhealth and Christiana Care,” she said. She also wants more families to understand how meaningful diversional activities can be at home.
“Ultimately, my goal is to see our program numbers, patient outcomes, and staff and family feedback continue to grow positively, reflecting the sustained value and transformative impact of non-pharmacologic, person-centered dementia care.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_4202.jpg.webp,,,2025-11-20 14:57:45.761185

(Getty Images)DES MOINES — Two alleged whistleblowers are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co. and its affiliates for alleged racketeering, wrongful termination and concealment of information from state regulators.
The lawsuit alleges Farm Bureau officials repeatedly concealed from regulators in Iowa and other states instances of fraudulent activity committed by company agents or employees. The defendants’ conduct in the matter amounts to racketeering, obstruction of justice, and mail fraud or wire fraud, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit was filed by James Newton and Brent Meskimen, former police officers who later became special investigators for Farm Bureau. They are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co., FBL Financial Group, Farm Bureau Financial Services, and the West Des Moines law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Also named as defendants in the case are several Farm Bureau executives and attorneys.
The lawsuit claims Farm Bureau officials “engaged in a scheme to defraud insurance policyholders, insurance and other governmental regulatory authorities, and other participants in the insurance industry who are complying with their mandatory duty of reporting fraud and other fraudulent or other illegal acts.”
It also claims the defendants violated Iowa’s law on the wrongful discharge of employees in violation of public policy. That law prohibits the termination of employees for refusing to participate in illegal conduct or for acting as whistleblowers by reporting or objecting to illegal conduct.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Calls to Farm Bureau, Farm Bureau Financial Services and the law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann were not immediately returned Wednesday.
Break-in at policyholder’s residence
The lawsuit claims that as far back as 2011, Farm Bureau officials failed to report to state regulators evidence of fraudulent activity within the company, but the “straw that broke the camel’s back” was an insurance adjuster’s alleged break-in on a policyholder’s property.
According to the lawsuit, a residential fire occurred at the policyholder’s Nebraska residence on May 5, 2023, and the policyholder immediately filed a claim for losses.
In the course of investigating the claim, Farm Bureau’s Special Investigation Unit learned that an adjuster working for the company had used a credit card to pick the lock of the policyholder’s garage near the scene of the fire to determine whether it contained items the insured claimed as being lost in the fire, the lawsuit alleges.
Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Farm Bureau’s general counsel, Wickham, and advised him Farm Bureau had an obligation to inform the policyholder of the illegal access to their garage.
According to the lawsuit, the company’s assistant general counsel, Karl Olson, “eventually agreed” to allow Meskimen and Newton to meet with the policyholder and inform them of the illegal garage entry by the adjuster, but barred Meskimen and Newton from disclosing that two third-party vendors hired to investigate the claim had also been inside the garage.
The lawsuit claims Olson and Property Casualty Claims Vice President Anthony Kimmi then agreed that all “poisonous” documentation pertaining to the illegal entry, including photographs, should be placed in a separate file using a canceled insurance policy associated with a Minnesota policyholder who had no association at all with Nebraska fire.
After the new file was created for information about the garage, efforts were made to “lock down” the file to ensure limited access to its contents, and Kimmi directed the staff to suppress all printout capabilities from the file, the lawsuit alleges.
On June 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Wickham, the general counsel, at the Farm Bureau home office in West Des Moines and reported that they “could no longer in good conscience be associated with this file,” the lawsuit claims, telling Wickham “it was wrong ethically and that it violated state statutes, claims best practices, Farm Bureau core values, doing what’s right, and that it could very well be criminal and could potentially violate privacy rights.”
According to the lawsuit, Wickham responded by saying he’d speak to Farm Bureau leadership “to make sure this never happens again,” to which Meskimen allegedly said the directive to create the file “came straight from General Counsel Wickham’s own assistant general counsel, Olson.”
After Newton, Meskimen and the Special Investigations Unit concluded fraud had been committed by the company, the findings were allegedly relayed to Paul Swinton, a vice president and assistant general counsel of property and casualty at FBL Financial Group, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit claims Swinton refused to forward “the significant majority of the findings” to regulators in Iowa and Nebraska for their review and investigation, despite mandatory-reporting requirements.
Lawsuit: State regulators kept in the dark
According to the lawsuit, the 2023 incident was not the first time Swinton and Newton clashed over information that wasn’t being shared with state regulators.
“Newton and Meskimen were often and continually directed not to make mandatory referrals to the appropriate Departments of Insurance for review and investigation by the appropriate insurance regulators in states where FBL Financial Group was operating and conducting business, including Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico,” the lawsuit alleges.
Among the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit:

Forged signatures: In the spring of 2023, a Farm Bureau agent in Kansas admitted he had forged the signatures of approximately 50 of his policyholders, without their permission, over a period of three to four years, and that the forms contained false and misleading information to support of the clients’ insurance policy applications. Farm Bureau “refused to allow Newton and/or Meskimen to submit this admitted fraudulent conduct to the Kansas Department of Insurance,” the lawsuit alleges, despite a state law requiring such reporting.


Two fired agents: In 2022, Swinton refused to share information with regulators about two fired Farm Bureau agents. In one of the two cases, a Kansas agent admitted to having forged at least 900 various documents with clients’ signatures, allegedly with the clients’ consent, and another 100 documents without the clients’ consent. Swinton allegedly refused to share information with regulators about the two firings. The lawsuit claims that after Newton wrote in an annual report that he had concerns with such matters going unreported, Wickham “was furious” and instructed him to never put anything in writing like that again.


Fraudulent claim: In 2023, after a Farm Bureau agent was fired for filing a fraudulent claim on his own home in Utah, Swinton or others within the company refused to allow Newton and Meskimen to submit information on the agent’s conduct to the Utah Department of Insurance, despite a state law requiring such a referral.


Father’s altered policy: In 2018, the company’s Special Investigations Unit determined an Iowa agent had altered a customer’s policy after a fire so that the policy included a Ford Mustang that was consumed in the blaze. The customer was the agent’s father and a retired Farm Bureau agent. The lawsuit claims Swinton barred the unit from referring the incident to the Iowa Department of Insurance.

Newton and Meskimen are fired
The lawsuit alleges that while the unreported instances of fraudulent activity date back to 2011, it was the May 2023 garage break-in that “the tipping point for Newton and Meskimen.”
The lawsuit alleges that on Aug. 30, 2023, Newton had an in-person meeting with Wickham and insisted the information related to that case needed to be referred to the Nebraska Department of Insurance. “Wickham responded by telling Newton that if he made that referral his career would be over,” the lawsuit claims.
On Nov. 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Karen Rieck, the vice president of human resources for Farm Bureau Financial Services, and voiced their concerns about the lack of referrals to state regulators.
A week later, Newton received a phone call from Wickham and Rieck, in which Wickham said Newton had “essentially resigned” by refusing to report directly to Swinton. The lawsuit alleges Newton indicated he had no problem reporting to Swinton but that if Swinton was not going to make the mandatory referrals related to fraud, he would do so himself.
“As a result, Newton was fired,” the lawsuit claims. Meskimen was allegedly fired five days later after telling his superiors that he, too, would make such referrals if they were required by law.
The lawsuit claims that shortly before the two men were fired they each were given positive performance reviews, with Newton described by his superiors as “one of the most well-respected employees in the organization” and Meskimen described as a trusted leader whose “integrity is beyond reproach.”
In addition to Swinton, Olson, Kimmi and Wickham, the named defendants in the lawsuit include Daniel Pitcher, chief executive officer of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services, and Ronald Mead Jr., the chief operating officer for property casualty of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services.

(Photo courtesy of Central College)Central College is using a more than $700,000 donation from the Fred Maytag Family Foundation for facility renovations and new offerings aimed at supporting students and bringing campus and community closer together.
The Pella private university announced this week in a news release it received a $720,000 gift from the foundation this summer. Hilary Rowe, Central College director of marketing and communications, said in an email $50,000 has gone to the Journey Scholarship Fund, with the rest funding renovations to the building sharing the foundation’s namesake — the Maytag Student Center.
Rowe said in her email the foundation has supported Central for nearly a century, funding a full tuition scholarship and other financial aid, STEM initiatives and and other capital projects.

“Central has a very special relationship with the Maytag family,” Central College President Mark Putnam said in the release. “They still feel a strong sense of connection to Iowa and Central. Ken and Fritz Maytag have been committed to this building. Their values align closely with ours — with what Central wants to achieve in the world and who we are in the world.”
Much of the renovation work funded by the donation has already been completed, Rowe said in her email, with new amenities now available for students. The Maytag Student Center now houses the Maytag Marketplace, which includes a redesigned food and convenience store, the university’s Spirit Shoppe, temporary vendor spaces and areas for “public engagement.”
Putnam said in the release new technology will be added to certain rooms in the student center in the future through the donation, and lounge spaces will receive new finishes, seating and carpeting.
Iwan Williams, Central College executive director of retail management, said in the release the university used a student survey to learn what they would buy from a campus store if one was available, and from those responses, a “convenience store model” was developed. Now students can buy hot food, various beverages and more from the space in addition to grab-and-go food.
The marketplace’s new “pop-up vendor window” brings in local businesses to sell wares on campus, Williams said in the release, and has already seen success from Top Shelf Nutrition, which recently utilized the space.
As the marketplace is open to the public, Williams said in the release he expects groups like summer camps held on campus, as well as members of the community, to benefit from it. The space also fits into the college’s “Imagine More: It’s Central to Pella” initiative, which seeks to bring campus and community closer together through strategic partnerships and projects, both off and on campus.
“We’re drawing in local and specialty businesses that appeal to students and employees,” Williams said in the release. “It’s a manifestation of the Imagine More concept created here in the Maytag Marketplace. What we see right now is just the beginning.”

A state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation official said during the Oct. 23 […],"Fire information for the Windy Rock fire is displayed near the Jens exit of I-90 on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025. (Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana’s 2025 fire season is expected to be pricey — between $50 and $70 million — driven largely by a complicated wildfire near Drummond earlier this year that’ll likely come out to be the most expensive suppression effort in state history.
A state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation official said during the Oct. 23 Environmental Quality Council meeting that 2,303 fires burned 75,000 acres in Montana this year. 
This was one of the lowest acreages burned in state history, which Gov. Greg Gianforte has repeatedly pointed to and praised DNRC for its work. 
DNRC’s fire management manual says that under state law, the department is required to perform aggressive initial attack on all fires and keep them “as small as possible.”
“Under Montana Code Annotated 76-13-104, the DNRC has the responsibility to protect land, property and natural resources within the state,” the agency said to the Daily Montanan. “The department places the utmost importance on the lives of firefighters and the public and will not intentionally jeopardize safety in pursuit of fire suppression responsibilities.”
The steep costs of the fire season coupled with the sparse acres that burned have raised questions about the state’s approach to wildfires. The Gianforte Administration has focused on suppression, calling their methods, “a model of proactive planning and decisive action.” Legislators are drilling down on wildfire as part of a state study on suppression, as new research shows forests might not actually be as dense as once thought, directly contradicting a large swath of American fire policy.
The huge cost and relatively low acreage was discussed during a meeting of the Environmental Quality Council last month, as the state is studying fire suppression costs.
Fire mitigation, the practice of reducing risk of catastrophic wildfires, is one way state and federal legislators are looking at trying to solve the problem.
But some mitigation practices — including logging, thinning and prescribed fires — are controversial to some environmentalists and there is vast disagreement within those circles about what, if anything, should be done to the nation’s forests.
Legislators heard testimony on suppression efforts and smoke impacts of prescribed burns during the meeting, which comes under the backdrop of massive federal changes surrounding wildfires.
The Fix Our Forest Act, recently proposed federal legislation from Montana U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, has been a touchpoint for some environmental groups, saying that so-called thinning operations, a tool fire managers use to reduce fuel loads in forests, is opening the door to major logging projects in national forests. Sheehy himself is connected to the wildfire fighting industry, having founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting company.
Those same environmental groups, as well as a California author and research ecologist studying the issue, also say the way prescribed burns and thinning operations are being conducted does not follow historical wildfire patterns, saying specifically that the idea that huge swathes of the country’s forests are too dense is fundamentally incorrect.
The state and federal government work closely together on wildfires, as about 30% of Montana’s land is federally owned. This also complicates who pays for what, as Montana receives reimbursements for wildfire expenditures, but it does not cover the whole bill.
Legislators passed a slew of wildfire-related bills during the last session, including House Bill 70, a study into state fire suppression, which is driving conversations on the topic and is expected to be picked back up again in January.
“It’s really difficult to totally criticize,” Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula, vice-chair of EQC told the Daily Montanan of the effort on Windy Rock. “But on the other hand I think some serious questions need to be asked.” 
Gov. Greg Gianforte receives a brief from fire officials at the Windy Rock fire near Drummond, Montana, on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025.
‘A policy of aggressive attack’
The most expensive wildfire this season, the Windy Rock Fire, located about 17 miles from Drummond, still had people assigned to it in October, after being initially reported in late August.
The total cost to suppress the fire was about $56 million, though a DNRC spokesperson told the Daily Montanan that number is subject to change. The fire started on August 14 and burned 6,175 acres.
“It’s really important to note that the figure we provide may change and does not include the (Fire Management Assistance Grants). Finalized numbers for fire costs and FMAGs can take months and sometimes even years,” DNRC spokesperson Moria Davin wrote in an email.
The grants come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been in chaos since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. 
Likely, though, it’ll be among the most expensive suppression efforts in state history. Montana’s 10-year annual average for firefighting costs is about $30 million, said Wyatt Frampton, a DNRC official addressing the committee. There are no solid numbers yet on actual expenses, which also makes this year an outlier, Frampton said.
“Given prolonged staffing that we had into October and some ongoing significant expenses associated with special activities, we don’t have a firm resolution for you yet on those final estimates for fire season cost,” Frampton told the committee.
The Windy Rock Fire originated on Bureau of Land Management land and the state responded with its county assist team. Montana and the BLM have an agreement over fire “offset” protection in that area, Frampton explained.
“There are exchanges of protection,” Frampton told the committee. “There’s areas where the Forest Service protects Forest Service or BLM protects private property, and likewise, the state will protect federal lands to try to have a net balance between the agencies.”
The fire also became complicated almost immediately and it burned in rocky and steep terrain, which complicated efforts. It threatened about 175 residences as well, Frampton said. And beyond that, there were other problems, too.
“Dead and down fuels from a past Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak pose additional challenges,” an Aug. 16 press release from the fire states. “The Windy Rock Fire is located near a Wilderness Study Area and a Backcountry Conservation Area, requiring fire operations to take special considerations for these landscapes.”
The fire became something of a spectacle, in part drawing massive air tankers to Helena Regional Airport that performed sorties on the fire for a week in late August. Firefighters on a Sanders County fire noted getting air resources as “challenging” due to “escalating demands” in the region on Aug. 22.
When incidents get larger or more complicated than local or state resources can handle, special teams are called — in this case, Northwest Team 2.
The day they took command from the state, Aug. 25, Gov. Greg Gianforte visited and toured the fire’s command post saying that day, “we’ve pursued a policy of aggressive attack on all fires.”
And the state did — per reporting by Substack and podcast, The Hotshot Wakeup on Aug. 25, the amount of fire retardant Montana used increased from 400,000 gallons to more than 1 million gallons in a week around the time those tankers were operating out of Helena.
Beyond the cost, many environmental groups have serious concerns with fire retardant, which contains high levels of toxic metals. The effectiveness of aerial attack on a fire is greatly debated and aircraft are not effective and often grounded in windy conditions.
Former legislator Jim Keane, a member of the Environmental Quality Council, asked questions to state staff regarding the cost of aerial attack versus ground efforts. 
“There has to be an astronomical amount of aviation assets that went into this fire year on a minimum amount of acres,” Keane said during the meeting.
The Trump Administration has pushed for more money and equipment for firefighters, with some focus on aerial firefighting. In fact, Sen. Sheehy was a cosponsor on bipartisan legislation earlier this year that made it easier for private contractors to acquire airplane parts for the nation’s firefighting fleet.
This fire season is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history, though stats available through the National Interagency Fire Center, which tracks fire acreage and cost, are not adjusted for inflation, the agency has previously told the Daily Montanan.
But it’s a flawed assumption that fires can be put out, said Chad Hanson, a research ecologist, an author and the co-founder of the John Muir project, calling into question the amount state and federal governments spend on suppression.
He went on to say that studies by the U.S. Forest Service regarding forest density are flawed, saying money currently being spent on suppression and many fire mitigation practices would be better spent on hardening homes against fire.
“Pretty much everything that we’ve been told about fire in our forests is incorrect, scientifically,” Hanson said. “And it’s not just some loose theory.”

‘A wink and a nod’
Hanson and several fellow researchers have authored studies in response to research from the U.S. Forest Service regarding density in forests.
The density question is fundamentally a disagreement over forestry practices. The general idea among those in support of logging and thinning to reduce fire risk is that suppression practices on wildfires in the United States have led to forests that are too dense. They say there used to be many small intensity fires in the nation’s forests and that thinning and prescribed burns will replicate this natural process.
It’s a focus of a Sen. Sheehy bill — the Fix Our Forest Act — currently moving through Congress. The bill would also make it easier for land management agencies to conduct thinning and prescribed burn operations. In practice, prescribed burns often cut down small trees and brush, which is known as mechanical thinning, which are then put into small piles and burned. 
And Hanson says that the assumption all American forests had frequent, low-intensity fires is fundamentally incorrect and that federal research left out information contrary to that.
“They omitted and didn’t mention massive amounts of data that showed that historical forests were really variable,” Hanson said. “There were open forests, for sure, but there were also a lot of really, really dense forests, a lot of forests in between. This really simplistic notion that the forests were all open and park-like at low density, is not even remotely accurate based on the science and that’s not a contested notion.”
That’s not to say Hanson is against prescribed burns — there’s places where it could help, he said — but he does think the forests are closer to their natural density than some federal studies would suggest. Hanson and other researchers, including William L. Baker, a University of Wyoming professor, wrote a peer-reviewed review of a federal study called “Evidence for widespread changes in the structure, composition, and fire regimes of western North American forests.”
The Baker paper found most evidence was omitted in the federal study was information that, “does not support their low-severity model, including 10 published rebuttals of their papers.”
The federal study included logging interests, the Missoula Fire Science Laboratory and Environmental and Forestry Departments from major state schools across the west, including the University of Washington, UC Berkeley, Northern Arizona, Penn State, Utah State, Oregon State, and Arizona. It also included the Nature Conservancy, as well as various state and federal land management agencies.
Many of those researchers get money from the U.S. Forest Service, Hanson said, which has priorities of its own.
“Under Federal laws, the Forest Service can sell trees on public lands to private logging companies and keep most of the revenue generated from those timber sales for its own budget, using the money to pay staff and buy new equipment,” Hanson writes in his 2021 book, Smokescreen. “This creates a powerful perverse financial incentive for Forest Service staff to ignore wildlife and recreational impacts and emphasize industrial logging.”
It’s important to note, Hanson said, that the Forest Service is in charge of managing the nation’s forests, not necessarily protecting trees.
“We’ll do all these logging operations, we’ll call it thinning and fuel reduction, with a wink and a nod, and it will tell communities it’ll stop the fire from reaching the towns,” Hanson said. “And that is a dangerous lie, because that’s not what’s happening. The fires are blowing right through those thin areas.”
It’s the same logic the Fix Our Forest Act is based on, Hanson said, which is why it’s drawn criticism from some environmental groups like the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and EarthJustice.
“Prescribed fire doing preventing stand replacement fire is immediate massive loss of wildlife habitat,” said Sara Johnson, an environmental advocate who founded Native Ecosystems Council. “It prevents stand replacement fire, which is a huge benefit to wildlife.”
‘Active forest management’
In 2020, the Montana Forest Action Plan, a report commissioned under then-Governor Steve Bullock found 3.8 million acres of Montana’s forests “in greatest need of attention” 
U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough — and Gianforte, the state’s current Governor, is a noted supporter of the logging industry as well.
“Montana’s forest products industry has an important and necessary role in achieving landscape-scale forest restoration and management across the state,” the report states.
Less than 100,000 acres per year were being treated in Montana in 2020, according to the report. That number appears to have increased — earlier this year, the Forest Service said they conducted hazardous fuels reduction work on 200,000 acres of Montana forest in 2024. The BLM conducted approximately 38,000 acres of prescribed burns last year.
“Active forest management, such as mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, is one of the most important tools to reduce the risk and severity of wildfire alongside a robust community preparedness strategy,” the report reads. “This approach is especially important in the low-elevation fuel types where past fire suppression has had the greatest impact in terms of in- creased fuel loading.”
A separate 2020 report commissioned by the DNRC found that 85% of the state’s forests are at an increased risk of wildfire. According to the agency, historical Montana fires  were characterized by frequent, low-intensity fire that mostly burned surface fuels without killing mature trees. 
This also occasionally included moderate or higher severity fire, agency spokesperson Anna Lau wrote in an email. Lau went on to say that the state’s low- to mid-elevation forests, which are mostly ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, fires would typically occur every 5 to 30 years. That maintained open forest structures and created variability in the forest, Lau wrote.
“It’s important to recognize that high-intensity, stand-replacing fires play a natural and necessary role in certain ecosystems particularly at higher elevations, such as subalpine fir and lodgepole pine forests,” Lau wrote. “These forests have evolved with infrequent but severe fires that reset ecological succession.”
The DNRC does prescribed burns as well and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality has a call every day in the fall with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss the day’s burn requests.
Smoke from prescribed burns is a concern and EQC members heard from one woman who described significant smoke impacts. Logging has no smoke impacts, which EQC chair Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompson Falls, brought up.
“There’s different options for managing forests,” Fielder said. “You can do prescribed burns, or you can do thinning and other methods of reducing the fuel loads there. And as long as we just say prescribed burns are the best way to go without looking at other options. I think we’re not considering the health effects of this.”
A 2025 Stanford study showed prescribed burns “can meaningfully reduce smoke emissions,” from wildfires. And the DEQ has multiple factors it considers in those decisions.
“Burn decisions are determined based on how efficiently the smoke is going to exit the community,” DEQ meteorologist Aaron Ofseyer said in a statement. “A critical metric for determining this is the ventilation index. This index is calculated by multiplying the mixing height and the transport wind. The higher the index, the more likely the DEQ is to approve a burn.”
For those deeply involved with the work, like Tim Rochell, a prescribed fire expert with Missoula County, there’s been movement in public perception of the issue. 
“What we’re doing right now is we’re changing a culture like people have been taught to be afraid of fire, as opposed to something that’s a natural part of our landscape,” Rochell said. “And I think we’re slowly starting to change that.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WindyRock2-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-20 13:57:30.106139

Emmer, a Minnesota Republican who serves as one of the top party leaders in the U.S. House, endorsed Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District and former state legislator Joe Mitchell in the 2nd District.
Both candidates are running in open primary fields for the congressional seats as the current GOP representatives are running for other offices. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, in Iowa’s 4th District, is running for governor and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson in the 2nd District is running for U.S. Senate.

McGowan and Mitchell were the top fundraisers in their respective races during the most recent campaign finance reporting period.
While Washington, D.C., party leadership often issues early support for incumbent candidates and criticizes opponents from other parties, endorsements are less common during the primary campaign season. In the 4th District, McGowan is competing against several other well-known GOP candidates, including former House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl, Ryan Rhodes, the founder of the Iowa Tea Party, as well as Christian Schlaefer, a software consultant.
Emmer said in a statement, “Chris McGowan is exactly the kind of battle-tested conservative we need in Congress.”
“As a veteran, business leader, and devoted family man, he embodies the values of faith, family, and freedom that define Iowa’s 4th District,” Emmer said. “Chris will be a strong voice for the America First agenda, a reliable partner in the House Republican Conference, and a leader who will deliver real results for Iowa.”
McGowan thanked Emmer for his support, saying the congressman  “understands what it takes to win tough races and to govern with strength.” If elected, McGowan said he would focus on enacting President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies by “bringing Iowa values of faith, family, freedom, and grit to Washington to fight for the America First agenda.”
Emmer also endorsed Mitchell in the 2nd District, as he runs for the Republican nomination against state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta. Mitchell, a former regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Trump’s administration and the founder of Run Gen Z, a young conservative organization, said Emmer’s endorsement is a “a strong sign of the momentum we’re building.”
Emmer said electing Mitchell in 2026 is a vital part of keeping Republicans in control of Congress.
“If House Republicans are going to stay in the majority and continue delivering for the American people, it is vital we send bold conservative candidates like Joe Mitchell in Congress,” Emmer wrote in a social media post. “Radical Democrats will stop at nothing to return to power and revive Biden’s reckless policies. Iowans can’t let this happen, which is why they’re going to send Joe Mitchell to Washington so we can continue to Make America GREAT again!”
Emmer also traveled to Iowa in October to support U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks at a fundraiser, as she runs for reelection in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District. At the event, he told the crowd Miller-Meeks’ winning in 2026 “means we’re winning everything that you’re fighting for in Iowa” and would be an important step in keeping the GOP majority in the House. Iowa’s 1st District is projected to be one of the most competitive races in the 2026 election, with political forecasters rating the district as a “toss-up.”

Spencer Deery and Dan Dernulc were the latest victims of attempted swattings as early redistricting supporters turn up the heat on opponents and undecided lawmakers. (Photos courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)As redistricting rhetoric intensifies in Indiana, three Republican lawmakers who oppose the prospect — or are undecided —  have reported attempted swatting attacks on their homes.
“It is disturbing that anyone would attempt to harm or intimidate lawmakers, but sadly not all that surprising in the current environment,” Sen. Spencer Deery, said Thursday, after police “thwarted” an attempt at his West Lafayette residence.
“Swatting” involves hoax calls or reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — and can have lethal consequences for unwitting victims at the swatted location.
Redistricting rift growing among Indiana Republicans

Deery, a vocal opponent of early congressional redistricting, was notified about 8 a.m. Thursday that police dispatch had received a report of domestic abuse at his address. It included a threat of violence to officers who responded.
“I am grateful to the West Lafayette Police Department for their professionalism and preparedness to recognize this as a swatting attempt,” Deery said, noting it was resolved without endangering his children or others in the neighborhood boarding buses to school.
He assured constituents, “We will continue to do our duty and to do what is in the best interest of our district, no matter the threats.”
Deery’s not the only one facing threats in the frenzy for early maps. Redistricting is traditionally done every 10 years, after the census.
Republican supermajorities drew the current congressional boundaries in 2021, maintaining a 7-2 GOP majority. Two blue districts cover northwest Indiana and Indianapolis. President Donald Trump and his supporters want Indiana to produce a 9-0 map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as part of his push to keep GOP control over the U.S. House.
Trump has ratcheted up the pressure, telling Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday that he “must produce” on redistricting. That day, Braun proclaimed he’d find ways to “compel” recalcitrant senators to obey his special session call after they voted to ignore it and adjourn.
Thursday’s attempt on Deery came a day after Sen. Dan Dernulc reported a foiled swatting attempt on his home in Highland.

“Local law enforcement officials were quick to analyze it, recognize the report was false and inform me of the attempt,” Dernulc said in a Wednesday statement.
He hasn’t yet made a decision on redistricting, telling the Capital Chronicle earlier this week it’s “because I haven’t even seen a map.”
“Until I see something, I don’t want it being like (Democratic former U.S. House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi, where they say you have to vote for something and then find out,” Dernulc said at the time.
Later, he called Wednesday’s attempt “scary and shocking.”
“I have always done my best to serve my community, be their voice, and work … to help make Indiana a great state,” Dernulc’s statement continued. “It is sad because of these efforts and work that I am villainized in some minds to the point of harmful retaliation. Threats to public officials cannot and should not be the norm. I hope to see justice for this illegal behavior.”
Another undecided Republican colleague, Sen. Greg Goode, reported a swatting attempt on his Terre Haute residence Sunday. It came hours after Trump called him out by name as a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” in a post to Truth Social.

Braun denounced the attempts as “absolutely terrible” on Thursday, telling reporters, “That’s way beyond the pale. Unacceptable. … All I’m saying as governor, leader of the state: stop it.”
Asked if he thought aggressive rhetoric had contributed, Braun responded that there’s “rhetoric on a lot of issues.” He said it “boils down to personal responsibility not to do something stupid.”
Deery also slammed an unpaid pizza delivery to his home this week, which he framed as a more subtle attempt at intimidation.
“This may seem like a harmless prank, and it certainly isn’t as serious as a swatting, but it still is an attempt to intimidate an elected official by conveying ‘we know where you live,'” Deery said. “Even this less serious tactic should be condemned and never normalized.”

It’s the game in which a tower’s blocks are removed until the absence of one causes the entire structure to collapse.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that consequential piece in the health insurance game, and very shaky, unsteady Republicans are messing with it.
To insert another board game, it’s like the GOP is remaking “The Game of Life,” which simulates the journey through adulthood, college, career, marriage, children, retirement, all the things. Of course, bad journeys on board games are overcome by reshuffling a deck of cards and giving another twirl to the doohickie that spins to indicate how many spaces to advance on the board.
In real life, though, do-overs aren’t so clean.
Sure, federal employees have been unshackled, no longer forced to work without pay after Democrats caved and created a crooked path for Republicans to reopen the government. But plenty of those federal workers had to work side jobs in the interim. The 43-day federal shutdown forced folks living a paycheck-to-paycheck existence to exchange that for a more extreme checking account-to-reserve funds lifestyle.
Unlike board games, real people are the pawns in the game of life. The unpaid federal workers playing catch-up are real people. Folks getting over the trauma of facing hunger because they couldn’t buy groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are real people — all 42 million of them.
The 24 million individuals receiving health insurance through ACA marketplaces? They’re real people. Based on what they saw when open enrollment began Nov. 1, some are considering cancelling coverage and foregoing mental health care, colonoscopies, all of the necessary things to which the politicians who denied them remained privy.
“That scenario is wrong in so many ways,” said Advance Carolina policy director Jovita Lee, Ed.D. “Throughout the shutdown, members of Congress kept getting paid, never had to contemplate losing health insurance. It was a different story for their constituents. So what we have are politicians not only using gerrymandering to pick their voters but also making those voters do free work at airports so they could fly home after leaving work early and unfinished in D.C.”
Air traffic controllers were among the federal workers forced to work without pay during the shutdown.
Most Democrats in Congress voted against the continuing resolution that ultimately reopened the government. They refused to say yes without Republicans agreeing to extend the subsidies that have made ACA marketplace insurance more affordable. Without the subsidies, people are poised to pay hundreds of dollars more per month for health insurance premiums.
Even if you don’t get insurance through an ACA marketplace, you’re still prone to paying more for health care. You see, like Jenga, health care is a collective thing. As rumblings permeate about people pulling out of ACA marketplaces because they can’t afford coverage, leaders at insurance companies will hear that and raise costs to compensate for folks getting sicker because they stopped going to see their doctors. Somebody has to pay to offset the price differential in order to keep the health care system propped up. That would be you. Ask your provider.
Even better — ask your Congress member. And get them to explain how the resolution that reopened the government is temporary, so another impasse is likely, another shutdown, possibly in January.
Tell that Congress member to admit that the overarching issue with all of this is the health insurance system wholly needing an overhaul to make premiums realistic again.
It’s enough to make you wonder whether elected officials are taking away necessities just to get people worn down and so focused on survival that they disengage politically. The tiresome antics are wearying, for sure, their fanciful board games, as it were.
Bored games, really.

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040. (Photo/Sarah Leach)As the Department of Energy issues a third order prolonging operations for a coal plant in west Michigan slated to close in June, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has requested a stay on the extension. 
On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request with the department arguing its justification for another extension was based on outdated assessments of the Midwestern grid operator, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, of its energy reserves heading into the winter. 
The initial order, which extended operations at the J.H. Campbell coal plant from its planned closure on June 1 until August 21, initially argued the plant’s resources were needed to prevent blackouts at homes and businesses amid high demand over the summer, despite projections from the grid operator which determined it would have enough resources to meet demand from consumers. 
The department’s latest order, issued Tuesday, extends operations until February 17, 2026. Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that while the North American Electric Reliability Corporation had yet to issue its reliability assessment for winter 2025-2026, assessments from the previous two years had presented concerns on whether Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s energy reserves would be sufficient in “above-normal conditions.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the 2025-2026 assessment was released hours before the order was issued, with Nessel arguing its contents completely negate Wright’s arguments justifying an extension. 

While the assessment found multiple regions in the U.S. could have insufficient energy to support its customers amid extreme weather, MISO was listed at a “normal risk,” meaning that its resources will be sufficient to meet operating reserves under normal and extreme peak demand and outage scenarios.
The assessment also notes that this year’s risk scenario for the grid operator should not be compared to last year’s as there have been changes to the assessment methods
“[The Department of Energy] is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a statement. “[The department] must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”
According to the plant’s owner Consumers Energy, keeping the plant operating has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day. The company was able to recoup $84 in separate costs by selling energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Republish photo only with original story.)Ohio lawmakers passed a bill early Thursday morning that would ban intoxicating hemp products and make changes to the state’s marijuana laws. 
The Ohio House voted 52-34 to pass Ohio Senate Bill 56, sending it to the Senate. 
Ohio Republicans Thaddeus Claggett, Levi Dean, Brian Lorenz, Jason Stephens, D.J. Swearingen, and Michelle Teska joined Ohio Democrats in voting against the bill around 1 a.m. Thursday morning.
The House vote took place after the bill was originally scheduled to go to conference committee Wednesday morning, but the meeting did not happen until just before midnight Wednesday.
Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, offered about a dozen amendments during the conference committee, but none of them were adopted.
The Ohio Senate has an if-needed session scheduled for Dec. 10 and Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said he is confident the Senate will pass the bill.

The Republican lawmakers on the conference committee said a lot of accommodations had to be made. 
“We were so close that things came together and we did not want to walk away being so close with where we’re at,” said Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City. “I think we came to a good compromise.” 
Huffman introduced the bill in January and the Senate originally passed the bill in February, but the House made major changes, most notably by adding intoxicating hemp regulations. 
The Ohio House passed Ohio S.B. 56 in October with a bipartisan vote and the Ohio Senate voted unanimously one week later not to concur with changes made to the bill, sending it to conference committee. 
After the bill was sent to conference committee at the end of October, changes were made to hemp at the federal level.
Congress recently voted to ban products that contain 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container earlier this month when they voted to reopen the government. 
Previously, the 2018 Farm Bill said hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
There is a one-year implementation delay for the federal hemp ban, but states can create their own regulatory framework before then. 
“On the hemp side, what the the federal government did certainly influenced what we needed to do,” Huffman said.

Ohio’s bill complies with recent federal changes by banning intoxicating hemp products from being sold outside of a licensed marijuana dispensary.  
“When it comes to intoxicating hemp products, we essentially cut to the chase,” said Ohio Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville. 
“We had already whittled down most retailers where those could be sold. That is going to kick in. They’re going to have the 90 days of runway that’s in the bill. After that, all those products are either going to be sold in a marijuana dispensary or they won’t be allowed to be sold.”
If the Ohio Senate passes Ohio S.B. 56 in December and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signs the bill into law before the new year, Ohio’s intoxicating hemp could take effect as soon as March.
Ohio S.B. 56 allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. 
“There’s aspirational language in here that the legislative leaders have agreed on that says, if the federal government takes action and makes (THC beverages) legal again, that it’s our intent that we would come back and have legislation to create a structure and have legal THC beverages again,” Stewart said. 
On Oct. 8, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that started on Oct.14, but a Franklin County Court of Common judge has placed a temporary restraining order on DeWine’s ban until Dec. 2.  
On the marijuana side, the bill would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Ohio S.B. 56 would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries. The bill also maintains the 10% tax rate on recreational marijuana and keeps home grow the same at six plants per adult and 12 per residence. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment, something they have been trying to do since late 2023. 
“(Ohio S.B. 56) fundamentally undermines the will of the voter and what they said that they wanted,” said State Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake. “They told us at the ballot box. They said we need to stop punishing adults for responsible use.” 
Ohio recreational marijuana sales topped $702.5 million in the first year. 
“People wanted the ability to smoke it where they wanted to smoke it, the ability to have their neighbors exchange marijuana and see whose brand was better,” DeMora said. “This bill does none of that stuff.” 
Ohio Republicans disagree.
“I don’t think it goes against the will of voters,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman said. “You can say we got 57% of the vote, but is it the will of all the people that you’re allowed to smoke marijuana cigarettes while you’re walking into the Cincinnati Reds baseball game? I don’t think so.”

In September the FDA approved a new generic form of mifepristone, bringing the total approved manufacturers to three.
This federal approval, which drew the ire of anti-abortion groups, came after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, that his agency would conduct a “complete review” of mifepristone. 
“If the FDA is reevaluating the brand-name drug’s safety, then it needs to stop rubber-stamping new mail-order generic versions before more women are hurt,” Hanaway said in a statement Thursday.
The new FDA approval will make medication abortions more accessible, Hanaway argues.
“The supply of mifepristone will increase, the cost will decrease and the number of chemical abortions will rise… across the nation,” the new court filing reads.
The lawsuit demands the federal government restore its previous restrictions on mifepristone by requiring three in-person doctor visits, reducing the gestational period during which the medication can be taken from 10 weeks to seven and rolling back recent federal policy that allowed for the mailing of mifepristone and allowed for prescriptions to be made online or through pharmacies.
Medication abortion — used in about two-thirds of abortions in the U.S. — requires two kinds of pills. The first, mifepristone, causes the embryo or fetus to stop growing and detach from the uterine wall, ending the pregnancy. The second, misoprostol, causes the uterus to expel the pregnancy tissue. Both medications are also used to treat miscarriages.
“For Missouri and other states with strong protections for unborn life and maternal health, the widespread mail-order distribution of mifepristone directly undermines state law and burdens state hospitals, emergency rooms, and taxpayers,” Hanaway said in her statement Thursday.
The FDA states that mifepristone is safe to use if taken as directed in the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects. More rarely, there can be hemorrhaging and infection. Those prescribed mifepristone are urged to call their doctor if they experience heavy bleeding, abdominal pain or a fever. This guidance also applies to those who recently underwent surgical abortions, experienced miscarriages or delivered a baby.
Since the medication was approved for use nearly three decades ago, the FDA has reported only 32 deaths associated with mifepristone. The report evaluates data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Hanaway stepped into the legal challenge to mifepristone first filed by her predecessor, Andrew Bailey. The federal lawsuit challenging the safety of mifepristone was taken up by the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas last year after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the original lawsuit, saying the anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations in Texas who brought the original case didn’t have the standing to sue. 
The case was recently moved from a federal court in Texas to the eastern district of Missouri in St. Louis after a federal judge in Texas said he no longer had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs. A court date has not yet been set.
Despite voters enshrining the right to abortion in the Missouri Constitution last year, medication abortion is inaccessible through Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri.

Murphy proposes rescue, reform of public worker health plan system",Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/20/governor-murphy-state-health-benefits/,Gov. Phil Murphy's proposal to revamp the health benefits program for government workers would shift costs away from premiums and onto health care visits. The state's largest public-sector union is opposed.,"Gov. Phil Murphy's proposal to revamp the health benefits program for government workers would shift costs away from premiums and onto health care visits. The state's largest public-sector union is opposed. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy proposed an overhaul of the state’s public worker health plans on Thursday that would flatten the number of plans offered to government workers, shift more costs for health care visits onto workers, and inject $260 million in a bid to attract local governments that have fled the public plan over years of steep premium hikes.
Murphy’s proposal comes as the local part of the State Health Benefits Program threatens to collapse amid a dwindling pool of subscribers driven ever smaller by rising rates that spur more departures and, in turn, more rate increases. And it comes as Murphy, a Democrat, is nearing the end of his two terms as governor. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) succeeds him in January.
“Unless we take sweeping action now to shore up this program, there are tens of thousands of New Jerseyans whose access to health care will be in serious jeopardy, and next June’s rate increases will be astronomical,” Murphy said during a speech at the New Jersey League of Municipalities’ annual conference.
The State Health Benefits Program covers both state and some local government workers, and the local part is technically insolvent. Even after years of double-digit rate increases — including a 37% increase approved in September — the premiums it collects from local and county governments and their workers are not enough to cover its costs.
Its reserves, which actuaries say should hold enough to cover two months of claims, are depleted, and the local part has been taking loans from state workers’ better-funded plan to continue offering health benefits to nearly 146,000 workers across New Jersey.
That number is falling every year as surging rates push local governments with younger, healthier workforces to cheaper options in the private market, pushing rates up as the program’s insurance pool grows older, sicker, and riskier to insure.
“This program provides health care coverage to our state’s valiant, and often under-appreciated, public servants,” Murphy said, adding, “These New Jerseyans — along with our state’s taxpayers — are counting on us to prevent the SHBP for local government from collapsing.”
The governor acknowledged passing the reforms before he leaves office on Jan. 20 would be difficult.
In a bid to lower premiums, Murphy’s plan would increase workers’ share of health care visit costs, and the proposal has already drawn opposition from the Communications Workers of America, the state’s largest public-sector union.
“This proposal, as it is, is a nonstarter,” said CWA District 1 New Jersey Area Director Tonya Hodges. “The SHBP Stabilization Act of 2025 is nothing but an egregious attempt to dismantle local government health care, continue shifting costs onto the backs of public workers, and perpetuate a system that allows insurance carriers and [pharmacy benefit managers] to increase prices with impunity.”
Senate President Nicholas Scutari said he believes a compromise is possible to address the problems plaguing the State Health Benefits Program. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) in a statement said Murphy’s proposal underscores the key tenets needed for reform.
“The foundational principles that are needed to enable the plans to operate effectively and efficiently are the stabilization of local governments going in and out of the system, reducing the number of health plan options, and breaking the stalemate between management and labor. Although the proposals from the Governor and the Assembly address these principles differently, the Senate Workgroup that I charged with addressing this issue believes there is an opportunity for a compromise that preserves vital health care for workers while protecting municipal and county taxpayers,” Scutari said.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), meanwhile, said in a statement that he welcomes discussions on how to lower costs for taxpayers and municipalities “while providing quality, affordable health insurance to public workers.”
 A $260 million one-shot
Key to Murphy’s pitch is a one-time $260 million appropriation that would be used to pay down money loaned from the state worker side of the State Health Benefits Program. That balance is projected to reach $180 million by the end of 2025, and whatever remains of the appropriation would go into the plan’s reserve.
The appropriation is significant, accounting for about 11.5% of the nearly $2.3 billion that the local government workers’ health plan is expected to spend in 2025, and could allow the state to lower the rates approved in September in early 2026, long before a slew of other reforms take effect in 2027.
At present, the program’s premiums include added charges to repay loans to the state workers’ plan and rebuild the local part’s depleted reserves.
Murphy administration officials hope that rate reduction will encourage local units that have left the plan over rising costs to return, driving rates down as the insurance pool’s risk falls.
“Our administration is willing to provide a quarter-billion dollars, in the short-term, to keep the SHBP for local government solvent in exchange for smart, structural reforms that will stabilize the program in the long-term,” Murphy said.
The governor’s proposal would require local governments to stay inside the State Health Benefits Program for five years once they join and stay out for the same period if they leave. The provision is meant to keep the plan’s insurance pool stable.
 Less generous plans
Local government workers’ health plans would become less generous under Murphy’s proposed changes, and there would be far fewer plans presented to workers.
At present, the local part of the State Health Benefits Program offers 50 plans, though as many as 95% of local government workers are enrolled in plans that cover at least 97% of health care visit costs, meaning most workers are responsible for paying just 3% of their health care expenses through coinsurance, copays, or deductibles.
That figure, called an actuarial value, does not include premiums and would fall significantly under the three health plans the governor’s proposal would create beginning in 2027.
It would drop to a statutorily mandated 88% under a PPO plan, or 78% under a high-deductible plan. The actuarial value of a proposed tiered-network plan was unclear.
Administration officials hope shifting costs away from premiums will help keep healthier workers in the public plan, and they hope raising workers’ share of health care visit costs will discourage them from seeking unnecessary or excessive care.
That framework would necessarily raise costs for some of the plan’s members, especially those with chronic conditions who require frequent care. Morgan, the Communications Workers of America official, said the proposal would lock government workers “into inferior plans.”
“We should be moving toward more oversight and more affordable benefits,” Hodges said.

 A new commission
Murphy’s plan would also alter governance over local government workers’ health plans.
A new seven-member commission would oversee rate setting and plan design, though they would be bound to keep actuarial values at the levels set in statute.
It would include four cabinet heads from the Departments of Treasury, Banking and Insurance, Community Affairs, and the Civil Service Commission or their designees, giving the state government a majority on the commission.
The governor would appoint the three remaining members, with one each recommended by the New Jersey League of Municipalities, the AFL-CIO, and the state’s largest police and firefighter unions.
Local governments have long sought representation on the bodies that oversee New Jersey’s public worker health plans. They have none under current law.
Treasury officials have said the frequent deadlocks in the state’s plan design committees, whose membership is evenly split between state and labor representatives, have contributed to rising premiums.
Murphy’s proposal would allow the state treasurer to act as tiebreaker if plan design committees that set rules for the state part of State Health Benefits Program deadlock.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As some South Dakota dairy farmers struggle to find workers and as the state’s unemployment rate remains the lowest in the nation at 1.9%, South Dakota’s economic development office continues to approve incentives for the industry.
Two boards affiliated with the state Governor’s Office of Economic Development approved $17 million of aid for businesses this month, according to a press release from the department. Most of it was for dairy operations.
“When businesses grow in our small towns, it creates a ripple effect that strengthens the whole community,” said Commissioner Bill Even, who leads the office. “Each of these projects represents a partnership between the state, local leaders and business owners working together to move South Dakota forward.”
Drumgoon Dairy, near Lake Norden, lost 38 of its 50 employees this summer after a federal Department of Homeland Security audit flagged workers for inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country. Dairy audits in the state increased this year, farmers have said, and Drumgoon has struggled to hire local employees to replace the workers in the aftermath.
Noem’s South Dakota neighbors hit with an immigration audit that decimates their workforce

That hasn’t stopped state officials from continuing to direct aid to the dairy industry. Warner-based Silverstreak Dairies was awarded up to $12 million this month in Livestock Nutrient Management Bonds to build manure containment systems as part of the company’s recent $32 million expansion, which doubled its capacity to 5,400 head.
Annie Vannurden, a partner in the Warner operation, told South Dakota Searchlight it employs 30 people. With the recent expansion, Silverstreak pivoted toward more technology to address workforce shortages, including introducing a post-milking robot and using collars to monitor cows’ needs and reduce the amount of human interaction.
The Livestock Nutrient Management Bond program issues tax-exempt bonds to purchasers — typically local banks — who set the repayment terms and interest rates for the company borrowing the money. This is the first bond in the program approved so far this year.
Vannurden said the bond program helps dairy farms invest in their operations and technological upgrades rather than pay higher interest to other loan programs.
“It just shows that South Dakota cares about its dairy farms, people in agriculture and the environment,” Vannurden said, adding, “because they want us to be thoughtful and mindful and complete in our manure handling and compliance.”
Silverstreak Dairies is headquartered in Pierz, Minnesota, and operates eight dairies — the Warner dairy is the company’s sole South Dakota operation. The Warner operation was previously awarded $8.74 million in a Livestock Nutrient Management Bond in February 2024.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)With most power customers likely to pay at least $150 more next year, Maine’s public advocate said the hike “underscores how challenging and volatile energy costs have become” for Maine households and small businesses.
One day after the commission that oversees the state’s utilities rejected Central Maine Power’s proposed 10-year rate increase, the Public Utilities Commission announced Wednesday it approved new electricity prices for 2026. 
Starting in January, residential and small commercial customers of CMP will see rates increase to 12.72 cents per kilowatt hour, up from 10.61 this year. Versant Maine Public District residential and small commercial customers will see rates increase from 11.65 cents per kilowatt hour to 14.87.
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement Thursday that an analysis by her office estimates customers can expect their monthly bills to go up, on average, between $13 and $17. 
Utility regulators reject CMP’s proposed rate hike, for now

“When every dollar matters, this is a significant increase for families and small businesses that are already stretched thin,” Sanborn said.
A power bill has two primary components: the cost of the energy being supplied, and the cost of the infrastructure to deliver it. Private utilities are responsible for delivering power. They also serve as intermediaries with energy suppliers, which are selected through a competitive bidding process overseen by the commission. This chosen supplier is known as the “standard offer,” since households are also entitled to seek an alternative “competitive electricity supplier.” 
“We recognize that rising energy costs create real challenges for Maine households and businesses,” said commission Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. 
The new standard offer rate, he said, “reflects current market realities and the commission remains committed to securing the lowest reasonable prices for Maine electric utility customers in a challenging energy environment.”
Sanborn said the higher costs are likely the result of increased natural gas prices, as well as changes in the wholesale market that have introduced new pricing risks for power suppliers.
On Tuesday, the commission rejected CMP’s proposed 10-year delivery rate increase, which would have raised costs for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. The three-member panel encouraged the utility to resubmit a plan that takes into greater consideration long-term resilience planning and the impact on ratepayers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2153308881-scaled-1-2048x1152-1-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

New micro-neighborhood provides longer mental health residential stays at a lower price point, customizable treatment plans, and job assistance.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  With expansion, Spring Lake Ranch hopes to be missing link in mental health care.","It’s a familiar story for Vermonters: A loved one experiencing a mental health crisis goes to the hospital. They spend a few days in a psychiatric unit, or two weeks at one of the few drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities in the state, and then they’re sent home. All the stressors, patterns, people, and pathways that originally led them to crisis are still there, and they relapse.
Relationships are damaged and resources are strained. In some cases, hospital and rehab stays are replaced by prison sentences, which exacerbate the difficulties of reintegrating in a safe and healthy way. Relapse. Crisis. Each time the cycle repeats, it fuels a sense of hopelessness that makes long-term recovery from mental health challenges feel that much harder.
At Spring Lake Ranch Therapeutic Community (SLR) in Shrewsbury, VT, an expanded step-down program seeks to bolster residents’ long-term success. SLR hopes the program can become a model for others across the country. 

The Banks Transitional Living Program (TLP) at Spring Lake Ranch is a micro-neighborhood currently being constructed on the Ranch’s 700+ acre, mountain-top property where their primary mental health facilities have existed for nearly 100 years. Within three new apartment buildings and a community center, residents will receive customized support to bridge the gap between residential care and independent living. 
“This is something we’ve been wanting to do for a long time,” says Rachel Stark, Executive Director of the Ranch. “We hope this will be the missing link for people who are ready for new challenges, but not quite ready to be fully on their own.”   
Clients come to SLR from all over, often from intensive inpatient and rehab facilities. Common diagnoses include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Some residents are simply having trouble making life transitions or experiencing “failure to launch” syndrome. About 80% have dual diagnosis, which means they are experiencing both mental health and substance use challenges. 
Residents participate in a farm-based therapeutic work program while receiving clinical care within a supportive community. The typical stay is 6-8 months, but timelines are individual. After that, residents currently have the option of transitioning to Elliot Program, a 6-bedroom pilot of the Banks TLP, where they can have a car, manage their own medication, go to school, or work off-site. Last year, roughly a quarter of SLR residents chose Elliot Program before discharge.
“We did a market study, we did a feasibility study,” says Stark. “But more than that, we talked to families. We talked to residents. This is what people were looking for.”

The 12-bed Banks TLP will offer apartments and suites, depending on resident preference. The rooms have been designed with care, full of light and each with its own balcony overlooking green pastures and lush forest. The community center will be a gathering place for residents, staff, and families, with a large kitchen and offices. 
Residents and their families will choose between a variety of service packages. All will receive continued clinical support and coaching with trusted providers, accountability in recovery, vocational counseling, and help in further developing their independent living skills. They can also choose add-on services like physical wellness, family wellness, and transportation assistance. 
Additionally, residents who’ve been in the Banks TLP for at least a year can participate in the Pathways to Activities, Socializing, & Support (PASS) program, providing continued assistance once they move off-site.  
The Ranch wants to help residents succeed by strengthening the full continuum of care. Mental wellness and recovery are lifelong goals, and by giving residents more time and specialized focus on skill-building and independent living, SLR believes they will be better equipped to escape the cycle of relapse and crisis. 
This level of care comes with a financial cost, which insurance does not currently cover. SLR designed the Banks TLP as a package model so that families could choose the most feasible plan with service add-ons. Residents are also encouraged to apply for financial aid.
Currently, 30-40% of residents receive financial aid for the primary therapeutic work program, covering up to 80% of costs. Earlier this year, the Ranch announced their goal of doubling the amount of aid distributed to residents by 2030. This aid is funded by donors, as well as by sales of Ranch-made products like maple syrup, woven goods, and granola.

“When somebody is right for this program, we do what we can to get them here,” says Kevin Molloy, Director of Operations and Admissions, himself a former resident. “It may feel out of reach, but the support is there to make it happen. This model of care works, I’m living proof of that. So, we want to make it accessible to as many people as possible.” 
In 2024, SLR launched a three-year, $18 million Capital Campaign to fund the Banks TLP as well as other updates necessary to support the expansion. With one year left in the campaign, they’re looking to raise the final three million. 
Development and Communications Director Rose McCracken is working hard to hit that goal. 
“The early support was really amazing. People who’ve been to the Ranch or who’ve had a loved one here know how powerful the program is and they want to see it grow. What we need now is help from folks who may not have heard of us but are passionate about mental health care.”
Investing in mental health benefits us all, McCracken says. “These are not just our family members and friends. They are our future neighbors, coworkers, and community leaders. When we give them the tools to thrive, it enriches life for all of us.”
The Banks Transitional Living Program at Spring Lake Ranch will begin accepting residents in 2026. For more information, visit springlakeranch.org/bankstlp.

Lawmakers in New York are introducing a bill that would ban law enforcement officers, including federal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from wearing masks. The bill, sponsored by Assemblymember Tony Simone, would be called the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics (MELT) Act. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The Michigan Supreme Court proposed on Wednesday an order to prohibit any civil arrests from taking place in a courthouse “while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”
While not explicit in the text of the proposal, it matches actions taken by other states to prevent federal immigration agents from arresting noncitizens with no criminal record on civil immigration warrants while they attend court hearings for unrelated, minor offenses. 
“We welcome this proposed order by the Michigan Supreme Court as it would strengthen public safety, transparency, and accountability for the benefit of all Michigan residents,” Christine Sauvé, the policy, engagement and communications manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. 
“We increasingly receive calls from individuals detained by ICE at or near courthouses in Michigan,” she added. “Often simply the presence of ICE or Border Patrol near these locations – or the possibility of their presence – is enough to deter a range of individuals from accessing the critical process they need to preserve individual rights, the wellbeing of vulnerable people, and public safety.”
Connecticut was the latest state to implement such guidance, last week passing a bill that would bar most civil immigration arrests on courthouse grounds. Meanwhile, in New York, on Monday a judge threw out a challenge by Trump to a 2020 law that limited civil arrests in local courts and state facilities.

Currently, ICE guidance — issued the day after President Donald Trump took office — instructs officers that they “may conduct civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.”
As of Sept. 21, over 70% of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization, meaning that their arrests generally come under civil immigration warrants. 
The proposed order also “does not apply to arrests made pursuant to a valid warrant that a judge has authorized,” while ICE civil warrants are generally administrative warrants as opposed to judicial. 
“This is a commonsense safeguard that benefits all Michiganders because we need everyone to come to court,” Sauvé wrote. “Other states have taken similar measures to ensure there is not a chilling effect on resident access to justice, and these efforts have passed Constitutional muster.”
Justice Brian K. Zahra, the sole Republican on the court, noted in the order that he would have declined to publish the proposal for comment. The order is open for public comment through Dec. 22.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/court-arrests.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 16:25:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford HealthCare could add 2 Prospect CT hospitals to its system by year’s end,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/hartford-healthcare-prospect-medical-ct-hospitals/,HHC pitched its case to buy Manchester and Rockville hospitals owned by Prospect Medical Holdings. CT must issue a decision by Dec. 30.,"After years of uncertainty regarding the future of the Connecticut hospitals owned by bankrupt operator Prospect Medical Holdings, two of the three facilities could have a new owner by the end of the year.
On Tuesday, Hartford HealthCare, one of Connecticut’s largest health systems, presented its case to the state’s Office of Health Strategy to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals. Under the new expedited approval timeline for hospitals in bankruptcy, state officials must issue a decision by Dec. 30.
During the public hearing, Hartford HealthCare CEO Jeffrey Flaks said the health system plans to bring all its expertise, resources and capabilities to Manchester, Rockville and the surrounding towns.
“The robust apparatus of Hartford HealthCare will be brought to these communities to make health care better. That’s why I’m so confident that we have this very unique opportunity to dramatically improve health care that will be here for generations going forward,” Flaks said.
Hartford HealthCare will spend $86.1 million to purchase the facilities and pledged to invest an additional $225.7 million towards capital improvements, like facility and IT upgrades, over the next three years. 
Hartford HealthCare also plans to recruit new physicians to the Manchester and Rockville communities, as well as expand access to specialty care, like oncology, inpatient rehabilitation and vascular and orthopedic surgical services, according to the application submitted to the state.
If approved, the deal would serve as the first step towards concluding a lengthy search to find new buyers for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — a process that often seemed on the brink of failure.
In 2022, Prospect signed a deal to sell its three Connecticut hospitals — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury — to Yale New Haven Health for $435 million. But the deal was mired in setbacks and litigation. 
In August 2023, a cyberattack crippled operations at Prospect’s facilities around the country. In 2024, Yale New Haven Health and Prospect Medical sued and countersued each other over the true value of the hospitals. In January 2025, Prospect filed for bankruptcy and, by the following month, Yale officials said a deal appeared “impossible.” 
In September, Yale agreed to pay $45 million to Prospect to end all disputes over the hospitals’ sale. 
Hartford HealthCare stepped in and its acquisitions of the Manchester and Rockville facilities could be finalized by the end of the year. Connecticut’s flagship academic medical institution, UConn Health, seems poised to acquire Waterbury Hospital. A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved the UConn deal earlier this week, and now the transaction must obtain state approval.
It’s a speedy transition for the three hospitals, whose ownership had languished in uncertainty for years.
While the Yale deal was pending, Lamont and OHS received broad criticism for the lengthy approval process. That led state legislators to approve a measure earlier this year that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. 
Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete. 
In an emailed statement, Lamont’s spokesperson Rob Blanchard said OHS “met all statutory timelines in the Yale-Prospect [certificate of need review]” and that the legal disputes between the two companies illustrate the transaction’s complexity. 
“Yale’s decision to file suit against Prospect less than two months after the agreed settlement raised clear concerns about the parties’ readiness to close the deal. The disputes that prolonged the CON process are now evident in the lawsuit, countersuit, and resulting $45 million settlement,” Blanchard stated in emailed comments.
Erosion of services at Rockville
Despite the promise of new ownership for Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, the formerly private equity-backed operator will leave a lasting imprint on the state’s hospital system — perhaps most notably in the erosion of services at Rockville General.
When Prospect acquired Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which includes Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals, both facilities were full-service acute care hospitals. Today, Rockville — which serves a geographic region that’s largely rural — functions as a satellite campus of Manchester, with only an emergency room and behavioral health unit. 
A spokesperson for Prospect did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, lays the blame for the diminishment of the hospital directly with the state.
“That’s OHS’s failure,” Nuccio said. “They allowed this to happen.”
A 2023 investigation by The Connecticut Mirror found that Prospect began cutting services during the early days of the pandemic, eventually shuttering most of Rockville’s inpatient units without obtaining the required state approvals. Records and employee testimony submitted to the state show that officials were aware of the unauthorized cuts going back as far as 2021.
In February 2022, OHS fined Prospect for some of the service cuts at Rockville, but the operator appealed the penalty. The agency ultimately found it did not have substantial evidence to penalize Prospect, and waived the fine. 
In October 2024, OHS launched another investigation into the service cuts. In May of this year, Connecticut officials reached a settlement with Prospect Medical Holdings. OHS fined the operator $300,000, but the agreement also allowed Prospect to shutter all services at Rockville aside from the emergency room and behavioral health, officially making the facility a satellite campus of Manchester.
At the time, then-OHS commissioner Deidre Gifford issued a statement saying the agreement “protects critical resources” for patients and families in the area.
“The agreement also holds the Prospect applicants accountable to the community, requiring public notice of past terminations and development of a strategic plan for the consolidated hospital. The plan must be developed with community input and presented to the community in a public forum,” Gifford’s statement read. 
Hartford HealthCare has said as of now they don’t expect service cuts at either Manchester or Rockville. But Nuccio said she’s suspicious based on the company’s history with Windham Hospital, which HHC acquired in 2009. 
In 2015, Hartford HealthCare announced the conversion of Windham’s critical care unit to what’s known as a progressive care unit, which can’t handle the same complexity of care. Most recently, the company received strong pushback from the local community over the system’s decision to shutter Windham’s labor and delivery unit, which stopped performing births in 2020.
During the hearing on Tuesday, executives with HHC stated that the system improves the quality of care at all of the hospitals that join its system and that they are proud of the work done with former acquisitions. The company’s certificate of need application states that HHC invested hundreds of millions of dollars in facilities it acquired in the past, resulting in drastically improved quality of care for patients. 
Tina Varona, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare, declined to make Flaks available for an interview after he testified in Tuesday’s hearing, saying he had to leave immediately. 
“We are unable to comment outside of the testimony at this time due to the NDA and pending regulatory review,” Varona stated in an email follow-up after the hearing. 
Following Tuesday’s hearing, Attorney General William Tong issued a statement saying he expected Hartford HealthCare to maintain services, including labor and delivery, intensive care and behavioral health. But he called on OHS to hold Hartford HealthCare to its promises.
“Expectations must be matched by accountability: Absent other legal impediments, I would urge the Office of Health Strategy to seek firm commitments to continue these vital services,” Tong said. 
Vernon mayor Dan Champagne shared Nuccio’s sentiments in holding the state accountable for what happened to Rockville Hospital, particularly for how long officials took to approve the failed 2022 deal with Yale. But, he said, he’s grateful Rockville has not suffered the same fate as Prospect hospitals in Pennsylvania, which had to close because they couldn’t find a viable buyer.
Champagne said he understands skepticism of what an acquisition by a big hospital system could mean for Manchester and Rockville. But for him, Hartford HealthCare’s bid will guard against the most damaging result: closure of the hospitals and the flight of medical professionals from the communities.
“There are a lot of people who say, ‘big systems can sometimes lead to increased prices or closure of services,’” Champagne said. “We need to go back to what we’re facing here. I’m watching other hospital systems close from Prospect. We have an opportunity to keep this open. That’s the most important thing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

Charlie Baker and followed a landmark court ruling that found the state needed to issue more specific and stringent regulations in order to meet the 2050 climate commitment.,"NO AGENCY SUBMITTED reports to comply with a 2017 rule requiring cuts to the emissions produced by state-owned vehicles — and environmental regulators didn’t aggressively enforce the rule, either, according to new court documents filed last week. 
Massachusetts agencies that own or lease at least 30 passenger vehicles, from the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Department of Transportation, are compelled to reduce the pollution stemming from that vehicle fleet each year by specific amounts and submit reports to the Department of Environmental Protection in order to show compliance.  
But MassDEP has no records of these reports and didn’t follow up with the relevant agencies to receive that data for each year going back to 2019, when the reports were first due, according to the court documents that are in connection to a lawsuit the state brought against oil giant Exxon Mobil.  
The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, which oversees MassDEP, declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. 
The rule was issued under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and followed a landmark court ruling that found the state needed to issue more specific and stringent regulations in order to meet the 2050 climate commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent compared to 1990 levels. That 2016 ruling prompted an executive order from Baker directing DEP to issue additional regulations to help Massachusetts achieve those emissions reductions. 
A suite of six regulations emerged, one of which was the state passenger vehicle emissions reduction rule. But that regulation appears to have been ignored since it took effect in the wake of the 2016 litigation that was spurred by groups like the Conservation Law Foundation.  
DEP made the admission, ironically, in a court proceeding tied to a lawsuit the state filed against Exxon, accusing the company of deceiving the public and investors about the risks of climate change and its role in contributing to it. That litigation, initiated in 2019 by then-Attorney General Maura Healey, has now raised questions about the state’s own efforts to reduce emissions.  
After a judge denied Exxon’s attempt to obtain data and documents pertaining to Massachusetts’s vehicle fleet rule via discovery, the company pivoted to seek the information through a public records request in January. And when the state denied that record request, Exxon sued this past March — ultimately producing some relevant documents, including agency communications related to the rule and one request from EEA in 2019 for a modification of its vehicle’s emissions limit. 
But Exxon, believing that the state was withholding additional information, pressed the state for more. That’s when, in defense of the state’s motion to dismiss the records case, DEP admitted last week that “no agencies had submitted reports under the fleets regulation.” 
Conservation Law Foundation, whose lawsuit gave rise to this regulation requiring emissions reductions from state-owned vehicles, said the court documents are concerning. 
“CLF is still reviewing the record, but we fought for these [Global Warming Solutions Act] regulations to ensure real climate action,” said Seth Gadbois, staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation. “All levels of government are bound to follow them. When they’re ignored, it’s a step backward for the climate goals Massachusetts is legally required to meet.” 
The state passenger vehicle regulation is, of course, just one piece of Massachusetts’s broader efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector — which account for the largest share of pollution in the Bay State at 38 percent. 
Baker, in 2021, went significantly further in cracking down on the emissions tied to state vehicles by requiring through executive order that the state’s fleet be 100 percent zero-emission in 2050.  
Since then, the Healey administration has allocated tens of millions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including for public entities and the state fleet, along with school bus electrification — though Massachusetts would still need to triple its annual rate of new charging deployments through 2030 to achieve its climate commitment of cutting pollution in half compared to 1990 levels. 
Still, the lack of compliance with and enforcement of an emissions-reduction regulation that was the direct result of a major legal victory for environmental activists is likely to raise scrutiny of state climate efforts. The revelation from the Exxon Mobil lawsuit comes as the Trump administration’s push to squash clean energy further jeopardizes Massachusetts’s ability to meet those 2030 goals. 
The regulation states that when MassDEP believes an agency has exceeded its emissions limit “or violated any other condition” of the rule, DEP “may require” an agency to perform audits on its carbon dioxide emissions and deliver periodic reports “to assure continuous compliance.” The regulation also grants MassDEP the ability to “verify compliance” by conducting inspections and requesting additional information. 
None of the records made public through the lawsuit show DEP taking any such steps. Sharon Weber, deputy division director for air and climate programs at DEP, confirmed in a deposition last month that DEP has no documents showing any instances of “compliance verification” or other enforcement actions in spite of the fact that no agency appears to have filed reports detailing the emissions of its vehicle fleet.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Healey-Baker.jpg?fit=1000%2C690&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

TOPEKA, Kansas — The Republican secretaries of state for Kansas and Missouri have signed a memorandum of understanding to exchange voter registration information in a bid to identify people who failed to cancel registrations after moving from one state to the other.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins said the partnership would enhance voter roll maintenance by “securely” sharing personal details on 1.87 million registered voters in Kansas and 4.13 million registered voters in Missouri.
Two organizations dedicated to advancing voter rights expressed skepticism the two-state agreement would do much to strengthen election security.
Neither secretary of state offered an estimate of the number of people in Kansas and Missouri who might have active registrations in a state where they used to reside.
“We can reduce duplicate registrations, created when residents move across the state line, by updating voter registration records timely and as allowed by law,” said Schwab, a candidate for the 2026 GOP nomination for governor in Kansas.
Hoskins said Missouri engaged in rigorous voter registration maintenance in accordance with state and federal law, but the deal “allows us to improve accuracy even further.”
He said the risk of duplicate registrations was real because thousands of Missourians and Kansans relocated each year across the state line in Kansas City metropolitan counties.
“This partnership is good government, plain and simple,” Hoskins said. “When voters move, their information should follow them and our local election officials deserve every available tool to keep the rolls clean, current and transparent.”
Democratic state election officials ​in letter ​ask if they were ‘misled’ by Trump administration

Esmie Tseng, spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the organization’s concerns with the Missouri-Kansas arrangement were comparable to those shared in September when Schwab announced a voter registration collaboration between Kansas and Texas. She said both states must carefully guard personal information, and the states ought to proceed with the understanding that databases could be flawed.
“It should not be used as a way of simply scaring people about election integrity,” Tseng said.
Some states — but not Kansas — striving to upgrade election security in the past decade turned to the Electronic Registration Information Center. ERIC an organization of member states worked to collate motor vehicle department data, Social Security Administration death reports, address information from the U.S. Postal Service and state voter registration records to search for possible illegal voting.
Schwab’s predecessors as Kansas secretary of state operated the now-defunct Crosscheck program that promised to improve accuracy of state voter registration rolls. A lawsuit was filed challenging Crosscheck’s security shortcomings and a high rate of false positives. Settlement of the lawsuit in 2019 led to shelving of Crosscheck.
“Given the history of voter data mismanagement and its negative impact on Kansans, our big question is: How is this better than ERIC and different from Crosscheck?” said Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, a Kansas organization focused on civil and voting rights.
Whitney Tempel, director of communications for Schwab, said all data sharing relevant to maintaining accurate voter rolls would be conducted in accordance with mandates of state or federal law.
She said the Kansas agreements with Missouri and Texas were part of a trend in which states proactively sought to update voter rolls through direct cooperation with other states.
“This is part of a national surge in one-to-one state agreements as opposed to multistate groups,” Tempel said. “This is one more tool for voter roll maintenance.”
Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said Kansas and Missouri were part of a growing trend among states that voluntarily partnered on data-sharing projects to streamline work on election security.
In early 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice requested states turn over voter registration lists as part of a national inquiry into potential voter fraud. The Justice Department said the goal was to guarantee compliance with federal laws. DOJ subsequently revealed information was shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for inclusion in the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, database.
On Tuesday, election officials in 10 states sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and DOJ asking for clarification of statements about uses for voter registration data by the administration of President Donald Trump. DOJ filed lawsuits against eight states for declining to comply with demands for information, which included driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
In response, the Kansas secretary of state praised the federal SAVE database. Schwab committed to providing DOJ with publicly available voter information.

More often than staff at the Mount Washington Observatory would like, that’s just how it goes for weather monitoring equipment high on the mountain’s slopes, according to Mount Washington Observatory Director of Weather Operations Jay Broccolo. 
Mounted on aluminum tripod frames, the equipment is designed to monitor conditions including wind speed, snowfall, and solar radiation on the mountain Broccolo and others proudly say is home to “the worst weather on Earth.” But even cutting-edge technology can’t always stand up to Mount Washington’s worst: As ice builds up on the equipment, the surface area exposed to the gales increases and increases. Sometimes, Broccolo says, the metal structures supporting the tech simply buckle.

The automated weather stations are part of a network the Mount Washington Observatory is in the process of expanding throughout the North Country and up and down the slopes of Mount Washington, Broccolo said. The dozens of stations provide real-time weather updates and contribute to a log of local climate data that helps scientists track change over time and understand more about the White Mountains’ unique environment. 
Data from high on the peaks is very valuable to the effort, particularly because it is so hard to come by, Broccolo said. But that’s for good reason. The observatory’s main structures and infrastructure on the peak itself are hardy, but maintaining smaller, standalone weather stations is very difficult — particularly above 4,000 feet on a mountain where, in winter, top wind speeds may approach (or exceed) 100 mph on a daily basis.
“We’ve tried three times, and they’ve lasted not even a month into the winter on every single one,” Broccolo said, speaking to reporters, North Country business owners, and scientists at the foot of Mount Washington Nov. 18. 
A new attempt at solving that takes the form of a collaboration between the Mount Washington Observatory and the Cog Railway. The Cog is aiding in the construction of a new, steel tripod station along its tracks that will — hopefully — prove more durable than the aluminum structures used by the observatory in the past, Broccolo said. 
“It’s very much a trial-as-you-go situation,” he said. “There’s very few places on the planet that experience the weather that this place does.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mesonet-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins said the partnership would enhance voter roll maintenance by “securely” sharing personal details on 1.87 million registered voters in Kansas and 4.13 million registered voters in Missouri.
Two organizations dedicated to advancing voter rights expressed skepticism the two-state agreement would do much to strengthen election security.
Neither secretary of state offered an estimate of the number of people in Kansas and Missouri who might have active registrations in a state where they used to reside.
“We can reduce duplicate registrations, created when residents move across the state line, by updating voter registration records timely and as allowed by law,” said Schwab, a candidate for the 2026 GOP nomination for governor in Kansas.
Hoskins said Missouri engaged in rigorous voter registration maintenance in accordance with state and federal law, but the deal “allows us to improve accuracy even further.”
He said the risk of duplicate registrations was real because thousands of Missourians and Kansans relocated each year across the state line in Kansas City metropolitan counties.
“This partnership is good government, plain and simple,” Hoskins said. “When voters move, their information should follow them and our local election officials deserve every available tool to keep the rolls clean, current and transparent.”
Esmie Tseng, spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the organization’s concerns with the Missouri-Kansas arrangement were comparable to those shared in September when Schwab announced a voter registration collaboration between Kansas and Texas. She said both states must carefully guard personal information, and the states ought to proceed with the understanding that databases could be flawed.
“It should not be used as a way of simply scaring people about election integrity,” Tseng said.
Some states — but not Kansas — striving to upgrade election security in the past decade turned to the Electronic Registration Information Center. ERIC an organization of member states worked to collate motor vehicle department data, Social Security Administration death reports, address information from the U.S. Postal Service and state voter registration records to search for possible illegal voting.
Schwab’s predecessors as Kansas secretary of state operated the now-defunct Crosscheck program that promised to improve accuracy of state voter registration rolls. A lawsuit was filed challenging Crosscheck’s security shortcomings and a high rate of false positives. Settlement of the lawsuit in 2019 led to shelving of Crosscheck.
“Given the history of voter data mismanagement and its negative impact on Kansans, our big question is: How is this better than ERIC and different from Crosscheck?” said Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, a Kansas organization focused on civil and voting rights.
Whitney Tempel, director of communications for Schwab, said all data sharing relevant to maintaining accurate voter rolls would be conducted in accordance with mandates of state or federal law.
She said the Kansas agreements with Missouri and Texas were part of a trend in which states proactively sought to update voter rolls through direct cooperation with other states.
“This is part of a national surge in one-to-one state agreements as opposed to multistate groups,” Tempel said. “This is one more tool for voter roll maintenance.”
Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said Kansas and Missouri were part of a growing trend among states that voluntarily partnered on data-sharing projects to streamline work on election security.
In early 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice requested states turn over voter registration lists as part of a national inquiry into potential voter fraud. The Justice Department said the goal was to guarantee compliance with federal laws. DOJ subsequently revealed information was shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for inclusion in the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, database.
On Tuesday, election officials in 10 states sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and DOJ asking for clarification of statements about uses for voter registration data by the administration of President Donald Trump. DOJ filed lawsuits against eight states for declining to comply with demands for information, which included driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
In response, the Kansas secretary of state praised the federal SAVE database. Schwab committed to providing DOJ with publicly available voter information.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5210800-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT survey finds ties between financial stress, mental health issues",Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/ct-survey-mental-financial-stress/,"A survey of over 1,300 CT adults found residents are struggling more than they were in 2018 and are concerned about federal cuts to benefits.","Connecticut residents are struggling more with mental health issues and some basic needs than they were in 2018, according to a community survey released earlier this month by DataHaven, a nonprofit organization producing data for the state.
The survey, conducted from August through October 2025, surveyed over 1,300 Connecticut adults to asses quality of life, health, employment and resources across the state. 
One takeaway: Connecticut residents making less than $30,000 per year are, predictably, more likely to struggle with food, housing and transportation costs — but these residents are also more prone to mental health issues.
Mark Abraham, the executive director of DataHaven, said the survey elicited some positive findings.
“Connecticut continues to show great resilience and a high quality of life, with more than 83% of adults saying they are satisfied with the place they live,” Abraham said in a Nov. 6 press release.
The survey found that the majority of those surveyed believe Connecticut is a “good” or “excellent” place to raise children — and most were satisfied with the city they lived in.
However, many questions included in the survey related to the numerous changes and cuts being made to social safety net programs at the federal level — and found that nearly 30% of families with children have struggled this past year.
“The data also reveal areas of concern that communities are working hard to address, including cuts to food assistance, health care and housing that over a million people in our state have been relying on,” Abraham said. “The results also show rising anxiety, worries about immigration enforcement, differences in access to economic and health opportunity, and financial stress, especially for renters and families with children.”
Anxiety, depression and mental health care access
While 200,000 more adults reported feelings of anxiety and depression now compared to 2018, the survey also found a strong correlation between mental health issues and income.
Thomas Burr, the public policy and affiliate relations manager at the Connecticut branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, wasn’t surprised by the survey’s findings.
“That’s what I’m hearing,” Burr said. “It seems like this last year especially, all the drama coming out of D.C., coupled with an economy that’s still not great for a lot of people, has really brought a lot of people down.”

“Demographically speaking, mental health affects everyone, whether you’re wealthy or poor,” Burr said. “But I think because being poor and having issues potentially putting food on your table or [keeping] stable housing is just more trauma on people. And the more traumatic stuff you’re dealing with, the more challenges you’re dealing with, the greater the impact on your overall mental health.” 
When broken down by race, Black, Latino and Puerto Rican residents had heightened feelings of anxiety.
One question added to the survey just a few years ago asked residents: “During the past 12 months, was there any time when you needed mental health treatment or counseling for yourself but didn’t get it?” Statewide, 13% of Connecticut residents answered yes. But 19% of those making under $30,000 reported not getting mental health treatment when they needed it.
“It’s higher for folks who have limited income because cost was a big reason,” Abraham said. “But also just not knowing where to go for support or to find those services was a big reason, especially for younger people.”
People ages 18 to 24 were more likely to have not found mental health treatment when they needed it compared to older residents.  
Compared to the 2018 survey, feelings of depression and hopelessness are more common than they were in 2018. While the number of residents experiencing depressed feelings every day stayed the same, 5% fewer residents experienced no feelings of depression.
DataHaven also included survey questions about immigration status and deportation fears following a steep increase in deportations under the Trump administration. 
Statewide, 31% of residents either worried “a lot” or “some” about themselves, family or a close friend getting their immigration status revoked or being detained or deported.
“Even before new policies take effect that will dramatically increase the federal budget for immigration enforcement and deportations, many residents are already feeling an impact on their health and well-being,” Abraham said in the DataHaven press release.
Tabitha Sookdeo is the executive director for Connecticut Students with a Dream. She said that her members, ranging in ages 14 to 25, are scared.
“I feel like this entire survey reaffirmed so much of what we have been seeing on the ground and what we’ve been feeling,” Sookdeo said. “You know, I have to literally create a mental health fund for our staff and for our members and for their families.”
Latino and Puerto Rican residents worried more than white or Black residents about possible deportations or detainments — and Sookdeo said two of the organization’s members were detained by ICE over the past few months. The organization was able to get them back through a bond process, but those members and their families are “not doing well.”
When President Donald Trump took office in January, Sookdeo said, she went to the different chapters of Connecticut Students for a Dream to discuss the possible risks to members and their families.
“You could see the light kind of start to dull in their eyes … trying to process what this means,” Sookdeo said. “And that was before inauguration, so fast forward to today, it truly is a traumatic experience. These are still young people, they’re still children, their brains are still developing. And that’s happening in extraordinarily traumatic circumstances.”
Many of the organization’s members have been struggling, Sookdeo said, and she has been having sleepless nights herself.
“So many people are suffering and in such a state of despair,” Sookdeo said.
Housing and food — can people afford the necessities?
Similar trends emerged when comparing responses among economic brackets on food and housing questions; Connecticut residents making less than $100,000 were much more likely to have struggled with food and housing money in the past 12 months.

However, for families with children, there was more struggle. DataHaven found that over a quarter of families with children did not have enough money for food at some point in the past 12 months, and nearly 15% struggled to pay for housing.
Jason Jakubowski is the president and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare. He said that it is “absolutely” the case that families with children are struggling especially. However, because of the recent government shutdown and the federal changes to SNAP regulations this November, Jakubowski said these issues are exacerbated, and new faces are showing up to the pantries.
“Since this SNAP crisis began, actually, I’ve seen more senior citizens come out in these last couple of weeks,” Jakubowski said. “There’s a lot of them that rely on SNAP benefits that probably weren’t included in that data that ended in October, and now, suddenly, they’re thrust into the system.”
From 2024 to 2025, food insecurity fell for everyone except families with children. But overall, food insecurity is a larger issue now than it was pre-pandemic — 100,000 more adults are experiencing food insecurity today.
Jakubowski said the CT Foodshare pantries have experienced between a 50% and 100% increase in clients in the past couple of weeks. And as for the last couple of years, Jakubowski said, CT Foodshare has seen similar trends to what was identified in the survey.
“We’ve definitely seen food insecurity increase over the last couple of years,” Jakubowski said. “We’ve definitely seen it spike over the last couple of months, and obviously, even more so over the last couple of weeks.”
Nearly a quarter of residents surveyed who make less than $30,000 struggled to afford housing within the last 12 months. Affordable housing in Connecticut has been a heated topic of discussion after Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed House Bill 5002 during session. The bill would have pushed towns to reform their zoning laws, among other initiatives. 
Housing growth is slow in the state, but the passage of House Bill 8002 during the special legislative session, among other initiatives, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to begin creating more housing.
Changes to Medicaid and SNAP programs in CT
Major eligibility changes to SNAP and Medicaid under the Trump administration will leave thousands in Connecticut uninsured or with less money for food. DataHaven found that residents in the state are worried.  

The survey asked residents how worried they were about current governmental policies that could lead to residents struggling to afford food, housing and health insurance. These questions specifically referenced changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, changes to SNAP coverage and changes to subsidized housing or Section 8 programs.
When it comes to Medicaid, those in urban areas and rural towns are the most worried that more residents could lose health insurance coverage. Over half of the residents from both urban and rural areas were “very concerned” about adults and children losing health insurance coverage.
Burr is worried that a federal change not yet implemented, requiring the redetermination of eligibility every six months through a lengthly paperwork process, could also kick some people off Medicaid — especially those with cognitive impairments or mental health conditions. 
“Having the wherewithal to be able to provide all the information they’re looking for to be redetermined as eligible, it’s not a trivial thing,” Burr said. “And there will definitely be people who fall off the rolls who would otherwise be eligible, but they just can’t do the paperwork.”
And in terms of food insecurity, Jakubowski said, there is “definitely” an indirect effect between Medicaid cuts and the amount of people utilizing food pantries.
“People come to one of our pantries and people go to one of our mobile trucks, because they have to make a choice … do they pay for shelter, electricity, heat, medication, health care or food?” Jakubowski said. “And they say, ‘Well, food is the thing I can go without.'”
Despite the possible correlation between Medicaid benefits and food, residents in rural towns were less worried about SNAP benefits and affordable housing. Residents in urban towns, however, were most worried about all the cuts. 
But overall, an overwhelming majority of Connecticut residents are anticipating the loss of housing, food and health care benefits for many people throughout the state.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_112-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 11:58:09.848621

On a quiet Sunday morning in September, I came across a legal notice referencing a rezoning request for several large rural parcels. The notice didn’t say much, but someone online mentioned it was for a massive data center campus. 
I froze. 
I’ve been following news about data centers across the country all year and even other parts of Michigan. 
I never imagined one would come here.
I posted the notice in a local Facebook group, hoping a few neighbors might know more. Within hours, hundreds of comments poured in. People were scared, confused, and unexpectedly united. Howell is a town where people rarely agree on anything, and yet most of us were uniting against this. The conversations were robust and civil. 
Then they were gone. Deleted from Facebook. 
Residents who live near the site told me they had no idea about the proposal until a letter arrived in the mail or a neighbor knocked on their door. I emailed the township asking for more information just two days after the notice appeared. I didn’t receive the documents until November 4 (seven weeks later) and only after submitting a FOIA request costing hundreds of dollars. What the emails revealed wasn’t necessarily illegal, but it was deeply troubling.
While the community was left in the dark, key conversations had already happened with a small handful of people. By the time the public learned about the project, the rezoning and site plan were already moving full speed ahead.

The landowner seeking the rezoning had helped township officials plan the logistics of the public meeting, including recommending that it be livestreamed, and strategized about keeping people outside under tents and letting them in the building one at a time. 
Safety and accessibility were barely mentioned and glow sticks were offered as the solution to safety concerns about people walking down a dark, curving, busy road in the dark. The emails also mentioned that the local utility company was pressuring him to make sure the hearing didn’t get postponed.
Public meetings are supposed to belong to the public. They are not supposed to be co-designed by the private party asking for a special deal.
No matter where someone stands on a project, that should bother all of us.










Good, solid, well thought-out projects don’t need secrecy, non disclosure agreements (NDAs), or fear of public pushback. Only bad ones do.


– Breanne Green - Howell resident and a leader of Stop the Data Centers Livingston County. 


And this situation isn’t unique to Howell Township. It’s happening across the state. Township halls in Pavilion, Augusta, Kalkaska, Dundee, Saline, and other communities have been filled beyond capacity with residents saying the same thing:
Slow down. Tell the truth. Respect our community.
Residents have good reason to be worried.
A single hyperscale data center can use as much electricity as 750,000-1,000,000 homes. Michigan’s utilities admit they’re being flooded with interest. Consumers Energy has received inquiries totaling 15 gigawatts of potential data center load; DTE another 7 gigawatts.
That’s 22 gigawatts – the equivalent of powering 16 million homes.
Independent experts estimate that even one 100-megawatt data center can require nearly $500 million in new power plants, battery farms, and grid upgrades.
If the company scales back or closes (as many tech projects have nationwide) those “stranded” costs don’t disappear. They get pushed onto all of us through higher electric bills.
And the water impacts are just as serious.
Data centers can use between one and five million gallons of water per day for cooling.
In Michigan, we like to think our freshwater supply is endless. It isn’t. The Alliance for the Great Lakes warns that heavy withdrawals and evaporating millions of gallons in cooling towers can stress aquifers, lower private wells, and affect nearby rivers.
Groundwater is connected. It doesn’t recognize property lines or promises in a rezoning packet.
Packed public information meeting concerning proposed Howell Township data center. Sept. 23, 2025 | Courtesy of Stop the Data Centers Livingston County.
Yet despite all these concerns, Howell Township residents were given just 14 days’ notice for the largest land-use proposal in recent county history. Planning commissioners didn’t receive much more than the public. One commissioner said he barely slept for two weeks trying to understand what was happening.
At the same time, the tech industry driving this boom is openly admitting it’s risky and unstable. Jeff Bezos has called the AI investment wave an “industrial bubble.” Mark Zuckerberg said he’d rather risk “misspending a couple hundred billion dollars” than fall behind. Even Michael Burry, the investor who correctly predicted the 2008 crash, has bet against major AI companies.
These billionaires see data centers as a gamble worth taking.
But for communities like Howell Township, the risks aren’t theoretical. We’re the ones staring down decades of construction, new power plants, battery farms, diesel generators, transmission lines, water withdrawals, noise, traffic, heat, and light. All this built to serve companies who may not be here in five years.
And when the bubble pops, they walk away.
As regulators plan for Michigan’s energy future, environmentalists speak out on data centers

We stay with the costs.
The good news is that when regular people stand together, it works, even across political lines.
Just across Lake Michigan in Caledonia, Wisconsin, residents pushed back on a proposed Microsoft data center, and even after receiving local approval, Microsoft abruptly withdrew citing “community feedback.” 
And in Port Washington and Menomonie, two more nearby communities, residents demanded transparency, and those projects ultimately stalled or paused.
The movement has become large enough that Microsoft now warns investors about “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent.”
One of the largest corporations on Earth is telling Wall Street that ordinary people in small towns can stop billion-dollar deals.
That shouldn’t scare us. It should empower us!
Here in Howell Township, thousands of residents are calling for a six-month moratorium on data center approvals.
This is not a ban. This is not “anti-technology.” It is simply a pause and the only ethical path forward.
A pause gives the township time to:

update zoning and ordinances
get independent environmental and infrastructure reviews
understand water, energy, noise, and emergency impacts
create rules that protect residents-not developers

If a project is truly good for us, it will still be good after careful study. Good, solid, well thought-out projects don’t need secrecy, non disclosure agreements (NDAs), or fear of public pushback. Only bad ones do.
I love this community. I love the people in it. And I believe in fairness, freedom, and local control. That means decisions made in the open, with honest information. It doesn’t mean rushed deals pushed by trillion-dollar corporations and utility companies who do not live here.
Something big is happening in Livingston County. But we are not powerless.
We are stronger when we stand together.  And the power is, and always has been, with the people. Now is the time to use it. Show up to the meetings. Give a public comment. This is our home. Our water. Our future. We will decide what happens here.

It’s the second highest cost burden for most American households, just below housing. (Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Despite the government reopening, Americans are still suffering from the chaos of an administration that is out of touch with the needs of the people.
Though federal workers are back on the job and agencies are resuming their work, countless essential programs are stalled or at risk, costing all of us by failing to invest in the services we need, like health care, housing, and transit.
Reopening the government is not the same as restarting the economy — and if Congress and the White House want to turn relief into momentum, they need to put real investment behind one of the strongest engines of growth we have: public transportation.
Public transportation is one of the best economic investments a government can make. Every $1 billion invested in public transit creates and supports more than 50,000 jobs, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
Strong transit networks attract businesses, get people to their jobs, and revitalize downtowns. Cities like Denver, Dallas, and Seattle have already seen how modern transit systems can spur billions in investment around new rail lines and stations.
Transportation also lies at the heart of our affordability crisis. It’s the second highest cost burden for most American households, just below housing.
But instead of addressing this head on, the administration is reneging on its funding obligations for projects of all types and threatening to further deplete investments that would give us more affordable options to get around. Across the country, bus lines are being cut, subway systems are aging, and commuter rail projects are stalled because federal funding remains uncertain or insufficient.
Which is why it is so troubling that the Trump administration is threatening to take the unprecedented step of gutting federal transit funding altogether in the next funding fight.
While this move may have the politically motivated goal of impacting larger transit systems in cities like New York and Los Angeles, what the administration does not realize is that the communities that would suffer the most are those with transit agencies who rely the most heavily on federal funding:.
These include small urban and rural agencies like the ones you’ll find in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, Flagstaff, Arizona, or Rocky Mount, North Carolina, where students rely on transit to get to class, warehouse workers rely on transit to get to work, and older adults rely on transit to remain independent and stay connected to their communities.
Washington’s next move should be clear: reject Trump’s plan to gut transit funding and pass a long-term, fully funded transit package.
That means investing in operating funding, supporting maintenance and modernization, and putting resources towards expansion, so that local and state partners aren’t left to carry the burden alone. The return on that investment isn’t abstract — it’s faster commutes, stronger local economies, and cleaner air.
But this will require political will from our leaders. It means resisting the easy allure of short-term fixes like formula funding for highway expansion and narrow discretionary grants for transit, and instead delivering the long-term funding for the infrastructure that makes cities thrive.
Federal and state governments must prioritize sustained, predictable funding for local transit agencies. At the local level, cities should redesign streets for buses, bikes, and pedestrians — not just cars.
The government is open again. Good. Now let’s keep the country moving — literally.
A nation that invests in its people’s ability to move freely and affordably is a nation that’s investing in its own growth. And we need that more than ever.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 14:55:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Stock trading by members of Congress could be banned in bipartisan push,Ashley Murray | States Newsroom,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/congress-ban-stock-trading-bills/,At least 25 bills have been introduced this Congress to further limit lawmakers and their family members from trading individual stocks.,"WASHINGTON — At least 25 bills have been introduced this Congress to further limit lawmakers and their family members from trading individual stocks, and representatives across the aisle renewed pressure Wednesday on U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson to take up the issue.
Their contention is members of Congress hold a serious advantage over everyday Americans when buying and selling stocks because of their access to information on Capitol Hill.
The House Committee on Administration convened Wednesday morning to hear how existing guardrails laid out in the 2012 STOCK Act fall short and consider the options to revamp it.
The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, shortened to the STOCK Act, codified that members of Congress, congressional employees and other federal officials are not exempt from federal insider trading laws. 
The law also required that lawmakers and certain congressional staffers must disclose stock transactions that amount to over $1,000 within 45 days.
The law built upon the late 1970s-era Ethics in Government Act that established financial disclosure requirements for officials in all three branches of government.
“While rules already govern how public officials trade stocks, stronger restrictions may be necessary to restore trust and ensure officials are not profiting from their positions,” said Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis.
Ranking member Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., said that he “unequivocally” supports a ban on members of Congress trading individual stocks and “that ban should extend to the co-equal branches of government as well.”
Law seen as ineffective
Policy experts before the committee poked holes in the protective measures already on the books.
“Despite allegations of improper conduct, no member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the (STOCK) Act, nor do any public records exist indicating that officials have ever paid statutory fines for STOCK Act disclosure errors,” said James Copland, senior fellow and director of legal policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute. 
Trust in lawmakers and government officials to self-police is eroding, argued the experts and several committee members. 
Roughly 86% of the public across party lines wants to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks, according to a 2023 survey from the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.
Dan Savickas, vice president of policy and government affairs for the advocacy group Taxpayers Protection Alliance, said data collected by stock activity trackers and journalists reveals Congress’ sticky entanglement with the market. 
According to a January 2024 report from Unusual Whales, a platform that monitors lawmakers’ stock transactions, dozens of members who traded in 2023 outperformed the S&P 500 Index. 
A New York Times investigation published in 2022 found 3,700 stock transactions by members of Congress from both parties from 2019 to 2021 “posed potential conflicts between their public responsibilities and private finances.” 
Savickas said a number of issues exist in the law’s current form, not least of which is that the STOCK Act “does not prevent conflicted trading by members of Congress, but merely requires them to report when and if they do so.”
Plus, many report them late without consequence, he added. Additionally, a violation is only subject to a $200 penalty and enforcement is left up to the executive branch, leaving it vulnerable to subjectivity and politics, Savickas said.
Some members of the committee questioned how lawmakers would be taxed should they be forced to divest, and how to navigate specific family investments. That included Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., whose family owns 20% of a community swimming pool he and his family have long used.
“How do we make sure that we’re not eliminating me or making me sell something that I feel strongly about? This has been part of my childhood, part of all my kids’ childhoods,” Griffith said, adding that his son coached the local swim team to the championships last year.
“How do we protect that while curing the ills of people who are trying to do bad things?”
‘As crooked as a dog’s leg’
During a press conference ahead of the hearing, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said “this place is as crooked as a dog’s leg, and it needs to stop.”
Burchett joined Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., in urging Johnson to bring to the floor the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a bill joining together several members’ proposals from this year.
The bill would prohibit Congress members, their spouses, and any dependent children and trustees from owning, buying or selling securities, commodities, futures and certain other assets. If enacted, a lawmaker and their family members would have 180 days to divest. Those newly elected would have a 90-day timeline to do so. The ban would not apply to diversified funds.
“Everybody standing here along with a number of others have been working on this issue for some time,” Magaziner told reporters. 
“We all worked together over the course of the summer to come up with a single, unified bill. So we have one bill, one strategy, and now it is on leadership to get this done and give us a vote,” he continued.
Other leaders on the issue who’ve signed onto the joint effort include Reps. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., Chip Roy, R-Texas, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Joe Neguse, D-Colo. Nearly 80 others signed as cosponsors in addition to the 16 original names.
Fitzpatrick said lawmakers “have to get this done, we will get this done this Congress.”
“Mark my words, this bill, or a bill, will come to the floor, hopefully through an open amendment process where we can make this better,” Fitzpatrick told reporters.
“If we are all willing to accept the premise, and I hope everyone is, that members of Congress unequivocally have access to inside information — we do — if you accept that premise then we have to do something on the stock trading front,” he continued.
Johnson timeline for action
When asked by States Newsroom if Johnson has a timeline for bringing any of the proposals to the floor, a spokesperson responded in an email, “We’ll defer to House Admin (committee) for the time being whether they plan to markup a bill etc.”
Johnson told Punchbowl News in September that a stock trading ban bill is “a tough issue.”
In May, Johnson said he worried whether a ban would affect who could serve in Congress because salaries haven’t risen in several years.
“But on balance, my view is we probably should do that because I think it’s been abused in the past and I think, sadly, a few bad actors discolor it for everyone,” he said.

A federal three-judge panel heard arguments in a Winston-Salem courtroom Wednesday about the new congressional districts in eastern and northeastern North Carolina that Republicans adopted in October. Opponents want the judges to block the new districts from being used next year. 
Republicans want to make sure that the 1st Congressional District, which has been represented by a Black Democrat for more than three decades, will elect a Republican next year. 
Republican President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat, both narrowly won the 1st District last year. It was considered the state’s only competitive congressional district before it was redrawn.
Hilary Harris Klein, a lawyer representing the North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause and individual voters, argued that the redistricting deliberately targeted the people in that district for how they voted in 2024, and for bringing a lawsuit against congressional and legislative districts used last year. 
“This is an unprecedented escalation,” she said. “This has created a new kind of harm.”
North Carolina is part of a national wave of redistricting instigated by Trump. He wants Republican states to create more GOP congressional districts in time for the midterms to prevent Democrats from taking the majority in the U.S. House.  
States redistrict after each census, and more often if courts require it. This is the first time North Carolina has redistricted at a president’s explicit request. 
The new North Carolina congressional map was designed to elect 11 Republicans and three Democrats. The current congressional delegation has 10 Republicans and four Democrats. 
Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), who was in charge of drawing the districts, was the hearing’s only witness. No racial data was used to create the plan, he said.
“We undertook the process to improve the partisan advantage for Republicans,” Hise said. 
Klein argued that if allowed, Republicans would be able to redistrict after every election if they don’t like the results. 
“It can create an infinity loop that will forever frustrate judicial review,” she said.

The judges, all Republican appointees, had pointed questions for Klein and Lalitha Madduri, who represents a separate group of voters. 
State and federal courts have declared that they will not consider cases claiming partisan gerrymandering. Klein was asked repeatedly how the harm to voters she described differs from any harms from partisan gerrymandering the courts allow. 
Klein said this year’s redistricting is different because legislators had no legitimate reason to do it. “The only reason they did it was to hurt our clients” and other voters, she said. 
Meantime, Madduri argued that the census data used to draw the districts is old, so the districts are out of proportion. The main reason states redraw district boundaries every 10 years after the census is to make the district populations as close to equal as possible. 
However, Madduri could not say how far out of balance the districts have become. 
Judge Thomas Schroeder suggested that the novelty of the retaliation argument would work against opponents’ efforts to have the map blocked until the case can be tried. They have to show a likelihood of success on the merits to win a preliminary injunction.

She is pictured here in 2021. (Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — For nearly 20 weeks, certain lawyers, paralegals, psychologists, interpreters, court reporters and investigators were not paid.
Federal funding for a group of criminal justice professionals expired in early July, and the government promised to reimburse them in October, but the longest shutdown in U.S. history delayed that promise.
As of Nov. 14, the government racked up a $682,598 bill owed to appointed federal defense attorneys, experts and service providers in Kansas alone. It is a fraction of the $70 million in unpaid vouchers across the country.
The delayed payments are a symptom of years of inadequate funding, resulting in understaffed public defender offices, financially strained panel attorneys and apprehension at the integrity of constitutional rights for people charged with federal crimes.
It is a crisis that isn’t solely financial. It is constitutional, said Dionne Scherff, a criminal defense attorney and the Kansas representative on the Criminal Justice Act panel, which is made up of private attorneys who take on indigent defense cases when federal public defenders cannot.
Scherff is one of roughly 60 attorneys who are appointed to federal criminal cases in Topeka, Kansas City and Wichita if public defenders can’t take on additional caseloads or run into conflicts. Without funding, critical service providers such as interpreters and court reporters have continued to work without pay, as have attorneys.
One Kansas attorney drew from a personal line of credit and retirement funds to keep a law office open and pay living expenses, according to a Sept. 10 letter to the Kansas congressional delegation.
“The smart economical and constitutional thing to do would be to fund it on the front end,” Scherff said.
In Congress’ legislation to end the shutdown, it carved out nearly $1.6 million for federal public defenders. That was about $200 million below defenders’ request, but it will make available the $70 million owed in back pay to panel attorneys. Payments are being processed and are expected to land in attorneys’ and service providers’ bank accounts this week.
However, the stopgap measure doesn’t carry public defenders and panel attorneys through the end of the fiscal year next October. It gets them to Jan. 30.
 
‘Crisis will come sooner’
The payment freeze is the longest since 2013, when panel attorneys and service providers went five weeks without pay. It caused constitutional violations and cracks in the criminal justice system.
In California, a federal judge tossed out a criminal case, finding that the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated.
“The right to effective assistance of counsel is a bedrock principle of this country and is indisputably necessary for the operation of a fair criminal justice system,” said Judge John Mendez of the Eastern District of California in a Nov. 12 ruling.
The case’s defendant was indicted last year on one count of methamphetamine distribution. He argued the lack of funding created an “untenable conflict between counsel’s professional obligations and their basic economic survival.” A jury trial was scheduled for January.
The Sixth Amendment doesn’t just articulate assistance of counsel but “effective assistance of counsel,” Mendez wrote.
The appropriate way to remedy “this chronic constitutional violation,” he said, was to dismiss the defendant’s indictment.
“To expect defense counsel to properly prepare for trial, while consistently denying her the tools to do so is, in this court’s view, not only unconscionable but also unconstitutional,” Mendez said.
In New Mexico, a group of Criminal Justice Act panel attorneys informed a federal judge that they would no longer accept new cases. They wrote in the Nov. 5 letter that the lack of funding placed “untenable strain” on attorneys and contractors who provide expert services.
“The more CJA cases we take on, the more harm we risk doing to our existing CJA clients because that means more time spent on other work for income streams and less time available to our indigent clients,” the attorneys wrote.
They said 2026 will be worse, predicting funding will run out even sooner than this year’s date of July 3.
Melody Brannon, the federal public defender for Kansas, agreed.
“The crisis will come sooner,” she said.
Inadequate funding is a shortsighted move, said Brannon, who also signed the letter to Kansas’ congressional delegation. Bills will come due and costs will rise later, culminating in a more expensive approach, she said.
“Budgets are moral documents,” she said. “Budgets reflect our values.”
Underfunding threatens the criminal justice system’s credibility, and it further erodes the confidence of clients, their families and the public, and choosing to continue to underfund federal public defenders reflects a society that is not valuing its most vulnerable members, Brannon said.
 
‘Justice is blind’
Federal public defenders and panel attorneys do not choose their cases. More than 90% of people charged in federal court are appointed an attorney.
”We’re standing in a line and ready to do a job because individuals — whether they’re charged with child pornography or a Jan. 6 incident or charged with a bank robbery — it actually does not matter to us,” Scherff said. “We don’t look at it with a political lens.”
It is expected, constitutionally and ethically, that panel attorneys and public defenders take a case and defend it vigorously, Scherff said.
“Justice is blind in that sense,” she said.
But, she added, clients suffer when Kansas panel attorneys resign because of no pay and more vow to leave if funding pitfalls continue.
If Jan. 30 arrives without full funding, federal public defenders, which have been under a hiring freeze for the past two years, will return to a state where they become strained when panel attorneys cannot take on new cases, Brannon said.
“And then,” she said, “what happens when someone comes to court and there is no attorney there to take that case?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/065A9854-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-11-20 09:58:32.691778

This year's Alaska Division of Oil and Gas North Slope areawide lease sale drew brisk bidding and netted about $17 million, according to results released on Wednesday. (Photo by Craig McCaa/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)The state’s annual North Slope oil and gas lease sale drew brisk bidding that was dominated by small independent companies, some of which were new entrants to Alaska, officials reported on Wednesday.
The Division of Oil and Gas said nine companies submitted a combined $16.97 million in high bids for 271 onshore tracts in the central North Slope.
It was the most tracts sold in a North Slope lease sale since the annual areawide leasing program started in 1999, and it was the highest amount of money submitted in high bids since 2014, when 254 North Slope tracts were sold for $39.85 million.
The sale had offered 3,121 tracts over about 5 million state-owned acres.
In a statement, John Crowther, acting commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, said the sale results show evidence of a continuing North Slope oil “renaissance.”
“Over the last decade we’ve seen significant exploration, major new discoveries, and more and more acres under lease — and today projects with significant new production are on the verge of coming online. Now we have a record-setting lease sale at the same time we’re heading into one of the busiest construction seasons on the Slope in years. The future is bright,” Crowther said in the statement, which was released by DNR.
Surprise Valley Resources, a Texas-based independent, was the top bidder, picking up 116 tracts for about $8 million in total, according to preliminary results. The company entered Alaska last year, submitting winning bids on 41 tracts in the 2024 areawide North Slope lease sale.
Texas-based Burgundy Xploration, an independent that has previously invested in Alaska, was second on the list, picking up 57 tracts for about $2 million.
Several other small companies acquired tracts in the lease sale, including some newcomers to Alaska: Duncan Resources LLC and Frontier Exploration LLC.
But some established energy companies participated as well.
Oil Search (Alaska) LLC and Repsol were also significant bidders. Repsol, which is based in Spain, picked up 45 tracts in areas south of the Kuparuk River field, according to the preliminary results. Oil Search (Alaska) LLC, which is owned by Australia-based Santos but which is still registered in Alaska as a lease-holding entity under that name, picked up 22 tracts, mostly adjacent to its existing and under-development Horseshoe Unit. Horseshoe is near the Pikka Unit, in which Santos and Repsol are partners.
The Pikka field is expected to start producing oil next spring, a Santos vice president told a conference audience in Anchorage in August. After a first phase of development, with production estimated at 80,000 barrels per day for a few years, a second phase is expected to result in peak production of 120,000 barrels per day, according to Santos, the unit’s operator.
In the DNR statement, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said the Trump administration deserves some of the credit for the successful North Slope lease sale.
“From new Alaska-based explorers to long-established global producers, companies are stepping up because they recognize the tremendous opportunities our state offers. The Trump Administration’s commitment to responsible resource development is helping unlock those opportunities,” Dunleavy said in the statement.
The state’s two other annual Arctic oil and gas lease sales, with results also announced on Wednesday, drew more muted responses.
The Brooks Range Foothills sale, which offered 813 tracts over 4.3 million acres, attracted seven bids for a total of $200,581.92. All were from AK Frontier Energy LLC., another new entrant. The Anchorage-based company was registered Nov. 6.
The Beaufort Sea sale, which offered 570 tracts over 1.7 million state-owned offshore acres, attracted nine bids for a total of $364,346.10. All were from Samuel Cade, an Alaska investor who frequently participates in state lease sales.

Photo by TW Farlow/Getty Images.Minnesotans stared at their screens in horror last June as the raging Blue Earth River swallowed a beloved country store near Mankato. The same flood badly damaged a nearby dam and caused well over $1 billion dollars in damage across 22 southern Minnesota counties.
It was one of more than 60 billion-dollar weather disasters to hit the state over the past 45 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About 20 of those have struck since 2021, laying bare the real-world stakes of a warmer, wetter Upper Midwest.
As the Trump administration sits out an annual United Nations climate change meeting in Brazil that could (maybe) produce a detailed roadmap to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels, local governments in Minnesota and across the U.S. are preparing for more extreme weather to come.
At least 22 Minnesota city, county, regional and tribal governments have published “climate action” or resilience plans to mitigate the human and financial costs of future weather disasters, according to a report out Tuesday from Josefina Hajek-Herrera, a fellow with the Building Power Resource Center and climate policy consultant.
They include Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester, Duluth and 12 other communities with more than 10,000 Minnesotans. Mankato published its own climate action plan less than a year after the June 2024 flood inundated low-lying parts of town.
State Sen. Jen McEwan, DFL-Duluth, said during a call — hosted by report sponsors 100%, an environmental justice nonprofit, and Building Power Resource Center — that the infrastructure-busting impacts of extreme weather are apparent even in her purported “climate change haven” hometown. 
In June 2012, Duluth received over seven inches of rain in less than 48 hours, tearing up hillside roads and sewers. Powerful storms damaged Duluth’s popular Lakewalk a few years later, spurring a major fortification project set to begin construction in 2026.
“(Those floods) woke up a lot of people to the fact that climate change is happening now, in real time,” McEwan said.
The planning push comes as President Trump rolls back ambitious environmental laws, regulations and programs enacted under former President Biden. The Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress have canceled billions in federal grants to help local governments reduce pollution and harden infrastructure against extreme weather. Billions more remain in legal limbo, including $7 billion in renewable energy funding for lower-income communities — which the Biden administration said would cut energy bills for 900,000 households — and nearly $1 billion for “pre-disaster” mitigation projects.
“What we’re seeing at the federal level is a morally indefensible and astronomically ignorant approach to energy and climate action,” DFL State Rep. Larry Kraft said on the call. Minnesota cities, he added, “can pick up the slack.”
Municipal planning staff or outside consultants take the lead on climate action planning, often with substantial input from residents, businesses and community groups. Most plans detail a mix of shorter- and longer-term goals to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, such as by purchasing renewable power, installing high-efficiency electric heating at city facilities and adding electric vehicles to city fleets. 
Those goals mirror or in some cases front-run Minnesota’s statutory mandate for statewide carbon neutrality by 2050. In that sense, the plans put a local spin on what state law already requires over the next 25 years. Given the vast scale of human-caused climate change, however, their direct planetary impact will be negligible.
In recognition that the costs of climate change are already piling up, all but one of the 10 climate action plans released since 2022 contain “climate vulnerability assessments” that identify populations and infrastructure most at risk from extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, food insecurity and high energy costs, Hajek-Herrera said in the report. 
The report hails successes like St. Paul’s jargon-free Climate Action Dashboard, which shows progress toward its 2030 goal of carbon-neutrality in city operations across city-led initiatives like electric heating at Como Park Zoo and Conservatory and the new, ultra-low-impact North End Community Center. 
On the call, Diana Chaman Salas, Hennepin County climate and resiliency department director, ticked off some of her employer’s accomplishments: a 10% cut to miles driven by county vehicles, a comparable reduction in county departments’ electricity use from onsite solar power by 2027 and enough community garden capacity to feed 1,000 people last year.
But recent plans’ focus on “cross-jurisdictional relationships” relating to transportation, education, renewable energy development and other projects offer tacit acknowledgement that local governments can’t do everything on their own.
St. Paul admits its fleet electrification plan has been held back by slow deployment of public charging infrastructure. Grand Marais fell behind on its building electrification goals earlier this decade due in part to a local shortage of qualified heat pump technicians, Hajek-Herrera said in the report. Electric grid constraints and red tape around key grant programs have stymied Northfield’s ambitious plans for solar arrays on public property. 
And formidable funding challenges — made worse by the federal government’s war on clean energy and climate science — loom over the entire enterprise.
“Ongoing uncertainty in federal climate policy further underscores the necessity for sustained and enhanced state-level support to bridge implementation gaps and strengthen local capacity,” Hajek-Herrera said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/electricschoolbus-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 09:58:32.691778

Read this story in English.
La Cámara de Representantes y el Senado aprobaron la semana pasada un amplio proyecto de ley de vivienda para reemplazar uno similar que el Gobernador Ned Lamont vetó tras la sesión ordinaria.
El Proyecto de Ley 8002 de la Cámara de Representantes exige a los municipios la creación de planes de desarrollo urbanístico, modifica los requisitos mínimos de estacionamiento fuera de la vía pública, amplía las comisiones de alquiler justo e incentiva a los municipios a tomar medidas para permitir la construcción de más viviendas, entre otras medidas.
Su principal objetivo es facilitar la construcción de más viviendas en Connecticut. El costo de la vivienda ha aumentado y la falta de vivienda se ha incrementado en los últimos años. Los expertos afirman que no se han construido suficientes viviendas en Connecticut para satisfacer la demanda, lo que ha agravado estos y otros problemas.
Se espera que Lamont firme el nuevo proyecto de ley, que ayudó a negociar con los líderes locales.
A continuación, un resumen de lo ocurrido en materia de legislación de vivienda durante la sesión extraordinaria de la semana pasada.
¿Por qué se convocó una sesión extraordinaria?
Durante la sesión ordinaria, la legislatura aprobó un ambicioso proyecto de ley de vivienda conocido como Proyecto de Ley 5002 de la Cámara de Representantes, pero Lamont lo vetó tras la oposición de los líderes locales. Afirmó que quería encontrar la manera de lograr su apoyo.
Después de meses de trabajo en una nueva versión del proyecto de ley, Lamont convocó a la legislatura a una sesión extraordinaria de dos días. La Cámara de Representantes se reunió el miércoles y el Senado el jueves. Aprobaron el proyecto de ley de vivienda, además de otros tres proyectos de ley.
Lamont ha elogiado el nuevo proyecto de ley porque los líderes locales, que se oponían mayoritariamente al anterior, lo han respaldado. Un grupo bipartidista de alcaldes y primeros ediles hablaron en una rueda de prensa en apoyo del nuevo proyecto de ley.
Los Demócratas afirmaron que querían que se aprobara un proyecto de ley para satisfacer la necesidad de más viviendas lo antes posible, mientras que los Republicanos criticaron la sesión extraordinaria, argumentando que el proyecto de ley debería haberse presentado en la sesión ordinaria, cuando el público podría leerlo y opinar.
¿Qué cambiará en la zonificación de mi ciudad?
Algunos aspectos aún no están claros y dependen de su municipio. El proyecto de ley exige a los municipios la creación de planes de desarrollo urbanístico, con objetivos específicos sobre la cantidad de viviendas que planificarán y la zonificación correspondiente.
Si los municipios elaboran estos planes o toman medidas para aumentar la vivienda cerca de estaciones de tren y autobús o en el centro de las ciudades, tendrán acceso a un nuevo fondo estatal y podrán obtener un mayor reembolso estatal por los gastos en construcción de escuelas.
El proyecto de ley también establece que los municipios no pueden exigir a los promotores que construyan nuevos apartamentos con menos de 16 unidades que incluyan estacionamiento fuera de la vía pública, con algunas excepciones.
Los Demócratas y los defensores de la vivienda afirman que estas medidas incentivarán a los municipios a construir más viviendas, ya que muchas normativas locales de zonificación dificultan la construcción de apartamentos. Los Republicanos temen que esto reduzca la autonomía local.
¿Qué más incluye el proyecto de ley?
Este es un proyecto de ley extenso que aborda diversos temas. Amplía el número de comisiones de alquiler justo, un organismo gubernamental que puede atender quejas sobre aumentos de alquiler y decidir si se modifica el monto de dicho aumento.
Prohíbe la “arquitectura hostil”, es decir, el uso de elementos como reposabrazos en el centro de los bancos o pinches que dificulten que las personas sin hogar se acuesten.
También establece el Departamento de Vivienda de Connecticut como autoridad estatal de vivienda, lo que significa que puede colaborar con los municipios para construir más viviendas y edificar en terrenos estatales.
¿En qué se diferencia del proyecto de ley anterior?
Este proyecto de ley tiene muchas similitudes con el anterior. Muchos Demócratas que trabajaron en él afirmaron que la mayor parte se ha mantenido igual; los cambios se centran principalmente en las disposiciones sobre zonificación.
Una diferencia es la creación del fondo estatal para incentivar a los municipios a participar en los programas para aumentar la cantidad de viviendas cerca del transporte público y en los centros urbanos. El proyecto de ley anterior incluía medidas que priorizaban la financiación de ciertas infraestructuras existentes para los municipios que decidieran realizar determinados cambios en la zonificación.
Además, elimina el proceso conocido como “cuota equitativa”, que asignaba a cada municipio un número específico de unidades para planificar y zonificar. En su lugar, los consejos regionales de gobierno determinarán cuántas unidades necesita planificar cada municipio. Los municipios pueden participar en los planes de los Concejos de Gobierno de Connecticut (COG) o crear sus propios planes y objetivos.

In October, an immigrant truck driver — who federal authorities alleged does not have legal status — killed three people in an Ontario car crash. In a letter sent last week, the U.S. Transportation Department’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration claimed the collision “may have been avoided,” if California had complied with new federal rules — rules that could also lead to 61,000 truck drivers in California losing their licenses.
As CalMatters’ Adam Echelman explains, before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, non-citizen immigrants, such as refugees and asylum seekers, were allowed by the federal government to carry trucking licenses. More than 720,000 trucking licenses are active in California, with about 61,000, or 8%, belonging to non-citizen immigrants. 
But in September, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued new regulations prohibiting certain immigrants from holding commercial trucking licenses — and singled out California in the process.
After claiming that the transportation department conducted a “nationwide audit” of trucking policies, Duffy threatened to withhold $160 million, or roughly 4% of the state’s federal highway safety funds, from California due to alleged violations.

Duffy, in a September statement: “California’s reckless disregard is frankly disgusting and an affront to the millions of Americans who expect us to keep them safe.”

Duffy, in that same statement, argued that issuing licenses to “dangerous foreign drivers” threatens “the safety of every family on the road.” Yet, in publishing the new regulations, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also acknowledged that there’s not enough evidence to prove that certain kinds of immigrants drive more dangerously than others. 
The transportation department also said it won’t award the state $40 million from a separate federal grant because it claims that California is failing to enforce English-language proficiency guidelines for truck drivers.
If California rescinded the trucking licenses from all its non-citizens, the sudden drop in truckers could result in increased shipping costs, experts say. California’s trucking industry could also take a hit: Despite the explosive growth of online retailers in the last decade, which has helped expand the trucking industry, trucking companies still struggle to retain workers who are willing to work the long hours and receive the low pay that entry-level positions offer.

Budget outlook looks familiar

California is likely to remain in the red for next year, according to the latest analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
California will likely face a $17.7 billion budget gap in the new fiscal year, which could grow to an annual $35 billion by 2027-28 as spending continues to grow, the report finds. 
This is the fourth year in a row during Gov. Gavin Newsom’s governorship that the state is projected to have a deficit despite increasing its revenue. Between just July and October, the state exceeded projected tax revenue by $6 billion — mostly powered by the fanfare around artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley — but nearly all of that will go toward K-12 schools, community colleges and state reserves, the office said.
Assembly Budget chairperson Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat, said the committee “remains committed to crafting a responsible budget.” But the vice chairperson of the budget committee in the Senate, Republican Sen. Roger Niello of Roseville, blamed the structural deficit on Democrats’ “unstoppable spending problems.”

Zoning lawsuit won’t reach Supreme Court

From CalMatters housing reporter Ben Christopher: 
East Palo Alto settled a lawsuit challenging its “inclusionary zoning” policy, ruling out — for now — the possibility that a federal court might find it, and similar programs across the country, unconstitutional.
Like nearly 150 jurisdictions across California, the Bay Area city requires developers of new multifamily housing to either set aside some units for lower income tenants or pay a fee to the city’s affordable housing fund.
The case began with local couple Wesley and Angela Yu who decided to split their lot and build two units on the new parcel. The city required them to sell or rent one out at below-market rates or pay $54,891.
The Yus sued with the help of the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation, arguing that the policy violates the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on the seizure of property without compensation. The case’s backers believed the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority would see things the same way should the suit ever make it that far.
It won’t. Shortly after the suit was filed, East Palo Alto’s city council voted to exempt lot splits like the Yus’ from the policy. On Tuesday, they formally settled the case.
Pacific Legal settled a similar challenge in Healdsburg last year and has pending challenges to inclusionary zoning rules in Denver, Colorado and Jackson, Wyoming.

Senate Joint Resolution 1 was introduced in the 11th hour of the 36th Special Session, which ended Wednesday on day seven.
As a resolution, it is not subject to a gubernatorial veto. It is also not subject to the state law requiring the Legislature to only consider topics included in the governor’s proclamation.
Proposed constitutional amendments initiated by state lawmakers must pass (as resolutions) in two consecutive legislative sessions. SJR1’s passage during a special session effectively shortens that timeline.
The resolution will now return to the 2027 Legislative Session for consideration. If passed by state lawmakers again, it will appear on general election ballots in 2028 for final approval by voters.
The resolution passed both houses on party lines.
In the Senate, the 12 Democrats present voted for it, and the four Republicans present opposed. In the Assembly, the 26 Democrats present supported and the nine Republicans opposed. Seven members of the chamber were absent.
When asked about the timing of the resolution’s introduction, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said that the Legislature had been prioritizing bills because they needed committee hearings and floor votes.
“This was somebody that we had ready to go,” she added.

One day prior, a bipartisan supermajority of state lawmakers formally petitioned to add their own topic to an ongoing special session.
Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen and Assemblymember Alexis Hansen, who are married, negotiated with Democrats to force one of their own priorities to be considered. That priority: Limiting the purchasing power of corporate owners.
A 2025 regular session bill sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal was resurrected as Senate Bill 10 for the special session. It was heard in a joint committee of the Senate and Assembly Wednesday morning.
As expected, Ira Hansen voted with Democrats to pass the bill out of the upper chamber. Then, in an emotional floor statement, Alexis Hansen announced she would not vote for the bill despite being a part of the petition to have the bill considered.
The Hansens left their respective floors shortly after their notes. Neither was there for the SJR1 votes.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08784-Edited-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 09:58:32.691778
,California,2025-11-20 13:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,"He built a nursing home empire despite state investigations. Now, lawsuits are piling up",Jocelyn Wiener,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/11/nursing-home-shlomo-rechnitz/,"California nursing home owner Shlomo Rechnitz received a batch of state licenses in 2023 despite past scrutiny from the attorney general's office and the state auditor. Today, his companies are facing half a dozen lawsuits over patient care.","In February 2024, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $2.34 million to an 84-year-old nursing home resident named Betsy Jentz, finding that the facility had violated her rights on 132 occasions, at times leading to serious injuries.
Six months later, an Alameda County jury found another facility had violated the rights of 71-year-old James Doherty, Sr. more than 1,400 times. That included seven instances in which staff failed to transport him, causing him to miss chemotherapy treatments, court documents said. Doherty died following the development of a large pressure sore. His family was awarded $7.6 million.
In February, a jury in Shasta County is scheduled to hear a case against a nursing home accused of negligence in the 2020 COVID-19 deaths of 24 patients. 
And next spring, trial is scheduled to begin in the case of a 79-year-old dementia patient, referred to as Cheryl Doe, who was allegedly raped twice in another Alameda County facility; a second case against the same facility alleges that excessive sedation of 64-year-old Alando Williams led to his death.
All of these facilities have one thing in common: state records list Shlomo Rechnitz as an owner.
Court documents show Rechnitz and his companies have denied all allegations in all of the cases. Mark Johnson, an attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities and one of his main companies, Brius LLC, said in an email that facilities cannot comment on active litigation. 
“It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care,” he said. 
Johnson sought to distance his clients from the cases, saying that Rechnitz and his wife, Tamar, “are passive owners of the facilities” and have “absolutely no role in operations or management.” Johnson said “the licensees” contract with a company to manage the facilities, adding that  “each facility has all the necessary resources for patients and staff.”
Rechnitz has been on the state’s radar for years. In 2014, then-Attorney General Kamala Harris attempted to prevent him from purchasing new homes. In 2018, the State Auditor’s Office found his companies had significantly higher rates of federal deficiencies and complaints than the rest of the state’s care facilities.

In 2021, a CalMatters investigation documented that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status for seven years after he acquired the homes. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses to them. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.
Now elder care advocates say he is Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health are failing some of California’s most vulnerable citizens. They say the state could push for greater accountability, including withholding licenses from owners they deem to be bad actors.
Wendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”
York brought the lawsuit in 2021 alleging that one of Rechnitz’ companies’ facilities, Windsor Redding Care Center, was responsible for the COVID-related deaths of some 24 elderly and dependent residents. Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, previously said the company “vehemently” disagrees with the allegations in the case, which is headed to trial early next year.
There are “government agencies who are responsible for their oversight,” York said, but “at the end of the day, it feels like we’re the ones who are doing the enforcement.”
Johnson called it “crucial to note that California is one of the only states in the country to provide zero liability protection for healthcare providers during the unprecedented pandemic.”
“This is particularly noteworthy since nursing homes were the front line in trying to protect our frail and elderly,” he said.
At least one of the cases against Rechnitz’ facilities includes allegations about his own conduct. A man suing Rechnitz and his companies over a relative’s injuries wrote in a sworn declaration filed in court that Rechnitz attempted to intimidate and bribe him with Lakers tickets during an unexpected phone call on the eve of his scheduled testimony in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
Johnson, the attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities, called allegations about threats “completely false and defamatory.” A judge ruled the conversation could not be introduced as evidence.

In another case, Rechnitz and his wife Tamar in discovery disclosed their net worth: $786 million. 
Tony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said that dollar figure hasn’t been divulged publicly before.
 “At least in some of these chains, the money that was meant to go for patient care is being stripped away and sent up top to the ownership,” he said.
Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, did not comment on the disclosure of the family’s wealth when CalMatters asked him.
‘Heightened monitoring’ for two years
The Department of Public Health has for years refused CalMatters’ requests for an interview about licensing issues related to Rechnitz’ companies’ homes. They again declined requests for an interview for this story. They did not provide a reason. 
Instead, spokesman Mark Smith, said in an emailed statement that the department “remains committed to transparency and accountability for all providers, and to the health and safety of all nursing home residents in California.” In response to CalMatters’ questions about facilities in which Rechnitz is listed as an owner, Smith noted that the department had “negotiated for and obtained heightened monitoring authority and additional enforcement powers, beyond those applicable to other skilled nursing facilities, for a period of two years at 24 of this provider’s locations.” 
That period has ended.
“This does not mean our department will avoid holding this provider or their facilities accountable,” he said. “We will continue to monitor these locations as appropriate, enforce and cite for regulatory violations if needed, and take further corrective action if necessary.”
A CalMatters analysis of data from both the state health department and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found 78 California facilities in which Shlomo Rechnitz or his wife, Tamar, were listed as having an ownership stake. On average the facilities fared poorly on several key quality metrics compared to the state overall. 

In the past three years, the 78 nursing homes received an average of 12.4 citations for facility-reported incidents, compared with 6.1 for all nursing homes statewide.
A higher proportion of these facilities has received a federal fine in the last three years than the state’s overall rate. Two-thirds of the facilities received at least one federal fine in the last three years, compared to half of all facilities across the state.
The facilities have been fined an average of $47,897 during the last three years, compared to an average of $29,573 for all California facilities.
The facilities had comparably low federal quality ratings: Almost 58% of these facilities had recent ratings of one or two stars (out of five), compared with slightly over 37% of facilities statewide.

Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, noted in his email that a large percentage of these facilities are located in Los Angeles County, which he said issues deficiencies at a higher rate than any county in California, many of which are overturned on appeal.
He also said that “Mr. Rechnitz’ facilities self-report at a significantly higher rate than other comparable facilities,” which, in turn, could lead them to have a higher number of deficiencies.
Kamala Harris’ intervention
Back in 2014, Rechnitz bid on 18 Country Villa nursing homes in federal bankruptcy court. Then Attorney General Harris was so concerned with his track record that she filed an emergency motion to prevent him from purchasing or managing the homes, describing him as “a serial violator of rules within the skilled nursing industry.” At the time, Rechnitz’ attorney characterized the remarks as “defamatory” and “outrageous.”  
The purchase went through. 
Rechnitz then submitted change-of-ownership applications seeking licenses to run those homes. Rather than approving or denying them, CalMatters found that the state Department of Public Health simply left his applications in “pending” status for years. Despite that, his companies were allowed to continue operating the homes.
In 2015, he applied for licenses for five Windsor nursing homes. The next year, the department denied the change of ownership applications, but again allowed Rechnitz’ companies to operate them. 
In her scathing 2018 report, the state auditor Elaine Howle criticized the California Department of Public Health, saying weak oversight and licensing lapses increased risk to nursing home residents. 
In an effort to address these issues, the Legislature passed a law in 2022 to close a loophole that had allowed nursing home operators to run facilities without first receiving licenses. The law required the Department of Public Health to look at an applicant’s track record over several years before granting a license.
But before that law took effect the following year, the Department of Public Health suddenly granted Rechnitz and his companies many of the licenses it had previously left pending or outright denied. The group includes nursing homes that were the focus of recent lawsuits, such as Country Villa Wilshire, the Los Angeles-area facility where a jury awarded $2.34 million after a woman allegedly fell repeatedly due to understaffing; Windsor Redding, where the 24 patients died during a COVID outbreak; and Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland, where complaints filed in Alameda County Superior Court allege a woman was sexually assaulted twice and a man died after being given too much medication.
Ed Dudensing, a Sacramento-based attorney who specializes in elder abuse in nursing homes, is bringing the case in Alameda County Superior Court alleging that neglect and poor staffing allowed a fellow patient to rape 79-year-old Cheryl Doe on multiple occasions while she stayed at Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland. He is also representing the family of 64-year-old Alando Williams in the lawsuit against the same facility alleging overmedication and wrongful death.
Dudensing has three other active cases against facilities affiliated with Rechnitz and his web of companies alleging neglect, abuse and wrongful death. 
In one of them, 78-year-old Barbara Pendley allegedly died after suffering severe dehydration at North Point Healthcare & Wellness Centre in Fresno. 
North Point was another facility that the state opted to grant Rechnitz and his companies the license for under the 2023 settlement agreement. 
Rechnitz and his companies have filed legal responses denying allegations in all of these cases, several of which are scheduled to go to trial in the coming year. 
“We’ve just got to keep fighting,” Dudensing said.
“There was a time when there was a lot of scrutiny and that’s obviously well-documented,” he said. “But he managed to slip through.”
Cassie Dunham, the previous deputy director of the Center for Health Care Quality for the California Department of Public Health, last year became chief executive and president of the California Association of Health Facilities, the industry’s lobbying group. Through a spokesperson, Dunham declined an interview for this story citing her involvement with the development of departmental policy during the time that the state granted Rechnitz the licenses.
Corey Egel, a spokesman for the industry group and himself a former spokesman for the Department of Public Health, said in a statement that the association “supports strong, transparent oversight but believes the system would benefit from clearer timelines, more consistent application of standards, and more efficient resolution of pending cases — so that regulatory goals and resident care priorities can both be met.”
Patient lawsuit at newly licensed nursing home
Among the facilities that Rechnitz’companies received a state license to run in 2023 was Country Villa Wilshire, an 81-bed Los Angeles nursing home. 
According to a lawsuit against the facility, 84-year-old Betsy Jentz landed there in November 2020 after she fell and fractured her ribs and hip. Prior to her injuries, the complaint stated that Jentz had been in excellent health; her attorneys said she had run 27 marathons.
But during the next year, according to a plaintiff’s brief, Jentz fell at least 10 times. On some of these occasions, she hit her head, suffered a fractured and dislocated shoulder and a fractured pelvis. The complaint also described malnutrition and severe pressure ulcers. It attributed those injuries to neglect. In court filings, Rechnitz and his companies have denied all responsibility.

On the evening of Jan. 28, 2024, Jentz’ great nephew Derek Skylar Aud was preparing to testify in court the next morning. Then, according to court documents, he received an unexpected phone call.
The man on the other end of the line introduced himself as Shlomo Rechnitz, Aud later wrote in a declaration filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.  
Over the course of more than an hour, Rechnitz allegedly told Aud that “things would get very nasty” for him and Jentz if Aud testified, the declaration said. Rechnitz allegedly said he would prolong the case for years and bring to light damaging information his private investigators had collected about Jentz. 
He also said his private investigators had learned that Jentz loved basketball, and said she could receive courtside Lakers tickets “right next to LeBron James” if she agreed to a side deal, Aud told the court.
“Mr. Rechnitz then said ‘listen, I get it, we really fucked up and I’m accepting full responsibility, but I want the remedy or accountability to be on my terms and cut all these outrageous attorney’s fees out of the picture,’” Aud said in the declaration. “He also said ‘we fucked up and I accept responsibility, we were severely understaffed.’” 
Rechnitz did not directly respond to these allegations in court, and the judge ultimately did not allow the jury to consider the phone call to Aud in making its decision. 
Attorneys from Lanzone Morgan, a Long Beach law firm that specializes in nursing home abuse, represented Jentz and Aud in their case against Country Villa Wilshire. They said that the judge accepted defense attorneys’ argument that the call constituted “confidential settlement discussions” and did not allow the jury to hear testimony about it. Gittler & Berg and Ekpebe Law Group, the law firms that represented Rechnitz and his companies in the case, did not respond to CalMatters’ requests for comment. The jury’s $2.34 million verdict is now being appealed.
Lanzone Morgan also brought the case against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness that ended in the $7.6 million judgment in August. The case is in a post-trial phase in which the judge is determining how to apportion the liability among defendants.
Rockport Healthcare Services, the administrative services company for many of the homes, is also named in some of the lawsuits, including the one against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness. Rockport is owned by Steven Stroll, who has also served as Rechnitz’ accountant. Rockport has filed responses in court denying responsibility for the allegations. 
Elizabeth Kim, an attorney with Lanzone Morgan, said she wants to see the Department of Public Health stop issuing licenses to Rechnitz and “other bad actors.”
“It’s shocking to me that he’s able to get licenses after he pretty much runs many of his facilities into the ground,” she said. She referred to an Aug. 22 trial in which Rechnitz acknowledged owning a private plane and having recently sold a home in Los Angeles for $23 million. 
Her client, Aud, whose great aunt Jentz died in January 2025 a few months after the jury made its decision, wrote in his declaration to the court:
“I continue to feel uneasy about the calls and threats and I carry the fear of retaliation with me daily…I do live in fear that Mr. Rechnitz is now even more furious and that he will make good on his threats.”

Here’s why",Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/11/immigrant-drivers/,"The Trump administration is cracking down on immigrants who drive trucks in California, creating new regulations and threatening to withhold millions in federal highway funding over alleged violations by the state’s DMV.  Newsom says those allegations are a lie.","In summary
The Trump administration is cracking down on immigrants who drive trucks in California, creating new regulations and threatening to withhold millions in federal highway funding over alleged violations by the state’s DMV.  Newsom says those allegations are a lie.


New federal regulations could leave California with 61,000 fewer truck drivers as the Trump administration bans certain immigrants from operating large vehicles. With fewer truck drivers on the road, consumers may see higher shipping costs, too. 
Following an executive order from President Donald Trump in April, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy began cracking down on truck drivers by creating new regulations that prevent refugees, asylum seekers, and those with Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, or DACA, from holding commercial trucking licenses. The administration is also increasing enforcement to penalize those who have limited English proficiency. 
California is the main target of both actions, sparking a feud between Duffy and Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
“Licenses to operate a massive, 80,000-pound truck are being issued to dangerous foreign drivers — often times (sic) illegally. This is a direct threat to the safety of every family on the road,“  Duffy wrote in a statement in September. “California’s reckless disregard is frankly disgusting and an affront to the millions of Americans who expect us to keep them safe.” 
Newsom has been unsparing in his responses. “Sounds like the federal Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson on his own road rules,” wrote his press office in October on the social media platform X. “Once again, the Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his ‘dear leader,’” the office said in November, responding to more allegations by Duffy. 
Until recently, the federal government allowed states to issue trucking licenses to non-citizen immigrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, and those with DACA. Of the more than 720,000 trucking licenses that are active in California, about 8%, or roughly 61,000, belong to this class of immigrants. 
Now, under the new federal regulations released in September, nearly all of the 61,000 immigrants will lose their licenses in the coming months or years — for some, as soon as January. 
Losing thousands of license-holders could disrupt California’s transportation economy, said Rebecca Higgins, vice president of policy for the Eno Center on Transportation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. These cuts may lead to a sudden drop in the number of drivers in the state, potentially increasing shipping costs, she said. 
In addition to the new regulations, the U.S. Transportation Department has repeatedly claimed that it conducted a “nationwide audit” of trucking policies and that at least five other states —  Texas, South Dakota, Washington, Pennsylvania, and Colorado — have a history of violating federal law by giving licenses to ineligible immigrants. But the transportation department only publicly released an audit of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and has refused to respond to CalMatters’ requests for data on any other state. 
Duffy has threatened to withhold $160 million in federal highway safety funds from California because of alleged violations found in the audit. That money, representing about 4% of these federal funds, is supposed to arrive next fall. Duffy doesn’t have the legal right to withhold the remaining 96%. 
Separately, the transportation department said it will no longer award any money to California from a different federal grant, totaling about $40 million, because it alleges that California isn’t enforcing English-language proficiency guidelines for truck drivers.
‘Insufficient evidence’ to support new regulations 
Over the last decade, the demand for truckers has grown as companies like Amazon increasingly offer home shipping for any product imaginable. The trucking industry has expanded along with it, though companies have long struggled to retain workers willing to work the long hours with low pay that many entry-level positions offer. 
With more trucks on the roads compared to 10 years ago, truck drivers are involved in a higher percentage of crashes and traffic-related fatalities. Duffy said the new regulations for immigrant drivers are an effort to save lives. But in publishing the new regulations on immigrant truck drivers, Duffy’s transportation department acknowledged that there’s “insufficient evidence” to prove that certain kinds of immigrants drive more dangerously than other drivers. Instead, the department  justified the regulations by citing a number of high-profile crashes involving truck drivers who allegedly lack legal status, including a fiery crash on the I-10 in Ontario in October.   
The driver, Jashanpreet Singh, is in jail, where he’s charged with vehicular manslaughter and reckless driving leading to the death of three people and injuries of two more. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims he lacks legal status and said it plans to detain him even if the charges are dropped.
In a Nov. 13 letter, the transportation department claims that if California had complied with the new regulations then “the crash may have been avoided.” But Higgins said the federal focus on a few crashes involving immigrants is glossing over the “root cause” of most traffic accidents, such as speeding and driving under the influence.
Thousands of licenses rescinded
Following the federal audit of California’s DMV, the state has already rescinded 17,000 licenses from immigrant truck drivers, giving each of them 60 days to stop driving and find a new job.  Duffy said California was “caught red-handed” violating federal law on trucking licenses while Newom’s press office said that was a “lie.”
The reality is more nuanced. The federal audit found that California had issued some trucking licenses with expiration dates that extend past the dates that the driver could prove their legal right to remain in the U.S. The California DMV said that federal law never prohibited this practice until September, when the transportation department changed the rules. California rescinded these 17,000 licenses to abide by the new regulations and never violated the law, the DMV said.  
After it rescinded those licenses, California asked the federal government to drop its threat to withhold $160 million in highway safety funds, but the transportation department refused. 
All told, the money at risk represents a small fraction of the total federal dollars that go to California’s highways, so small that most Californians are unlikely to notice the change on the road, said Higgins. “The general public doesn’t notice a 3% or 2% reduction in highway funding, and they don’t notice a 1% reduction in trucks on the road.”
Still, she said many truck drivers and trucking companies could be hit hard.
Because of the transportation department’s new rules, California has already denied over 300 applications for truck licenses from refugees, asylum seekers, and those with DACA status, said Toni Tinoco, the assistant deputy secretary for communications at the state’s transportation agency. Driving schools say that some students have decided not to apply at all, knowing that their applications won’t be accepted.
Even after rescinding 17,000 licenses, California still has about 44,000 immigrant truck drivers whose licenses are still valid. But it’s likely that they won’t be able to renew their licenses as long as the federal regulations remain in effect. The only exceptions are those who have certain work visas known as the H-2a, H-2b or E-2, which are relatively rare for truck drivers.
A lawsuit by two national unions representing truck drivers appealed the new federal regulations and a judge agreed last week to temporarily pause their implementation, saying the federal government didn’t give states enough prior notice before changing its rules. 
But the U.S. Transportation Department said the ruling doesn’t apply to any state under disciplinary actions, such as California. Tinoco said California will continue denying immigrants their licenses.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Melon-Farm-Day-2_LV_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-20 08:57:06.598628

Sen. Dan Thatcher of West Valley City announced last month that he is looking to leave the Legislature, but only if his party — which he joined in March after leaving the Republican Party — would be able to replace him through an election open to all voters in the district, which includes parts of Tooele, Eagle Mountain, West Valley City, West Jordan, Herriman and Magna.
It’s still possible that state leaders or the Utah GOP could step in to oppose the Forward Party’s plans. The Forward Party of Utah has said Utah law allows it to define its own process for selecting an appointee to fill a midterm vacancy; that nomination would then need to be approved by the governor.

In a release Wednesday, Utah’s Forward Party released the names of five eligible candidates who have applied to replace Thatcher and published profiles for each of them online at 11chooses.com. A candidate forum is scheduled for Dec. 4. 
The candidates are:

Tynley Bean, Erda
Maleah Bliss, Kearns
Emily Buss, Eagle Mountain
Jeff Marshall, Magna
Jeff Saunders, Tooele

The party also shared its plans for approval voting, including options to vote online or in person between Dec. 5 and Dec. 11 after voters verify their identities. The winning appointee will be announced Dec. 12 and then sent to Gov. Spencer Cox for approval. 
The voting schedule released by the Forward Party of Utah says:

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Library Service Board Thursday is expected to vote on whether to restore state aid for Fairhope Public Library and a proposal to further restrict minors from library materials that positively depict transgender individuals or procedures or employ an undefined “gender ideology.”
The votes could bring an end to two long-running battles over free expression and content in state libraries, particularly on LGBTQ+ issues. Craig Scott, a past president of the Alabama Library Association and critic of the changes, said that the vote was simply a formality.
“They already know what they are going to do,” he said. “It is all but done essentially.”

John Wahl, the chair of the APLS board and the Alabama Republican Party, denies that the process was unfair.
“I think it was overwhelmingly fair,” he said. “We submitted a public comment period that was longer than required by state code. We had public time where everyone was invited to come and speak. I think this is a code change that the board does support.”
Both issues have been before the APLS board for months at the behest of board member Amy Minton, who is also running for Alabama Senate.  Minton first proposed the “gender ideology” restrictions — never defined — in May. Minton cited an executive order from President Donald Trump saying there are two genders and the Alabama Legislature’s passage of the “What Is A Woman” Act, defining gender by the presence of sexual organs. An executive order is not a law.
The APLS Board voted in July to adopt Minton’s proposal through the administrative code change process, which then initiated the formal process that included a public comment period that began at the end of August and ran through mid-October. Free speech advocates, including Read Freely Alabama, an organization that opposes the restrictions, criticized the process as unfair and not transparent.
During an Oct. 21 meeting , Ron Snider, one of the board members, accused Wahl of using his position as chair of the Alabama Republican Party to influence the results of the written submissions during the public comment period.
Wahl has denied any wrongdoing on his part.
“Party members passed resolutions,” he said. “County parties sent stuff out, the state party sent out an email letting people know about the public comment period, and I think they should have. This is a healthy part of the process. We want people to know about decisions that are happening. We want people to let their voice be heard, no matter what side it is.”
Snider provided two letters penned by Alabama Republican Party staff urging their supporters to submit comments in favor of Minton’s proposal to update the administrative code. Those then resulted in a flood of comments shortly before the Oct. 14 deadline.
APLS staff said that 873 comments were submitted before the final day and that more than 600 were in favor of the administrative code changes. Then, on the deadline, 7,605 comments were submitted and of that, 6,173 were in favor of the administrative code.
“I think it has been a bit of a farce,” said Angie Hayden, one of founding members for Read Freely Alabama. “It is the board’s attempt at looking like they are following the procedure and respecting the wishes of parents when really, they have had an agenda from the beginning.”

Fairhope

APLS will also decide whether the Fairhope Public Library is following the administrative code and eligible to, once again, receive state aid. The APLS Board voted to suspend state aid for the library in March amid complaints from a handful of people who accused library staff of shelving inappropriate material in its teens section in violation of the administrative code that APLS passed in the summer of 2024.
Fairhope Public Library officials said they had been complying with the code and submitted their policies for review by APLS when the administrative code changes were updated in 2024 and were not told they were out of compliance.
Since their funding was revoked, Fairhope started the process to review the books that some in the community had challenged and reshelved seven of the titles in the adult section while retaining 10 in the teens section of the library.
However, APLS opted to continue to suspend state aid for the library at the September meeting so that members of the board could review the challenged books themselves to determine if the library is complying with the administrative code changes.
Fairhope has permanently forfeited state aid for the rest of 2025, roughly $22,000, because they had been out of compliance with the administrative code after the June 30 deadline to receive the funding since it was suspended.
The question is whether APLS will continue to deny the library its funding moving forward. Supporters of the Fairhope Public Library raised more than enough to offset the funding that was lost for 2025.
“Luckily, we were able to raise that money in record time, in less than seven days,” said Elizabeth Williams, who helped set up the GoFundMe account to fundraise. “We raised, I think $48,000 is the final amount when we cut off giving. The library will not suffer. The library is well funded for quite some time. That $22,000 will be given back to them. We have held off delivering the funds to the library because we wanted to see, and they wanted to see, if the state would reinstate the funding.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 08:57:06.598628

A recent report says the use of prison labor by Hyundai suppliers may be holding down wages for other auto workers. (Courtesy Jobs to Move America)Mark Miller worked a dangerous job for more than four decades, but he said he’d never gotten hurt at work until his employment with an automotive supplier in Montgomery.
In two years with the company, he broke his hand and four ribs in two separate accidents. Miller said he received no safety training before being charged with running production lines for vehicle consoles and dash components, and employees were constantly dodging forklifts whizzing by at full speed, carrying parts from trucks to assembly lines.
“You was on your alert at all times,” said Miller, who worked at the facility from 2022 to 2024.“I was trained maybe 10 minutes on the job, and I was told to do it and go as fast as I could go.”
As bad as these conditions were, Miller — at the time one of thousands of incarcerated people that private companies employ in Alabama — said quitting would have meant facing greater risks in a higher security facility within the state’s notoriously dangerous prison system.
“So I had no choice in the matter,” he said.
The limited options Miller and other incarcerated workers face could be suppressing wages and increasing safety risks throughout the automotive-supply industry in areas — including Montgomery — where suppliers make use of prison labor. That’s the conclusion of a study the Columbia University Labor Lab released Nov. 6.
“Even when you just look at the free-world workers, the non-incarcerated workers, we find that the plants that are using a higher share of incarcerated workers have worse wages, worse working conditions,” Suresh Naidu, an economics professor at Columbia University and one of four study authors, said at a Nov. 6 press conference during which Miller also spoke.
Focus on Hyundai supply chain
Hyundai and other major manufacturers don’t use prison labor in their own facilities in any meaningful way, said Aaron Sojourner, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. “It’s too reputationally risky for the brand,” he said.
The study instead centers on Hyundai suppliers in Alabama, companies that provide the automaker with parts for vehicle construction.
Through the Alabama Department of Corrections’ work-release program, prisoners are housed in minimum-security facilities and work, without officer supervision and in plain clothes, alongside free employees for private companies. They also work for public agencies. Auto suppliers employ many people in the work-release program, which is being challenged in court through state and federal lawsuits after a 2022 change to Alabama’s Constitution that banned “involuntary servitude.”
In addition to working for auto-parts suppliers, incarcerated people work in a range of industries, including general manufacturing, lumber, fast food, meat processing and other food processing/distribution, according to the federal lawsuit and public records reviewed by the Alabama Reflector. Incarcerated people also work for city, county and state agencies, including the Alabama Department of Transportation, the city of Montgomery and Jefferson County, according to the federal lawsuit.
The study connects prison labor to low pay among Alabama’s Hyundai suppliers.
The study correlates a 10% increase in the proportion of incarcerated workers at a plant with a 10% to 14% drop in wages for free workers.
Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama’s plant, which produces around 360,000 vehicles annually, has been operating since 2005. With 4,500 workers, the plant is Montgomery’s largest manufacturing employer and is one of only two plants in the United States where Hyundai vehicles are assembled. The other opened in Georgia late last year.
Hyundai’s supply chain is concentrated in the Montgomery area, and its suppliers employ another 6,000 people nearby, according to the study. Multiple facilities that house work-release inmates also are in this part of the state.
According to the study, wages for workers in the entire auto-supply sector in the Montgomery area are 7% to 9% below expectations, based on wages in nearby regions.
Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama did not respond to specific questions from the Alabama Reflector, but public relations manager Scott Posey provided a statement saying the company is aware some suppliers previously participated in Alabama’s work-release program.
“However, Hyundai was not involved in any supplier’s decision to participate in such program,” the statement reads. “Consistent with the standards and values to which we hold ourselves as a company, we mandate that our suppliers and business partners strictly adhere to the law, and we have an established track record of taking action when alleged violations occur.”
Posey also pointed to Hyundai’s supplier and business partner codes of conduct, both of which have sections on forced labor.
“HMMA expects Business Partners to support HMMA’s commitment to ensuring that no products entering its supply chain are mined, produced, or manufactured, in whole or in part, with forced, imprisoned, indentured, or indentured child labor (collectively, “forced labor”), by preventing the use of forced labor within their own operations and undertaking measures to ensure that forced labor is not used within their supply chains,” states the business partner code of conduct, which includes suppliers in its definition of business partners.
Still, advocates contend suppliers are still employing Alabama prisoners through the work-release program.
Effects of prison labor on all workers’ wages, working conditions
Study authors explained how prison labor can push down wages and negatively impact working conditions for all employees in a facility or entire industry sector.
When workers feel they can’t leave a job, this gives employers power to keep wages low, they said. Using surveys of more than 600 auto-supplier workers in Alabama — 13% of them incarcerated — researchers found that incarcerated workers were less likely than others to quit their jobs based on hypothetical wage decreases and felt less freedom in general to leave their employment.
Jobs to Move America has been investigating prison labor in the auto-supply chain for years, and staff conducted worker surveys used in the Columbia study between August and December 2024, primarily through in-person visits to manufacturing plants.
Alabama’s work-release program participants typically receive only a third of wages their employers pay. The state takes 40% of their gross earnings and also deducts fees for things like transportation and laundry.
And workers don’t choose their jobs in the first place. Job-placement officers at work-release facilities and community work centers where they’re housed make those decisions.
“I was put there,” Miller said of his assignments to two Montgomery-area plants operated by the same Hyundai supplier. He said he was told, “if I couldn’t do my job, that they’d just call the camp and report it, and then the camp would write me up if I didn’t do it, and probably send me back to one of the dangerous prisons.”
In a lawsuit the U.S. Justice Department filed against ADOC in 2020, the department said its investigation into the state’s prisons for men found use of excessive force by guards, failure to protect inmates from violence, overcrowding, understaffing and other conditions that amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of inmates’ Eighth Amendment rights. The litigation is ongoing, and ADOC public information manager Kelly Windham Betts said the department can’t comment on it for that reason.
By contrast, work-release facilities are often safer.
An ADOC regulation requires employers to pay for inmate labor in the same manner as for any other employee, which means they must pay the same wage for similar work. Because of this — and because surveys showed free workers in the Montgomery area also felt compelled, to a higher-than-average degree, to stay in their jobs — study authors said prison labor is a factor that explains lower wages for all auto-supplier workers in the Montgomery area.
“Since the free-world workers also find it hard to quit, and the suppliers and the plants that use incarcerated labor have access to this additional pool of workers that have an even harder time quitting, employers can profitably lower wages for both free and incarcerated workers,” Naidu said.
Some of the same dynamics also could be affecting safety and other working conditions, according to the study.
The ADOC regulation states employers must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and incarcerated workers can’t be used as strikebreakers, but the Columbia study points out those on work release aren’t allowed to join labor unions.
Job-placement officers within ADOC’s work-release program monitor working conditions for people in the program and handle any complaints, Betts wrote in an email. “Work release programs are instrumental to the success of inmates preparing for release back into the community,” she continued.
Study authors also note reports that Hyundai suppliers have used child and migrant workers, according to reporting by Reuters and the New York Times and a lawsuit,  “for whom similarly coercive dynamics likely apply, and which similarly drive down wages and working conditions for all.”
Possible solutions
In an academic working paper related to the study, the same authors report creating a model to determine how four potential changes could affect both incarcerated and free workers.
They conclude all four changes — reforming prison conditions to eliminate violence, eliminating prison labor wage garnishment, imposing a $15 minimum wage, and abolishing prison labor — would improve welfare of free workers while only the first three would positively affect incarcerated workers. Ending prison labor would have negative consequences for those who are incarcerated, the authors write.
Will Tucker, Southern director for Jobs to Move America, said his ideal solution would be to release, through parole or other means, all participants in the work-release program.
“They are quote-unquote safe enough to be released into the free world to work an 8-hour, 10-hour shift, and yet they’re not safe enough to just go home to their families,” he said. “That’s absurd. They should just be freed. And for a state that has a massive overcrowding problem in their prisons, it’s a solution that’s right there in front of them.”
In the meantime, cutting contracts with private employers and sending people back into dangerous prisons isn’t the right thing to do, he continued.
Companies that are benefiting from the work-release program have a role to play as well, he said.
Jobs to Move America filed a lawsuit in California on Nov. 13 against Hyundai and Kia alleging the automakers falsely certified compliance with that state’s “high-road” labor standards while profiting from suppliers in the U.S. South that have used child and prison labor.

A long history

Alabama’s work-release program is the latest chapter in a long history of systems that make use of captive labor.
After slavery was abolished, Alabama came to operate the most profitable convict-leasing system in the country, said study author Adam Reich, a sociology professor at Columbia. And it was the last state to end convict leasing in 1928. Prison labor currently benefits the state to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per year, according to one lawsuit.
Arguments in the courts surrounding another lawsuit, which challenges the legality of the work-release program in light of the 2022 state constitution change, hinge on the definition of “involuntary servitude,” with attorneys for the state saying it doesn’t exist in Alabama’s prison system.
Miller gained his freedom in April. Tucker said Jobs to Move America and some of its partners successfully advocated for his and six other former workers’ parole — a major feat in Alabama, where parole is denied to the vast majority of those eligible for it.
Miller said after he broke his ribs at work and was lying on the ground, gasping for air, supervisors told him they would call an ambulance, but they called the state van instead. He said the company called him back to work before he had healed, and supervisors ordered him to continue working immediately after the incident that broke his hand.

(Photo courtesy of Angela Mund)Rural residents in South Carolina face significant challenges when it comes to accessing health care. Many live in areas where hospitals and health facilities are few and far between, forcing patients to travel long distances for even basic medical services.
Several rural hospitals have closed in recent years, further straining an already fragile system. The shortage of health-care providers means patients often wait weeks or months for appointments.
Certified registered nurse anesthetists help to fill critical gaps in care, providing safe, quality, and cost-effective care, especially in these rural and other medically underserved areas where physician shortages are most acute.
Limited public transportation, higher poverty rates, and lack of health insurance compound these barriers, while aging populations and rising rates of chronic disease increase the demand for care.
Together, these factors create a cycle of health inequity that leaves rural South Carolinians with poorer outcomes and fewer options for timely, affordable care.
Without certified registered nurse anesthetists as the primary providers of anesthesia care, many of these health-care facilities would not be able to offer obstetrical, surgical, pain management, trauma stabilization and other services that patients deserve.
According to national statistics, more than 80% of anesthesia providers in rural counties are certified nurses who are fully qualified to provide the entire spectrum of anesthesia services, from the simplest to the most complex procedures.
Thursday is National Rural Health Day, when our nation honors the community-minded focus of health care in rural America and recognizes the unique challenges that rural communities face, it’s important to applaud the workers who deliver that care.
Rural patients need access to surgical and anesthesia care, often times at a moment’s notice, particularly so that older patients who may have higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hypertension and heart failure don’t have to travel long distances to access the care they need.
The expertise of certified registered nurse anesthetists ensures patients get the care they need.
Bound by bureaucracy: How South Carolina ties the hands of its nurse practitioners

But even with all that they do, challenges remain. There are still gaps to fill.
Right now, outdated “supervision” requirements in South Carolina prohibit them from practicing to the fullest extent of their education and training.
It has been four decades since substantial changes have been made to the way anesthesiology is delivered in the Palmetto State. Yet, the needs of our communities and the overall health delivery landscape have changed drastically.
I have seen firsthand how much certified registered nurse anesthetists can do when burdensome and outdated regulations are removed and these highly trained professionals are allowed to reach their full potential.
Health systems deliver safe, high-quality anesthesia services more efficiently, surgical delays are reduced, and patients receive expanded access to essential medical procedures.
More people are moving here, yet we face a health-care worker shortage. Simple policy solutions can add to the ranks of anesthesiology professionals.
Fortunately, legislative proposals would modernize the way anesthesia is delivered in South Carolina and bring us into alignment with other states.
These measures would remove the supervision requirements of certified registered nurse anesthetists, ensure that each health-care facility has the flexibility to utilize them in the ways that best meets the needs of their communities, and grant limited prescriptive authority to allow them to effectively order and administer timely care to their patients.
Expanding their autonomy through legislative reforms is a critical step toward stabilizing our rural health-care network and empowering certified registered nurse anesthetists to deliver comprehensive care where it’s needed most.
But policy alone isn’t enough. We need sustained investment in rural hospitals, workforce development, and insurance coverage to ensure that every South Carolinian has access to safe, quality, and cost-effective care.
The bottom line: Certified registered nurse anesthetists aren’t just filling gaps — they’re holding the system together.
It’s time to give them the tools and support they need to ensure that every South Carolinian has access to safe, timely care, no matter where they live.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mund-in-OR-cropped-1024x768.png,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

(Joshua Bowling/Source New Mexico) Each of New Mexico’s district attorneys on Wednesday asked state lawmakers during ongoing Legislative Finance Committee hearings to increase their funding in the upcoming legislative session. Most every prosecutor’s office asked for more money to hire attorneys and support staff, but DAs in New Mexico’s most rural areas had a unique set of requests.
In the Eighth Judicial District, which includes Taos, Colfax and Union counties, prosecuting attorneys rely on a high-mileage fleet of cars to cover courthouse visits that require driving as much as 140 to 266 miles round-trip. In the Fifth Judicial District, which includes Roswell, attorneys experience disruptions to internet speeds and reliability during electronic discovery processes. And across the state, IT services and computers are “at end-of-life” and need a major overhaul, the president of the New Mexico Administrative Office of the District Attorneys said.
Marcus Montoya, district attorney for the Eighth Judicial District and president of the New Mexico District Attorneys’ Association, said his office currently has 10 vehicles, two of which have clocked more than 100,000 miles. The odometer on his office’s 2005 Toyota Matrix recently rolled over to 142,282 miles, he said, noting that Kelley Blue Book assigns that vehicle an average lifespan of 147,428 miles.
His staff attorneys need the vehicles to attend court hearings, serve subpoenas and attend meetings throughout the vast district, Montoya said. Extreme weather isn’t uncommon in his part of the state, where roads and highways stretch through craggy, mountainous terrain.
“We are the Dutch boy plugging the dam with our finger,” Montoya said.
He asked state lawmakers to increase his office’s base budget by about 4.4%, which would include $75,000 to upgrade its vehicle fleet. In all, his office requested about $6 million. Montoya’s office isn’t alone — the 12th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which includes Alamogordo, also requested about $71,000 to replace vehicles with 150,000 miles. 
Dianna Luce, DA for the Fifth Judicial District, told state lawmakers that her office has issues with internet speeds and said that convincing University of New Mexico law graduates to move to Chaves County is a tough proposition. As of Wednesday, she said her office has seven unfilled staff attorney positions.
“It is extremely difficult to hire attorneys,” she said. “We primarily hire from outside the state.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ruralDas-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

A new bill aims to stem that tide.,"A data privacy law covering some New Jersey public officials spurred a wave of lawsuits. A new bill from Sen. Gordon Johnson aims to stem that tide. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey legislators are proposing major changes to a state law shielding addresses and other personal information of certain public officials in a bid to stem a tide of lawsuits enforcing its provisions.
The statute, called Daniel’s Law after the murdered son of a New Jersey federal judge, is broken and the proposed amendments will fix it, said bill sponsor Sen. Gordon Johnson (D-Bergen). Johnson, a former Bergen County sheriff whose information is shielded by the law, is sponsoring the measure along with Nilsa Cruz-Perez (D-Camden).
“This fix will protect covered people and strengthen enforcement and restore public confidence, of course, in this law,” Johnson said. “The filing of mass lawsuits for profit was a major issue for me to get involved in and to amend or change this bill to put it back to what its initial purpose was.”
NJ Black leaders urge action on criminal justice, voting reforms

New Jersey has seen hundreds of suits filed under the statute by Atlas Data Privacy on behalf of police officers and other officials whose information is shielded by Daniel’s Law, with Atlas alleging data brokers and other companies have not complied with requests to scrub the officials’ personal information from the internet. Those suits have spurred some constitutional concerns as they’ve proceeded through state and federal courts.

Johnson’s legislation would remove covered individuals’ ability to select an assignee to sue to enforce Daniel’s Law on their behalf, and it would give judges discretion to award damages in such cases. Those awards are mandatory under existing law.
The bill would also limit damages to cases where data companies accused of disclosing officials’ personal information showed negligence or intention to violate the law. There is no such requirement under existing law.
Johnson, echoing concerns raised by data firms that have sued to strike the law as unconstitutional, said amendments made to Daniel’s Law in 2023 that allowed individuals covered by the law to designate assignees to enforce it on their behalf created a “cottage industry” for outside firms to profit.
Those changes “opened the door for predatory companies who have turned this protection into a profit scheme, which does nothing to protect the people we’re trying to protect and makes money for them,” Johnson said.
But supporters of the 2023 bill that made those changes argue its provisions are key to the law’s enforcement. That measure’s prime Senate sponsor, Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), said data brokers had largely ignored Daniel’s Law until his bill increased their liability.
“We established true penalties, and we had assignability in there, and that was meant to simply protect people. And I noticed that’s when all the multi-billion data privacy companies that sell your data each and every day, that’s when they started to pay attention to it,” he said.
Removing covered persons’ ability to have third parties sue on their behalf would stifle enforcement by forcing individuals to fight large firms with teams of attorneys in court, Cryan said. Other penalties introduced by Johnson’s bill would not be enough to force compliance, he added.
In place of mandatory damages and a court-heavy enforcement system, Johnson’s amendments would require firms to regularly access an online portal where individuals whose information is shielded from disclosure can request it be removed, or pay a $200 fine.
“The reality is those fines are a drop in the bucket to these kinds of companies if they even pay attention to them. Remember, they have a demonstrated history of not paying attention, and when we amended this bill, that’s when they started to pay attention,” Cryan said.
Firms would also be forced to pay an annual fee to access the portal. The bill gives state officials the authority to set that fee.
Johnson acknowledged concerns about his bill’s effect on the enforceability of Daniel’s Law and said he is willing to discuss changes to his legislation, including possible provisions that would allow people covered by Daniel’s Law to lodge class action suits to shield their information.
“This bill is a living document that can be amended again,” Johnson said. “We’re always open for discussion.”
Cryan was Union County sheriff before entering the Legislature in 2002. His personal information, like Johnson’s, is already shielded by the law, though Johnson’s bill would extend its protections to court administrators and legislators.
Protections for lawmakers’ personal information, already a concern in Trenton after years of escalating threats of political violence, became a focal point for state lawmakers after a gunman in June killed Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and left another state lawmaker and his spouse critically wounded.
Johnson’s bill would give those hosting shielded information significantly more time to comply with removal requests, raising the window from 10 business days under current law to 45 business days.
Dozens of data brokers sued by Atlas Data Privacy last year argued in court that timelines under present law gave them little time to comply with takedown requests filed on behalf of more than 19,000 individuals.
That case is continuing to move through the courts. The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the case in July. In September, the appeals court said it was unsure of the law’s constitutionality and asked New Jersey’s Supreme Court to weigh the challenge.
Atlas opposes Johnson’s bill, which the senator has dubbed the “Protect Daniel’s Law Act.”
“Slapping a ‘Protect Daniel’s Law’ label on a bill that destroys privacy is like bottling poison and selling it as spring water. This bill would sacrifice the safety of New Jersey’s public servants, and their families, to increase the profits of powerful data brokers,” said Matt Adkisson, the company’s president.
Daniel’s Law is named for Daniel Anderl, who was slain during the attempted assassination of his mother, U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas. The law’s critics have said it impermissibly chills speech, which they say is compounded by its targeting of even unintentional violations.
Johnson acknowledged those constitutional concerns as one of the bill’s drivers. He said Senate leadership agreed to give the bill a committee hearing, though it’s not clear when it will come before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Johnson said he hopes to have it passed before the new session of the Legislature begins in mid-January.

Rural and urban areas have different health outcomes, needs and disparities. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jan K. Carney: On National Rural Health Day, why community engagement and trusted voices matter in our changing world.","This commentary is by Jan K. Carney, M.D., M.P.H., associate dean for public health and health policy at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine.


With nearly two-thirds of our population living in rural settings, National Rural Health Day, on Nov. 20, highlights the strengths of our rural communities. Federal changes to expert scientific panels, cuts to health agencies and health programs, and widespread scientific misinformation create confusion in critical areas of health and science. Our Vermont rural strengths can help us directly and positively impact today’s complex health challenges. 
Rural and urban areas have different health outcomes, needs and disparities. Health is heavily influenced by ZIP code due to differences in economic opportunities, affordable housing, food security, transportation and access to health care services.
National initiatives, such as America’s Health Rankings, confirm that many rural states, such as Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Alabama are far less healthy, and rural states together have a 23% higher overall mortality rate compared to urban environments. In contrast, despite their rurality, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine have better health outcomes than other rural states. These rural strengths can help guide us in meeting our health and social challenges. 
Publicly accessible health data by geographic regions may also help inform us. One model from the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps project includes measures of population health and well-being, healthcare, quality of life, physical environment, social and economic factors.
Someone living in Addison County, for example, can see how they compare to Vermont and the U.S. in health and social measures. Similarly, Vermont Department of Health cancer data shows differences in risk factors by county, such as tobacco use and rates of HPV vaccination.
The Rural Health Information Hub is another user-friendly source of high-quality data. Taken together as a reflection of our community’s health, these practical sources of data can help us build on our strengths and identify priority health challenges.  
Community engagement and partnerships contribute positively to health outcomes and provide proven strategies for our rural communities. Research from the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network shows a high level of trust with our community partners in advancing research that connects community needs and our academic medical centers. Lessons learned from community-academic partnerships in medical education suggest that community benefit is essential for long-term community engagement and further strengthening our collaborative goals. 
Communication preferences for health information in Vermont rural communities may differ from urban areas. Understanding these preferences is essential to improving health literacy and empowering individuals and entire communities to act on health information that is based on science.
A pilot study with older adults living in rural housing during the Covid-19 pandemic explored how their feedback influenced the specific ways we communicated vaccine information, and used their communication preferences to maximize confidence in public health science.
A statewide electronic survey, in partnership with the United Way of Northwest Vermont, highlighted key differences in how rural residents preferred to receive health information. Whereas the internet, Front Porch Forum, and television were generally preferred by urban respondents, rural populations preferred word of mouth, posters, Facebook, and local papers. This suggests that community “conversations” through local channels, in addition to information from trusted sources, may be key to further improving our individual and collective health. 
Recent examples from the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships are testing the possibility of using local libraries to offer telehealth services in rural locations, and our local libraries can also improve health literacy in individuals and families.
What other innovative health connections could we make in our many rural locations? Such strategies can better connect us, reaching individuals, neighbors and families with health information based on science. Whether vaccines, health care services, or advocacy for health and social issues, together, these approaches can contribute to better health, stronger communities and enduring health connections. 
We know our most trusted sources for health information. Recent national polls from the Kaiser Family Foundation confirm that for seeking reliable information about vaccines, physicians, nurses and other health professionals, along with local public health agencies are overwhelmingly trusted for critical health information.
The Vermont Department of Health has 12 local health offices throughout our state, part of a trusted network that connects health care and public health. Expanding our range of trusted voices can prevent disease and illness, and promote access to needed health care, social services and life-saving preventive measures. 
For health, place matters. Our rural strengths, community-academic research, innovations and health communication are all needed, expanding our network of trusted voices. These represent unique opportunities to further strengthen our collective health and become partners in our own health and health care, at every age and in every Vermont community.

Gretchen Whitmer.
Null was charged but was later found not guilty for his alleged role in offering support to the men who conspired to kidnap Whitmer in 2020. He was also one of several militia members who entered the state Capitol, with tactical gear and long guns strapped around their torsos, in protest of Whitmer’s lockdowns at the height of the COVID pandemic.
News of his candidacy was met with near immediate skepticism from Republicans and others on social media, who questioned if Null could amass the more than 15,000 valid signatures needed to make the ballot. Even if he does make the ballot, he faces fierce competition in U.S. Rep. John James, also of Shelbyville, who has positioned himself as a frontrunner in the race.

Aside from James, the full slate of Republican gubernatorial candidates includes Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township, former Attorney General Mike Cox, former House Speaker Tom Leonard, far-right activist Anthony Hudson and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.
Two men were found guilty in the plot to kidnap Whitmer: Adam Fox and Barry Croft, who are currently serving prison sentences. But several others were arrested and prosecuted on separate federal and state charges. Those who faced federal charges other than Fox and Croft were acquitted, but at least one of them pleaded guilty and testified against the defendants.
Null was among those charged on alleged state crimes of offering material support to Fox and Croft. Several were convicted, but Null, his twin brother Michael Null, and Eric Molitor were found not guilty.
Molitor is listed in campaign filings as the treasurer for Null’s new bid for Michgian’s highest office.
He has been eyeing a run for governor since last year.
The Michigan Democratic Party in a news release condemned the burgeoning campaign.
“William Null is a far-right extremist and former militia member whose dangerous, violent extremism has no place in our state,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement. “The Michigan Democratic Party strongly condemns Null’s candidacy for governor, and we urge Michigan Republican Party Chair Jim Runestad and each of the Republican candidates for governor to join us in condemning Null and his dangerous extremism.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Facetune_19-09-2024-12-22-27-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

The letter, dated Tuesday, is addressed to Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, and Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Justice, overseen by Bondi, in recent months has demanded voter information from numerous states. The information would allow the DOJ to evaluate state compliance with federal voting laws, department officials had said.
But federal officials later acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
The secretaries in their letter express “immense concern” about how the information is being shared, and they “seek clarity on whether DOJ and DHS actively misled election officials regarding the uses of voter data.”
The letter is signed by Colorado’s Jena Griswold as well as Adrian Fontes of Arizona, Shirley Weber of California, Shenna Bellows of Maine, Steve Simon of Minnesota, Francisco Aguilar of Nevada, Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico, Tobias Read of Oregon, Sarah Copeland Hanzas of Vermont, and Steve Hobbs of Washington.
The secretaries fear Trump officials could misuse the information.
“Is the administration collecting in an unprecedented way mass voter data and dumping it into an untested, unverified federal system to spread voter disinformation — disinformation to undermine our elections?” Griswold said in an interview with Newsline.
Trump’s DOJ wants access to Missouri voting equipment used in 2020 election

DHS operates Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, which can identify the citizenship status of a person. The system can be prone to errors.
“We would like to know what the Trump administration is doing with voter data, and I am proud to stand with nine other secretaries of state to demand answers and accountability,” Griswold said. “We ultimately would like to know what the Trump administration is doing and whether they’re taking appropriate steps required under the law to protect voter information.”
The secretaries of state met with senior DOJ and DHS officials twice, on Aug. 28 and Sept. 11, according to the letter. A DOJ official during the first meeting told the secretaries the department intended to use voter data “to assess compliance with the voter list maintenance provisions of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).”
On Sept. 11, Heather Honey, an election conspiracist who is a Homeland Security “election integrity” official, told the secretaries the department had not requested voter data and had no intention of using it, the letter says.
“The same day, DHS publicly contradicted her representation and confirmed that they had received this data and would input it into the unproven and potentially insecure citizenship-check system, SAVE,” the letter says.
The secretaries request details on the sharing of voter data between federal agencies, the security of the information, and contradictory statements by federal officials. They request a response by Dec. 1.
 Sweeping requests for information

The DOJ has sent requests for voter data to at least 40 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The request to Colorado in May was among the most sweeping — it sought “all records” related to the 2024 election, among other information.
In response, Griswold’s office supplied two copies of the state’s master voter list — one from 2022 and one from May — and one copy of the master voter history list dating from after the election in November 2024. The data includes the names of voters, their residential addresses, birth year, and, if provided by the voter, phone numbers — all public information. It does not include a voter’s social security number, driver’s license number, month and day of birth, signature or email address.
Other states, including Maine, refused to hand over any information. New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state David Scanlan, citing a state prohibition, said he wasn’t authorized to provide the DOJ with his state’s voter roll.
The voter data requests are just one of many ways the Trump administration has “made our elections less secure,” she said.
In March, Trump issued an executive order that, though a court has blocked key parts of it, would disenfranchise millions of Americans if it were implemented, according to voter advocates. The administration has dismantled federal entities that had worked to support election security or counter foreign election disinformation. It is attempting to eliminate mail-in ballots.
It is trying to free Tina Peters, the election-denying former Colorado county clerk who is serving a prison term for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment.
“I do think it’s very important for elected officials to stand up whenever they can,” Griswold said. “It’s all these small situations that grow on top of each other, and we can’t ignore what’s happening at large. And in this situation, I’m proud that 10 of us are coming together and saying we demand answers from Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem to shine light on whatever the Trump administration is doing with this data.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)For decades, Hoosier governors and lawmakers have sparred over what can be done during a special legislative session. But state leaders are now confronting a different dilemma — can the General Assembly legally ignore a governor’s demand to convene?
Indiana’s debate reached a new breaking point Tuesday when the Senate chamber voted to adjourn until Jan. 5, rebutting Gov. Mike Braun’s call for a special session on redistricting.
The Senate’s decision to simply not show up appears to be unprecedented in state history.
Republican Sen. Mike Young, who supports redistricting, said Tuesday that lawmakers are already, by definition, in a special session and therefore can’t ignore it.
“The governor has the power to call us into a special session, which he’s done,” Young said. “But we have a right as a body to set a different schedule. … We could have been in and adjourned, sine die, but we chose not to do it. This is a slap in the face of the governor of the state of Indiana.”
He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the legislature must at least gavel in and out of the special session — even if redistricting matters are left untouched.
“We first have to go in,” Young said. “I’m not saying we have to do any work. I’m just saying they’re not following the rules of the Constitution.”
But Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, who leads the chamber, told reporters the opposite.
“It does not appear to be a problem that we can make a decision as to whether we come in or not,” Bray said, citing internal legal advice to the Senate.
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston offered only a brief response Tuesday when asked whether he believes the legislature can ignore the special session call entirely.

“We’ll see if that’s even necessary,” Huston said.
Facing mounting resistance from his own party, Braun said he’s now looking for ways to “compel” the Senate to act. The governor’s office had no further details on what authority he believes he can use. He did radio and television interviews Wednesday but didn’t include print reporters.
The legislature previously planned to meet Dec. 1 to take up President Donald Trump’s wish for Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Indiana’s Senate Republican leadership has maintained the caucus lacks enough support to pass mid-cycle congressional maps. GOP senators were split 19-19 in a vote to adjourn until January. It passed with Democrat support.
‘I don’t see where the legislature can ignore that’
Over the last century, governors of both parties have relied on special sessions to resolve deadlocks, rewrite tax codes and complete budgets. While executive and legislative leaders have clashed, at times, over the content and length of special sessions, historical records reviewed by the Capital Chronicle showed no examples of the General Assembly simply refusing to convene at all.
In 1865, then-Gov. Oliver Morton called a special session to address Civil War–era financial emergencies and reorganize state institutions. In 1919, Gov. James Goodrich summoned lawmakers so Indiana could ratify the 19th Amendment.
In 2002 and again in 2018, governors convened special sessions to tackle unfinished bills and complete budget work. And in 2022, former Gov. Eric Holcomb called lawmakers back for a special session that ultimately produced the state’s near-total abortion ban.
The Indiana Constitution provides that “if, in the opinion of the Governor, the public welfare shall require it, he may, at any time by proclamation, call a special session.”

But the Constitution also grants each chamber authority to “determine its rules of proceeding, and sit upon its own adjournment.” It does not say what happens if lawmakers simply do not convene.
Who controls the session’s length, agenda and existence once called has been debated since Indiana’s first constitutional convention in 1816 and again in 1850.
It resurfaced most recently in a 2022 Indiana Supreme Court case involving Holcomb.
In that case, the high court justices struck down a statute — House Enrolled Act 1123 — that would have allowed the Legislative Council to call the full legislature into special session. The justices held that the governor alone has that authority — but notably did not decide whether the legislature is legally required to meet once the governor calls them in.
The 2022 ruling also traced how delegates in 1850 explicitly rejected proposals to allow the legislature to call itself into session — evidence which the justices said reflected a deliberate choice to vest that power exclusively in the governor.
The opinion further noted that while governors historically initiated special sessions, “the General Assembly retained authority over the conduct and duration of such sessions.”
Indiana Code currently caps special sessions at no more than 30 session days and no more than 40 calendar days following the first day of the governor’s desired session calendar.” 
Former House Speaker Brian Bosma, who served in more than half a dozen special sessions during his tenure, said his reading of the Indiana Constitution is that lawmakers are required to convene, even if only for minutes.

“My personal view, my read of the Constitution and statutes as a lawyer, is that the governor has every right to call us because it’s a singular right to call a special session. And I don’t see where the legislature can ignore that,” Bosma said. “But what I’m confident the legislature could do is come in on the first day and adjourn.”
He added that lawmakers could “adjourn after two minutes,” taking attendance, saying the pledge, and ending the session if they choose.

“It seems to me that the legislature is compelled to be there,” Bosma continued, “but it could adjourn.”
The former House speaker pointed to a notable gathering in 1991, when Senate Republicans abruptly adjourned the first special session during a budget impasse — and “no one questioned (then-Senate President Pro Tem Bob Garton’s) authority to do so.”
Could Braun force lawmakers to appear?
Internal legislative policies could help compel some senators — but only if enough show up in the chamber first.
Senate rules, for example, allow 25 members to “compel the attendance of absent Senators.” There are 40 Republican senators currently in office. 
If at least 25 senators appeared — along with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, who presides over the Senate as its constitutional president — they could order absent senators to return, issue calls of the Senate, or adjourn.
But, crucially, those powers apply only after the Senate gavels into session. If the chamber never convenes, none of those enforcement mechanisms can be activated.
Indiana has some precedent for large-scale absences, though. In 2011, Democrats fled the state during a weeks-long walkout over “right-to-work” legislation.
Bosma said “there has been discussion in the past” of the governor “dispatching the state police to collect people up and bring them in” — including in 2011. But while “it’s been threatened, it’s never happened.”
In the wake of that walkout, Indiana enacted “anti-bolting” laws that allow the House and Senate to fine members who intentionally refuse to attend and prevent a quorum. Those penalties can reach $1,000 per day. But those statutes apply only when the chamber is already in session — meaning they provide no mechanism for enforcing attendance at a special session lawmakers never convene.
Bosma emphasized that then-Gov. Mitch Daniels declined to send state police to retrieve the absent lawmakers, however, and noted that such a move today could be politically explosive.
“Certainly, it wouldn’t be done, I would think, (by) a Republican governor to Republican legislators,” he said. “But we’ll see how it plays out.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Minnesota cities and counties spent millions of opioid settlement payouts in 2024 largely on treatment, support for those in addiction recovery, education and administrative costs. Some Minnesota counties spent the cash on law enforcement expenditures intended to weed out drug stashes and bolster criminal investigations: Three spent money on K-9 units, and at least two counties used the funds to pay the salaries of agents investigating drug-related crimes.
The money comes from a series of settlements after state and local governments sued corporations — Johnson and Johnson, McKensson, CVS and other pharmaceutical giants — for their roles in creating and perpetuating the opioid epidemic.
Fewer Americans died from an opioid overdose in 2023 compared to 2022 — 79,358 compared to 81,806 — but that’s still up from 2019, when overdoses killed 49,860. The trend is similar in Minnesota, where opioid overdose deaths rose from around 400 a year in the late 2010s to roughly 1,000 per year since 2021. Provisional CDC data suggests that opioid overdose deaths decreased in 2024, mirroring the dip in all drug overdose deaths in Minnesota and the country.
Local governments have wide discretion in how they spend the money that’s intended to remediate the harms of the epidemic, which is reflected in the variety in local uses of settlement cash.
Local spending picked up in 2024 after a slow start in the first two years, which leaders told the Star Tribune was to be expected for strategizing and decision-making. In 2024, local governments spent over $17 million, compared to $5.5 million in 2023 and $538K in 2022.


The settlements are important in filling funding gaps in the steps of addiction care, said Jeremy Drucker, the state’s addiction and recovery director, who is himself in long-term recovery. Unlike treatment, prevention and long-term recovery services are not covered by Medicaid. Minnesota cities and counties have filled the gap with grants and now opioid settlements.
The largest portion of the settlement money in Minnesota has gone towards supporting people recovering from addiction. Clay County, for example, funded a new detox and withdrawal management facility that opened in 2024. Several counties partnered with existing organizations; Minneapolis spent $500,000 on Turning Point, an organization that provides culturally specific recovery services in north Minneapolis.
Another big chunk — nearly $4 million — was spent on administrative costs, largely to hire staff and form committees to figure out how to spend the rest of the money.
Hennepin County, which will receive over $70 million in the next 18 years, by far the largest share, spent $1.5 million on administrative costs in 2023 and 2024. Julie Bauch, the county’s opioid response senior strategist, said that spending went towards data analysts, contract managers, an opioid finance expert and other staff. The county also spent nearly $1 million on its medical examiner’s office to keep up with increased deaths from drug overdoses.
To date, drug makers, wholesalers and pharmacy chains have reached settlements to pay over $50 billion to state, local and tribal governments, with various deadlines within the next two decades. In Minnesota, an agreement between state and local governments dictates that 75% of the roughly $633 million so far in opioid settlements will go directly to cities and counties, which are required to report spending to the state but otherwise operate with relative autonomy. Though the agreement lists abatement strategies, it also explicitly states that fund recipients have the flexibility to modify their approach “as needed.”
A Tuesday decision by a federal bankruptcy judge adds another $7.4 billion from Purdue Pharma — which made over $35 billion selling OxyContin — and the Sackler family, Purdue’s owners and one of the most notorious players in fueling the opioid epidemic. Minnesota’s share of the Purdue settlement is $59 million over 15 years to state and local governments.
Nationwide, most opioid settlement money so far has gone to treatment, overdose reversal medications, education, counseling and housing-related programs for people with substance abuse issues. A smaller portion of funds went towards law enforcement initiatives like rifle suppressors in Indiana and drones in Arizona, which addiction experts found questionable, a KFF Health News analysis found.
Lackluster oversight of local spending in other states has resulted in expenditures like $600,000 for opioid-awareness concerts in New Jersey, which the state’s comptroller called a “waste” and “misuse” of funds.
Bauch said local governments may be tempted to get creative with opioid settlement money and use it to backfill federal cuts, but she added that Minnesota’s agreement has guardrails in place to prevent shenanigans.
According to the Opioid Settlement Tracker, a website created by lawyer Christine Minhee, Minnesota is one of 20 states committed to reporting 100% of its spending.
Some law enforcement spending seen as questionable
Abigail Winiker, a drug policy researcher, said in an interview that spending on K-9 units and officers for drug investigation task forces “doesn’t stand up to what I consider our standards for effective spending of settlement funds.”
Winiker is on a team at Johns Hopkins that laid out principles to localities spending opioid settlement dollars — a framework which Minnesota’s Department of Health adopts in its own guidance. The first two principles are to “spend the money to save lives” and to “use evidence to guide spending,” both of which are not met by law enforcement spending that targets drug supplies, in Winiker’s view, since drug busts are usually accompanied by arrests of addicts.
“We know from decades of failed Drug War policies and lots of research that a punitive approach to opioid use disorder is ineffective if you want to reduce the harms of the crisis,” Winiker said.
Winiker’s recommendation to counties handling smaller amounts of money is to “not try to re-invent the needle and look for work already being done on the ground” in recovery, harm reduction and prevention.
An opioid epidemic group at RAND also published strategies for allocating local settlement dollars that is referenced in the Minnesota Department of Health’s guide. Bradley Stein, the director of the group at RAND, agreed with Winiker’s assessment.
“I am not aware of anything in the opioid settlement language that would make getting a drug-sniffing dog consistent with the intention of the settlement,” Stein said. “The opioid settlement was pretty clear: It’s to help people that have been affected.”
Drucker said that although the state encourages local governments to invest in prevention, treatment and recovery services, the spirit behind the agreement giving local governments control over three-quarters of the funds was the belief that “local communities know their own needs.”
Kristen Pendergrass, the vice president of Shatterproof, a national addiction nonprofit, acknowledged that communities are faced with hard decisions when it comes to spending. Drug busts can actually make overdose rates go up — because users seek out new dealers with unfamiliar supply — and increase volatility of the drug supply, Pendergrass said. On the other hand, she added, ”We can’t just let illegal drugs flow into communities.”
Blue Earth, Redwood and Le Sueur counties spent a total of $86,156 on police dogs in 2024. Lakeville Police Department spent $196,998 to assign a full-time officer to a county drug task force.
“It’s really a holistic approach,” said Josh Milow, Blue Earth’s deputy county administrator. The county has also spent opioid settlement money to pay for mental health counselors in its schools along with programs for peer recovery support. “We’re really looking at early childhood, we’re looking at mental health, we’re looking at all those steps. Enforcement is also a piece of opioid remediation and we’re going to try to especially get fentanyl out of our community.”
Brad Paulson, the Lakeville chief of police, acknowledged in an email the value of education, treatment and recovery, but added: “Knowing that there are others actively working in those spaces, with the expertise to do so, we’ve chosen to steer our focus largely on the criminal aspect as that is the space we are most familiar with.”
Minnetonka spent $94,425 — most of its opioid settlement spending to date — on a device to identify drugs as well as a fume hood for its police evidence room. The description for the device purchase cites the strength of fentanyl and the need to minimize police exposure to illicit drugs.
Theories that significant fentanyl exposure can happen through skin contact or accidental inhalation have been debunked by the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology. Multiple studies have explored the pervasive misconception that law enforcement officers can accidentally overdose on fentanyl on the job, a belief bolstered by social media videos of officers experiencing symptoms of panic — not opioid overdose — after coming into contact with the drug.
“The fume hood and other tools help increase safety for our staff by decreasing the chance of accidental exposure (to all drugs, not just fentanyl),” said Jessica Case, a Minnetonka Police spokesperson, in an email.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-609942630-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 07:56:50.611714

This disparity is staggering, sobering and devastating. But surprising?
Tent Cities. The Wall of Forgotten Natives. 
When you drive around the streets of Minneapolis and other areas of the Twin Cities in recent years, the impact of homelessness on Native American communities — and particularly, unsheltered homelessness — has been unmissable. But our relatives’ stories are far more complex than what you see at first glance.
Wilder Research has been working in partnership with the Minnesota Tribal Collaborative to Prevent and End Homelessness, a group of tribal nations working together on homelessness, as well as housing service providers across the state to try to capture and tell these stories. 
In September, we released two companion reports (here, and here) that paint the most comprehensive picture to date of the challenges facing Native Americans experiencing homelessness statewide. This is what we learned: 

An alarming number of Native American adults who are experiencing homelessness are outside, unsheltered. About half of the Native Americans who we interviewed spent at least one night unsheltered in the past month, though many stayed outside for multiple nights.
Many Native American women experiencing homelessness are victims of violence and exploitation before and during their time without housing, echoing the broader crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives. About half of Native American women reported that they had stayed in an abusive situation because they had no other housing options. Native Americans experiencing homelessness are at high risk for being the victim of violence; 44% reported being attacked or assaulted.  
Lack of affordable housing is a critical barrier for homeless Native Americans in greater Minnesota, the Twin Cities metro, and on reservations. In the Twin Cities, Native Americans experiencing homelessness earn a median income of just $203 per month, far less than the median rent for a 1-bedroom apartment, which is $1,115.
High rates of mental illness and substance use disorders make it difficult for people experiencing homelessness to access and maintain stable housing. Native Americans experiencing homelessness were far more likely than non-Natives to have anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. Similarly, in our study, Native Americans were five times more likely than non-Natives experiencing homelessness to use fentanyl, four-and-a-half times more likely to use heroin, and three times more likely to use methamphetamines. 

These findings do not exist in a vacuum. They are the result of complex intergenerational and epigenetic trauma. There is a long history of displacement, suppression of culture, breaking up of traditional family and community systems, and genocide that has contributed to this tragic disparity in homelessness for Native Americans in Minnesota. 
Boarding schools, the Indian Adoption Project of the 1950s and 1960s, and the child “protection” system has taken generations of Native children from their families – 38% of Native American adults experiencing homelessness spent time in foster care, compared with 18% of non-Native adults. 
In the 1950s, the federal government also began systematically encouraging Native Americans to relocate from their reservations to several U.S. cities, including Minneapolis. Native American families were given a free one-way ticket, limited financial assistance, and the promise of vocational training, good jobs and a high quality of life. In reality, these families faced housing and job shortages, prejudice, and disconnection from their traditional food systems and cultural and community resources. 
These actions by the federal government (and many other systemic factors) directly contributed to the urban American Indian homelessness problem we face today. 
Despite all this, when we asked them what helps them stay strong during hard times, Native Americans experiencing homelessness identified as strengths their determination, love and responsibility for their children, and resiliency. It is critical to recognize these strengths in any solutions to addressing homelessness.
Self-determination is a key component of any solution to this problem. Our relatives who are experiencing homelessness should be at the center of any solution, with tribal nations and urban American Indian community leaders surrounding these relatives in a protective circle of support and culturally driven approaches. 
Local, state and federal government agencies and private funders should address this circle with humility and respect and should offer a multi-jurisdictional, all-hands-on-deck response to fix this problem that their systems have created over time.  
As a community member, if you want to help, there are many things you can do. You can volunteer for and/or donate to local homeless service providers, including those that focus on the Native American community. Or, consider volunteering for the next Minnesota Homeless Study, taking place in October 2026.

 don’t tax me,
 tax the man behind the tree.
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s recent announcement that he wants to eliminate the Missouri’s income tax causes me to paraphrase this old poem, used often by the late U.S. Sen. Russell Long, longtime chair (1966-1981) of the Senate Finance Committee, when considering proposals for whatever was presented as “tax reform.”
No matter what the fate of the state income tax, the real questions are: (1) for what purposes does the state take our money? (2)  How much money does the government need? and (3) who’s going to pay?
The income tax, like all taxes, starts out with a bad rap.
The more money you make, the more income tax you pay. An income tax can be progressive — before that word came to mean “bad” to some people and “good” to others — which means that the higher your income goes, the higher the percentage the government takes. Missouri’s income tax can hardly be called progressive because it only goes up from 2% to about 4.8%. It used to be 6%, but in recent years legislators could not resist the urge to “cut” taxes even if the cut was modest and triggered by some supposedly good news about tax collections.
The brutal unforgiving fact is that government costs money, and it’s got to come from someone.
If you cannot find the man behind the tree… well, you can’t tax the tree.
Somebody’s got to pay for public education, roads, bridges, public transportation, public health, health care, mental health, courts, law enforcement, state parks, recreation areas, protection of the natural environment and the National Guard.
The public goods that we buy collectively through our governments are what we need to help us make and keep our civilization. Civilization ain’t cheap. A society can go cheap, but going cheap costs a lot. Just look around. You may see some things that inspire you, but a lot of other things really need improvement.
The quality of a state’s civilization is what attracts people to move here and keeps young people from moving away. St. Louis, for instance, has public institutions like the zoo, history museum, botanical garden, science center, art museum, public libraries, well maintained public parks that are free — all supported by taxes and augmented by charitable contributions.
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. said: “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society….”
 How much money does the government need to nurture a civilized society? Actually, it’s “governments” plural.
School districts are governments that get about half of their budgets from the state. Some districts are being driven by rising costs to four-day weeks, leading us to ask President George W. Bush’s famous question: “Is our children learning?”
Sewer districts, water districts, fire districts, library districts, mosquito control districts, counties, municipalities — they all need money.
The state’s major source of revenue is the income tax. Local governments, school districts and other special districts “own” the property tax, and municipalities and counties “own” the sales tax, with a few exceptions.
Real estate taxes are unpopular because they are based on the rates set locally and the valuations of real property are set by assessors, who in most counties are elected. Disparities exist. The loss of your job does not affect how much property tax you pay. The same is true for the annoying annual personal property tax.
The sales tax is relatively popular among the rich and the near-rich — those who don’t spend all their money on necessities. The sales tax only taxes certain things you buy, mostly goods but not services.
Missouri’s “modern” sales tax was enacted when the economy was largely goods. Services, by and large, are not taxed. Now that we are mainly in a service economy, the current sales tax is stressed out. If the state broadens the base of what is taxed as sales, as a way of making up for ditching the income tax, the burden of taxation will fall disproportionately on those who need to spend all or most of their money on necessities.
In the 1970s, U.S. Rep. Al Ullman, a Democrat from Oregon, proposed a “value-added tax,” a consumption tax that is added to a product at each stage of production or distribution. The value-added tax would have replaced some or all the federal income tax.
It is used in more than 160 countries including the European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom. But it’s not the most popular idea in America. At Ullman’s next election, his constituents voted that he should retire from public service. Sadly, for him, there was no man behind the tree.
So how do the governor and his legislative allies eliminate the state income tax? Eliminating the tax is easy. Replacing it is hard.
Watch for this: One approach is a “phase-in,” meaning that our leaders will do “tax reform” over a period of years, so their voters presumably won’t notice. But if people fail to notice, it will be like the old “boiling frog” story — if you put a frog into boiling water, he will immediately jump out, but if you put the frog in cool water and gradually turn up the heat he will stay in the pot until he’s cooked.
Bad ideas are bad ideas even when they are phased in. The challenge for our leaders will be to find good and equitable replacements for the income tax, if they exist.  Voters who pay attention, I hope, will not fall for any proposal that starts with the prefix “re” – as in reform, reorganize, reallocate, etc.
Especially as concerns taxation, if we go for “reform” that is “phased in,” we may get cooked.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Assembly met for its final floor session of 2025 Wednesday, where Democratic lawmakers sought to pass a bill that would extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers for one year after the birth of a child, though Republicans blocked it. Bills to encourage school district consolidation and make changes to elections laws passed.
Republicans block Democratic efforts to get a vote on postpartum Medicaid bill 
Wisconsin is one of two states in the U.S. that have not taken the federal government’s postpartum Medicaid expansion, and Democratic lawmakers hoped to begin the process of changing that during the floor session. 
The bill, which passed the Senate in April on a 32-1 vote, would allow eligible mothers to keep their Medicaid coverage for a year postpartum. Currently in Wisconsin, mothers only get 60 days of coverage if they don’t otherwise qualify for Medicaid.
Assembly Democrats planned to employ a rarely used Assembly rule to pull the bill out of committee and bring it up for a vote. Under the rule, if 50 lawmakers sign a petition, a bill can be brought to the floor. Democratic lawmakers hoped to have the chance to convince some of the Republican cosponsors of the bill to sign on.
Before that could come to fruition, however, the Assembly clerk notified Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) of the plan, Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told reporters. 
Republicans moved the bill from the Assembly Rules Committee, where it had sat since May, to the Assembly Organization Committee — triggering a rule that says a  withdrawal petition on the bill cannot be circulated for 21 days. 
“This is a great effort by the Speaker to prevent this important bill from getting a vote on the floor,” Neubauer said. 
Neubauer said she didn’t know why the clerk notified the Assembly Republican leaders.
“There had been some conversation with staff about the timeline for [the petition], but I’m not really sure why it happened the way it did,” Neubauer told reporters. She said that Rick Champagne, director of the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, told the lawmakers that notification should have happened when they turned the petition in with the 50 signatures, not prior to the petition circulating.
All 45 Democratic lawmakers are cosponsors of the bill as are over 20 Republicans, but the bill has been hung up in the Assembly due to opposition from Vos, who has said in the past that he doesn’t support expanding “welfare.” The bill only needs a simple majority of 50 votes to pass the Assembly.
Neubauer read out the names of the Republican cosponsors during the press conference. 
“These are legislators who believe that this bill should become law, so they say, but they have been bullied by their speaker into not pushing for a vote on this bill on the floor,” Neubauer said. “Frankly, Robin Vos’ move to prevent us from circulating this petition and his refusal to bring this bill to the floor is pathetic, and when moms in Wisconsin and their babies are put at risk, their health and well-being is put at risk, because they do not have adequate health care in the year after they have given birth, it will be Robin Vos’ fault.” 
The Republican lawmakers on the bill include Reps. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston), Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek), Scott Allen (R-Waukesha), Elijah Behnke (R-Town of Chase), Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc), Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield), Cindi Duchow (R-Delafield), Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere), Rick Gundrum (R-Slinger), Nate Gustafson (R-Omro), Dean Kaufert (R-Neenah), Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay), Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond), Scott Krug (R-Rome), Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin), Paul Melotik (R-Grafton), Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz), Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville), Kevin Petersen (R-Waupaca), David Steffen (R-Howard), Rob Tusler (R-Harrison), Chuck Wichgers (Muskego), Rob Wittke (R-Caledonia), Rob Summerfield (R-Bloomer), Calvin T. Callahan (R-Tomahawk), Clint Moses (R-Menomonie) and Joy Goeben (R-Hobart). 
Democratic lawmakers also tried to introduce amendments to a bill on the floor that would have extended postpartum Medicaid coverage, but those were also blocked by Republicans.
“It shouldn’t be this hard to get Republicans to do the right thing. Wisconsin women deserve access to quality, affordable health care and that includes postpartum care,” Vining said before she was cut off by Speaker Pro Tempore Kevin Petersen who said she wasn’t on topic.
“This is a disgrace,” Vining yelled out.
School district consolidation 
Democratic and Republican lawmakers split over a package of bills that would encourage school districts to consolidate. Republican lawmakers argue the bills are necessary due to falling enrollment, which they say is the reason for school districts’ financial struggles. 
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said at a press conference that the bills would address declining enrollment and the cycle of repeatedly going to referendum to raise money from local taxpayers that school districts are in. Schools in Wisconsin have seen a drop of about 53,000 students over a decade, from the 2013-14 to 2022-23 school years.

Of Wisconsin’s 421 school districts, about two-thirds are struggling with declining enrollment with preliminary numbers from the Department of Public Instruction showing that enrollment for public school districts in the 2025-26 school year fell by about 13,600 students. Total enrollment across Wisconsin school districts is about 759,800 this year. 
“Districts with declining enrollment receive less in state aid and to make up for that revenue loss. We’ve seen a growing cycle of constant referendums with varying degrees of success,” Nedweski said. “Wisconsin taxpayers are frustrated with our public school system… They are frustrated with districts continuously asking them to raise their own taxes, frustrated that their generous investments have not produced matching results.”
Democrats blamed Republicans for school districts having to go to referendum, noting that state aid has not kept pace with inflation in nearly two decades. They also said Wisconsinites have not been asking to close schools. Neubauer said Republicans were “proving how disconnected they are from our constituents.”
“Wisconsinites do not want to close school buildings, break up their communities, force their kids to ride on the bus for hours a day, or lose their local sports teams. Wisconsinites want us to fund our public schools,” Neubauer said. “Republicans’ push to close schools misses the mark completely, and Wisconsinites deserve better… Don’t close schools, fund them.”
According to the Department of Public Instruction, Wisconsin is spending the least, proportionally, in state revenue that it has ever spent on schools under the current funding formula. About 32.1% of state general purpose revenue goes to state general aid to schools, while that percentage used to be around 35%.
Rep. Angelina Cruz (R-Racine) noted during floor debate that many school districts lost state aid this year. Data from DPI for the 2025-26 school year shows that of 421 districts, 71% — or 301 districts — will receive less state aid this year compared to the prior year and 26% will receive more.
“For 15 years, Wisconsin has intentionally divested in our public schools while expanding privatization through voucher schemes,” Cruz said at a press conference, adding that Racine Unified School District has felt the loss of revenue acutely.
According to DPI data, about 15% of Racine’s revenue limit — or $43 million — goes to pay for voucher program participants.
“Since 2011, our community has gone to referendum three times —  in 2014, 2020 and 2025 — asking residents to raise their own property taxes to provide what the state has refused to fund,” Cruz said. “Even after those referendum paths, our district has been forced to close and consolidate schools including… the school where I grew up as a teacher. This is not about a lack of community commitment. It is about the state failing its constitutional obligation to provide free and as nearly uniform as practicable schools to children… Let me be clear, if there is money to close public schools, there is money to fund public schools.”
Rep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay) rejected claims that the choice program is to blame.
“That’s a tiny little percentage of this,” Kitchens said. “It’s happening because of declining birth rates, of people choosing to have less kids, waiting long to have kids. I can’t imagine how anybody can look at our 421 school districts that we have right now and think that in 30 years, that’s going to be sustainable.”
Kitchens also emphasized that the bills are voluntary.
“Let’s trust our communities to work through these things and decide for what’s best for themselves,” Kitchens said. 
Republicans also rejected Democratic lawmakers’ insistence that the state needs to invest more money in its public schools. 
“[Democrats] want us to believe that if we simply spend more on K-12, people will flock to Wisconsin and increase enrollment,” Nedweski said. She compared Wisconsin to New York, which according to the New York Focus spends more per public school student than any other state. “Their outcomes are no better than ours, and they are losing students even faster than Wisconsin. As they elect more communist leaders like [New York City Mayor-elect] Zohran Mamdani, I suspect more New Yorkers will rapidly leave tax-and-spend Democratic Socialist policies. More spending is not a strategy, it’s denial.”
Nedweski said the bills are a “lifeline” for school districts that can use it and will encourage savings and “invest in increasing opportunities for students who may not otherwise have access to things like AP classes, world languages, advanced tech ed and specialized learning services.”
The six bills in the package:

AB 644 would increase additional state aid to schools that consolidate in 2027, 2028 and 2029 to $2,000 per pupil in the first year. Under current law, school districts receive additional aid when they consolidate. For the first five years after consolidation, a consolidated school district gets $150 per pupil. In the sixth year, the aid drops to 50% of what the school district received in the fifth year and in the seventh year, the aid drops to 25% of the fifth year. It passed 53-44 with Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) joining Democrats against the bill. 


AB 645 would provide grants of up to $25,000 to groups of two or more school district boards for the costs of a feasibility study for school district consolidation or whole grade sharing agreements. It passed on a voice vote.
AB 646 would launch a study of Wisconsin’s school districts, looking at current school district boundaries, potential school district consolidations, existing school district facilities, staffing levels and salary scales, the population of school-age children in each school district, and revenue limits and current overall spending. It passed 54-43 along party lines.


AB 647 would create a four-year grant program for school districts that enter into a whole-grade sharing agreement, agreeing to educate students at one location. School districts would get up to $500 per pupil enrolled in a single grade. It passed 54-43 along party lines.


AB 648 would help create new supplemental state aid for consolidated school districts to  address differences in school districts’ levies when they merge. The measure is meant to address concerns of higher property taxes for residents of low-levy districts when a consolidation takes place. It passed 54-43 along party lines.
 AB 649 provides the funding for the bills, including $2.7 million for grants to schools that enter whole-grade sharing agreements, $3 million to provide state aid to offset levy limit differences and $250,000 for feasibility studies. It passed 54-43 along party lines.

Vote on online sports betting bill delayed
After being fast tracked through the public hearing process, a vote on a bipartisan bill that would legalize online sports betting in Wisconsin was postponed. 
The Wisconsin Constitution requires that gambling in the state must be managed by the state’s federally recognized Native American tribes. Following that requirement, sports betting has been allowed in Wisconsin since 2021, but bets have had to be made in person at tribal casinos. 
AB 601 would expand this to allow for online sports betting anywhere in the state by placing servers running the betting websites and apps to be housed on tribal land; this is known as a “hub and spoke” model. It was introduced in October and received hearings in the Assembly and Senate earlier this month. 
Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) said that he still would have had the votes on the bill if it had come up for a vote, but he had conversations with members of his caucus over the weekend that brought new issues to his attention. He would not provide details on what the concerns were, though he said they didn’t deal with issues of constitutionality.
“I’m not going to get into the details of the conversations that I’ve had with members,” August said. “We’re just working through some of that right now, and I’m confident that there’s no rush on this. It’s the right thing for the state, and I’m confident that we’ll get there.”
Neubauer said she planned to support the bill. 
“We know that our tribes in Wisconsin have the right to control gaming in our state, and right now, that’s not happening with online sports betting,” Neubauer said. “I do hope that we pass a bill that puts control of that industry back in their hands.”
The Assembly passed and concurred in a total of over 50 bills. Others include:  

AB 596 and AB 597, which passed unanimously, would direct $1.9 million to be used for a state grant match program for veterans’ housing. A nonprofit group would need to be participating in the federal program, which currently provides about $82 per day per veteran housed to groups that offer wraparound supportive services to homeless veterans, to be eligible for a state matching funds of $25 per day per veteran. While no one voted against the bills, Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns that the bill would not fill the gaps that currently exist due to the closure of two Veterans Housing and Recovery Program sites earlier this year. 
AB 602, which would instruct Evers to opt into a federal school choice program, passed 54-44 along party lines. 
A pair of bills meant to help address students who are disruptive in class passed in 54-43 votes. AB 613 would require principals to provide written notification to parents every time a student is removed from a class and “the quality or quantity of instructional time provided to the pupils in the class is diminished.” AB 614 would add language into state law to say that teachers are allowed to maintain order in the teacher’s classroom, establish and enforce classroom rules, call 911 in an emergency, take immediate action if a pupil’s behavior is dangerous or disruptive and request assistance from school administrators during a disruptive or violent incident.
AB 207, which would provide information about constitutional amendments to voters including their potential effects, passed on a voice vote.
AB 312  passed on a voice vote. It would require absentee voting sites to be open for at least 20 hours during the period for voting absentee in-person.
AB 385 passed in a 55-42 vote with Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh) joining Republicans in favor. The bill would prohibit a political committee, political party or conduit from accepting contributions that are made with a credit card online unless the contributor provides their credit card verification value (CVV) or code and the billing address associated with the card is located in the United States. Republican state lawmakers introduced the bill following efforts by Republicans and the Trump administration to target ActBlue — a Massachusetts-based platform that processes donations to Democratic campaigns. 
AB 617 passed 53-44. Rep. Paul Tittl joined Democrats voting against the bill. It would make a number of changes to elections law, including requiring that alternate absentee ballot sites must be in a building or facility constituting a fixed location and requiring absentee ballots with faulty or missing certifications be returned to voters if they are received seven days before the election. It is similar to a bill introduced last session, but it does not include a provision that would have allowed for Monday processing of absentee ballots. Rep. Scott Krug (R-Rome) said that he is speaking with the Assembly Elections Committee chair about potentially having an informational hearing on Monday processing.

Young Municipal Center, Detroit | Susan J. DemasFollowing an Australian clean energy company’s decision in September to cancel plans for a battery plant in Detroit, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) joined leaders from the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 58 to break down how the project could have helped the community. 
Fortescue, a green technology and metals company, announced in 2024 that it would redevelop a vacant industrial building near the historic Ford Piquette Plant into a $210 million electric vehicle battery factory which was expected to create 600 jobs. However, that plan soured, with the company telling Crain’s Detroit Business that the “current policy settings and market conditions” including President Donald Trump’s Administration’s decision to eliminate “critical tax credits” for electric vehicles and clean energy were the driving force behind the decision to scrap the project. 
Chang, who has served in the Legislature since 2015, noted that she has represented communities throughout Detroit who are facing environmental justice concerns, including disproportionate impacts from air pollution. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She noted that the Asthma and Allergy Foundation had ranked Detroit as the most challenging city in the nation for people with asthma based on the prevalence of asthma, and the higher than average number of asthma deaths, with vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions serving as major risk factors for individuals with respiratory conditions.
The Fortescue plant would have been an amazing example of revitalization for the city, Chang said, with construction crews already working on remediation and electrical upgrades. However, the Trump Administration’s move to cut support for clean energy and transportation put a stop to that, Chang said. 
“And this is after $12.7 million in state incentives and $11 million in Detroit incentives that were offered and thankfully were not paid out due to the cancelation,” Chang said. “About eight out of 10 Michiganders support clean energy investments, but the Trump administration is out of step with what our state wants and what Michiganders need.”
Clean energy advocates held a press conference detailing what was lost in Fortescue’s decision to cancel plans for a $210 electric vehicle battery plant in Detroit. Nov. 19, 2025 | Screenshot
As a result, Detroiters and Michiganders are seeing stalled progress and backward momentum on clean energy jobs, Chang said.
The potential health benefits that could have come alongside the adoption of more EVs and clean energy sources will also go unrealized, Chang said, 
“Detroiters with asthma are going to continue to suffer. Clean air would have led to better health and more worker productivity, but we are going to be losing out on this opportunity.” Chang said. “So today, we are calling on the Trump administration to end the attacks on climate policy and clean energy investments. Michiganders and Americans deserve clean air and good clean energy jobs, and the federal government should do its part.”
Jamie Racklyeft, the executive director of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, argued against treating investments in clean energy as a partisan issue. 
“Michigan now has well over 120,000 people working in clean energy and clean transportation jobs, with the sector growing faster than the overall economy and ranking among the strongest in the nation,” Racklyeft said. “Every lost project means fewer paychecks, slower neighborhood revitalization and more tailpipe and smokestack pollution in places that have already carried that burden for generations.”
Meanwhile, China continues to dominate the EV market, while the U.S. only makes up a small margin of EVs sold, Racklyeft said. 
“Analysts are warning the continued policy uncertainty here will only help China pull farther ahead in the global EV race,” Racklyeft said. “This is the real choice in front of us. Do we want to import the clean vehicles of the future, or design, engineer and build better vehicles here in Detroit and across Michigan?”
Andrew Dueweke, the assistant business manager for the IBEW Local 58, similarly called for people to look past the politics on clean energy. 
“Who knows when this investment might be able to come back to the city,” Dueweke said. 
As members of the Legislature weigh what the future of the state’s tax incentives will look like for businesses, Chang said she was hopeful supporting clean energy jobs could be a part of that conversation.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_9079-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 06:56:20.398912

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Directors of a Madison health care system will consider Thursday whether to change course in the organization’s response to a union organizing campaign.
Supporters of the union campaign at Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin put five motions before the board of directors at an in-person meeting in October — including one to voluntarily recognize the union, SEIU Wisconsin.
A statement from the co-op management Wednesday did not address whether the board will directly act on any of the motions when it meets.
“The motions are advisory to the Board of Directors concerning its instructions to management about the unionization efforts of our direct care employees,” Group Health stated. “All the Motions will be considered by the Board at the November 20th meeting. The results of those discussions will be communicated to our membership in a future statement.”
Group Health’s response to the union drive, which became public about a year ago, has produced a rift between the co-op’s management and some of its members, who have criticized the organization’s response as a betrayal of its progressive heritage.
“To me it was horrifying to learn that we had people leaving because the conditions were not tolerable,” said Ruth Brill, a Group Health member since 1979 who has supported the union organizing campaign.
According to union supporters, the five motions offered at an Oct. 11 in-person mass meeting to discuss the union organizing campaign passed unanimously. About 170 Group Health members attended that meeting, and union allies said it was the largest turnout in memory for an in-person meeting of co-op members.
Three of the five motions call on the board, the co-op management, or both:

To report to members how much money Group Health has spent in 2024 and 2025 to pay the law firm Husch Blackwell, which has represented the co-op in connection with the union campaign.
To voluntarily recognize SEIU Wisconsin as the representative for the professions and departments that the union first sought to represent when workers petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a union election on Dec. 12, 2024. That motion also demands that Group Health “observe strict neutrality regarding the unionization of any of its workers.”
To compile a report “of all meeting minutes, emails, and other communications involving Board members, administrators, and/or supervisory employees regarding union activity, from January 2024 to the present.”

The third motion also demands a report on all legal or consulting fees that Group Health has spent related to the union drive, including itemized details.
The fourth motion demands that the board and administration “faithfully follow the democratically expressed will” of the co-op members, charging that the membership has “been denied an opportunity to duly and fully exercise its role” in leading the co-op.
The fifth motion calls for a meeting by mid-January “on the democratization of GHC governance.”
“GHC says members are the most important part of our cooperative and yet the board is not listening to what the members have very clearly stated what they would like to happen,” said Dr. Nisha Rajagopalan, a family practice physician and among the union campaign’s leaders.
“If we are a cooperative that is for our members and our patients, those people showed up in the room and they voted and said exactly what they wanted, and we would like to hear the board uphold that,” said Katie Cloud, a certified medical assistant who has also been active in the union campaign.
Paul Terranova, a Group Health member for 25 years, organized a presentation to the co-op board earlier this year to make the case for unionization in the context of a nonprofit co-op. He later helped organize a slate of candidates for the board in opposition to four incumbent board members. All four of the rival candidates were elected in June.
Terranova said that board members have not communicated directly with Group Health members about the union campaign. Board discussions about the matter have been conducted in closed sessions.
The board’s consideration of the motions is “a really pivotal moment for GHC,” Terranova said, “and how they handle this is going to say a lot about whether this is still a cooperative or if it’s become just a corporate board with cooperative window dressing.”



 A conflict over who should be in the union and how it should be recognized
The union campaign at Group Health Cooperative has been mired in conflict over who should be represented.
Originally union organizing focused on specific health care professions in specific departments where union activists said there was the strongest interest in union representation and where there were specific concerns in common about working conditions.
Group Health management opposed that bargaining unit, asserting that because Group Health is “an integrated care delivery system” all health care-related staff should be included and should vote in the election.
Union supporters have argued that expanding who votes in the election was a ploy to defeat the union, an accusation that Group Health management officials have denied.
“The only reason to include people who would not be interested [in union representation] would be to water down the vote, so that there’s a higher chance that the vote for representation will fail,” said Ruth Brill, a retired member of the state employees’ union who is supporting the Group Health unionizing campaign.
Hoping for a compromise agreement, the union and employees leading the union campaign changed their petition to confine the election to a single clinic. Instead, however, the co-op stuck to the original management proposal covering all health care workers.
The National Labor Relations Board regional director assigned to the case chose the company’s proposed unit over the union’s single clinic proposal.
After that decision, however, SEIU Wisconsin argued that dozens of unfair labor practice charges against Group Health would intimidate employees from voting for the union and prevent a fair election. The NLRB regional director agreed to block the election until the unfair labor practice charges are resolved.
While awaiting the NLRB’s investigation of the charges, employees campaigning for the union have argued instead that Group Health should voluntarily recognize the original bargaining unit that the union proposed.

The National Conference of State Legislatures and Council of State Governments West have long provided research and training to members and staff of the Wyoming Legislature, but annual dues raised eyebrows earlier this year. 
The post Wyoming Legislature reverses course on axing memberships with national associations perceived as too costly, liberal appear[...]","Lawmakers reversed course Tuesday on the prospect of cutting ties with two national, non-partisan, non-profit organizations that have long provided research and training to members and staff of the Wyoming Legislature. 
Wyoming pays biennial dues to the Council of State Governments West and the National Conference of State Legislatures that cost approximately $271,300 and $293,500 respectively. Each is included in the Legislature’s two-year operating budget lawmakers approve in even-numbered years. 
The value of those memberships, however, came into question during a Management Council meeting in April. As such, lawmakers invited both national groups to attend Tuesday’s meeting to make their case. Ultimately, their pitches worked. 
“If the good [Senate] President and I had not asked those questions, we wouldn’t have learned all this information we’ve had today,” Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, said at the meeting. “I will tell you right up front, I had no idea how much our Legislative Service Office utilizes NCSL and the amount of value that it evidently brings to our offices, and to those folks here that we’re counting on to help us with all our duties, and obligations, responsibilities,” he said. 
Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, said he agreed with Neiman, and also thanked Montana State Sen. Barry Usher, NCSL’s president-elect, who testified at the meeting and met with the two Wyoming lawmakers ahead of the meeting.
“It was a very enlightening and great conversation, and I appreciate you challenging us to step out and step up and get out of our echo chambers, and not being afraid to defend our ideas,” Biteman said. 
The council voted unanimously to sponsor the budget bill with the dues intact. 
How we got here
Concern over membership dues grew out of a discussion by the Management Council in April over whether to update its reimbursement policy for out-of-state travel. 
The policy covers two meetings per lawmaker during the legislative off-season of “a national or regional organization in which the Legislature participates,” such as NCSL or CSG West. All other out-of-state travel must be specifically approved in advance by the Management Council. 
In April, the council changed the policy to include travel expenses for lawmakers who attend American Legislative Exchange Council meetings. Also known as ALEC, the group is a national organization funded by corporate and conservative donors known for pushing model bills out to state legislatures. The argument to include ALEC in the policy partly originated with how lawmakers perceived the other groups already included in the policy.

“I’m not going to throw one of [those] organizations under the bus,” Biteman said at the April meeting. “But I went to one of them and wasn’t impressed. It just wasn’t — it did have kind of a liberal bent to it. I didn’t enjoy any of the programming.” 
Tuesday meeting
Edgar Ruiz, director of CSG West, defended his organization Tuesday to the Management Council. 
“We’re not a federal program. We’re not a think tank. We’re not a lobbying group. And we’re not an association that is separate from the states that we serve,” Ruiz said. “Rather, CSG West is a member-driven, member-led organization that services you.”
Ruiz also explained how the organization supports all three branches of state government and how it protects its “political balance.”
“Our four officers rotate among a Republican and a Democrat. Each of our policy committees are co-led by a Republican and Democrat,” he said. “And our executive committee, which is our governing board, is comprised of legislative leaders of the 13 western states that we serve.”
Ruiz also detailed the key regional issues CSG West brings lawmakers to examine together, including water, agriculture, energy and public safety. 
In 2018, in particular, the organization worked with Wyoming legislators to sort out “what was causing our Department of Corrections’ budget to continually go up,” Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, said.

It wasn’t clear at the time whether the cause was Wyoming judges sentencing too harshly, law enforcement overresponding, or something in state statute, Nethercott said. 
But CSG West, in partnership with Pew Charitable Trusts and federal agencies, worked to identify the problem — probation revocations — saving the state $18 million in contract bed costs. 
Rather than merely pointing to what other states were doing, Nethercott said CSG helped lawmakers craft solutions by providing “necessary information to make real, sound policy decisions that was based on Wyoming data.”
Montana Sen. Usher, meanwhile, spoke on behalf of NCSL. 
“NCSL is the only bipartisan organization dedicated solely to America’s state legislatures,” Usher said. “Whether you’re a deep conservative member like myself, or a liberal member, NCSL is the place where we can come together, compare notes, and share what we are working on in our states.”
Usher said one of his leadership goals for the organization “is to change the perception that NCSL is a liberal organization. I can assure you it is not. The conversations lean whatever way those in attendance take it.”
Usher also noted that his home state and Wyoming have some of the lowest staff per legislator rates, making NCSL that much more valuable. 
That benefit was reiterated by Legislative Service Office Director Matt Obrecht. 
“About 10 years ago, I had a unique ethics question that I was working on a memo for the Senate Rules Committee, and I was just absolutely hitting a dead end with my own research on that,” Obrecht told the council. “No court cases on it. It’s a legislative ethics question. I couldn’t find anything online. So I called NCSL.”
The organization gave him the help he wouldn’t have found otherwise, Obrecht said. 
“What I’m hearing you say is you feel that the value is there,” Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, said. “I’m asking you directly the value, the cost of these two organizations from a staff standpoint. I’m not talking about legislators and what we get out of it. But from a staff standpoint, do you feel that the money we spend on these organizations is worth it?”
“What we pay in dues to NCSL and CSG is an absolute bargain for what we get in return,” Obrecht said, adding that the organizations also rely on LSO for fiscal and budget information as well as responses to surveys and questionnaires. 
Later in the meeting, Nethercott pointed to the “’Colorado River situation’ as one of the great challenges facing us.”
“The ability to have a non-partisan entity providing a structure for us to participate and build a network of relationships within the region to help tackle this fundamental issue — I think we are not fully appreciating the significance of that,” she said. 
The legislative budget will still need to be approved by the full Legislature, which convenes for the 2026 budget session in February.

Roberts — the former president of Wyoming Catholic College, now president of the Heritage Foundation — apologized for using an antisemitic trope.
The post Antisemitism accusations plagued Kevin Roberts’ political heroes too appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by National Catholic Reporter.
In the bruising backlash over his defense of conservative commentator Tucker Carlson’s interview with notorious white Christian nationalist Nick Fuentes, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts faces similar accusations to those that plagued his two greatest political heroes.  

Analysis

Moreover, as a prominent critic of “cancel culture,” a leading Catholic traditionalist and a shepherd of the controversial Project 2025 government reorganization plan, Roberts finds himself threatened with cancellation.
Roberts, 51, is the former president of tiny Wyoming Catholic College who vaulted into his $926,000-a-year position atop Heritage in 2021 after a four-year stint at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation.
Roberts describes himself as a “devotee” of Russell Kirk, who died in 1994.
Kirk, who authored the canonical 1953 book The Conservative Mind, and Pat Buchanan, conservative political pundit and perennial presidential candidate, were repeatedly branded — many say unfairly — as antisemites, mainly for their shared belief that Israel had too much influence over American foreign policy. 
Roberts has described The Conservative Mind as “the most important book about conservatism ever written.”  
Buchanan, who retired from public life in 2023 and is now 87 years old, has long been Roberts’ political idol and guiding star. As a college freshman in his native Lafayette, Louisiana, Roberts organized a rally for Buchanan’s 1992 primary campaign against eventual nominee George H.W. Bush. Roberts also attended the Republican convention in the Houston Astrodome, where Buchanan delivered his famous “culture war” speech. 
Both Kirk, considered a father of the so-called “paleoconservative” movement, and Buchanan, a former advisor to Presidents Reagan, Nixon and Ford, faced accusations of antisemitism over statements about Israel and its purported outsized influence on American policy. 
Kirk said in a 1988 Heritage Foundation lecture: “Not seldom it has seemed as if some eminent neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United States.” Midge Decter, Jewish director of the Committee for the Free World and wife of neoconservative mainstay Norman Podhoretz, attacked Kirk’s comments as “a bloody outrage, a piece of anti-Semitism.” Kirk also opposed the first Gulf War in 1990, calling it a “war for an oil can.”
Buchanan, who grew up in a family steeped in the isolationist, antisemitic rhetoric of Catholic radio broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin and famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, also used similar language in his opposition to the Gulf War. On a 1990 television broadcast of “The McLaughlin Group”, Buchanan declared, “Capitol Hill is Israeli-occupied territory.” Later that year, on the same show, Buchanan said, “there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East — the Israeli defense ministry and its ‘amen corner’ in the United States.”
Buchanan’s comments inspired the wrath of the late New York Times editor and columnist Abe Rosenthal, and prompted a 40,000-word article examining conservatives’ antisemitism by William F. Buckley Jr. in his National Review magazine. Comments by Rosenthal and others, including Holocaust survivor and author Eli Weisel, were scathing. Buckley was more forgiving. Buckley concluded: “If you ask, do I think Pat Buchanan is an antisemite, my answer is, he is not one. But I think he’s said some antisemitic things.”
Unlike Kirk and Buchanan, Kevin Roberts has publicly condemned antisemitism on several occasions. Under his leadership, Heritage unveiled “Project Esther” in 2024 to combat antisemitism. 
But as a result of his comments defending Tucker Carlson after Carlson hosted white Christian nationalist Nick Fuentes, Roberts found himself in a similar pickle as his ideological role models, but with far greater potential consequences.
In a video statement, Roberts characterized criticism of Carlson as “slander” by a “venomous coalition” and said the outspoken former Fox News star will always remain “a close friend of The Heritage Foundation.” Roberts said that while he “abhors” some things that Nick Fuentes has said, “cancelling him is not the answer either.”
But the most damaging part of his defense may have been his comment that “Christians are entitled to critique the State of Israel without being labeled as antisemitic.” Later, he added, “…conservatives should not be compelled to automatically support any foreign government, regardless of the pressure from the globalist elite or their representatives in Washington.” The term “globalist elite” is sometimes interpreted as an antisemitic trope.
Most of the immediate backlash focused on Fuentes and his well-established racist and antisemitic stances. The lead editorial in the Nov. 2 Wall Street Journal began “An old political poison is growing on the new right, led by podcasters and internet opportunists who are preoccupied with the Jews. It is spreading wider and faster than we thought and it has even found an apologist in Kevin Roberts, president of the venerable Heritage Foundation.”
But the editorial also focused on Roberts’ distinction between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. “This is what Hamas supporters on the left say: What do you mean? We were only criticizing Israel. Not exactly.” The editors even borrowed a line from William Buckley’s takedown of Pat Buchanan, calling Roberts “a pyromaniac in a field of straw men.”
But while Kirk and Buchanan suffered few consequences for their controversial statements, interpreted by many as antisemitic, Roberts’ future at Heritage seems endangered. In the wake of the dust-up, several staffers resigned or moved to other positions. Roberts issued another statement strongly condemning Fuentes.
Earlier this month, Roberts apologized before an all-staff meeting at Heritage headquarters in Washington. His contrite comments were leaked to the Jewish News Syndicate and Washington Free Beacon.
“I made a mistake, and I let you down and I let this down this institution. Period. Full stop,” Roberts told the staffers, according to the Jewish News and Free Beacon reports. He said the comments were written by his former chief of staff, Ryan Neuhaus, who was subsequently removed from the position. But Roberts said it was his fault for not sufficiently reviewing the material before making his comments, released as a video on X.
“I didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy. I still don’t, which underscores the mistake.”
He specifically apologized to Jewish staff members for using the term “venomous coalition” — an antisemitic trope — in his comments defending Carlson.
“And I very sincerely — very, very sincerely — apologize to you in particular, and to all of you for using that. It was not my intention to use a trope. I should have been better.”

There are parallels between the anti-evolution trial of 1925 and our current politics in Wyoming, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post Things evolve, but stay the same appeared first on WyoFile .","In 1925, the Tennessee Legislature passed the Butler Act, which made it unlawful for any teacher in the state’s public schools and universities “to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” Meant to stop teachers from introducing Charles Darwin’s work on evolution to their students, the bill mandated that “offending teachers be fined between $100 and $500 for each offense.” In 2025 dollars, that’s a fine of slightly less than $2,000 to $10,000. 

Opinion

Shortly after the bill became law, John Scopes, a high school teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, agreed to serve as the criminal defendant in a test case to be focused on the constitutional protections of freedom of speech. But things went sideways fast. Three-time presidential candidate and former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan volunteered his services for the prosecution saying, “Teachers in the public schools must teach what the taxpayers desire taught.” Clarence Darrow, who was the most famous criminal lawyer of the period, volunteered to direct the defense with his team saying, “The question is not whether evolution is true or untrue, but involves the freedom of teaching, or more important, the freedom of learning.”
Over 200 reporters came to town along with 3,000 spectators. Merchants decorated their shops with pictures of apes and monkeys. The local drugstore offered Simian Sodas and the town constable affixed a sign to his motorcycle reading “Monkeyville Police.” Everyone agreed it would be the trial of the century.
Among those present that summer was a young Black fiddler and mandolinist named Howard Armstrong. Born in Dayton in 1909, the 16-year-old musician was busking on the streets throughout the trial. Seventy-five years later, at 91 and a recipient of the National Heritage Award, Armstrong came to Wyoming, where he performed and taught workshops for adults and students. He told me that it was when all those people were in Dayton for the trial that he began to play music of many kinds — Irish, Italian, Polish, Mexican. Later, living in Chicago, he translated English lyrics to sing in Chinese. “You had to play for everybody if you wanted to make a living,” he said.
Another musician influenced by the trial was Uncle Dave Macon, a white banjo player. In 1926, he recorded “The Bible Song,” one verse of which declares, “Evolution teaches man came from a monkey. I don’t believe in no such a thing in a day of the week or Sunday. For the Bible’s true. Yes, I believe it. I’ve seen enough, and I can prove it. What you say, what you say, it’s bound to be that way.”
While the Scopes trial had a comic carnival-like atmosphere, it was deadly serious business — the first battle in our now hundred-year-long culture wars. It took place in a time of social upheaval and dislocation — the aftermath of World War I and the global flu epidemic, widespread anti-immigrant sentiment, the arrest and imprisonment of people for criticizing then-President Woodrow Wilson, the round up and deportation of suspected socialists, anarchists and communists.
It’s unnerving how much this sounds like our situation now — ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the aftereffects of the Covid-19 Pandemic, the U.S. president’s attacks on his critics, and ignoring due process, his order to murder suspected drug traffickers in international waters. Along with these, we’re experiencing a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by the rise in global migration that is itself fueled by war, climate change, ethnic and racial conflict, and by ordinary intractable poverty in the face of unimaginable wealth. Think of Elon Musk with over $500 billion.
Just as the 1925 Tennessee Legislature passed a law to control access to what was then a controversial book, so has the 2025 Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee voted 11-2 to introduce a bill mandating that public and school libraries keep “sexually explicit” material inaccessible to people under 18. Perhaps not surprisingly, the bill does not appear to be aimed at what people often call pornography. Rather, it’s to keep LGBTQ+ materials out of the reading view of young people seeking to understand themselves and the society they will both inherit and shape.
Tennessee’s 1925 Butler Act banning the teaching of evolution and Wyoming’s 2025 proposed bill to limit young people’s access to materials exploring human development and personal identity are misguided and, in the long run will not attain their goals, neither those that are stated nor those that remain unspoken. 1925 to 2025 — a hundred years. I hope we evolve beyond such legislation before another hundred pass.

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)After seven days of intense lobbying and political drama, the Nevada State Legislature adjourned the 36th Special Session on Wednesday without approving a $1.8 billion megadeal derided by progressive and conservative groups alike as a “Hollywood handout.”
The hotly debated proposal to expand the state’s film tax credit program to $120 million per year for 15 years needed the support of 11 state senators. It fell one senator shy, with 10 voting for the bill, eight voting against, and three absent but assumed nos.
The failure of the bill to pass is seen as a loss for Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who put the film bill on his packed special session proclamation and sent the state’s preeminent consultant Jeremy Aguero to consult with legislators behind closed doors on the potential fiscal impact.
The weeklong special session was marked by what lawmakers described as relentless lobbying and it laid bare divisions within the majority party caucus. And, in true blockbuster fashion, it ramped up in the third act.
‘I could not deliver for you today’
In the upper chamber Wednesday, support for the film bill came from eight Democrats and two Republicans.
State Sen. Dina Neal, a vocal critic of public subsidies for corporations who has voted against previous megadeals, cast a “yes” vote that surprised many. In a floor speech, the North Las Vegas Democrat said she would vote for the bill because of Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who Neal said saved her life when she had a medical episode earlier this year.
“Dear Hollywood, I want to be absolutely clear that, although this vote may benefit you, it is not for you,” said Neal. “It’s not even a consideration about you.”
Neal chastised the lobbying and pressure exerted on legislators.
“I am angry with the political tactics that cause pain to my colleagues. I’m angry that there was a sense in this building that somehow people owe 100% loyalty — not even 100% loyalty, 1000% loyalty. And that folks in this building were looking for political corpses to press a button.”
Lawmakers in opposition were “being disrespected at every turn,” she added.
Neal’s support ultimately did not matter to the end result, and she told reporters after the session adjourned that she was happy the bill died.
“I was very clear my vote was for Majority Leader (Cannizzaro),” she said, “and that I had to do it my way.”
State Sen. Angie Taylor, a Reno Democrat who throughout the seven-day special session was rumored to be on the fence about the film studio bill, ultimately voted against it. She told the Nevada Current that, while the state needs to diversify its economy, there was also the question of whether the state could afford the upfront investment.
“I could just never get to a point where I was comfortable enough with the financial piece,” she said.
Taylor said that passing legislation is always a process of “give and take” but that “it was on steroids” during this special session.
State Sen. Melanie Schieble, a Las Vegas Democrat many thought might support the bill, said she asked difficult questions about the fiscal responsibility of the proposal and attempted to find solutions to mitigate those.
“Ultimately, in my view, we’ve been unable to do that,” she said.
See the numbers: Nevada’s potential film studio fiscal cliff

A fiscal analysis by the Legislature’s own nonpartisan staff found the film bill would lead the State of Nevada’s general fund off a fiscal cliff in 2030. Public sector employees, including AFSCME members and public school teachers, warned the structural deficit created by the film bill would force the state to layoff employees or cut essential services.
Opponents characterized the measure as a corporate giveaway to the developer Howard Hughes Holdings, the mega studios Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Brothers Discovery who would earn up to $120 million in transferable tax credits for shooting in state, and other large companies who would purchase the transferable tax credits at a discount and apply them to their own gaming, insurance or modified business taxes to lower their tax bills.
But it seemed for every opponent in the capital worried about the lackluster return on investment, there was a member of a building and trades union saying the film bill would bring thousands of construction jobs that could put them to work.
A coalition of these unions in weeks leading up to the special session formed a Nevada Jobs Now PAC and launched a “public information campaign” that included mailers to voters and television ads.
Several state senators addressed those labor unions and their workers before voting in opposition of the bill.
“I’m very sorry I could not deliver for you today,” said state Sen. Shelly Cruz Crawford (D-North Las Vegas) during her brief statement on the floor.
State Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas), who voted via Zoom, said policy changes that he believed would have “protected the interest of the entire state” were rejected by “some of the stakeholders” and that as a result he had an obligation to the state to vote no.

During a recess held after the bill failed to pass, members from the construction unions coalition stood outside the Senate Majority Leader office. When Cannizzaro emerged, they applauded and thanked her for working on the bill.
The film studio bill is expected to impact next year’s elections and many of its key players are running in competitive races.
Lombardo is running for reelection. Cannizzaro is running for attorney general. Assembly Minority Leader Sandra Jauregui, who sponsored the film bill during the regular session and presented the bill during the special session, is running for lieutenant governor. Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, who announced he is not running for reelection, has not said whether he plans to run for another office.
The resistance
“There was a referendum on special interests in this building,” said Neal during her floor speech in the Senate, “and there needed to be a referendum on special interests in this building.”
Speaking to reporters later, Neal elaborated, saying she agreed with a group of Assembly members who called themselves “the resistance” and attempted to use procedural rules to kill the bill.
Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, a Democrat from Reno, in the opening hours of the special session forced a surprise vote on the bill, which almost worked but fell one vote shy.
The “resistance” group questioned why two of their colleagues — both yeses on the film bill — were permitted to vote remotely. They also went against their caucus leaders’ motions to declare the film studio bill an emergency bill, delaying a full floor vote in their chamber.
Those efforts, Neal said, “made sure there was a conversation” about special interests and the group “held that line.”
“I think there’s a new set of legislators who believe in people, believe in community, and they don’t want to be beholden to big interests that come in this building and try to tell them what to do,” added Neal.
La Rue Hatch, speaking before her chamber’s full vote on Sunday, acknowledged the “unprecedented actions” taken in the first few days of the session.
“I know this has frustrated people, but this is an unprecedented bill. This is the largest corporate handout in Nevada history.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image000000-3-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-20 06:56:20.398912

(Photo courtesy of Blue Cross of Idaho)A major Idaho health insurer this week asked the Idaho Department of Insurance to investigate the billing practices of a new North Idaho hospital.
Blue Cross of Idaho claims that Post Falls ER & Hospital has refused offers to be part of the insurer’s network of in-network providers, and has instead relied heavily on a last-resort financial protection that lets health care providers dispute insurer payments.
Blue Cross of Idaho Chief Strategy Officer Drew Hobby said the insurer wants to protect consumers from rising health care costs.
“We have a responsibility to help Idahoans get access to high quality, affordable care. And we’re very concerned and alarmed with this process, which we would say is driving up unreasonable costs and unreasonable rates to Idahoans,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
The Idaho Department of Insurance is reviewing the issue, agency spokesperson Julie Robinson said in a statement. 
The Post Falls ER & Hospital opened in 2024. The facility was Nutex Health Inc.’s first micro-hospital in Idaho. 
Post Falls ER & Hospital could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Outside of the Post Falls ER & Hospital, 100% of hospitals in Idaho are in Blue Cross’s network, Hobby said. Blue Cross also asked the Department of Insurance to help get the hospital’s owners to meet with Blue Cross.

 What is the billing practice Blue Cross wants Idaho to investigate? 

In its letter to the Idaho Department of Insurance, Blue Cross asked for a probe into whether the Post Falls ER & Hospital has misused a process called independent dispute resolution.
The process, created by the federal No Surprises Act, allows health care providers to challenge denials and payments by health insurers for services that are out of network, triggering arbitration to decide the final payment. 
Each week in recent months, Blue Cross received an average of 75 dispute requests from the hospital, the insurer said in its letter. That is much more than the insurer says it received from all other health care entities in Idaho. On average each month, Hobby said Blue Cross only received 14 dispute requests from other providers in Idaho.
“Compared to the rest of providers that we work with … the volume is alarming,” Hobby said. 
The payments sought in that process are often high, Blue Cross told the Department of Insurance. One example Hobby shared was a claim for nearly $2,900 to treat a runny nose, which was well over the $376 that is the median commercial rate for nasal congestion.

Cally Younger, administrator of the Idaho Governor’s Office and Energy and Mineral Resources, said Little’s office hopes to notify and announce the members of the new Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force in the coming weeks. 
The task force will likely include state elected officials, leadership from Idaho National Laboratory, university or education officials, private industry representatives, a Tribal representative, local officials and other partners, Younger said. 
The goal is to launch the task force in the coming weeks with an eye toward conducting the task force’s first meeting in February, Younger said. 
 What will Idaho’s nuclear energy task force focus on?

Some of the questions the task force may attempt to answer include what types of nuclear energy research and development does Idaho want, and which entities does Idaho want to fill those roles, Younger said.

The task force may also look at supply chain issues and weigh the pros and cons of data centers, which consume large amounts of energy and water, Younger said. 
In an interview Tuesday with the Idaho Capital Sun, Younger said the task force would look at government supported nuclear research, like the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, as well as private, commercial nuclear programs and the connections to higher education and workforce development. 
Younger said the state hopes to use the new task force to capitalize on some of the momentum building around nuclear energy. 
“There’s been a ton of excitement with nuclear in this last year,” Younger said. “People keep using the word renaissance, which some people love and some people hate. We just see a renewed interest in it.”
‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

This year, President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders supporting nuclear energy.
Additionally Idaho National Laboratory officials told state legislators the lab is in the process of permitting and building its first new nuclear reactors in 50 years, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho National Laboratory operates an 890-square mile research complex located outside of Idaho Falls and is considered the nation’s leading nuclear research lab. 
Although Idaho National Laboratory and the state are ramping up nuclear programs, one watchdog organization is sounding a warning. 
After Idaho state officials published a request for information this fall seeking information about nuclear development opportunities, a Boise-based nonprofit organization that describes itself as Idaho’s nuclear watchdog and the champion of clean energy, the Snake River Alliance, said nuclear energy poses risks to Idaho ratepayers, public health and clean water. 
“The nuclear fuel cycle — from uranium mining to radioactive waste storage — is a chain of pollution, exorbitant cost, health impacts, and irreversible damage to our most precious resource: water,” Snake River Alliance Executive Director Leigh Ford said in a written statement. “Nuclear power does not pencil out for Idaho ratepayers or water resources.” 
 How was the Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force created?

Little signed an executive order creating the Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force while attending the Western Governors’ Association’s energy conference Sept. 22 at Idaho National Laboratory. 
“Idaho has been a leader in nuclear energy because of the lab for decades,” Younger said. “We are in a unique position because of our relationships with the (U.S. Department of Energy).”
Little said the new task force replaces and modernizes the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE Commission, that his predecessor, former Gov. Butch Otter, created.  
Younger said she hopes the new task force is a bit smaller, more nimble and more responsive than its predecessor the LINE Commission.
“As we look at what’s going on across the country and where we are as a state, we just wanted to affirmatively say we are doing something new,” Younger said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)When U.S Customs and Immigration Officers arrested Felipe Mendez, he was given the choice of losing his two sons to government custody if he tried fighting the deportation or leave the United States willingly.
He lost his wife and 2-year-old son when tornadoes swept through his trailer park in Nashville in 2023, dropping a neighbor’s mobile home on top of the house he shared with his family of five. Mendez described to reporters at the time he remembered hearing the cries of his wife and children, knowing she and the toddler died when they went quiet. 
He came with his family to the United States just five months before the tornadoes from a rural village in Guatemala, fleeing a country where nearly half the population lives in poverty. 
Through a translator, Mendez spoke to the Lookout, describing the lack of job opportunities in Guatemala and a desire to stay in Tennessee if he could.
“I’m very sad to be leaving,” he said.
After the tornadoes, Mendez and his sons tried to move forward. He took a job at the fast-food chain Wendy’s. He was driving home from work in May when he was pulled over by a swarm of officers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
He was swept up in an immigration sting operation established on Nashville roadways heavily traveled by immigrants by state and federal law enforcement officers with the intention of finding and arresting undocumented residents. ICE announced it had made 196 arrests during the sting meant to apprehend people who “pose a threat to public safety.”
The reason for Mendez’s stop remains unknown, but he was charged with driving without a license, a misdemeanor in Tennessee. The Lookout reached out to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE but neither responded.

An analysis conducted using highway patrol records by the Nashville Banner found that of 607 vehicles stopped during the May operation, 1 out of every 7 included a reason for the stop, “most often citing a non-moving violation, such as window tints, light laws or improperly displayed tags.”
When ICE officers arrested Mendez, they didn’t send him to prison and start a forced deportation process but released him with an ankle monitor when he agreed to leave the United States within five months.
“They gave him no choice but to leave,” said Ashley Warbington, a friend and translator for Mendez. 
Tennessee and ties to ICE
President Donald Trump’s administration launched an immigration crackdown nationwide soon after he returned to office in January. One of the most high-profile operations is in Chicago, where local and state government officials have pushed back against what Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called “attacks on families” by federal agents. 
In Tennessee — a state dominated politically by a coalition of suburban and rural Republicans — the response to ICE and federal law enforcement intervention has been different. Before Trump took office, Gov. Bill Lee and state lawmakers created an immigration bureau inside the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security.
Lee has embraced the Trump administration’s federal crime task forces, which, among several controversial practices, include ramped-up immigration raids. He sent the state National Guard to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement and is trying to use it for the same purpose in Memphis.
The state safety department and the corrections department both signed agreements with ICE, known as 287(g)s, to work with the federal agency and allow it to train and potentially pay its Tennessee Highway Patrol officers and prison guards. Forty-four local law enforcement agencies also signed up in 2025.

The Trump administration has labeled its efforts as removing “the worst of the worst.”  But as the Trump administration has pressured ICE officials to ramp up their deportation efforts, as reported by Axios, caught in the net are people without permanent legal status who genuinely came to America for better opportunities.  
Kelly Chieng, who befriended Mendez after his arrest in May, said it’s been “heartbreaking” to watch people who came here to make a better life for their families leave because of the current political climate. 
“It’s about creating a culture of fear so they just leave,” Chieng said.  
Alexmary Mariño, her husband Orangel and her infant daughter came to Middle Tennessee from Venezuela looking for work. But Warbington, who met Mariño earlier this year, said  Orangel was arrested driving home from his construction job and ICE deported him back to Venezuela, leaving Mariño and her baby alone in Dickson. 
Mariño, like Mendez, started her own journey back to Venezuela in October at the Tornado Bus Company’s stop in Nashville.  
Mendez told Warbington that he made it back to Guatemala and he’s trying to make the best of the situation. His sons are enjoying hanging out with their cousins, Mendez said.
Mariño is still in the midst of her 25-day journey, which will include nearly a dozen stops in various cities as well as a boat ride. Warbington said Mariño is worried about what awaits her.
“She says there is nothing for her there,” Warbington said.

Photographed  on March 11, 2025. (Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Many acres of wetlands across the vast Mississippi River basin would lose federal protection under a new rule proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Agricultural and builders’ groups have called it a win for private property owners. Environmental groups warn that it will exacerbate costly challenges like flooding that already plague the river and its tributaries. 
The new rule, proposed Nov. 17, is the latest in a convoluted, decades-long fight over which streams and wetlands qualify as “Waters of the United States” and thus are regulated by the federal government under the Clean Water Act. Environmental advocates claim more expansive federal protections are needed to preserve the country’s natural resources, while some farmers and homebuilders argue the government is overstepping its authority to control how they use their land. 
A landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court case, Sackett v. EPA, used a narrow definition to determine which wetlands get federal protections. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin promised earlier this year that the agency would adjust its definitions to comply. The proposed rule delivers on that promise.
The proposal will be open for public comment for 45 days before it moves forward.
Wetland advocates are still parsing details of the proposal but say they’re concerned with the impacts it could have.
Legislation slashing development oversight of isolated wetlands heads to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk

“The EPA’s newly revised Waters of the United States definition, crafted to conform to the Sackett decision, resolves many ambiguities in a way that further reduces federal protections for wetlands,” Harpeth Conservancy CEO Grace Stranch wrote in a statement to the Tennessee Lookout. “Tennessee’s wetlands support extraordinary biodiversity and sit atop unique geology; these features require tailored, science-based solutions, not blanket rollbacks.”
In Tennessee, the majority of wetlands that could be most at risk under the proposed rule lie in the state’s western region, closest to the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
Kelly McGinnis, executive director of One Mississippi, a group that advocates for the river, said the proposed rule “does not help any of the issues the basin is facing.”
“Whether we’re talking water quality and pollution, trying to mitigate the impact of the more frequent floods and droughts we’re seeing — removing even more wetland protections … is devastating,” McGinnis said.
States along Mississippi River have varied wetlands protections
In Sackett v. EPA, a couple asked the Supreme Court to restrict federal regulations of wetlands so they could build a home on their northern Idaho property. The court ruled in their favor, saying only wetlands that have a continuous surface connection with another r protected water body — such as a permanent, navigable waterway — qualify for protections under the Clean Water Act. 
The Clean Water Act protects the “Waters of the United States” but it does not define them. That has fallen to the EPA, which has changed its definition repeatedly since the law’s passing in 1972. The murkiness and scope of the definitions has long frustrated stakeholders. 
In a news release, Zeldin said the new EPA rule follows the Sackett decision closely, granting protections only to wetlands that touch another protected water body and have visible water for at least part of the year.
Experts say a wetland is doing work even if it doesn’t usually have water in it or is isolated. The benefits of wetlands lie in their ability to relieve flooding, purify water, mitigate drought and provide wildlife habitat. Experts say in an era of increased storms, droughts and floods wrought by climate change, they’re needed now more than ever. 
Many groups have attempted to predict how many wetlands will lose protections following the Sackett decision, but the actual impact is yet to be understood. What is clear is that with more limited federal regulation, states will have different rules governing wetlands. 
Along the Mississippi River, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Tennessee and Mississippi have wetland protections that go beyond the Clean Water Act, a Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk analysis found. Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas do not have more protective wetland laws on the books. Louisiana extends state protections to its coastal wetlands, but not inland ones.
And state laws are still moving targets. Tennessee lawmakers, for example, voted this year to roll back protections that had been in place since the 1970s requiring developers and landowners to seek state permission and pay for mitigation before draining or altering isolated wetlands. In Illinois, where researchers have estimated about 72% of the state’s remaining wetlands could lose federal protections under Sackett, lawmakers have drafted legislation beefing up their state’s regulations, though they have not passed it, yet.
There are also unanswered questions about how the Sackett decision would affect areas along the Mississippi and other rivers where the river’s main channel is separated from the floodplain by built levees — a concern Justice Brett Kavanaugh mentioned directly in his concurring opinion on the case. 
Wetland-rich Louisiana, in particular, relies on manmade flood control structures to try and hold back floodwaters from low-lying communities. State legislation passed in 2025 made wetland areas behind levees ineligible for state protection. 
Should those areas lose federal protection, it opens them up to “a ton of risky development,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director at the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“The reason to not build in a wetland shouldn’t have been, ‘Oh, you have to get this pesky federal permit,’” Gentry said. “It’s that wetlands flood … this is not creating more affordable housing, if you’re building risky homes in flood zones.” 
Mississippi River basin wetlands are already in trouble
Groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members faced the potential of hefty fines if they altered federally regulated wetlands, have reacted positively to Zeldin’s proposed rule. 
The groups have complained that the previous definition, which was published in early 2023 and protected a broader swath of wetlands, left farmers confused about things like what constitutes a continuous surface connection between a wetland and a water body, said Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
“The fact that this administration has come in and given definitions to those terms already improves the situation significantly,” Briggs said. “It gives our farmers more confidence in using their own land.” 
Tennessee wetlands bill sees support from law firm that spearheaded national deregulation

Environmental groups, however, say that there will be consequences of the administration’s effort to make it easier for people to drain and fill wetlands for their own purposes. 
“They have, in this rule-making, completely ignored the costs of fewer wetlands and more polluted water to communities around the country,” said Mark Sabath, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Mississippi River basin is home to many different types of wetlands, from Minnesota’s peatlands to the swamps of the Gulf South. In some places, they carry economic benefits of their own — like in Arkansas, where they provide crucial habitat for waterfowl that hunters spend big money to shoot. 
According to data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 132,000 acres of wetland across the basin were lost between 2009 and 2019, the equivalent of about 100,000 football fields. 
The last time EPA was reworking its definition of the“Waters of the United States,” in 2022, the  Mississippi River Collaborative, a consortium of environmental groups focused on the river,  wrote that the link between continued destruction of wetlands and increased nutrient pollution, a persistent problem for the Mississippi River, “is very clear.” 
“One cannot protect waters like the Illinois, Mississippi, and Ohio Rivers and the Gulf of Mexico without protecting wetlands and small streams,” they wrote.

(Getty Images)Across Idaho, more than 160,000 people earn income — whether as a primary or supplemental source — through self-employment, contract work or small business ownership. They include truckers, delivery drivers, freelance creatives, child care providers and self-employed farmers and tradespeople who remain central to Idaho’s economy.
Together, they generate over $9 billion annually, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. This independent workforce reflects Idaho’s spirit of self-reliance and enterprise — yet labor policies haven’t kept pace with the way people earn a living today.
Much of Idaho’s workforce turns to self-employment because that’s how many local industries operate — from agriculture and construction to family-run services and trades.
For others, independent work offers the flexibility to manage their time, earn income on their own terms, and pursue family, education, or creative goals. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 80 percent of independent workers prefer their current arrangement, and fewer than 9 percent say they’d rather have a traditional employee job.
But self-employment comes with tradeoffs. The same independence that defines this kind of work can also leave people without basic protections. Under current laws, self-employed workers often go without benefits like health coverage or retirement savings — and even when companies or clients want to offer them voluntarily, they’re discouraged from doing so because of legal uncertainty.
Current labor rules risk treating those arrangements as formal “employment,” triggering costly liabilities. As a result, many businesses or clients avoid offering benefits altogether. Surveys show that 81 percent of self-employed workers want portable benefits solutions — ways to access benefits while keeping the independence they’ve chosen.
That’s where portable benefits come in. Portable benefits would travel with workers as they move between jobs, clients or projects — benefits that belong to the individual rather than a single employer. Picture a truck driver, a freelance designer or a self-employed farmer who receives contributions from each company or buyer they work with — funds that accumulate in a personal benefits account they can take with them from job to job.
This reform isn’t about changing what makes self-employment appealing. It’s about expanding access to financial security while preserving the independence and initiative that define Idaho’s self-employed workforce. Lawmakers can make that possible by establishing safe harbor provisions that allow companies or buyers to voluntarily offer benefits without fear of reclassification.
With its entrepreneurial economy built on small businesses, family farms and independent trades, Idaho is uniquely positioned to lead — and modernizing its labor laws would help workers thrive on their own terms.
While other states, such as California, have moved in the opposite direction with restrictive reclassification laws like Assembly Bill 5 — leading to measurable declines in self-employment and disrupting industries such as trucking and the creative arts — Idaho can instead embrace policies that expand flexibility and opportunity.
Supporting voluntary portable benefits would reinforce Idaho’s commitment to economic freedom, entrepreneurship and individual opportunity.
Across the country, momentum for portable benefits is gaining traction. States such as Utah and Tennessee have advanced proposals to modernize labor laws and enable voluntary benefit programs for self-employed workers. In other Western states, including Nevada and Montana, similar bills have been introduced in the past year. At the federal level, proposals in Congress would create similar safe harbors, allowing innovation at scale. After years of debate about how to support nontraditional workers, policymakers are finally beginning to act.
What’s notable is that these workers aren’t asking for government mandates or subsidies. They’re asking for the freedom to participate in modern systems of security without sacrificing the independence they’ve chosen. Portable benefits meet that need — offering stronger financial security without compromising the initiative and determination that define Idaho’s workforce.
By removing outdated barriers to voluntary portable benefits, Idaho can prove that independence and security not only coexist — they make each other stronger.

(Photo. by Lexi Browning/ West Virginia Watch)“There is not enough money to fix the education system” is often posed as the beginning of a question when in truth those ten words are the answer to what ails institutionalized learning at all levels. 
If there was some magical infinite money stream flowing unfettered into the school system, there would be plenty of splashy headlines about how it was spent, and shiny new buildings going up, and a slew of hires, and plenty of charts and graphs of pay and benefits going up, and so the list goes. That is what hypothetical unlimited money does; it makes the wish list and ethereal accomplishments just as unlimited. And promised money in the politically charged education discourse is always unlimited in potential. 
What money does in real life is reveal. It reveals leadership, or lack thereof. It reveals human nature. It reveals systemic issues. It reveals priorities, preconceived notions, prejudices and personalization of perspective. Never in the history of ever has money fixed a human nature problem. 
There are reasons Herbert Hoover High School students are enjoying year three of excellent new facilities in Elkview, rebuilt after the 2016 flooding, while Richwood students are in year one and Summersville hasn’t even started moving dirt from the same disaster. Those reasons are not funding, but the human management of funding, the personal and local politics of education funding, the greed and mismanagement that comes from funding without competence.
Going into an election cycle, education will get the buzzword treatment by those running for office. “More pay for teachers” no matter how well meaning a sentiment has crept up the list of top oratory cliches, ranking below “God Bless America” and somewhere between “Make our communities safer” and “Go (insert relevant local sports team cheap pop here).” “School choice” the buzzword plays much better than “school choice” the complicated policy issue of sorting haves from the have-nots when not properly supervised and held accountable. “Save our school” plays much better to cheers and clicks than in-depth discussions on demographic decline that predestines the doom of any differentiated instruction if any learning is to be had at all.
More teacher pay is a fine thing, deserved in the case of in-classroom teachers, but monetary compensation can only outweigh being a cog in a dysfunctional system for so long. The hockey-stick graph of administrative pay raises and costs compared to in-classroom teacher pay and expenditures is seared in the teachers mind while the admins show no signs of wanting less pay, less compensation, or a smaller slice of the education funding pie for the greater good. More positions and spending, to manage more positions, and spending to facilitate more increases in positions and spending, is quite the racket. In any other field of endeavor such a thing would be challenged, but the “education” nomenclature apparently makes the whole enterprise immune from reason. 
Not on the policy charts is the feelings in-classroom teachers experience dealing with the human factors of students who are all individuals, who all come from different home environments, who all have various parental situations, who all are walking examples of problem personalization. And there are dozens of them per teacher. What is the fair compensation for an in-classroom teacher getting the blame on all sides when they fail to shepherd their two dozen square peg charges through the one-size-fits-all system of rounded education?
There isn’t any fair compensation for that sort of soul-crushing Sisyphusian career path. And yet the wonderful, dedicated, persevering in-classroom teachers still carry on, though even they will have limits. The data is showing the hard edges of those limits in teacher shortages, retention issues, and quality of candidates, especially in difficult school situations. 
“There will never be perfect students/teachers/schools” is the response to such realities and criticisms, and correctly so. No more than the magical, mystical funding increases that will come from… somewhere… will improve current issues without meaningful reform and change. For some reason, perhaps just out of sheer repetition and fatigue, too many just let the “more pay for teachers” or “more funding for X project” be the acceptable answer to questions that are really about population decline, government funding, public service and stewardship, and the public’s willingness to demand excellence from our education system. 
The worst run school in the land still wouldn’t accept five as the answer to “what is 2+2” on a test. But that is what we are doing collectively with the education debate in general and the education funding discourse particularly. Cliche buzzwords, vote for me, lather, rinse, repeat. Meanwhile, every year another batch of newly minted adults emerges from the 13 year process we call education, not a product of “the system” but the system we provided them by omission and commission. It is what the engineers and tech folks call non-system thinking; problem solving one quick thing tactically that makes a strategic mess of everything else because there is never a linear solution that does not affect everything else. Symptoms over causes. Quick fixes. The “fix that fails” over and over again because the answer always comes out as some gussied up version of “five”. 
We are failing them because we are — as a people — what we tolerate, and there is no amount of funding to fix that.

(Photo by Esteban Fernandez for West Virginia Watch)Cheyenne Baker became homeless while attending South Charleston High School. She had been a straight-A student, but a difficult family life forced her to leave her home.
“I had nowhere to go. I was working at a hotel during the time, just trying to get by, and they let me stay at night in one of the rooms,” said Baker, who is now 21. “I just tried to figure out what I was going to do from there. I started missing classes because I didn’t have transportation.”
There are more than 13,000 students experiencing homelessness in West Virginia, according to data from the West Virginia Department of Education. A separate document from the department said the number of homeless students for the 2024-25 school year was 15,101.
While West Virginia’s student population has plummeted over the last decade, the number of students identified as homeless by school employees has climbed. But legislation introduced for several years at the state Capitol meant to help these children has failed to make it to the governor’s desk.
“We have a lot of kids that we can help,” said Sen. Vince Deeds, R-Greenbrier. “The number is surprising, but it, unfortunately, is accurate.”
Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, said, “In the Senate, we get up and somebody says a prayer every day. Well, who are the least among us? I can’t think of anybody who’s more worthy of our attention than homeless children that are floating around.”
Homeless students are counted under federal guidelines known as McKinney Vento, which defines a homeless student as a child lacking “fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence.” 
In West Virginia, some of the students are living in cars or shelters. Most are doubled up with families and friends — an unstable experience that impacts school performance and behavior. 
There are around 300 homeless students in Cabell County Schools, where Keith Thomas serves as the director of health, wellness and student support. Their homeless student population includes children living at Branches Domestic Violence Shelter in Huntington. 
“We expect kids to succeed, but it’s not fair to them when they don’t have a fixed place of living,” he said. “You just can’t focus. I’m not going to learn what four times three is if I don’t know where my next house is.”
Kristin Walter, state education department’s coordinator for the Office of Student Support and Wellness, said, school staff working closely with these students and their families often share that the children experience frequent moves and instability, a lack of basic necessities, and emotional trauma. There has been a “fear of stigma and disclosure of their living situations,” she said. 
“Rising numbers may be connected to increased training and awareness around the McKinney-Vento definition, which has led to more accurate identification and referrals for support,” Walter said. “Rising housing costs, financial instability and stronger collaboration among student support staff such as Communities In Schools and school counselors have also contributed, as these teams work together to ensure students are identified and supported appropriately.”
The thousands of identified homeless students were counted separately from the state’s nearly 6,000 foster children.
Baker said a teacher recognized she was homeless and offered to let her move into her home so she could finish school. 
“I’m convinced that she saved my life,” she said. “She pushed me to continue just showing up, and I’m pretty sure she’s the reason why I graduated high school, because I was convinced that I wasn’t going to make it during the time.”
Her school’s McKinney-Vento coordinator also offered extra support, she said. 
“I was in a constant state of, like, fight or flight mode. Even though I was staying with her, my clothes were still in a small suitcase, because I was ready for, ‘What if something were to happen?’” Baker said.
West Virginia’s federal funding for homeless students decreased
Counties split the state’s allocation of federal McKinney-Vento funds to purchase school supplies and pay for transportation and special support services for homeless students. It can also be used for other emergency assistance needs. 
West Virginia’s McKinney-Vento dollars decreased this year to $689,517 — down from $817,803 last fiscal year.
There’s no dedicated line-item funding for homeless students in West Virginia’s budget.
Thomas said that the state education department does a good job of distributing McKinney-Vento funds to districts. Churches and local community groups help his county purchase clothes for kids and make sure they have food.
“We could use more funds. Everybody could, because it’s a growing number,” he said. 
Rodd Monts is director of state policy for SchoolHouse Connection, a nonprofit focused on education-based youth homelessness policies.
“Given the changes in D.C., a lot of states are looking at ways that they can provide more funding for supportive students experiencing homelessness,” he said. “It’s a challenge … because so many states are dealing with budget deficits as well as competing priorities, including within education itself.”

Bill to help homeless students will return in 2026, but will it be funded?
At the state Capitol, recent Republican-led education reform has focused on school vouchers and improving lagging reading scores. There have been some efforts to connect kids experiencing trauma with behavioral specialists.
As far back as 2017, bills sponsored by Republicans and Democratic lawmakers have been introduced to put full-time homeless students coordinators in more schools and help these youth obtain identification documents. None of those measures have passed the Legislature.
“This is just a topic that nobody has been talking about,” Deeds said. 
With the next legislative session less than 60 days away, Deeds plans to push for a homeless students’ ID bill. He is still drafting the legislation but said it would create a process for schools to help homeless students obtain vital documents, including a birth certificate, state identification card or replacement license, at no cost.
Deeds, who works as director of Public Safety for Greenbrier County Schools, said making sure these children have ID is a safety issue. 
“There’s a lot of kids that are out here that may be couch surfing in our communities, and I’m not saying that each and every one is in danger,” Deeds said. “But I think it would be nice for our first responders, for whatever reason if they have contact with these individuals, to be able to say, ‘Hey, we realize that you’ve got an ID that says that you live in Charleston, West Virginia. But what are you doing in Morgantown at 15 years old?’”
The bill would need funding, which Deeds noted could be difficult to squeeze out of the state budget as lawmakers have focused on passing skinny budgets.
“I’ve had some conversations just trying to find a preexisting funding source that may not be utilized that much,” he said. “That’s my goal so I don’t have to worry about a fiscal note.”
Similar legislation has passed in Red states, Motts noted, including Alabama.
Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
Woelfel introduced a bill during the 2025 legislative session that would have placed a full-time, dedicated homeless education coordinator in the state’s more urban counties to recognize and help homeless students. The bill would have required that a part-time homeless education coordinator be required in the state’s rural counties.
The bill didn’t move as the Senate’s Republican leadership selected the bills that were vetted in committees.
Woelfel has introduced similar measures during past legislative sessions and plans to reintroduce it next year. He said the state’s opioid epidemic has impacted the state’s rate of homeless students. 
“I think it’s worthwhile, but this bill never moved a bit,” Woelfel said.
Monts would like to see the legislation pass in West Virginia, connecting student homelessness to lowered academic performance and graduation rates. 
“We do understand that in many school districts around the country, liaisons are wearing multiple hats and juggling responsibilities, and as a result, being stretched pretty thin,” he said. “Being able to increase the amount of bandwidth and capacity you have to serve those students is also important too, which is one of the reasons we’d really like to see this bill move forward.”
Walter said that districts can use McKinney-Vento funds to pay for a homeless liaison, whose work would include identifying students, helping them enroll in school, connecting them with services and removing barriers to learning.

“Additional funding is always helpful, but it is equally important to ensure staff are educated and trained to be resourceful, understand the best ways to address mental health and social stigmas, and recognize that homelessness can take many forms,” she said, adding that districts also need to have processes in place to identify students experiencing homelessness and connect them with community resources.
Baker is currently attending Fairmont State University studying information systems management and Spanish.
She’d like to see more staff in schools reaching out to homeless students, offering mental support and guidance. 
“I feel very lucky that I had someone there that could help me, you know, because not a lot of people have that support, and not a lot of people were strong enough to come forward about something like that,” she said.

The North Carolina Global TransPark in Kinston was created in the 1990s as an industrial park to bring economic prosperity to a region that had lost more than its fair share of agricultural and manufacturing jobs. But nearly two decades after its launch, the TransPark had not lived up to expectations and was deemed a boondoggle, even by some supporters.
These days, however, the Global TransPark, with a renewed focus on aeronautics and more than 1,800 employees working on site at companies like Spirit AeroSystems and flyExclusive, is bustling with activity. That’s leading many to hope that the TransPark will finally produce the economic outcomes regional leaders and residents were promised. 
The park’s growth has been substantial in recent years. Last year, state, federal and local officials broke ground for the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Readiness Center East, C-130 Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul complex that will create more than 400 new jobs and generate $400 million in new investment for the region. And Lenoir Community College is building a $25 million Aviation Center of Excellence at the TransPark to offer training in aviation systems and aircraft construction, as well as an aviation academy for high school students.
According to the state’s 2025 State of Aviation report, the TransPark generates $781 million in economic output, supports nearly 3,000 jobs and contributes $43.5 million in state and local taxes. The park was created as an independent government agency within the N.C. Department of Transportation.

“I’ve seen us go through some great times and I’ve seen the bad times,” said Mark Pope, president of the N.C. Global TransPark Economic Development Region, which includes Greene, Lenoir and Wayne Counties. “I see us really inching our way back up to being a different community than what we used to be.”
But the park’s rising fortunes aren’t lifting all its neighbors equally.
East Kinston, one of the most economically depressed communities in the state, is about five miles north of the TransPark. From there, Chris Suggs, a city councilman and founder of Kinston Teens, a youth-led nonprofit devoted to community improvement, is closely monitoring the TransPark’s newfound success.
Suggs worries that residents in some of the county’s poorest communities could be left behind if intentional efforts aren’t made to include them. 
“You have this confluence of economic activity in a community where a few miles away, there is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the state,” Suggs said. “I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing if our leaders could actually figure out how to connect the two. Right now, neighborhoods like East Kinston and a bunch of rural communities in Lenoir County are disconnected from Global TransPark.”

A main concern, Suggs said, is the lack of adequate public transportation. Without it, he said, residents from low-wealth communities find it difficult to reach the new jobs or the community colleges where training for them takes place.
“If we make those types of investments in our civic and social infrastructure, if we make greater investments in housing so that people are able to take advantage of these jobs … I think those are some of the positives that can come from the economic boost the Global TransPark is starting to bring to this region,” Suggs said. 
Suggs said his colleagues on the city council and members of the Lenoir County Board of Commissioners have “missed the moment” when it comes to investing in quality housing and public transportation. Suggs did not seek reelection. His term on the council ends next month.
Jeremy Stroud, executive director of the Global TransPark, said the average salary at the TransPark is in the $75,000 range, compared to $48,000 for Lenoir County, where Kinston is located. 
“Our main function to help the people in Lenoir County and Kinston and the region is to work with private industry to attract more industry to the Global TransPark,” Stroud said. “In doing so, you have more technical jobs available to local residents.”

Stroud and others who spoke to NC Newsline said the path to good-paying jobs at the TransPark is through the public schools and Lenoir Community College, where many TransPark’s employees are trained. 
The TransPark has a strong relationship with Lenoir Community College and others in the regions. It also sponsors summer camps for students and offers job shadowing career days to spark interest in the high tech jobs available at the TransPark, Stroud said. 
“We try to engage with the local school systems and local community colleges routinely,” Stroud said. “I would say to a student, if you find something you’re passionate in, communicate that with your advisors and with the school systems and with the Global TransPark. We would love to expose those students to those careers.”
Lenoir County Commissioner Preston Harris believes the TransPark can be a catalyst to help lift residents out of poverty. Harris said those efforts must begin as early as elementary school. 
Harris noted that high school students also take courses at Lenoir Community College through early college programs. Students can graduate with an associate’s degree and some have “automatic jobs” with companies in the park, Harris said.

“A few of those companies, they actually have something set up in the schools where they will co-op with students so that while they’re in school and during the summer, they can actually work with those companies,” Harris said.
To better prepare the region’s future workforce, Pope said more schools need STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) programs to engage children and to get them “excited about learning how to fix things.”
Pope noted the workplace is changing, and technology and robotics skills are becoming essential to employment.  
“That’s why our STEM programs have to be so important in our elementary, our junior high, our high schools,” Pope said. “How do we train and get our kids engaged with what’s being made in their own backyard?”
Pope, the park’s executive director, wants an aviation-focused “academy or charter school” for middle school students near the TransPark that would enroll students from across Eastern North Carolina. He said he’s been talking to a lot of people about how to make that a reality. 
“I think that’s another missing piece of the puzzle,” Pope said. “If we had that, it would be a game changer for a lot of these young kids.”
As NC Newsline previously reported, Suggs returned home not long after graduating from UNC Chapel Hill in 2021. He wants more of his peers and the youth coming up now to see Kinston and Lenoir County as an option after graduating high school or college.
“It wasn’t necessarily the easiest thing for me to do,” Suggs said, referring to his decision to return to Kinston. “There are so few of us who went away to college and then came back.”
He said many of those who stayed after high school have struggled to find good jobs and stable housing.
“I want my peers, my generation, the generation coming behind us to feel like Kinston is a place that they can stay in and remain in and make a decent living and have a good quality of life,” Suggs said. “I don’t want us to be constantly losing our best and brightest to Raleigh, the Triangle or to Charlotte or anywhere else in the country.”

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The study was conducted by Falcon Correctional and Community Services Inc. experts partnering with the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC). The department said it is planning to contract with the consulting firm to create a framework to implement recommendations. 
“While the report affirms that DOC is moving in the right direction, it also shows that there is more work to be done,” Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy said in the department’s press release. 
In a statement, the advocacy group Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) said the report “confirms what directly impacted people and advocates have said for years: Wisconsin’s prisons are dangerously overcrowded, under-resourced and in desperate need of healing-centered reform.”
Many of the suggested changes will affect the entire correctional system, the agency said. Consultants and staff will work to “reimagine existing space, create new processes and training at five pilot sites.” 
In a letter dated July 9, 2024, Hoy told a state Assembly committee that the department planned on bringing on Falcon for an outside review. News of criminal charges against staff at Waupun Correctional Institution over prisoner deaths had broken just weeks before Hoy wrote the letter. The same day, the committee heard testimony about the toll of solitary confinement and other issues in the prison system. 
The department and Falcon signed a contract in November 2024, and the Examiner reported in January on details of the partnership obtained through public records requests. Criminal justice reform advocates expressed hope the report would be beneficial but have called for independent oversight of the Department of Corrections. Last week, the department published the 137-page final report, which lists strengths for the department to build on as well as recommendations for improvement.  
The report states that while all recommendations are made based on Falcon’s overall review of the adult prison system, “we understand that the majority of recommendations will require funding, often requiring budget approval.”
Susan Franzen of the prison reform advocacy group Ladies of SCI expressed concern about whether overcrowding and staffing shortages will affect DOC’s ability to effectively carry out recommendations. 
“Legislators need to help the DOC out by giving them a fighting chance to make these changes,” Franzen wrote in an email to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
The report states that the study involved working with DOC officials, gathering data, reviewing policies, statutes and prior studies and conducting virtual workshops with DOC experts and others, including formerly incarcerated people and advocates. 
It also included visits to 15 facilities, such as the Waupun and Green Bay prisons, and interviews with staff and incarcerated people.
Suicide watch
Preventing suicide is a pressing concern, the report states in a section that summarized information from mental health-related discussions with staff during mental health workshops and site visits.
One concern is that observation cells are typically in restrictive housing units; in addition, “individuals on observation status are not allowed therapeutic items, visits, phone calls, or recreation,” the report states.  
People who pose threats to themselves, or who pose threats to others because of mental illness, may be put on observation.
The report recommends housing people in observation in “more appropriate environments that support therapeutic care and patient safety.” 
Over the last 15 years, 59 people died by suicide in Wisconsin prisons, an average of four deaths per year. Suicide watch placements reportedly rose from 1,200 to 1,500 per year to about 2,500 in 2024. In June, the Examiner reported on Victor Garcia, who died due to an attempt to hang himself while he was on observation in a Wisconsin prison.
Psychological services staff decide what items a person can have access to while they’re on clinical observation. Department policy provides a list to use as a starting point, including items like soap, toilet paper and suicide-resistant clothing. 
The report described the list as “very limiting,” and the security mat or mattress was observed to be inadequate for most people on suicide precautions. Later on in the report, it suggests replacing small sleeping mats with suicide-resistant mattresses.
Solitary confinement
The Falcon report includes priorities and steps to take on “restrictive housing” in state prisons, where incarcerated people experience “very limited” out-of-cell programming and recreation time, such as:

Giving people in restrictive housing at least two hours of recreation and/or programming each day, not including out-of-cell time for necessary activities, such as showers 
Reviewing the status, programming and needs of people in restrictive housing every week instead of every 30 days 
Improving cleanliness and removing all graffiti 
Establishing units that are alternatives to restricted housing for people with serious mental illnesses

Incarcerated people in Wisconsin prisons can be put in restrictive housing as a punishment for a violation or when having the person live with the general population would create a serious threat. 
An average stay in disciplinary separation — a punishment for committing a violation — decreased from 39.7 days in January 2019 to 27.4 days in April 2025, the report notes. However, this varies by facility, and the latest average published online for Green Bay Correctional Institution is 48.7 days. 
The department has begun to address the number of people in restrictive housing and how long they spend there, the report states. However, the number of people placed in restrictive housing has not changed significantly over the last five years.
“High rates of substance use and mental illness among individuals placed in restrictive housing was noted, often contributing to a ‘revolving door’ for this population,” the report stated in the section about mental health insights from staff. 
Solitary confinement has potential effects of physical harm, health issues and negative effects on mental health, the report notes.
Solitary confinement is also associated with increased risk of violence towards oneself and suicide, and research shows that solitary confinement as a tool does not reduce institutional misconduct or violence or the risk of recidivism, the report states. 
There were 950 people in restrictive housing as of September, 863 of whom were placed there due to a rule violation, according to online Department of Corrections data. 
Under a policy that went into effect last May, a placement of over 120 days has to be approved by the assistant administrator for the division of adult institutions, the report noted. 
An overcrowded system
All medium and maximum-security facilities in Wisconsin except for Waupun Correctional Institution are over capacity, as of January, the report states. Facilities for men were at 130% of capacity, while women’s prisons were at 166% of capacity. People are living at security levels that don’t fit their classification — for example, a person sentenced to medium-security being held in maximum security, or a person sentenced to minimum-security being held in medium security. 
The state building commission took an initial step toward updating the aging and overcrowded prison system last month, when it agreed to create plans for a revamp. 
Inconsistency in the department 
Leaders and staff at the facility level of the agency felt a lack of autonomy in their day-to-day jobs, the report found. They believe there is “significant and often excessive and unnecessary scrutiny from outside entities.” 
But the study also found a problem with “a general lack of uniformity across facilities,” which is creating challenges relating to monitoring, oversight and accountability. It recommends “system-wide alignment” on areas including basic security practices, incident reporting and investigation processes.
The report recommends that the agency take an approach that involves both oversight and collaboration. The goal would be to carry out the strategy of DOC leadership with both efforts from leadership and “input and innovation” from frontline staff, stakeholders and incarcerated people. 
A central part of a section called “Back-to-Basics in Correctional Practices” recommends a three to five-day training for all staff about basic corrections practices, such as searches, use of force and out-of-cell time for people in restrictive housing. 
The department “has experienced a great deal of staffing changes, with a significant number of the current staff hired during or after the COVID19 pandemic,” the report found.
Strained mental health care
Mental health services were described as strained, according to the section of the report about mental health-related discussions with staff.
That section of the report suggests that an “unsustainable” number of people have been assigned to receive mental health care at least once every six months, and that this interferes with treatment for people who need more intensive care. 
Nearly half of all incarcerated people in adult prisons had been classified as needing mental health care as of May 20. It’s a much higher rate than other state correctional departments see, the report states. 
Department data shows the agency isn’t fully staffed in psychological services, with a vacancy rate of 19.7%. 
About nine in ten incarcerated women were on the mental health caseload. The report also noted that the population of maximum security facilities has a higher percentage of incarcerated people with mental health needs than medium or minimum security facilities.
Other recommendations in the report address medical practices, investigations and intelligence practices, data management and human resources and staffing.

Luis Duarte, of St. Jerome Catholic Church in Kenner, says he is cancelling events at the church in advance of the reported Border Patrol surge in the New Orleans area. (Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)The Rev. Luis Duarte, pastor at St. Jerome Catholic Church in Kenner, woke up Wednesday morning and took a few phone calls in his office. Then he decided to cancel all group activities at the church, other than mass, this week and the coming weeks.
He made the decision, he said, because he’s worried that rather than a place of sanctuary, his church in Kenner could soon become a target for federal immigration authorities.
As hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents descend on the New Orleans area by the beginning of December, Duarte said he’s concerned that the many daily activities at the church would make parishioners vulnerable to immigration enforcement operations. In this heavily Hispanic city, 80% of St. Jerome’s congregants are Hispanic, and many of them are immigrants, he said.
“I want to be with them, but I think sometimes you have to make those decisions to keep the community safe,” he said, adding that the weekend’s mass would be held in honor of all immigrants. “Remember that our Lord Jesus Christ went through that moment. So he knows what it feels to be persecuted just because of your race.”

This is the first time he’s ever had to make a call like this, he said, but after seeing the results of an immigration enforcement surge over the past few days in Charlotte, North Carolina, and after receiving several phone calls from members of the community worried about the presence of Border Patrol, he said he was forced to make a tough decision.
He said he’s also offering help to congregants who are scared of going out while the agents are deployed here. Duarte, along with some local groups that advocate for immigrants, are advising residents who could get caught in immigration enforcement operations to remain at home.
“I’m going to be attentive. If they need food or whatever, I will go to any house if they need something, because they are afraid of leaving to even buy groceries.”
On Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that some 250 Border Patrol agents will participate in what federal authorities are calling “Operation Swamp Sweep.” According to planning documents reviewed by the AP, agents will conduct immigration sweeps in communities and commercial areas in New Orleans, Jefferson, St. Tammany and St. Bernard Parishes and expand their efforts north through Baton Rouge.
This will be the third such operation in a major U.S. city in recent weeks, following operation “Midway Blitz” in Chicago and operation “Charlotte’s Web” in Charlotte.

In Chicago, federal agents focused on heavily Hispanic suburban neighborhoods near the city’s northwest side, sparking allegations of racial profiling — including of U.S. citizens of color caught up in the sweeps — and excessive use of force.
Kenner, a suburb to New Orleans’ northwest, has the highest share of Hispanic residents — largely Honduran — of anywhere in the metro area. The city of about 66,000 is 30% Hispanic and is well-known for its concentration of Hispanic-owned businesses, particularly along Williams Boulevard.
Kenner has already seen immigration enforcement operations stepped up this year, including early this month, when the city’s police department partnered with ICE, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Louisiana State Police for a nighttime raid at the boat launch in Laketown, which resulted in 15 immigration arrests.
In a video posted on the Kenner Police Department’s Facebook page, Kenner Police Department Chief Keith Conley said the operation was in response to years of nuisance complaints from city residents. Kenner PD was also one of the first local departments in Louisiana this year to ink a formal partnership pledging to work with federal immigration authorities.
In a phone interview with Verite News, Conley said the agency had not been briefed by their partners at ICE or anyone at U.S. Customs and Border Protection on the upcoming operation, adding that Kenner PD will work with federal immigration authorities if asked.
“From what I understand, they’re going to be operating independently. Certainly if they need our assistance for anything, we stand ready to assist and aid in their mission,” he said.
Conley said reports that fears over immigration enforcement are causing Hispanic residents to stay indoors might be overblown by social media.
“I don’t see any interruption in customers in restaurants and stores or anything like that,” Conley said. “If [residents] have any concerns or fears they’re more than welcome to call this office or to speak to any of our officers about it.”
But one business operator with locations in New Orleans and Kenner told Verite News that he is already seeing a drop in sales, even before the operation has officially begun.
“It’s a bad time,” said José Castillo, a manager at Norma’s Sweets Bakery, which is owned by his mother. “Business is down in Kenner, in New Orleans, in all our areas. … People are afraid to go out.”
Conley said Kenner PD has long been a good partner to federal immigration enforcement agencies. In March, the department signed an official agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the 287(g) program, which deputizes officers to carry out some ICE duties. President Donald Trump has urged departments across the country to enter into such partnerships, as has Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Trump ally and immigration hardliner.
The agreement allows KPD officers to draft their own “detainer” requests, authorizing local jailers to hold immigrants beyond when they might otherwise be released so that they can potentially be transferred into ICE custody.
In an investigation published in August, Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom found that Kenner PD traffic stops were creating a pipeline for immigrants from the city’s jail to federal immigration detention and even deportation. Between January and May ICE issued six times as many immigration detainer requests through Kenner PD than during the same time period in 2024.
As New Orleans area residents await the operation, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been fairly tight-lipped about what to expect.
“Every day DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. “We do not discuss future or potential operations.”
A spokesperson for Kenner Mayor Glaser did not respond to a request for comment on the operation. And Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng’s office said she has not been briefed on the operation.
“The Parish President has not been in contact with any other local, state or federal officials about this,” Rachel Strassel said Wednesday. “Since this is a law enforcement issue, we recommend you speak with Sheriff Joseph Lopinto and law enforcement officials in other municipalities across the parish.”
Lopinto’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
At St. Jerome’s Catholic Church people came in and out of the office doors, exchanging greetings and small talk. Gregorian chants flow on low volume from the computer from Father Duarte’s office.
With group activities cancelled, Duarte said he feels apprehensive about Sunday’s mass, because, he said, despite the fear in the community, his parishioners tell them they have faith in God.
“They know that trust in God is everything right now. He’s the only defender they have right now,” he said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado faces increasing pressure to redraw its congressional districts as other states undertake their own mid-cycle redistricting efforts.
President Donald Trump prompted those efforts with his demand to Republican-run states to ensure a MAGA majority in the U.S. House, a move that exemplifies his contempt for democracy and the will of voters. As red states obey by engaging in partisan gerrymandering, other states are left with no choice but to fight back, since fair play in a rigged game yields the biggest loser.
The debate over mid-cycle redistricting in Colorado, which is allotted eight seats in Congress, was long dominated by a seeming consensus that it couldn’t be done, since the state constitution assigns redistricting responsibility to an independent commission that’s supposed to redraw maps after the once-a-decade census.
But the conversation has shifted.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In August, a pair of Coloradans launched an effort to put on the 2026 ballot a state constitutional amendment that would allow for emergency redistricting in Colorado to restore partisan balance in Congress.
Last month, Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general who is running for governor in 2026, became the first statewide official to support a state constitutional amendment that would allow for emergency redistricting. Since then, the idea has earned the endorsement of other elected officials, such as Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow of Aurora.
Jena Griswold, the Democratic Colorado secretary of state who is running for attorney general, told Newsline this week that she supports the idea of a ballot initiative to allow for emergency redistricting.
“I do not believe that we can allow MAGA to corruptly steal Congress through corrupt redistricting. And I do think that we should pursue, on a very limited basis, redistricting to protect the right to vote and to hold our democracy together,” Griswold said.
After voters in blue California this month adopted a ballot measure to redistrict the state as a Democratic counterbalance to newly gerrymandered Texas and other red states, Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Colorado by name to follow California’s lead.
Growing favor for emergency redistricting in Colorado invites a close look at the options.
Unlike California, where new maps will be in place for next year’s general election, Colorado could not pursue an emergency redistricting ballot measure until November 2026, and any new maps the effort generates wouldn’t take effect until the 2028 election cycle. By that time Trumpist authoritarianism could have rendered elections themselves irrelevant.
Is there any way Colorado could redistrict in time for next year’s election?
Yes, potentially, in principle.
There is reason to think that the state Legislature, with its Democratic majority, could assert its power to redistrict on its own, without need for voter approval or a state constitutional amendment. That’s because its power comes straight from the U.S. Constitution, which assigns authority over congressional elections, including redistricting, to “the Legislature” of each state. 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that an independent redistricting commission in Arizona was constitutional, but that was a different time for the court. As Doug Spencer, a law professor at the University of Colorado, noted in an interview with Newsline this week, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissent in the Arizona case that flatly said the independent commission was unconstitutional, and today he leads a conservative majority at the court that could be open to overturning the earlier ruling.
An influential analysis from the UCLA Voting Rights Project on the California redistricting plan also highlighted the primacy of the U.S. Constitution. It distinguished between the California independent redistricting commission’s “responsibility” to redistrict and the legislature’s “power” to redistrict, which arguably remains no matter what responsibilities are delegated to other bodies.
It’s also notable that the Colorado constitution does not explicitly bar mid-cycle redistricting or redistricting by an authority other than the independent commission.
This is all theory. Now for reality.
Spencer said that while there might be a theoretical path for the Colorado Legislature to redistrict the state, too many obstacles likely stand in the way. Primary elections are in June, candidate filing deadlines are in March, and there’s almost certainly too little time for the Legislature to redistrict and sustain the plan through the inevitable court proceedings it would entail. 
“As the deadlines stand now, there’s just no way that all of those things in the courts would take place before those deadlines,” Spencer said.
Even if there were more time, Democratic members of the Legislature would have to weigh the political wisdom of reasserting their redistricting authority. So far there appears to be little appetite for it.
That’s why, even as MAGA redistricting enthusiasts suffer recent setbacks, some Colorado Democrats are coalescing around support for a long-term redistricting plan that depends on the people’s approval.
Griswold said she supported the independent redistricting commission, and a redistricting ballot measure should only be a break-glass-in-an-emergency provision. She thinks it would be worth having in place even if it takes several years.
“I do think there is value in voting on that in ’26 so that it can be used in ’28 if necessary,” she said.

(Getty Images)My sister died of cancer back about five years ago, and for her, it was a battle she bravely waged on two fronts. 
Her struggles were to first, just stay alive, and next to be able to afford having cancer in the United States of America. She knew her cancer was not curable, and she needed to stay alive long enough that hopefully something would come along that would save her, but would she be able to hold out and pay for it?
She endured years of treatments that wracked her body and her finances, and at the time, thankfully, there were provisions in the Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies to treat pre-existing conditions. 
At one of her treatments, she asked what would happen if the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as many chose to call it, was repealed, because at that time there was a tremendous push in the U.S. Congress by the Republicans to do just that. 
She was told that she would have to pay the approximately $40,000 per month that her treatments cost. Yes, that figure was $40,000 for each monthly treatment!
My sister knew she probably would not beat her cancer, and one thing she was determined to do was leave something to her children when the time came. She did everything in her power to not have to sell her property to get by, and, thankfully, she ended up getting on Social Security Disability. This at least helped relieve her mind that she would not have to sell everything she owned just to survive.
But now, our Republican Congress and president have finally achieved their goal and have decreased the subsidies that helped keep insurance premiums affordable for families that pay for their own insurance policies. 
Another of my sisters, also impacted by cancer, now pays nearly $2,000 a month for her family policy, along with enormous out of pocket expenses. Very few people in Kentucky can afford that, but most of the people we have elected to represent us in Washington seem to think they can.
Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel

Republicans have offered little that would effectively replace Affordable Care and give people like my sisters more than one-time payments or other short-term fixes. 
Our Kentucky Republican congressional delegation (minus Reps. Massie and Sen. Paul, who both cited the impact on the federal deficit as their reason) supported the bill that reduced health insurance subsidies, and they are all running for their current or higher offices. Thankfully the alarm that has been raised has some in Congress at least talking about what could be done.
Hospitals in Kentucky will be closing because Republicans are slashing Medicaid payments, and the political genius behind this is that the cuts will come after the upcoming midterm elections next year. 
Kentucky hospitals rely heavily on government payments for Medicaid recipients to stay open. There is no question that rural hospitals will close. And, if payments for private insurance policies get high enough, those people will be forced to drop their insurance and just go to hospitals and say, “Ok, treat me. I can’t pay, but I will sue you if you don’t.”
Then those hospitals will be faced with closing as well. Folks, this is the plan that our current leaders have for us.
You can say all you want about Democrats, but they try to keep health care something that the average person can afford. Think about it.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-107713154-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

On a press call hosted by Protect Our Care, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, underscored those stakes by recalling the day her daughter was born nine weeks early — a medical emergency she said she only survived financially because she had insurance.
“Ten years ago, my daughter Samantha was born by emergency C-section when my placenta ruptured, and we both nearly died,” McClellan said. Samantha spent six weeks in the NICU, and because she had employer-provided insurance, McClellan said she could focus on recovery “without having to worry about how I was gonna pay those costs.”
That experience, she added, is why she pushed to expand Medicaid and establish Virginia’s state-based exchange as a state legislator — to ensure that “every pregnant woman had the ability to have insurance, so that she could have a healthy pregnancy, a full-term birth, and a healthy child.”
She warned that maternal and infant health outcomes are already worsening. 
“The United States has one of the highest pre-term birth rates in the world,” she said, citing the March of Dimes 2025 scorecard, which again gave the country a D-plus and reported that 10.4% of babies were born preterm. 
Virginia’s rate rose from 9.8% to 10.1%, and “three cities in Virginia earned an F — Virginia Beach, Norfolk, and Richmond,” McClellan said. 
She emphasized that these statistics “are likely going to get worse” as millions face losing coverage from major Medicaid cuts and the expiration of ACA subsidies. If the credits lapse, McClellan said, “106,000 Virginians will drop out of the marketplace, and 47,000 are estimated to remain uninsured, because they won’t be able to get insurance for other needs.”
Families will be forced into impossible decisions, she added. Many pregnant women “will choose to forego prenatal care… because they’ll be forced to choose between health insurance, paying rent, and paying their utility bills.” 
No parent plans for a premature birth, McClellan added: “I certainly didn’t. But it can happen to anybody. We need to make sure that those families are insured. Preterm birth is preventable, but we have to make sure that moms are healthy before they get pregnant and can get the care that they need.”
 As costs rise, so do risks

The ACA’s enhanced premium tax credits have made coverage more affordable for millions since 2021. In Virginia, roughly 400,000 people use the marketplace, and as many as 100,000 could fall off their plans if the credits expire.
Health-care leaders have called the potential fallout “a bit of a tsunami,” warning that premiums could rise 30% to 50% next year.
Advocates on Wednesday’s call said the effects go far beyond monthly bills. 
Deneen Evans, a licensed clinical social worker from Roanoke County who earned a PhD, said her daughter was born prematurely with a severe brain hemorrhage requiring a shunt and months of NICU care. 
“These are lifelong challenges,” she said. Without stable insurance, “these children grow into adults with chronic medical issues.”
Kristen Clardy, a former Virginian now residing in Washington, D.C., said her son’s premature birth generated about $130,000 in medical bills — all covered by insurance. 
Later, marketplace coverage was “actually pretty affordable,” she said, until premiums began to spike. Now she faces an $800 to $900 monthly increase. “My heart breaks for moms who are having to make that choice between healthcare coverage and putting food on the table or gas and keeping their lights on,” Clardy said.
At the federal level, the question is whether to renew the enhanced ACA subsidies. President Donald Trump has urged Republicans not to extend them, arguing in a Nov. 18 Truth Social post that they “only benefit insurance companies,” Axios reported Tuesday. 
Instead, Trump and some GOP lawmakers have floated alternatives, including directing assistance to health-savings accounts or allowing cheaper, less comprehensive plans. Those concepts are currently being drafted into proposals. 
Democrats in Congress — including McClellan — and some Republicans argue the credits must be renewed before year’s end. The debate has become intertwined with broader budget negotiations that resulted in the longest federal government shutdown in the nation’s history. 
 The ripple effect in Virginia

If Congress allows the subsidies to lapse, premiums could jump sharply for families on the exchange. 
Kenda Denia, founder of Birth in Color, said the consequences would fall hardest on Black mothers. She noted Black women are more than twice as likely to die from childbirth as white women, and Black babies are 57% more likely to be born preterm. 
“Approximately 52,000 people lost health insurance between 2023 and 2024, including around 11,500 children,” she said. Without coverage, “fewer expecting moms are getting the prenatal care that they need.”
Maternal mental health advocates also warned of cascading effects. 
Amy Hammond, executive director of Postpartum Support Virginia, said pregnant people with mental health conditions are 50% more likely to give birth prematurely, and mothers of NICU babies have up to a 70% risk of postpartum depression. 
She said higher premiums “are a barrier to accessing adequate care before, during, and after pregnancy, which ultimately cost taxpayers more.”
 Families at the breaking point

For families living paycheck to paycheck, the fight in Washington translates directly into skipped appointments and strained budgets. Clardy said parents like her feel trapped between necessity and affordability. “Those are the real decisions that people are faced with right now,” she said.
Meanwhile, Virginia’s marketplace is already bracing for instability. Some insurers, including Aetna, plan to exit next year, citing uncertainty tied to the subsidies. Nationally, as many as 17 million Americans could lose coverage under Trump-aligned proposals that allow the subsidies to expire,
With the enhanced subsidies set to end Dec. 31, lawmakers say time is running short. 
“Millions more are about to see their health insurance premiums spike beyond their ability to afford when the enhanced premium tax credits under the ACA expire at the end of this year,” McClellan said. ”As a result, the cost of insurance will go up for everybody else.”

Local communities around the country are seeking more input on where and how data centers are built. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)Over the past decade, Virginia has become home to more than 650 data centers — the largest concentration on Earth — including roughly 150 hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Loudoun County alone hosts nearly 200 operating sites, with more than 100 additional facilities in development. 
Regulators and lawmakers are now confronting soaring peak demand and rising grid costs for Virginia ratepayers.  Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.
Data center growth has come at a cost. They already consume more than one-quarter of Virginia’s electricity, a share projected to approach half of statewide demand by 2030. Dominion Energy has told regulators that serving this new hyperscale load will require billions of dollars in new generation and transmission infrastructure — costs increasingly passed on to ordinary Virginians through rate hikes.
As it is, Virginia imports roughly 39% of its electricity — more than any other state — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, buying much of that power at a premium. Options to meet that demand require five to ten or more years of development, whether new natural gas, small modular nuclear, or utility-scale solar. In contrast, small-scale rooftop and ground-mounted solar can be built and interconnected in less than a year.
Since 2010, Virginia’s sales- and use-tax exemption  has provided data-center operators with more than $2 billion in cumulative subsidies, justified as job creation. Yet most jobs were temporary construction work.
We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) reported last year that the sector supports about 74,000 jobs statewide, mostly indirect or short-term, while a typical operating facility employs only around 50 full-time workers. In FY 2023 alone, this exemption cost taxpayers $928 million.
 A modest, market-based solution

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger said it best in her acceptance speech: “Data centers need to pay their fair share.” Virginia can take her message to heart by inviting the industry to make a small, voluntary, high-impact contribution toward the commonwealth’s clean-energy goals and local development.
Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia. Each SREC represents one megawatt-hour of solar generation; purchasing them helps finance projects and provides verifiable carbon offsets to the buyer.
The program would support any and all solar systems under 3 MW on public schools, hospitals, community colleges and municipal buildings — projects that lower energy bills and strengthen local economies.
With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Using JLARC’s FY 2023 figure of $928 million in annual tax savings, a 5% annual contribution would yield about $46 million per year for the purchase of Virginia-generated SRECs — enough to help finance over 500 MW of distributed solar capacity annually to benefit schools and communities.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Jobs and Economic Impact (JEDI) model, this voluntary program would each year:

Leverage $1.1 billion in private-sector investment in distributed solar
Generate more than $700 million in local economic activity
Create over 2,800 good-paying Virginia jobs.

All of this would be achieved without adding a single cent to ratepayer bills, while reducing taxpayer subsidies and helping stabilize Virginia’s solar industry by offsetting the abrupt and disruptive phase-down of federal investment tax credits.
 From additionality to multiplicity

For years, the technology industry has subscribed to what might be called the Gospel of Additionality — the idea that eco-virtue is earned by sourcing the largest and cheapest quantities of clean energy. This approach has sent corporate energy dollars to Texas wind farms and Arizona solar plants while companies continued to draw fossil-based power here in Virginia.
Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.
By purchasing Virginia DG SRECs data-center operators could:

Lower energy costs for public schools, hospitals, and local governments at no capital cost to them
Help offset summer coincident peak demand in the Mid-Atlantic PJM grid area more quickly and affordably than any other generation option
Reduce taxpayer burden by cutting energy costs for public institutions
Avoid ratepayer-funded SREC subsidies through a voluntary, market-based mechanism
Create durable local jobs and workforce training tied to installation, operations and maintenance

A good-neighbor contribution would show that an industry running on public infrastructure can also reinvest in the communities that power it. Data-center operators could help schools, hospitals and small towns across the commonwealth generate clean, affordable solar energy — a sure and equitable way for them to pay their fair share. 
And importantly, this modest proposal is designed to complement, not replace, a longer-term, holistic strategy for meeting Virginia’s energy needs by offering a simple, fast, and low-cost way to buy the commonwealth the time it urgently needs.

RICHMOND, Va. — Advocates for women’s rights, including a state senator, are pushing back against what they deem as “misogynistic” changes to the fitness standards of the U.S. military.
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in late September that every job in all branches of the military would be held to the “highest male standard” of physical fitness.
These changes are part of a shift in the culture of the restyled U.S. Department of Defense, which the Trump administration prefers to call the U.S. Department of War. Congress has not acted to officially change the name yet.
Hegseth said that updating fitness standards was necessary to prepare the military to face gathering enemies and growing threats, according to the published transcript.
Hegseth expressed his respect for the contributions of female troops and said the new fitness standards are not intended to exclude women from certain roles. But, if that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, “so be it,” he said.
The Army adopted a revised fitness test, the Army Fitness Test (AFT), in June, which is set to come into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, according to the U.S. Army website. The Air Force instituted a similar new fitness program which will also start on that date, according to the Air Force website.
Kobby Hoffman, president of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for Women, said she is old enough to remember when women were unable to have credit cards.
Opportunities and rights for women expanded in her lifetime, but the leap forward in gender equality has faced pushback, according to Hoffman.
“History shows that yes, when individuals get more rights, more opportunities, that there usually is a backlash,” Hoffman said. “And this is one big backlash. We always have to be vigilant because laws slip and slide every time a legislature meets.”
If women cannot be on the front line, they may not move up as easily through the military ranks, Hoffman said.
“My family that’s in the military, it’s more than just their upper body strength,” Hoffman said. “It’s about strategic thinking, leadership, diplomacy and avoiding war, respecting other human beings.”
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, served in her high school’s Junior ROTC and was among the first women to graduate from the Virginia Military Institute.
Hegseth’s speech was intentionally misogynistic and part of a wider culture war the Trump administration is waging against women, Foy said. She predicts this will be costly for America’s national security and reputation.
“I think it’s ironic that we have the least qualified person ever for defense secretary has the gall to question the qualifications of women who have actually met and oftentimes who have exceeded the standards for their job,” Foy said.
Foy noted that women still often have to be twice as good to get half as far.
“I think that that speech was very disrespectful to every person who wears and has worn a uniform,” Foy said.
Foy is using her influence as a politician to combat gender inequality. She is pushing for the U.S. National Archives to recognize Virginia as the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would add a rule to the U.S. Constitution making discrimination based on gender illegal.
“I also think we just have to continue to use our platform to promote the fact that when you have female soldiers who have attained Ranger status, they’ve done that by meeting the same standards as men,” Foy said.
Foy urged women not to give up hope and to fight for equality, even if it feels disheartening to see constitutional rights eroded and civil liberties undermined.
“But at the end of the day, as long as there is forward momentum, then we are winning,” Foy said. “We are making a change and the world is ever evolving and that isn’t going to stop with this administration, as long as we continue to keep our eye on the ball. And the goal is full equality.”
Army ROTC officials declined to comment, despite attempts made in person and via email.

As states strive to curb health insurers’ use of artificial intelligence, patients and doctors are arming themselves with AI tools to fight claims denials, prior authorizations and soaring medical bills.
Several businesses and nonprofits have launched AI-powered tools to help patients get their insurance claims paid and navigate byzantine medical bills, creating a robotic tug-of-war over who gets care and who foots the bill for it.
Sheer Health, a three-year-old company that helps patients and providers navigate health insurance and billing, now has an app that allows consumers to connect their health insurance account, upload medical bills and claims, and ask questions about deductibles, copays and covered benefits.
“You would think there would be some sort of technology that could explain in real English why I’m getting a bill for $1,500,” said cofounder Jeff Witten. The program uses both AI and humans to provide the answers for free, he said. Patients who want extra support in challenging a denied claim or dealing with out-of-network reimbursements can pay Sheer Health to handle those for them.
As AI enters exam rooms, states step up oversight

In North Carolina, the nonprofit Counterforce Health designed an AI assistant to help patients appeal their denied health insurance claims and fight large medical bills. The free service uses AI models to analyze a patient’s denial letter, then look through the patient’s policy and outside medical research to draft a customized appeal letter.
Other consumer-focused services use AI to catch billing errors or parse medical jargon. Some patients are even turning to AI chatbots like Grok for help.
A quarter of adults under age 30 said they used an AI chatbot at least once a month for health information or advice, according to a poll the health care research nonprofit KFF published in August 2024. But most adults said they were not confident that the health information is accurate.
State legislators on both sides of the aisle, meanwhile, are scrambling to keep pace, passing new regulations that govern how insurers, physicians and others use AI in health care. Already this year, more than a dozen states have passed laws regulating AI in health care, according to Manatt, a consulting firm.
“It doesn’t feel like a satisfying outcome to just have two robots argue back and forth over whether a patient should access a particular type of care,” said Carmel Shachar, assistant clinical professor of law and the faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School.
“We don’t want to get on an AI-enabled treadmill that just speeds up.”
 A black box

Health care can feel like a black box. If your doctor says you need surgery, for example, the cost depends on a dizzying number of factors, including your health insurance provider, your specific health plan, its copayment requirements, your deductible, where you live, the facility where the surgery will be performed, whether that facility and your doctor are in-network and your specific diagnosis.
Some insurers may require prior authorization before a surgery is approved. That can entail extensive medical documentation. After a surgery, the resulting bill can be difficult to parse.
Witten, of Sheer Health, said his company has seen thousands of instances of patients whose doctors recommend a certain procedure, like surgery, and then a few days before the surgery the patient learns insurance didn’t approve it.

– Sheer Health co-founder Jeff Witten 


In recent years, as more health insurance companies have turned to AI to automate claims processing and prior authorizations, the share of denied claims has risen. This year, 41% of physicians and other providers said their claims are denied more than 10% of the time, up from 30% of providers who said that three years ago, according to a September report from credit reporting company Experian.
Insurers on Affordable Care Act marketplaces denied nearly 1 in 5 in-network claims in 2023, up from 17% in 2021, and more than a third of out-of-network claims, according to the most recently available data from KFF.
Insurance giant UnitedHealth Group has come under fire in the media and from federal lawmakers for using algorithms to systematically deny care to seniors, while Humana and other insurers face lawsuits and regulatory investigations that allege they’ve used sophisticated algorithms to block or deny coverage for medical procedures.
Insurers say AI tools can improve efficiency and reduce costs by automating tasks that can involve analyzing vast amounts of data. And companies say they’re monitoring their AI to identify potential problems. A UnitedHealth representative pointed Stateline to the company’s AI Review Board, a team of clinicians, scientists and other experts that reviews its AI models for accuracy and fairness.
“Health plans are committed to responsibly using artificial intelligence to create a more seamless, real-time customer experience and to make claims management faster and more effective for patients and providers,” a spokesperson for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade group representing health insurers, told Stateline.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But states are stepping up oversight.
Arizona, Maryland, Nebraska and Texas, for example, have banned insurance companies from using AI as the sole decisionmaker in prior authorization or medical necessity denials.
Dr. Arvind Venkat is an emergency room physician in the Pittsburgh area. He’s also a Democratic Pennsylvania state representative and the lead sponsor of a bipartisan bill to regulate the use of AI in health care.
He’s seen new technologies reshape health care during his 25 years in medicine, but AI feels wholly different, he said. It’s an “active player” in people’s care in a way that other technologies haven’t been.
“If we’re able to harness this technology to improve the delivery and efficiency of clinical care, that is a huge win,” said Venkat. But he’s worried about AI use without guardrails.
His legislation would force insurers and health care providers in Pennsylvania to be more transparent about how they use AI; require a human to make the final decision any time AI is used; and mandate that they show evidence of minimizing bias in their use of AI.
“In health care, where it’s so personal and the stakes are so high, we need to make sure we’re mandating in every patient’s case that we’re applying artificial intelligence in a way that looks at the individual patient,” Venkat said.
 Patient supervision

Historically, consumers rarely challenge denied claims: A KFF analysis found fewer than 1% of health coverage denials are appealed. And even when they are, patients lose more than half of those appeals.
New consumer-focused AI tools could shift that dynamic by making appeals easier to file and the process easier to understand. But there are limits; without human oversight, experts say, the AI is vulnerable to mistakes.
“It can be difficult for a layperson to understand when AI is doing good work and when it is hallucinating or giving something that isn’t quite accurate,” said Shachar, of Harvard Law School.
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

For example, an AI tool might draft an appeals letter that a patient thinks looks impressive. But because most patients aren’t medical experts, they may not recognize if the AI misstates medical information, derailing an appeal, she said.
“The challenge is, if the patient is the one driving the process, are they going to be able to properly supervise the AI?” she said.
Earlier this year, Mathew Evins learned just 48 hours before his scheduled back surgery that his insurer wouldn’t cover it. Evins, a 68-year-old public relations executive who lives in Florida, worked with his physician to appeal, but got nowhere. He used an AI chatbot to draft a letter to his insurer, but that failed, too.
On his son’s recommendation, Evins turned to Sheer Health. He said Sheer identified a coding error in his medical records and handled communications with his insurer. The surgery was approved about three weeks later.
“It’s unfortunate that the public health system is so broken that it needs a third party to intervene on the patient’s behalf,” Evins told Stateline. But he’s grateful the technology made it possible to get life-changing surgery.
“AI in and of itself isn’t an answer,” he said. “AI, when used by a professional that understands the issues and ramifications of a particular problem, that’s a different story. Then you’ve got an effective tool.”
Most experts and lawmakers agree a human is needed to keep the robots in check.
AI has made it possible for insurance companies to rapidly assess cases and make decisions about whether to authorize surgeries or cover certain medical care. But that ability to make lightning-fast determinations should be tempered with a human, Venkat said.
“It’s why we need government regulation and why we need to make sure we mandate an individualized assessment with a human decisionmaker.”
Witten said there are situations in which AI works well, such as when it sifts through an insurance policy — which is essentially a contract between the company and the consumer — and connects the dots between the policy’s coverage and a corresponding insurance claim.
But, he said, “there are complicated cases out there AI just can’t resolve.” That’s when a human is needed to review.
“I think there’s a huge opportunity for AI to improve the patient experience and overall provider experience,” Witten said. “Where I worry is when you have insurance companies or other players using AI to completely replace customer support and human interaction.”
Furthermore, a growing body of research has found AI can reinforce bias that’s found elsewhere in medicine, discriminating against women, ethnic and racial minorities, and those with public insurance.
“The conclusions from artificial intelligence can reinforce discriminatory patterns and violate privacy in ways that we have already legislated against,” Venkat said.

(Photo courtesy of Revolution Wind)It is no surprise that after months of scapegoating renewables for high power prices, Rhode Island Energy has withdrawn from negotiations with the SouthCoast Wind project. This move prolongs our over-dependence on natural gas, which is the true driving force behind the rising energy costs in Rhode Island and all of New England.
The details of the contract negotiations are unclear and the challenges created by changing federal policies were inevitably a consideration. However, it is clear that given the opportunity, Rhode Island Energy will ignore our state’s climate goals, delay moving to a clean energy future, and keep us hooked on gas.
Rhode Island Energy breaks off contract with SouthCoast Wind amid federal uncertainty

The lack of transparency and accountability surrounding this abortive solicitation follow unfortunate but familiar patterns. While states like Maine and Massachusetts have active targets for offshore wind procurement, our state does not — despite having an ambitious target for economy-wide decarbonization under the 2030 Act on Climate. Therefore Rhode Island Energy suffers no consequences for abandoning contract negotiations. And even when we do have state targets, too often our state government simply allows the utility to ignore them — as it did during the Raimondo administration.
But while our state fails to hold Rhode Island Energy to account, offshore wind projects are being completed and coming online today that should start saving us money next winter. And while the effect is not as pronounced, we still get benefits even when our utility doesn’t have a contract with these projects.
More than half of the turbines at the Vineyard Wind offshore wind plant are already delivering power to the New England grid from the cable landing in Barnstable, Massachusetts. This plant has an average contract price of 8.4 cents per kilowatt-hour over the life of the project, nearly half of the supply price (14.8 cents per kilowatt-hour) that Rhode Island Energy’s residential customers have started to pay in the most recent billing cycle.
In Rhode Island, we won’t see the direct benefit of Vineyard Wind this year, because our power supply is bought in contracts six to 24 months in advance. But we are likely to see savings in the near future, and even more when the Revolution Wind project is complete. Revolution Wind developer Ørsted expects to start delivering power to the New England grid from its delivery point in Quonset in the second half of next year. 










While our state fails to hold Rhode Island Energy to account, offshore wind projects are being completed and coming online today that should start saving us money next winter. 


Revolution Wind’s contract price is 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour – which is also cheaper than any 6-month spring and summer supply price that we residential customers have been paying for the last three years, and much cheaper than fall and winter supply prices.
But even simple comparisons between contract prices likely underestimate the cost savings that these offshore wind plants offer. Because offshore wind projects have no fuel, they bid into the regional electricity market to deliver power at next to zero, which means that they depress the price paid to other power plants.
Also, the output pattern of offshore wind matches our needs. Most of the power on New England’s wholesale market is sold in one-hour intervals — and these prices ultimately get passed on to us through supply contracts. Power prices are much higher in the morning, the evening, and particularly during cold spells.
Peak use times are when offshore wind delivers by preventing the most expensive power plants from coming online. According to a 2021 study by consultancy DVN-GL, offshore wind tends to generate more in the later afternoon and early evening, when power demand and power prices are rising. Additionally, it has the highest output during the coldest hours of the year.
So while we will see limited benefits this year, we can expect the steel that we are putting in the water now to drive down our power bills next winter, and in winters to come. But if we want to meet our state’s climate targets, do our part to prevent the worst of climate change, and get off the roller coaster of high power prices caused by over-dependence on gas, we will need stronger leadership at the state level. Ultimately, we need leadership to hold Rhode Island Energy to account and stand solidly behind the commitments our state has made.

(New Hampshire Bulletin file photo)Municipalities that have invested in expensive projects to address “forever chemicals” in drinking water will see some relief from settlements with certain companies deemed liable, though the payments are not expected to cover the full cost of handling toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.
The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services laid out a plan to distribute an initial $45 million in settlement dollars across PFAS-affected public water supplies Nov. 17 during a meeting of the New Hampshire Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund Advisory Commission.
“No, everybody’s not being made whole. But again, you’re getting, I don’t know what the best figure is — 20 cents, 25 cents on the dollar that you may not have gotten before, so be happy,” NHDES Commissioner Robert Scott said at the meeting.
The settlements
The $45 million discussed Nov. 17 is an initial portion of settlements with the chemical companies 3M and DuPont resulting from a nationwide class-action lawsuit. NHDES expects that these settlements and two others involving the companies Tyco Fire Products LP, Chemguard, Inc., and BASF Corporation will continue to bring remediation funding into the state. Exactly how much remains unclear, PFAS Response Administrator Amy Rousseau said at the meeting.
The companies involved manufactured PFAS, which are also known as “forever chemicals” for the thousands of years they can potentially endure in the environment without breaking down, and firefighting foams that contain either PFAS or dangerous related chemicals. Through the litigation, New Hampshire and other states are seeking damages for the harms caused by PFAS and the firefighting foam, according to a September press release from the New Hampshire Department of Justice.
The settlements will be paid out in several phases, but New Hampshire expects to receive about $56 million during the first phase, according to the release. About $45 million of that total is estimated to be available for distribution after litigation costs and attorney’s fees are paid, according to NHDES; however, NHDES and the New Hampshire Department of Justice are not set to be paid from the funds, according to information provided by NHDES Nov. 17. 
The state expects to have about $26 million in hand by the end of the year, Rousseau said at the meeting; the rest of the approximately $45 million will follow in coming years. The exact amounts of future disbursements aren’t yet clear, according to NHDES, and payments will likely come in installments. Additionally, down the line, New Hampshire could see another $6 million to $10 million from settlements still in litigation, according to the September press release. 
Private homeowners across the state have also made significant investments in water treatment systems. But these settlements deal exclusively with public water supplies and can be applied only to public systems, said Rousseau.
New Hampshire waterways, residents affected
PFAS released into the environment contaminate soils and groundwater. The chemicals have been linked to health impacts including some cancers, decreased fertility, hormonal imbalance, immune system depression, obesity, and developmental delays, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Contamination is present at sites around New Hampshire, and concern about potential effects is, too. A type of kidney cancer previously linked to PFAS exposure is about 38% more common in Merrimack than in the rest of New Hampshire, a preliminary Dartmouth study concluded in October. That study did not assess causality, but researchers noted that PFAS are much more concentrated in the Merrimack area than in many other areas across the state. NHDES has said much of that contamination came from the former Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant, and legislators and advocates from the area contend that area residents suffer health consequences from the plant’s pollution. 
While research into the true extent of PFAS-related health concerns is ongoing, for two major types of PFAS chemicals called PFOA and PFOS, there is no level of exposure that does not entail at least some risk to human health, according to the EPA.
Making contaminated water safe again is costly
Water supplies where PFAS are detected must be treated to comply with EPA and state guidelines. Removing PFAS contamination from groundwater is intensive and costly. Public water system administrators around the state who have discovered PFAS in their supply have invested significantly in technology to make their water safe to drink.
In Merrimack, where water from public wells was found to contain PFAS above allowable levels, the Merrimack Village District has invested heavily in filtration systems that use activated carbon to remove the chemicals. The installation of treatment facilities for four wells has cost the district about $14.5 million, according to the district’s website; this included allocations from the district’s budget as well as state revolving funds, loans, and grants, business manager and water quality specialist Jill Lavoie said in an email. 
Distributing the funds
NHDES will consider factors including the type of water system, severity of PFAS contamination, water usage, and source capacity to determine how much of the settlement funding to award each recipient, according to a document provided at the Nov. 17 meeting.
The department broke remediation projects across the state into several categories for the purposes of designating settlement funds. 
The first group includes projects that have previously been awarded NHDES funding or are currently underway with funding from NHDES. Systems that have completed grant-funded projects will not be paid out, because they have already been funded, Rousseau said. Projects that received NHDES loans, however, will see their PFAS settlement dollars applied to the outstanding balance of their loan.
In total, this first category encompasses 47 water systems and about $18 million in projected settlement dollars, according to Rousseau. 
The second category includes public water supplies that NHDES considers likely to need remediation action in the future, based on water quality sampling data. This includes 42 community water systems that currently exceed EPA limits for PFAS, which NHDES estimates will receive about $14.7 million for remediation projects. The category also includes 38 community water systems with PFAS levels approaching EPA limits and 112 water systems that are not expected to exceed the limits; these groups together are estimated to receive about $11.2 million. 
The disbursements are not expected to cover the total amount that municipalities have expended on PFAS remediation, Scott said.
Unallocated funds can be applied to broader PFAS initiatives statewide, according to NHDES. The department has also expended more than a million dollars to collect data and prepare the claims, Scott said; when future disbursements are released, he said, the agency can be reimbursed for that expenditure.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0124-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

Marjorie Taylor Greene recently apologized during a CNN interview for her role in the country's ""toxic politics.""   Greene is pictured here at a press conference this week in Washington. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The lines that separate truth from falsehood, reality from fantasy, have become so smeared in recent years that democracy itself becomes difficult. Edgar Allen Poe, and later the Temptations, gave us the motto for our times:
“Believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear.”
But which half to believe? We’re now witnessing the introduction of high-quality, AI-driven deep-fake videos into Georgia politics, which makes it even harder to tell. 
For example, the other day I saw a clip that depicted U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene saying the following:
“I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics. It’s very bad for our country. It’s something I’ve thought about a lot, especially since Charlie Kirk was assassinated.  I’m committed, and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics. I really just want to see people be kind to one another. As Americans, we have far more in common than we have differences, and we have to be able to respect each other in our disagreements.”
Was that real, or was it an AI deep fake? I’m told that it’s real, but I’m also told to believe none of what I hear, so ….
One way to approach that question is to first ask what we mean by “real.” If by real you mean did it actually happen, yes, it’s real. Greene actually said those words. She’s saying similar things quite a bit these days, to such an extent that she and Donald Trump are publicly exchanging charges that the other person has become a traitor.
But is it real in terms of a sudden change of heart, a transformation by Greene from vicious culture warrior to a champion of peace, love and understanding?
No. It is not. 
What we’re seeing is Greene’s reaction to being told the obvious by Trump and other top Republicans, that she has no future in politics beyond representing Georgia’s 14th Congressional District. She didn’t like to hear that, and what she now frames as enlightenment is better understood as just a different manifestation of the resentment and frustration that has fueled her entire political career.
It’s important to remember that as far back as 2023, Greene was publicly musing about her future as U.S. senator, governor or even higher. “I have a lot of things to think about,” she told a reporter back then. “Am I going to be a part of President Trump’s Cabinet if he wins? Is it possible that I’ll be VP?”
Girl, no.
Don’t get me wrong, Greene does have some gifts as a politician, chief among them her instinct for the swings and sways of popular opinion within MAGA. That’s at play here too. It’s no accident that she has dared to divorce herself from Trump at a moment when he has become vulnerable. The economy is shaky, his immigration policy is unpopular, the poll numbers are bad and his bizarre mishandling of the Epstein case has made even close allies nervous. Greene seems to sense that if a door has been slammed in her face, fate may be opening a window.
And of course, we have an actual case of deep-fake video in Georgia, created through artificial intelligence, in the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Jon Ossoff and a handful of Republican challengers. U.S. Rep. Mike Collins, the frontrunner in the race for the GOP nomination, has released a video in which a deep-fake Ossoff can be heard – and seen –telling voters that he just doesn’t care about the impact of the recent government shutdown on farmers, that his only concern is his out-of-state donors..
It looks real. It sounds real. And given the regrettable gullibility of American voters, at least some of them are likely to take it as real. The Ossoff campaign condemned the video, pledging never to produce deep fakes of its own, while Collins dismisses any such concerns. 
“It’s just new technology, a new way to campaign, and you’re going to see a lot more of that out there,” he said.
Politics has never been a particularly truthful endeavor, but even then, fake quotes and fake photos have always been considered unacceptable distortions. Like a lot of people these days, the Collins campaign appears to believe that technology voids all those rules. They are living an approach that Trump has driven home, and that MAGA has fully embraced: If the rules and the norms get in the way of victory, screw the rules and the norms, and never ever apologize for doing so. If it works, if there’s no voter backlash to Collins’ actions, then yes, we will see a lot more of it.
Down that road lies chaos, though, and I’m hopeful that the American patience for chaos is running pretty thin these days.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247292479-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)Arundel resident Emily Ingwersen is looking at an increase of $1,400 per month to continue her family’s health insurance coverage next year if the tax credit they receive isn’t extended by Congress. 
“It’s pretty scary no matter how you slice it,” she said of weighing the risks of a plan with less coverage or taking on the higher expense.
Ingwersen, a mother of two, and her husband receive health insurance through the state’s marketplace. Together they run Ginger Hill Design + Build, a construction company that specializes in energy efficient homes, which they’ve been able to take risks to grow because of more affordable insurance coverage, Ingwersen said. 
The expiration of the subsidies that Ingwersen, along with just over 54,000 Mainers and millions of people across the country, currently receive was the key issue behind the federal government shutdown. After 43 days, the longest shutdown in U.S. history, the government reopened, but the deal to do so did not address the tax credits. 
Democrats had held out support of a GOP stopgap measure because it didn’t address skyrocketing premiums for individual health care plans, while Republicans insisted those talks had to occur when the government was open. But seven centrist Senate Democrats and one independent, Angus King of Maine, ultimately broke with party leaders to advance a reworked spending package to end the shutdown that didn’t address health care. 
Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has pledged to hold a vote on the subsidy the first week of December, though House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has not made such a promise. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee began more broad discussions about how to address rising health care costs on Wednesday. 
Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel

Back in Maine, Ingwersen and many others are seeing just how high their insurance costs could become. Currently, she pays $1,200 per month after the roughly $500 credit. Based on an estimate provided by her insurance portal, she will be paying $2,600 per month next year to maintain the same level of coverage. That change amounts to about a 117% increase. 
“It’s more than our mortgage,” Ingwersen said of the new anticipated cost. 
Health insurance marketplaces first began in 2014 after President Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act in an effort to make coverage more affordable. Congress provided tax credits for people making low and moderate incomes and in 2021 increased the subsidy and expanded eligibility. It’s the enhanced tax credits that will go away if Congress does not act. 
That would have a direct, immediate impact on people like Ingwersen. But eventually, policy experts say, it will impact everyone in the interconnected health insurance market. 
Weighing risks 
Andrew Volk, owner of the Portland bar Hunt & Alpine, didn’t have insurance for most of his 20s while he was working in restaurants because of high costs. 
“There just wasn’t the possibility to buy anything beyond catastrophic insurance, really anything reasonable,” Volk said of trying to afford insurance before the ACA. Eligibility for catastrophic plans are also generally limited to people who are under 30 years old. “I never was able to figure out how to buy anything until the marketplace came along.”
With that change, Volk at 29 years old was able to afford insurance, eliminating at least one of the many risks with opening a small business, he said. 
“I don’t think I would have opened the business without it,” Volk said of the marketplace. 
Shortly after the bar opened, Volk’s now-ex wife gave birth to their daughter, a process that ended up being complicated. If they hadn’t had insurance through the marketplace, Volk said, “I don’t think the business would have made it past its first year.”
Volk, now 41, said the risk he took in his 20s not having insurance worked out, but he doesn’t recommend it. Neither does Shawna Ackley, a cancer survivor who in September traveled to Washington, D.C., with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network to urge Congress to extend the subsidies. 
As she continues to write to her members of Congress urging an extension, she thinks about her own experience navigating the health care industry after discovering a lump in her breast as a 38-year-old new mom, and how different it would have been without insurance. 
Like Volk, Ackley fell into the category of people — young, otherwise healthy — who may opt to forgo health insurance given the steep premium hikes.

“If there’s these high health care costs, people are going to have to make tough decisions,” Ackley said, “and then, heaven forbid, something happens.” 
She also worries that without health care, people will miss chances for early detention or delay treatment because of costs. 
Ackley gets insurance through her husband’s job, not the marketplace, but she also cautioned that if anyone loses their health care she could eventually be impacted too. 
System impacts 
Enrollment in the marketplace has more than doubled since the introduction of the enhanced premium tax credits, with the majority of those people receiving the subsidy. If they’re not extended, “The bottom line is, and something that nobody is refuting: people are going to lose coverage,” said Anna Howard, a policy development principal specializing in health insurance plans at American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. 
Looking at it systemically, it’s also not a good idea to have a lot of people uninsured, Howard said. 
One issue has to do with a fundamental part of the U.S. health care system: risk pools. Premiums are determined based on average expected health care expenses of the entire group in the marketplace, so pooling risks together allows the higher costs of the less healthy to be offset by the lower costs of the healthy. 
“If the enhanced tax credits are allowed to go away, then you’re going to lose young, healthy people from the marketplace coverage,” Howard said. “But the people who are going to stay behind are more likely going to be the older, sicker people who are like, ‘I don’t really have a choice. I know that I need health insurance coverage because I have XYZ conditions.’”
In turn, Howard said, that would lead to increased premiums for those left in the marketplace. 
Another issue that could arise if more people are uninsured is increased reliance on emergency rooms as de facto health care settings, which would not only crowd emergency services but also increase costs for hospitals, Howard said. 
In Maine, hospitals are already strained with high debt, aging infrastructure and post-pandemic recovery challenges, with some on the brink of closure due to Medicaid cuts made through the GOP spending bill over the summer. 
Mainers are also thinking about implications for the economy. Volk no longer relies on the marketplace for insurance as he now has enough employees to get a private insurance small group plan. He said he hopes Congress extends the subsidies in part because they are a means to take care of people, but “this also helps the fundamental business underpinnings of our economy.” 
“It helped me create jobs,” he said, “and taking it away is going to worsen conditions for small business owners and job creators to do what they do best.”
The solutions Mainers want
Ackley said she wants lawmakers to fund the subsidies long-term. She worries a short-term extension, even for a year, would cause harm to current and future cancer patients because of possible disruptions to affordable health care, she said. 
“The last thing that you want to think about is how you’re going to afford insurance or having to navigate insurance [changes] when you’re in the middle of treatment,” Ackley said. 
Other Mainers who Maine Morning Star spoke with are thinking beyond the subsidies. 
Stonington resident Julie Moringello, a cancer survivor, mother and self-employed artist, gets insurance through the marketplace, but her income is low enough that the removal of the enhanced tax credits won’t impact her. 
Amid government funding battle, Mainers call on Congress to provide health care stability

Moringello pays $319 per month for coverage for herself and her daughter but that’s not a complete picture of her health care expenses. 
Moringello sees doctors several times each year for regular bloodwork and scans to make sure she hasn’t had a recurrence. Given that, Moringello said she always meets her $8,500 deductible, so she actually pays more than $12,000 per year.  
“But it really hasn’t even started paying for my care,” she said. “I mean it protects me from a disaster, if I had a recurrence or something like that, but basically that’s coming entirely out of my pocket.” 
She wants the U.S. to adopt a universal health care system. So does Ingwersen, whose husband is from Canada, which has such a system funded through taxes. 
“I think our government should just provide health care like every other developed country,” Ingwersen said.  
Ingwersen and Moringello both want Congress to address the problem at its root. 
As grateful as Moringello is for the changes that resulted from the ACA, she said it is not perfect, and that the subsidies are a Band-Aid on a broken system. 
“But at the same time, we need them,” she said, “We’re in this terrible position.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4886-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 04:57:18.187032

The cost-saving move also feels like state-sponsored greedflation, writes Huascar Medina. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)After Nov. 12, the penny will no longer be minted as a form of legal tender. The reasons cited included the reported cost to mint a single penny, which is 3.69 cents. Every time the treasury minted a penny, we lost 2.69 cents. In fiscal year 2024, the U.S. Mint produced 3.2 billion pennies. The U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million that year in the production of the penny.
Benjamin Franklin, who coined the phrase “a penny saved is a penny earned,” designed the original American penny, known as the Fugio Cent, in 1787. The message on the coin was “Mind Your Business,” and on the reverse side, “We are One” was encircled by a chain of 13 links, representing the original 13 colonies. “We are One” later became the motto “E Pluribus Unum” on the one-cent piece.
The first official one-cent piece was minted early in our nation’s history by the newly established U.S. Mint, located in Philadelphia, in 1793, following the passage of the Coinage Act of 1792. They originally minted over 11,000, and Thomas Jefferson oversaw the U.S. Mint until a director was appointed. The penny is a piece of U.S. history, a symbol of the establishment of our great republic, and to see it disappear so unceremoniously is a cheap way to go out.
The penny is part of popular culture. In 1936, American footwear brand G.H. Bass introduced the Weejun, considered the first penny loafer mass-marketed in the United States. The shoe became known as the “penny loafer” in the 1950s, when college students would tuck a penny into the shoe’s front strap, or “vamp,” as a fashion statement, for good luck, and supposedly as an emergency backup to make phone calls at pay phones. The price of a pay phone in the ’50s ranged from 5 to 10 cents, so a pair of penny loafers wouldn’t get you very far.
I have owned a pair of penny loafers since before I could walk. I’ve been wearing penny loafers for over 40 years. Something else I owned growing up in the 1980s were Penny Racers, miniature toy cars that you pulled back to wind up. They could perform a wheelie when released if a penny was inserted into the slot on their back while racing. The Penny Racer was initially created by the Japanese toy company Takara in 1978 under the Choro-Q brand. It made its U.S debut in 1981. They were marketed as “a different breed of speed.”
It may sound like I’m delving into nostalgia, but the loss of the penny has ramifications that extend beyond my childhood. Wishing wells are littered with the pennies from well-wishers. Wells were seen as sacred and divine gifts. Even modern water fountains have been transformed into wishing wells, an echo of an ancient tradition that spans multiple cultures, where a coin was thrown into them for a wish. In the United States, you could offer a penny in exchange for a wish — any wish you could imagine.
When we run out of pennies or hoard them into oblivion, that well is going to cost you at least a nickel per wish, which brings me to the part that I haven’t seen reported by the media, yet. Are we rounding up or down for the cost of items that are not in increments of 5 cents at businesses? Things will always cost at least 5 cents moving forward. I thought affordability was an issue, and this feels like state-sponsored greedflation.

South Euclid-Lyndhurst Schools and Westerville City Schools don’t have much in common. 
While the students in the South Euclid-Lyndhurst School District are majority Black, that’s not the case for residents, especially in Lyndhurst which is overwhelmingly white. 
Westerville is an increasingly diverse district that straddles Franklin and Delaware County. 
We both passed school levies despite constant attacks on public education from a group of powerful Ohio politicians.
Most Ohioans want the best for our state’s children – even if we don’t have any of our own. 
We understand that strong public schools keep our neighborhoods vibrant. 
We know it just doesn’t pass the smell test when politicians try to blame the property tax squeeze on public schools. 
After all, they created the problem in the first place by slashing school funding to give handouts to big corporations and their wealthy political donors.
In most years, only about half of school levies pass. This year two-thirds succeeded. 
In Westerville, 57% of Delaware County voters and two-thirds of Franklin County voters supported a 0.75% income tax to fund the district’s basic operating expenses like staff, programs and materials. 
Just last year, voters defeated Westerville’s combined capital bond and operating levy. 
In South Euclid-Lyndhurst, 58% of voters approved a 7.9 mil property tax levy to fund building repairs and day-to-day expenses.
Both campaigns had a clear message to voters: These levies are essential to fund the programs and people that prepare our children to succeed. It’s up to us to fund our schools because the state isn’t coming to save us.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ohio Speaker of the House Matt Huffman and Ohio Senate President Rob McColley pushed through a 2026-27 state budget that underfunded public schools by $2.8 billion but gave a $1.68 billion tax cut to the wealthiest 20% of Ohioans and $2.5 billion to unaccountable private schools through the voucher program. 
They even handed over $600 million of our unclaimed funds to their billionaire political donors, the owners of the Cleveland Browns, for a new stadium in Brook Park.
South Euclid-Lyndhurst and Westerville were hit hard by the last state budget. 
Most lawmakers voted to abandon the Fair School Funding Plan which would have finally ensured the state contributes its fair share of what it costs to educate children in every district. 
Under the 2026-27 budget South Euclid-Lyndhurst had its funding cut by $727,941 and Westerville by $935,352. 
Under the Fair School Funding Plan, South Euclid-Lyndhurst would have received an additional $3.68 million and Westerville just over $6 million, according to Policy Matters Ohio. 
Years of state tax cuts have forced school districts to ask more of local residents.
A recent study showed that Ohio has the eighth highest property tax rates, but the 45th share of state funding for public education in the nation. 
State lawmakers are pumping out a slew of ill-informed property tax proposals — most of which would provide negligible relief to homeowners but would further defund our public schools.
Speaker Huffman and Senate President McColley hope Ohioans will blame teachers, principals, and superintendents. 
But they’re leaving out the part about how they force local communities to make up the difference by slashing public school funding so they can give kickbacks to their wealthy friends and donors.
At a time when people are collecting signatures to abolish property taxes and lawmakers are proposing one half-baked property tax bill after another — it seemed like this could be a tough election for school levies. 
Instead, it was the opposite. 
But Ohioans won’t let a few greedy politicians trick us into carrying water for their billionaire donors. 
This election we called their bluff. 
Now it’s time to demand real solutions: like full and fair funding for our public schools.

We’ve just about made it through another hurricane season. But I should warn you that something even scarier is coming: A gubernatorial election.
Board up your windows! Batten down your lawn furniture! The politicians are coming, and they’re blowing Category 5 gusts of hot air!
In 2026, we’re going to elect our next governor, and candidates have been jumping into the race like kids leaping into a cool Florida spring on a scorching summer day. So far, there are four Republicans and two Democrats vying for the job.
The Republicans are Byron Donalds, a U.S. representative from Naples; Paul Renner, a former speaker of the House from the Jacksonville area; little-known Lt. Gov. Jay Collins from Tampa; and James Fishback, a business executive with no government experience whom Politico described as a “fast-talking, Spanish-speaking Davie, Florida, native.”
On the Democratic side, the competitors are former Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly, now pursuing the Charlie Crist party-switch path; and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, a former police chief and sheriff.
As if those six weren’t enough, there’s an independent candidate, Miami Sen. Jason Pizzo, a former Democrat who’s announced he’s running, too.
Generally speaking, seeing seven candidates seeking the Governor’s Mansion could be a sign of how big a disaster the sitting occupant has been.
The Ron DeSantis administration is being investigated by a Leon County grand jury in the Hope Florida scandal. He’s under scrutiny for voting to give $83 million to a campaign contributor in exchange for 4 acres of Destin land nobody wanted. His proposal to build golf courses in a state park last year was so deeply unpopular that the Legislature passed a law this year to prevent him or his successors from ever trying to do it again.
Note that two of the three episodes involve DeSantis’ horrible handling of environmental issues. That’s why, I think, every chance we get in the next 12 months, we voters ought to quiz his would-be replacements about where they stand on that segment of the state’s responsibilities.
As we have seen repeatedly, the environment in Florida IS the economy. The two are as inextricably intertwined as the tangled roots of a mangrove forest.
Dirty water
When DeSantis was first elected in 2018, Florida voters were concerned about toxic algae blooms that had lasted for months. DeSantis swore he’d cure this by appointing a panel of scientists to tell him about what to do.
He appointed the panel  — but then he and the Legislature failed to follow most of its recommendations.
Now Florida is the No. 1 state for polluted lakes. A toxic algae bloom killed off so much seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon that more than 1,000 manatees starved to death. Florida’s longest river, the St. Johns, is coping with steadily increasing pollution from septic waste.
Grant Gelhardt via subject
Even when the Legislature passed a law ordering special protections for our iconic springs, the agencies answering to DeSantis ignored it, noted Grant Gelhardt of the Sierra Club.
Instead of attacking pollution sources, DeSantis cut a deal to pay millions of dollars to an Israeli company that dumps a hydrogen peroxide mix into algae-tainted waterways. But then the algae comes back and the Israelis have to do it over. Even the head of the Israeli company thinks this is futile.
“DeSantis’ fight against algal blooms in Florida will fail,” he wrote on X, back when it was just plain Twitter. “There is no question that preventing raw sewage and runoffs from spilling into waterways must be addressed.”
So, the first question everyone should ask the gubernatorial candidates is: What will you do to fix Florida’s rampant water pollution problems?
Lake O woes
I had a lengthy chat about this with Gil Smart of the Vote Water organization, who pointed out that Lake Okeechobee in particular needs help.
Gil Smart via Vote Water
It was recently named the dirtiest lake in the U.S. Things have gotten so bad there that Bass Masters removed Lake O from its Top Ten Bass Lakes in the United States.
Rather than clamp down on polluters poisoning Lake O and other waterways, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has set up a series of voluntary “basin management action plans” that all fail, Smart said.
“That’s the state’s main tool for reducing pollution and it’s not working,” he said. “At what point do we stop saying, ‘Oh, that’s a shame,’ and start doing something about it?”
The polluters tend to be big campaign contributors, which guarantees they’re left alone. But the pollution is taking an economic toll on our tourism, fishing, and other industries, so whoever takes over from DeSantis will need to make some hard choices.
Byron Donalds at his secret water summit, via Facebook with permission
Last year, Donalds convened a water summit that matched polluters with regulators — and refused to allow in either the press or the public. If he opened the meeting to everyone, Donalds argued, the poor polluters and the people regulating them would be too scared to talk honestly.
To me, “honest talk” between polluters and regulators is less important than letting the public — the people paying the tax bills and drinking the water —- know what’s going on.
But that leads to our second question for the candidates.
On the downlow
DeSantis clearly missed his calling. Instead of politics, he should’ve gone into espionage. 
He persuaded the Legislature to make his travel records a state secret, even though no governor ever sought such a Sunshine Law exemption. He held a Cabinet meeting in a foreign country, ensuring most Floridians couldn’t participate. Even worse, he’s repeatedly cut non-public deals to give away public land to private interests.
First came his attempt to allow a company to build three golf courses in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, plus hotels and pickleball courts in other parks. That blew up in his face like a hand grenade.
Then he attempted to swap land from the Withlacoochee State Forest with a Canadian golf course builder. An uproar ensued and the land went unswapped.
More recently, he wanted to give some mystery developer 600 acres from the Guana River Wildlife Management Area. Once the public found out, the developer melted back into the shadows.
Each instance of DeSantis trying to keep things on the downlow led to widespread outrage. People love Florida’s preserves, and they don’t like seeing some ploy to give them away.
That’s why I think the next question for the candidates has to be: Will you treat public land like it’s owned by the public, and not as your personal property to benefit friends?
We want to return to the days when our precious state parks, preserves,, and forests stayed public and stayed natural.
This leads to the one area where DeSantis almost came across as a good guy.
Undermining the Everglades
For 25 years, when Florida politicians wanted to fool the voters into thinking they liked the environment, they talked about restoring the Everglades.
“I pledge to spend millions on restoration of the River of Grass,” they’d promise solemnly. What they really meant was, “I’ll hand over millions in tax dollars to well-connected contractors to build what the plans call for, but I won’t do it fast and they’ll take their time, too.”
That’s why the Everglades restoration has gone billions over budget and years beyond its original deadline.
But not even the most cynical would have built a new pollution source like an immigrant detention camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve. That would undercut all the restoration work that’s already been done.
Yet DeSantis did it, and without even checking its environmental impact.
Environmental groups accused him of betraying the Glades. But DeSantis scoffed at being considered an Everglades villain, considering all the money he’d steered toward the River of Grass.
“You’re talking about the guy who’s plowed how much money into Everglades restoration?” DeSantis said.
That’s sort of like him saying, “I’ve spent a lot of money on a fancy car, so you should respect my automotive expertise — even though I’ve just dumped a bag of sugar in the gas tank.”
Lawsuits are working their way through federal court to shut this camp down.
Eve Samples via Friends of the Everglades
I contacted one of the plaintiffs: Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, the organization co-founded by Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I asked her what she would ask the candidates to replace DeSantis. Her answer:
“Will you commit to banning all harmful development from the Everglades that undermines the billion-dollar restoration project?”
That should cover not only the prison camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” she said, but also a rock mine being pushed by Big Sugar and various residential and commercial developments that have been steadily chomping away at the margins.
“You can’t be an Everglades governor and allow development in the Everglades,” she said.
Which leads to the next question.
Developer-Santis
DeSantis has never met a developer he didn’t like. He’s signed every bill they supported. He’s backed controversial developments so often, I started calling him “Developer-Santis.”
Did the developers want expensive toll roads to spread urban sprawl throughout rural areas? Despite widespread objections, DeSantis said yes to that.
Even when a project would make hurricane evacuation much worse, he didn’t support saving the lives of Floridians. Instead, he voted to say yes to the developer.
And if any local government failed to kowtow to developers, he’s been eager to force them into compliance.’
The result of putting the developers in the driver’s seat is that growth is careening out of control, leaving our sewer systems overloaded, our water systems running dry and our roads crowded and crumbling.
Lots of Floridians are becoming fed up with this unwavering governmental support of sprawl-over-all. They want a change. That’s especially true in our remaining rural areas, where people like living at a slower pace.
So, the next question I would ask the candidates is: Will you stand up to developers and tell them no? Will you stick up for saving some parts of Florida as rural? Will you commit to keeping these slices of paradise the way they are?
If they do it even once, that’s better than DeSantis.
Last but not least, let’s talk about science.
The anti-scientist
While I was talking to Gerhardt of the Sierra Club, he told me, “Science should be in the forefront of any plan to protect Florida’s resources.” Who could argue with that?
Our governor would. In the future, DeSantis will be remembered as the most virulently anti-science governor ever.
During the pandemic, he became such a contrarian to the medical establishment that he actually scolded teenagers for wearing masks .  
He’s also appointed people who were anti-science, like an anti-vaxxer surgeon general. And consider his wildlife commissioners, who are so eager to shoot bears that they ignored that the science shows the bear population has declined.
He was cool with signing a new law based on the thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory about “chemtrails.” Meanwhile, even though signs of climate change are obvious everywhere in Florida, he approved legislation to remove that term from most of state law. He had the full support of Speaker Renner on that one, by the way.
Surprisingly, ignoring climate change does not make it go away. We will continue facing soaring temperatures and rising sea levels that affect everything from the intensity of hurricanes to the frequency of expensive beach renourishment.
So, I think it’s fair to ask the candidates if they believe in following what science says about solutions. Or would they prefer Florida continue relying on folk tales, internet rumors, and ancient superstitions?
I think we need to pin these guys down now. Otherwise, they’re liable to try try to top DeSantis. Look for them to start building a fire circle in front of the Capitol, dancing around and chanting gibberish to placate the angry hurricane god,

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Fiscal guardrails mask CT’s revenue needs,William Buhler,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/20/fiscal-guardrails-mask-cts-revenue-needs/,"CT has been disinvesting in housing, education and other core programs because the state has an $88 billion pension liability to pay off.","Over the last few years Connecticut had the good fortune to receive unusually high capital gains tax receipts.  This allowed Gov. Ned Lamont to put $4.1 billion into a “rainy day fund” and $8.6 billion into pension debt repayment. 
But while some celebrated, others disapproved because urgent needs to fully fund education and build affordable housing were again being shortchanged.
This spring $2.4 billion in urgent legislative funding requests were denied, requests for funding eroded by multiple years of inflation. K12 education has been losing $407 million each year since 2017 due to inflation even though the governor called current funding the “largest ever commitment.” According to Joe DeLong, CEO of the Connecticut Council of Municipalities,  these cuts in real funding have contributed to 119,000 youths who are not engaged in school or work. They have problems of mental health/addiction, poverty or homelessness and need counseling, vocational instruction and career planning to get back on their feet.
Connecticut has been disinvesting in housing, education and other core programs because the state has an $88 billion pension liability to pay off and doesn’t collect enough revenue to manage this, fully fund its core programs and invest in its future. According to Wade Gibson of the CT Voices for Children Fiscal Policy Center, “Connecticut state and local government raises and spends less per dollar of personal income than almost any other state.”
Governor Lamont often disseminates upbeat news about the state’s economy. In his 2025 State of the State Address he said “we’re doubling our commitment to housing.” That seems reassuring except that we’re around 90,000 units short of what we need to facilitate job growth. A report by Jacqueline Rabe Thomas and Alex Putterman reveals investment in state subsidized housing has declined before and during the current governor’s administration. We should have been increasing investment in housing more than a decade ago but we were too caught up with the idea of balancing the budget as an end in itself. The governor makes us feel good with his upbeat remarks, but they gloss over the depth of the state’s economic challenges.
What are those challenges? 
For one, job growth. Jobs can’t be filled because job seekers can’t find affordable places to live.  According to Don Klepper-Smith, Chief Economist for Datacore, during the last 14 years the nation’s economy expanded by 38% but Connecticut’s economy grew by only 10%.  Had we invested more in housing and other core priorities we could be enjoying substantial job growth and more revenue as a return on investment. Instead, we’ve lost ground;  An analysis by CT Voices for Children “The State of Working Connecticut 2024” notes that “The state’s disparities in GDP and job growth, in comparison to the national average, have cost Connecticut billions of dollars in unrealized tax revenue and 248,000 potential jobs since 2007.”
After receiving recent higher capital gains tax receipts, Governor Lamont denied Connecticut has a revenue problem.  Yet this particular revenue could not be used to properly fund housing, education or other core priorities due to the volatility guardrail, one of three interlocking fiscal controls. Together they slow-walk the process of raising, appropriating and spending revenue, effectively blocking efforts to raise or direct new revenue. This result aligns with the governor’s staunch opposition to seeking more revenue from top income residents.
A few years ago Massachusetts passed a 4% surtax on income over $1 million. It brought in enough revenue to offer free community college for those 25 and over, build new transportation projects, pay for road and bridge repairs, create new bicycle lanes and pay for free school lunches.
But Connecticut’s fiscal guardrails block us from following Massachusetts’ example.  The volatility guardrail funnels all revenue from capital gains taxes to the Budget Reserve fund, also known as the rainy day fund.  After filling the rainy day fund, all remaining revenue of this type is used to pay down the unfunded pension liability and other debt.
Could Connecticut raise income or sales taxes to generate more revenue? Yes, but the spending guardrail limits the growth of the budget to ”the average percent increase in personal income over the previous five years or to the previous year’s inflation.”  The impact of new revenue on the budget would accordingly be muted in any given year.
Finally, there’s a revenue guardrail which requires appropriations not to exceed the current year’s revenue forecast. Due to these three fiscal guardrails there is no way to raise significant new revenue that could be spent in any reasonable timetable unless the governor declares an emergency.
People looking for positive economic news may be encouraged that Connecticut’s economy grew 4.6% during the second quarter of 2025. There were increased profits in manufacturing, finance and insurance and personal income grew by 6.4% and 6.3% in the first two quarters. As a measure of increased value of goods and services this indicates economic growth.
Does this growth mean Connecticut’s economy is in good shape?  No, because job growth is still in a holding pattern and the income gains are not broad-based.  We’re in a K-shaped economy in which the top 20% gains income while everyone else’s wages shrink due to inflation. Recent articles describe how 40% of households are struggling to get by, how Connecticut is lagging the nation in job growth, how the cost of living here is 13% higher and how families are finding the state unaffordable.
Besides the obstacles imposed by the guardrails, inflation and the growing income gap, inequitable property tax rates reduce spendable income for a broad swath of low- and middle-income households. Property tax rates are under the sole control of municipalities, and those filled with high value properties and corresponding low mill rates have a disincentive to approve land use for affordable housing. This exclusionary dynamic has led to property tax rate disparities in which one municipalities tax rate can be several times the rate of another.
Should decisions about tax policy, revenue and spending be supplanted by rigid fiscal controls? We expect legislators and government officials to correct deficiencies in our tax system. We want them to raise sufficient revenue to pay bills, fully fund public services, make prudent investments for the state’s economic growth and put aside savings for future contingencies.  Do the fiscal guardrails allow legislators to make such decisions?  No, no and no.
While weighing the need to retain some fiscal controls, Connecticut leaders should take stock of investments needed for broad-based economic growth. The guardrails should be lifted to allow for raising new revenue and increasing budget growth.
According to the Federation of Tax Administrators in 2021, Connecticut was 35th lowest in the amount of revenue it collects as a percent of personal income. With our level of pension debt, high living costs and years of disinvestment, 35th place is not where we need to be. Connecticut can’t make the economy work for everyone by clinging to small government.

Thomson, Kit Gage",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/19/burn-it-or-bury-it-montgomery-county-at-a-waste-management-crossroads-with-no-easy-answers/,"Calls to retire Montgomery County's trash incinerator at Dickerson present complex environmental, health and equity tradeoffs, write Vivian Thomson and Kit Gage, and county residents will need more facts than they have to make the right decision.","The Montgomery County Resource Recovery Facility -- the trash incinerator -- in Dickerson in a 2016 file photo. (Photo courtesy EPA Clean Air Markets)Montgomery County is at a waste management crossroads. The county has issued a request for proposals to export its 600,000 tons of annually generated waste to a landfill, probably in another state. County Executive Marc Elrich has long pushed to close the county’s trash incinerator.
This decision involves complicated environmental, public health, equity and cost tradeoffs, and the county lacks vital pieces of information. We have summarized what we know and what we don’t know in a report posted by Friends of Sligo Creek.
On the environmental and public health side of the equation, incinerators kill pathogens, but they produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Still, our analysis indicates that landfilling the county’s waste could produce far more greenhouse gases than incinerating it. That’s because landfills emit methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas.
The incinerator’s air pollution controls appear to be working well. The county’s solid waste plan says, “Several health-risk assessment studies have concluded that there are no measurable influences on ambient air concentrations attributable to RRF [incinerator] source emissions” (p. 3-32). According to the Maryland Department of the Environment, the incinerator operates well within its permitted air pollution limits and, except for hydrogen chloride, within the Biden administration’s proposed stricter standards for waste incinerators.
But the incinerator’s ash, a source of toxic metals, currently goes to a Richmond, Virginia, landfill whose surrounding community is 70% African American. County staff say the ash is stabilized to remain non-hazardous and that it is tested regularly.

Nearby jurisdictions use a different ash disposal technique. Arlington County, Fairfax County and the City of Alexandria use an ash monofill, a type of facility that’s designed to prevent the release of metals.
In extending the life of their incinerator to 50 years, Arlington and Alexandria said, “it was found to be economically beneficial for both jurisdictions.” They also cited the “stellar” environmental record of the facility. Although incinerators can divert materials from recycling, Arlington and Alexandria report strong recycling rates (53%), as does Montgomery County (45%).
Landfills harbor pathogens. They produce copious amounts of air and water pollution, for decades. Landfill gases contain carcinogens like benzene and vinyl chloride. Landfill leachate (garbage “juice”) is a toxic chemical cocktail, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said that even the best-protected landfills will eventually leak. One Virginia megalandfill identified as a potential recipient of the county’s trash generates almost 400,000 gallons of leachate per week. That landfill is in bankruptcy proceedings.
Equity is an important consideration. The area near the county’s incinerator is relatively well-off and is disproportionately white (75% white alone, versus 40% for the whole county). Many Virginia landfills are in marginalized communities. Maryland is already the leading out-of-state contributor to Virginia’s trash imports. The principles of proximity and self-sufficiency encourage the treatment of waste close to its point of origin.
Dueling estimates cloud the cost picture.
The county’s 2025 contractor report projects that, in the long term, even with needed upgrades, using the incinerator would be cheaper than landfilling. In 2024, the facility generated $24 million in revenues from sales of electricity and recovered metals. Closing the incinerator would mean losing those revenues and burying metals that, when recycled, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas pollution relative to using virgin materials.
However, county staff maintain that, in the short term, the landfill-plus-incinerator-closure option would be cheaper than continuing to operate the incinerator. They argue that the incinerator’s expenses would divert resources from efforts to decrease the county’s waste stream and that paying for landfilling on a per ton basis would incentivize waste reduction. However, the county has not estimated closure costs for the incinerator.
Some important unknowns are: The likely substantial costs for closing the county’s incinerator and remediating its site; the cost to send the incinerator’s ash to a different disposal site; and, the cost to extend the life of the incinerator, because no request for proposals has been issued to that end. For the landfill option, we don’t know what the impacts on the Derwood transfer station might be or whether the county might be liable for landfill contamination problems.
Finally, we don’t know what the county’s citizens think. The county has not scheduled a public hearing.
Council members say we must keep all options open and express deep unease with — or outright opposition to — exporting our trash. They, and the county’s citizens, deserve to see the full picture, and members of the public should have an opportunity to comment.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/52469466397_e9d1353222_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-20 06:56:20.398912

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)The auditor for the state legislature is raising concerns about an increase in the number of unresolved findings as his agency reviews government operations.
More than one-third of compliance issues identified by the Office of Legislative Audits this year were findings repeated from previous audits. About 10% of those findings were included in two or more previous audits, according to a report presented Wednesday to the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee.
“And for perspective, OLA has not seen repeat percentages this high since just prior to 2010,” Christine Timanus, deputy auditor at the Office of Legislative Audits, told committee members.
Most agencies are audited every three to four years. The majority of those reviews are for fiscal compliance.
On average, the auditor has conducted 190 reviews of state agencies annually over the last six years.
Over that time, the number of findings has decreased.
But the office reported that during that time, the percentage of repeat findings has increased from a low of 27% in 2022 and 2023 to the current 34% reported Wednesday.
Board bans individuals from state contracts over bribery charges, first debarments in eight years

Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen said the growing number of repeat findings is concerning.
“We do think that vacancy rates may have contributed at least in part to some of those things,” Tanen said.
An audit of the Social Services Administration released in September included a half-dozen repeat findings. Included in those were findings that the state agency failed to oversee local departments to which it has delegated authority. In other cases, children were going without medical and dental care, or investigations of allegations of abuse were not investigated in a timely manner.
Tanen said agencies are not implementing changes to address the audit findings.
“I don’t think it’s more auditing that’s necessary,” Tanen said. “I think it’s more fixing that’s necessary. We provide the recommendations. Ultimately, it’s the agencies that are responsible for putting the fixes in place. And I think what we’re finding is whether it’s because of a lack of adequate IT or human resources that those agencies oversee, controls those they’re just not doing it.”
Additionally, Tanen told the panel that at least 20% of the findings in the current year are related to delegated procurements. Tanen said the Departments of General Services and Budget and Management, and the Board of Public Works are not ensuring procurements are being conducted properly.
“And so, I think it becomes, at some point, we need to take a step back and say, these agencies that are responsible for controlling these activities, where do they stand to be accountable?” Tanen said.
“One of the things that may have to happen is when you delegate authority, sometimes you have to take the keys away from the child that’s not using the responsibilities that you’ve given them properly,” Tanen said. “And you know, if an agency is not procuring things properly or not handling the responsibilities they’ve been delegated properly, maybe we need to set an example, and someone needs to take that responsibility away and give it to somebody who can.”

Sears/Maryland Matters)The Board of Public Works indefinitely barred four individuals and one company Wednesday from doing business with the state after they were convicted of bribery in their previous dealings with the state.
The debarments appeared to be the first in eight years by the state,  which keeps a list of more than 80 companies and individuals who are ,prohibited from contracting with the state.
“It’s important that we uphold and strengthen the integrity of our procurement process by holding bad actors accountable,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman said during the meeting.
“Debarment is a crucial tool available to the Board of Public Works to ensure there are real consequences for companies that violate the public trust,” she wrote in a later statement. 
Of the four individuals barred, two were brothers — James and Paul DiPino — associated with the one debarred company, AB Medical LLC. 
According to board documents, James DiPino worked as a senior manager for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, where he was responsible for selecting vendors for purchase orders. In at least two instances, he selected AB Medical — a company secretly associated with his brother — for the purchase of personal protective equipment, despite having lower offers from other vendors. There were a total of 11 purchases from the company. 
AB Medical transferred $3 million to James DiPino through two shell companies established by both brothers in September 2020 — he used the funds for a personal investment account and the purchase of a nearly $280,000 boat,according to the materials. The brothers and company were convicted of bribery in 2023. 
James Schoo, another debarred individual, was a former Department of Juvenile Services employee who took bribes from the construction company Seabolt & Sons for maintenance work at DJS facilities, the board documents said. While Maryland paid the company $1.2 million, Schoo had the company install a concrete driveway in his home, put carpets in a rental home and both his and his daughter’s homes and received wood cabinets from the company — all with no payment for work or materials. 
Schoo also used a fraudulent company to compete as a losing bidder against Seabolt & Sons. He sent state funds to that company, which he used to send money to the unemployed husband of a different vendor — later hiring the husband to an actual DJS job desite his lack of qualifications, and attending outings with the employee. Schoo was convicted of bribery, conspiracy to bribe, theft and false statements in 2020. 
The final debarred individual from Wednesday’s meeting is Mark Anthony Sykes, who paid $20,000 in bribes to state officials in exchange for using his company, Building Enterprises LLC, for the cleaning of COVID-related facilitie, board documents saids. The company received nearly $175,000 from Maryland. Sykes was convicted in Baltimore County Circuit Court of bribery in April. 
In addition to bribery, other activities that are grounds for debarment include worker misclassification, failure to meet contract rules and wage theft, according to Lierman and Rachel Hershey, general cousel to the board. 
“It is clear from our discussion about debarment during today’s Board of Public Works meeting that more effort is needed to hold companies accountable when they have engaged in illegal and fraudulent activities,” Lierman said in the statement. “Our tax dollars should never be used to support unscrupulous companies that commit fruad or mistret their workers.”
The Board of Public Works maintains a list of debarred companies and indivisuals — that Lierman noted had not been updated for eight years, before Wedmesday. Both Hershey and Board Executive Secretary John T. Gontrum said the lack of updates is a reflection of the lack of debarments over the past few years, and the recently debarred will be added to the list. 
“There’s an opportunity here for some education to those entities that are responsible for bringing education to the board,” Hershey said.
Lierman plans to review past and upcoming fraud cases with the Office of the Attorney General and with board staff. She also said in her statement that she plans to bring the issue to the attention of the Joint Enforcement Task Force on Workplace Fraud to create a debarment recommendation process for other actions that “rob the state of valuable resources.”
“I remain comitted to being a watchdog for our tax dollars and being a strong advocate for Marylanders,” Lierman said in the statement.
State approves Baltimore Banner judgment payment
The state approved a nearly a $175,000 to settle a Public Information Act claim by the Baltinore Bannern against state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The bulk of the payment, $165,741, is for attorney’s fees to Venable LLP, the law firm that represented the Banner in the lawsuit. Another $8,239.94 is for litigation costs and the final $1,000 is a penalty for violating a PIA request, which will go to the Banner.
The lawsuit was filed in December 2022 after the medical examiner’s office improperly denied the Banner access to autopsy and toxicology reports, which the news organization had planned to use to report on overdoses and the opioid epidemic.
While Treasurer Dereck Davis referred to the $1,000 statutory damage as a “money grab,” the Maryland Department of Health Assistant Attorney General Nicole Lugo Clark described it as a “minute portion” of the overall settlement. Lierman said that she may have added the penalty language to the PIA statue when she was in the legislature — a statement that drew laughs from both the board and the audience after Davis’ “money-grab” comment.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0101-newsroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

Ford/Maryland Matters)An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by unaffiliated Maryland voters, who argued that the state’s closed primary elections infringe on their voting rights.
In her ruling last week, Circuit Judge Pamela K. Alban wrote that the state’s precedent is clear, based on prior cases that affirmed political parties’ rights to exclude unaffiliated voters from their primary elections.
“While the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights guarantee the right to vote in state elections, neither grants the right to vote in a political party’s primary without affiliating with that party,” Alban wrote.
An attorney for the voters who brought the suit, Boyd Rutherford, the former lieutenant governor to Gov. Larry Hogan (R), vowed to appeal Alban’s ruling.

“While we would like to have had a chance to fully brief the merits of our case in Circuit Court, our appeal will get the Constitutional questions before the Appellant Courts quicker,” Rutherford (R) said in a statement to Maryland Matters.
The Maryland Attorney General’s Office decined to comment Wedneday on the dismissal of the case.
Alban’s ruling was expected to be appealed — no matter which side she landed on. She said as much during a late-October motions hearing in Annapolis.
“I imagine no matter what I do, this may not be the end,” Alban told the courtroom then.
Maryland is one of 18 states with either completely closed or partially closed primaries, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures,
The Maryland voters filed their lawsuit challenging Maryland’s system in May, and a few months later, the Maryland State Board of Elections, represented by the state attorney general’s office, filed a motion to dismiss the case on various grounds.
During a late October hearing in Annapolis, Alban ruled partially in favor of the aggrieved voters, determining that they had legal standing to sue.
But Alban waited to rule on the merits of the case, and to determine whether the voters had stated a claim that could proceed. During her questioning, Alban hinted that she was skeptical of the voters’ case.
In their arguments, attorneys for the voters tried to make the argument that their case was distinct from two prior Maryland Supreme Court deicisohns that validated closed primaries: Hennegan v. Geartner in 1946 and Suessman v. Lamone in 2004.
But Alban disagreed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims fall squarely within the scope of the holdings in Seussmann and Hennegan. They assert rights that, under Maryland law, they do not possess,” she  wrote.
Alban ruled that although the Suessman case was focused on a primary election for circuit court judge, it still applied, because the court relied on the notion that Maryland voters are not entitled to participate in partisan primaries.
In the Hennegan case, a petitioner challenged a prior version of the state’s elections code, which prohibited party changes six months before a primary. The court ruled that because the petitioner did not have a constitutional right to participate in a party primary, the state law was valid.
As such, Alban ruled that both cases prove that the precedent in Maryland is that citizens have no constitutionally protected right to vote in primaries, and Rutherford’s case should be dismissed.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A former Cecil County deputy sheriff was sentenced Tuesday to eight years in prison with all but six months suspended for illegal searches on a police database, according to the Maryland State Prosecutor’s Office.
After Donta Odom completes his sentence, he will serve three years of supervised probation.
The sentencing by Cecil County Circuit Court Judge Paul M. Bowman comes after Odom pleaded guilty last month to four counts of misconduct in office and three counts of unauthorized access to a computer.
A statement of facts said Odom searched a law enforcement database for information on seven people who were not suspects, including his wife.
The document states Odom also searched information on romantic partners, relatives of romantic partners, a woman who worked in his building and others. Authorities said Odom had no “legitimate law enforcement reason to search” a database about any of the individuals, who are not named.
Odom worked for sheriff’s office from 2019 until he resigned in August 2025.

One of those searches Odom did between September and December 2024 on a person identified as “Victim 4.”
In December of that year, after Odom and Victim 4 went on a vacation to Ocean City, Victim 4 informed the sheriff’s office of Odom’s conduct.
Although Odom was served with a no-contact order, he continued to contact Victim 4 through social media, texts and emails. In addition, Odom secretly recorded a conversation with Victim 4 in March of this year, when they met at a secluded location, leading to a wiretapping charge.
On March 9, 2025, Odom repeatedly asked Victim 4 why she told investigators certain information. The next day, Odom texted her, “Why don’t you ask for the no contact order to be dropped” and “to delete everything.”
Odom also spoke with Victims 1 and 2 prior to and after they were interviewed by investigators.
“You have done incalculable harm to law enforcement. You have truly dishonored the badge you used to wear,” Bowman said, accordihg to a news release from the prosecutor’s office. “Your unlawful behavior while serving as a police officer will not be tolerated.”
“Law enforcement officers have access to sensitive and confidential information necessary to discharge their official duties,” Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said in the statement. “Our office will continue to do our best to ensure that those officers who abuse their positions of trust and misuse their authorities for corrupt reasons are held accountable.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_7854-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-20 05:57:46.963637

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The Ohio House has once again protected marijuana and “intoxicating” hemp policy from the Senate’s restrictions after a deal went up in smoke Wednesday night.
The Senate adjourned before the House was able to figure out if they even had enough votes.
The gavel hit for likely the last time before Ohio lawmakers take their holiday break.
And their main priority was supposed to be marijuana and hemp policy.
A deal was done to ban intoxicating hemp products with low-level THC that you can buy in gas stations and smoke shops.
Marijuana policy wasn’t going to change much, until a last-minute curveball on Wednesday.
“The Senate has dug in on adding some things to the bill that are just not acceptable to a lot of members of the House,” state Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord, said.
They have hit a roadblock — a Jamie Callender-sized roadblock.
The Cleveland-area Republican calls the last-minute additions to the bill “unconstitutional.”
“Some language that they took out that we had to protect from searches and stops by law enforcement based on being a ‘known user’ or a ‘known consumer,'” Callender said.
Democratic state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said the new provisions would make it illegal to have marijuana in your car in some instances.
The changes could also jeopardize jobs if someone tests positive for THC.
It also would not include money for expungement.
“The majority of Republicans in the House and Senate don’t care about the will of the voters, and that’s the biggest problem,” DeMora said.
But Ohio Senate President Rob McColley said that they were focused on public safety.
“Selling a lot of these products that we’ve already said are really concerning, could potentially harm kids,” McColley said in a previous gaggle.
State Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, has been working with Callender to protect access to hemp products, while also regulating them.

The duo has been pushing back against leadership for months.
The president argued that he and the Senate had done their job on the topic.
McColley said he isn’t going to air the differences out in public.
“I don’t think that’s fair to negotiations that are supposed to be in the spirit of a conference committee,” he said. “The Senate has made significant, significant concessions to get to this point. We’ve even made continued concessions three times after we thought we had a deal.”
But this isn’t the end.
“We have an if-needed session in December,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.
But for a large group of Republicans and Democrats in the House, the Senate’s requests are unreasonable.
“The Senate always has the opportunity to go back and retract, Callendar said.

Ohio House Bill 486, also known as the Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act, now heads to the Ohio Senate for consideration.

Kirk, a political activist who founded Turning Point USA and often spoke about his Christian faith, was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. 
Republican state Reps. Gary Click and Mike Dovilla introduced H.B. 486 bill less than two months ago.  
The bill originally just mentioned Christianity but an amendment in the House Education Committee broadened the scope of the bill to include Judeo-Christian. 
“We’re not talking about indoctrination,” Click claimed. “We’re not talking about preaching students. We’re not talking about narrative religions. We’re not talking about a Bible course. We’re talking about the factual events in history.”  
With the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses as the first and second clauses in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution stands as history’s most notable document establishing religious freedom in a nation at its founding. 
“The bill flies in the face of the First Amendment because the government has no business endorsing or promoting a particular religious tradition,” Ohio Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, said.
“Never once has a teacher ever told me they were afraid to teach about the positive or negative impact of religion on American history.”
The bill outlines several examples that could be taught including the history of the pilgrims, the religious background of signers of the Declaration of Independence, the religious influence on the U.S. Constitution, Benjamin Franklin’s call for prayer at the constitutional convention, the separation of church and state, the role of the Ten Commandments “in shaping American law,” how religious influence shaped the Civil Rights movement, and the impact of evangelist Billy Graham, among others, according to the bill’s language. 
“These are examples,” Click said. “It’s not an exhaustive list, but these are examples that can help teachers understand the things that they can teach that are legal or lawful.”
History teachers already teach this in Ohio classrooms, said Brennan, a former teacher. 
“I taught many of the very documents listed in this bill,” he said. “… A teacher has nothing to fear, as long as they’re not proselytizing,” Brennan said. 
“The Constitution doesn’t prevent us from teaching about religion. It prevents us from promoting it. There’s a big difference there.”
The religions of America’s Founding Fathers had wide variation but most were Protestant. Many came from the Anglican, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist churches, with some Quakers, Lutherans, and Dutch Reformed, and some Catholics. 
A significant minority of the founders were Unitarians or Deists, believing in a supreme creator but not in divine intervention. This included Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Paine.

(Photo by Carl Payne, States Newsroom.)Ohio lawmakers voted Wednesday to shorten the deadline again for returning absentee ballots — removing any grace period and invalidating all ballots that arrive after Election Day. That measure, Ohio Senate Bill 293, is now on its way to the governor.
As recently as 2022, Ohio voters had a 10-day grace period for absentee ballots post-marked by Election Day to arrive at their local county board of elections to be officially counted. Ohio Republican lawmakers shortened that to four days for the 2024 election, and are now eliminating the grace period entirely.
Threats from the Trump administration spurred Ohio lawmakers into action.
In a March executive order, the president introduced a novel of reading of federal law and simply declared all absentee ballots arriving after Election Day should be rejected.
In recent months, the U.S. Department of Justice has been warning Ohio officials it might sue the state over the issue.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill’s sponsors also pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case out of Mississippi which allows ballots to show up five days after an election.
Should the court reject absentee ballot grace periods, they argue, Ohio election officials could find themselves rushing to make sweeping changes ahead of a contentious federal election.
At the last minute, the bill picked up an amendment that critics warn will increase provisional voting “exponentially” and make it far easier to cancel a voter’s registration.
The changes direct county boards to promptly cancel a person’s registration if the secretary of state determines they aren’t a citizen.
It’s a notable departure. Typically, county boards send a confirmation notice when they find a problem with a person’s registration.
Ohio Sec. of State LaRose’s noncitizen voter registration audit sweeps in naturalized citizens

And it’s not like the secretary’s track record is perfect. Since taking office Sec. Frank LaRose has flagged hundreds of individuals as alleged noncitizens. County prosecutors and the Ohio Attorney General have largely brushed off his allegations and declined to prosecute all but a handful. Last year, LaRose’s review appeared to violate statutory requirements and wound up flagging recently naturalized citizens.
The amendment also directs the secretary to send reports to all 88 counties detailing apparent data mismatches. Voters identified in the report would receive a confirmation notice, and if they don’t provide corrected information they’d have to vote provisionally.

House floor debate
On the House floor, state Rep. Sharon Ray, R-Wadsworth, explained the bill brings Ohio’s deadline in line with 34 others around the country.
A former election board member in Medina County, Ray emphasized acting now will simplify changes at county boards, “allowing for an extensive voter awareness campaign” before the primary and ensuring “consistency” between the primary and general elections.
Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, debating on the Ohio House floor. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, asked his colleagues if they want to “tighten loopholes,” “instill confidence and credibility,” and ensure “Ohio is abiding by federal election law.”
“I do,” Bird said. “I would encourage you to want that as well.”
State Rep. Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, blasted the suggestion that Ohio’s current system is breaking the law.
“This notion that we would be violating federal law by continuing our grace period is false,” she said. “There is no federal law that is being violated. There is a court case that is being reviewed by the Supreme Court.”
Democrats brought three different amendments on the House floor. All of them failed.
State Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, proposed changes that would have created permanent absent voter list.
Russo offered language allowing voters to return absentee ballots at any polling location or county board of elections rather than just their county board.
State Rep. Ashley Bryant Bailey, D-Cincinnati, urged lawmakers to notify voters 60-90 days before an election if there’s a discrepancy in their records, “before they are blindsided at the polls and forced to vote provisionally.”

Bryant Bailey explained that notice matters to her because a clerical error nearly derailed her appointment to House.
She changed her name when she got married and her registration initially didn’t follow her.
“You may support this bill, or you may oppose it,” she said, “but notice isn’t partisan. It’s basic fairness.”
State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., spoke against each of the proposals before lawmakers tabled the amendments. He suggested a permanent absent voter list would open the door to family members voting on behalf of elderly, incapacitated voters. Allowing voters to turn in ballots at polling locations or other county boards would similarly “make Ohio elections less secure and open to fraud and abuse,” Williams said. Requiring notice before canceling a voter’s registration would lead to fraud, too, Williams insisted.
“If we really care about election integrity,” Williams said, “I think it’s reasonable for the Secretary of State to remove illegal immigrants from our voter rolls, even within 90 days of the election.”
For all Republicans stated concerns about complying with federal law, systematically removing voter registrations within 90 days of a federal election — as Williams suggested and as the bill would require — is barred by the National Voter Registration Act’s ‘quiet period’ provisions.
Last year, Virginia ordered just such a review that wound up removing 1,600 registrations, some of which belonged to eligible voters. A federal court and U.S. Court of Appeals sided with groups challenging those removals, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed them to go forward without ruling on whether the process was valid.
Senate concurrence
Because of that eleventh hour amendment, the Senate had to vote to concur with the House’s changes. Wednesday evening, the Senate took up the bill.
One of the bill’s sponsors, state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court deciding to hear the case out of Mississippi. That ruling will likely arrive next summer.
“It makes more sense and will be more efficient to introduce that change now, that way there’s plenty of time to make sure every voter is aware and can make their vote on time,” she insisted.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, wasn’t buying it, and called the bill an “all-out assault on democracy.”
“Why do we want to act on something before the Supreme Court of the United States makes a decision?” he asked, half exasperated.
“I mean, the Supreme Court, two years ago, basically the same members on the Court, allowed Pennsylvania voters to turn their ballots in and be counted late, even though Pennsylvania didn’t even have that on the books as a state law.”
State Sen. Willis Blackshear, D-Dayton, said the latest changes, coming on the heels of several recent election laws, will only breed confusion.
“Just in regard to the grace period,” he said, “we have changed the timeline from 10 days to four days, and now Senate Bill 293 proposes no grace period. Altogether, this bill will further that confusion and make it so more people will have to vote provisionally and risk their vote not being counted.”
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, pointed to provisions meant to “clean up” discrepancies in the voter rolls — for instance, if an address or a driver’s license doesn’t match or a person dies.
“There are at least four Kent Smiths that live in Cuyahoga County,” he said. “One of them, I know, has passed away. Do you see what the potential problem can be?”
Senate Republicans brushed off all the objections.
One of the bill’s co-sponsors, state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, reminded his colleagues that voters still have several weeks of early voting and 34 other states impose the same deadline for absentee ballots.
State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, recalled Election Day being a single day when he started voting in the 1970s and insisted “it’s so easy” to vote early or by mail.
Frustration growing, Johnson rejected the suggestion that the bill is a Republican attempt to suppress the vote.
“I can personally guarantee you, no one on this side of the aisle is trying to suppress the vote. Get a new line. It’s not true. No one believes it anymore,” he barked.
That rang a bit hollow for state Sen. Catherine Ingram, D-Cincinnati. She noted the Ohio House and Senate held several committee hearings on Election Day just a few weeks ago.

And when we treat it as a crisis—when urgency is used to silence debate or justify extreme measures—the quality of our decisions suffers. 
Massachusetts has always been at its best not when panicking, but when rising collectively to a challenge. That is the Massachusetts I want to lead. 
This principle was tested on Beacon Hill last week. Misplaced priorities were on full display when a modest, common-sense bill—one that would have provided immediate relief to Massachusetts families—was sidelined before it ever received an honest debate. 
The legislation would have replaced the binding 2030 climate mandate—requiring a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gases from 1990 levels—with an advisory goal. It was a pragmatic step toward affordability. It would have saved Massachusetts taxpayers millions. And yet, it never had a chance. 
Instead, legislative leaders punted the proposal into the winter months—exactly when families face their highest heating bills. 
The message was unmistakable: climate ideology prevailed over affordability.  
What makes the decision even more troubling is that a bipartisan coalition has been quietly forming around this issue. Lawmakers across the political spectrum recognize that Massachusetts can do well by the environment without imposing rigid mandates that strain household budgets. 
Even The Wall Street Journal recently praised Democrat Rep. Mark Cusack for introducing a more pragmatic balance between climate goals and economic reality. 
But legislators once again bowed to one of the most powerful and well-funded special interest groups in our state: the green energy lobby. They understood that giving this proposal room for genuine debate would open a can of worms—one that might force them to answer uncomfortable questions about who actually benefits from these mandates. 
Let’s start with a truth that should guide our approach: Massachusetts is responsible for just 0.01 percent of global CO₂ emissions. Nothing in that number justifies forcing families and small businesses to absorb drastically higher electricity and heating costs for a symbolic climate goal that will have no measurable impact on the planet. 
Yet Gov. Healey has elevated climate policy above affordability, competitiveness, and basic economic common sense. She created a powerful “climate czar”—a senior adviser with the authority to review virtually every major initiative through a singular climate lens. That means proposals on housing, affordability, transportation, economic development—you name it—must pass through a partisan climate filter first. 
This is not governing. This is outsourcing priorities. 
Massachusetts now ranks among the most expensive states in America for utility bills. It’s the direct result of a governing approach that prioritizes ideology over impact—an approach that treats affordability as an afterthought and working families as collateral damage. 
And the product of deliberate choices—such as Maura Healey blocking two natural gas pipeline expansions fully aware that doing so would drive energy prices up. 
Meanwhile, other states—blue and red alike—are reassessing aggressive targets and building affordability protections into their planning. Massachusetts is moving in the opposite direction. 
Families, seniors, and small businesses—those least able to absorb financial shocks—bear the brunt of these decisions. 
I’m not here to assign motives or accuse individual lawmakers of bad faith. But I will encourage every citizen to examine OCPF records and see which green energy companies have become some of the most generous political donors. Draw your own conclusions. 
Massachusetts needs a full, independent review of all climate-related spending and mandates. 
That review must look at: 
● All tax credits, subsidies, and grants flowing to green-energy companies 
● Every regulatory mandate that directly increases utility costs 
● The full cost of state climate programs to taxpayers and ratepayers 
● The effects of climate policies on reliability and competitiveness 
This isn’t about partisanship. It’s about priorities. When nearly every family in this state is struggling with the cost of living, it is reckless—and frankly irresponsible—for Beacon Hill to ignore the financial consequences of its climate agenda. 
Massachusetts has always been at its best when we lead with innovation, pragmatism, and common sense—not when we chase symbolic victories at the expense of the people we serve. 
It’s time to bring affordability back to the center of our policymaking and move away from the crisis thinking that has driven so many extreme decisions. If the current administration won’t do it, I will.

Running concurrently is the “Shine the Light on Hunger” campaign that this year set a goal of providing 6 million meals for the Food Bank for the Heartland.
While the Holiday Lights Festival and hunger-relief drive combo is a longtime tradition, this year’s activities come as the food bank, which serves 93 counties, faces “one of the most volatile times” in its history, says Brian Barks, president and CEO.

“Even before the government shutdown and the pause in SNAP benefits, we were already seeing the highest levels of food insecurity our service area has ever experienced,” he said. “These disruptions have only deepened the strain, pushing the food bank and our pantry partners to do even more with less.”
Barks said need is growing faster than resources, and he joined Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. and others Tuesday in announcing details of the holiday lights and food- and fund-raising campaigns.
“For more than a quarter-century, our community has come together under the glow of downtown’s holiday lights to extend warmth to those in need,” Ewing said. “This year, we shine not only light but also hope — and we invite every resident, business and organization to join us in celebrating the holidays and shining the light on hunger.”
One in five children in Nebraska and western Iowa experience food insecurity, says the Food Bank for the Heartland, which distributed more than 24 million meals during fiscal year 2025. The food bank partners with more than 500 agencies across Nebraska and western Iowa.
The Holiday Lights Festival illuminates sections of Omaha from Saturday, Nov. 29, through Thursday, Jan. 1. Nightly displays turn on in downtown throughout the Old Market and across 72 acres of The Riverfront, along the commercial corridors of North 24th Street and South 24th Street. 
Roger Dixon of the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority (MECA), which manages the downtown riverfront park system, said in a statement that the festival brings a “truly immersive holiday experience” with thousands of dazzling lights, a towering tree and dozens of seasonal events to the downtown area throughout December — free and open to the public.
The food campaign is supported by Conagra Brands, Farm Credit Services of America, WoodmenLife and Baker’s Supermarkets.
Rahul Sualy of Conagra Brands said the company created the Shine the Light on Hunger campaign to help make a tangible difference in providing food security to its neighbors. 
“Everybody deserves consistent access to nutritious food,” he said. “By helping provide millions of meals for families across the Heartland, we’re turning compassion into action this holiday season.”
Among the ways the public can support:

Donate funds online: Donate.FoodBankHeartland.org


Donate nonperishable foods by dropping off “most needed” items into bright orange campaign bins at Baker’s Supermarkets and participating arts and cultural organizations. (Items listed include boxed meals, peanut butter, macaroni and cheese, canned tuna and chicken, cereal, canned fruit and vegetables.)
Join the “Stuff the Truck” event Friday, Dec. 5, where — from 3 to 5 p.m., at Baker’s Eagle Run, 132 Street and West Maple Road — volunteers will fill a food bank truck with food for distribution. 

Holiday Lights Festival schedule:

Lighting ceremony, Nov. 29, 6 p.m., at The Riverfront’s Gene Leahy Mall in the performance pavilion, preceded by live music starting at 5 p.m.
KETV Family Festival, Sunday, Dec. 7, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., with free admission and trolley service connecting six family-friendly venues: Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha Children’s Museum, Omaha Public Library’s downtown branch, The Riverfront, Durham Museum and the Omaha Police Department’s Mounted Patrol Barn.

Free.,Trump signs bill requiring DOJ release of Epstein files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-bill-requiring-doj-release-epstein-files,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed into law late Wednesday a bill compelling the release of unclassified investigative files from the case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with whom he shared a well-documented friendship, though Trump denies any involvement in the financier's crimes. Epstein, who surrounded himself with the rich and powerful, died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.Trump signed the bill the day after the House sent it to the Senate, which agreed by unanimous consent to accept the measure.In a post on his own social media platform Truth Social, the president name-called several prominent figures in business and politics, including former President Bill Clinton.“Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!” Trump wrote.In the lengthy post, Trump credits himself and Republican leaders in Congress for the legislation, though the bipartisan bill was forced to the House floor via a discharge petition. After months of loud cries to release the files, even from his base, Trump changed his position Sunday night and directed Republicans to support the measure.In July, Trump's Department of Justice issued a memo that it would not publicly release any further records about the Epstein case.The legislation overwhelmingly passed the House Tuesday in a 427-1 vote.

Clay Higgins, R-La., was the lone no vote. The legislation compels the Justice Department to publicly disclose “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or (co-conspirator Ghislaine) Maxwell.” They include records related to Epstein’s detention and death; flight logs from Epstein’s planes; names of those connected with Epstein’s alleged crimes; records of civil settlements, and sealed and unsealed immunity deals and plea bargains; records pertaining to entities with ties to Epstein’s trafficking or financial networks; and internal DOJ communications “concerning decisions to investigate or charge Epstein or his associates.” The bill carves out exceptions for records containing victims’ identities, images of death or physical abuse, and information that could jeopardize a federal investigation. The bill also notes that the “DOJ may not withhold or redact records on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.”The bill’s passage and Trump's signature came less than a week after lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released some 20,000 pages of emails from Epstein’s estate that repeatedly mentioned Trump’s name. In one email from Epstein to convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier and sex offender claimed Trump “knew about the girls.”Many other names turned up in the thousands of pages of correspondence, including that of Democratic Delegate Stacey Plaskett, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned a residence, and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.A House Republican effort to censure Plaskett narrowly failed in the House Tuesday night. Summers announced Wednesday that he would resign from prominent board and other positions.",,,,2025-11-19 21:56:32.755507
,DC,2025-11-20 02:03:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House votes to cancel big payouts for senators’ 'Arctic Frost' phone subpoenas,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-cancel-big-payouts-senators-arctic-frost-phone-subpoenas,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House approved legislation Wednesday that would revoke part of a law Congress approved just last week, which for the first time allows senators to sue the federal government, potentially for millions of dollars, if their data is subpoenaed without their knowledge. The 426-0 vote sent the bill to the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., doesn’t appear inclined to put the measure on the floor for a vote, though he hasn’t entirely ruled it out. “You have an independent, co-equal branch of the government whose members were, through illegal means, having their phone records acquired, spied on if you will, through a weaponized Biden Justice Department,” Thune said. “That, to me, demands some accountability.”Thune said he understands why several Republican senators were frustrated they didn’t know the provision was added to the funding package that ended the government shutdown.“I take that as a legitimate criticism in terms of the process,” Thune said. “But I think, on the substance, I believe that you need to have some sort of accountability and consequence for that kind of weaponization against a co-equal branch of the government.”Thune declined to say if he thinks it's appropriate for senators to sue for millions in taxpayer dollars for having their phone call records pulled as part of the investigation into President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. “I don't think there's anybody that was targeted for whom the money matters,” Thune said. “I think it's more about the principle.”GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of eight senators who could benefit, said shortly after the House wrapped up debate he plans to sue Verizon as well as the Department of Justice under the new provision. “The subpoena that was issued, I think, was fatally flawed. The judicial order saying if you told me (about the subpoena) I would tamper with witnesses or tamper with evidence is legally offensive,” Graham said. “I'm not going to take this crap anymore. I am going into court, and we'll see what happens.""Dispute among RepublicansSenate Republicans’ decision to include the lawsuit provision in the stopgap spending law that ended the 43-day government shutdown represented a rare public break between GOP congressional leaders.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said last week just after the House passed the funding law he was “very angry” the lawsuit language was added to the package without his knowledge or sign off. “I think that was way out of line. I don't think that was the smart thing to do. I don't think that was the right thing to do,” Johnson said at the time. “And the House is going to reverse it. We're going to repeal that. And I'm going to expect our colleagues in the Senate to do the same thing.”The provision, which will remain in effect unless the Senate passes the new bill and Trump signs it, allows senators who had their cell phone or other data subpoenaed without their knowledge to sue the federal government for $500,000 “for each instance of a violation.” The language is retroactive until Jan. 1, 2022, and allows the eight senators who had their cell phone call logs subpoenaed as part of the FBI’s 2023 investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election to sue for millions of dollars. The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7, 2021, for Graham and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as well as Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly. All are Republicans. The law allows judges to delay notification for 60 days if the information was pulled as part of a criminal investigation and if telling the senator would endanger someone’s safety or life, lead the lawmaker to flee prosecution, result in someone tampering with or destroying evidence, lead to witness intimidation, place the investigation in jeopardy, or unduly delay the trial. A judge could keep renewing that 60-day notification delay in criminal investigations if one or several of those elements continued to exist. Both parties object House debate on the two-page bill sponsored by Georgia GOP Rep. Austin Scott was broadly bipartisan, though Democrats and Republicans expressed frustration with the lawsuit language for different reasons. Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said the ""troubling provision” in the spending law must be stricken.“These provisions are not the right path to address the true concerns over the separation of powers,” Steil said. “Remember, Congress serves the American people, not the other way around.”Steil said the FBI pulling cell phone call records for senators as part of its investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, known as Operation Arctic Frost, was an abuse of power that should be addressed. But he said allowing senators to sue for millions of dollars in taxpayer money was the wrong way to do that. “I’m committed to holding those involved accountable. No one benefited by the failures of the Biden administration,” Steil said. “However, that does not mean that elected officials should be financially benefiting from those failures now.”New York Rep. Joe Morelle, ranking Democrat on the committee, said those eight senators' cell phone logs were pulled because FBI agents believed the lawmakers “had knowledge of or even participated in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Efforts that culminated in a violent attack on this very institution.”Morelle said anyone with a basic understanding of criminal investigations knows that phone records “are among the most routine tools used” to gain a better understanding of events. “They do not reveal the content of any conversations. They simply show which numbers were called, which numbers called them and when those calls were made,” Morelle said.“If these Republican senators genuinely believe that their civil liberties were violated or if they are interested in changing the law relating to subpoenas, then they are better positioned than literally anyone on planet Earth to hold hearings, draft legislation and debate proposed changes in the open,” Morelle added. “But that’s not what this is all about. This is about ensuring the law applies to every other American, just not to them.”Scott said House Republicans voted for the spending law to end the government shutdown, not because they supported the lawsuit provision, which he called “the most self-centered, self-serving piece of language that I have ever seen in any piece of legislation.”He also rebuked Sen. Graham for saying during interviews that he plans to sue the federal government. “We have one senator, one, who maintains that this provision is good and is currently saying that he is going to sue for tens of millions of dollars,” Scott said. “I believe my side did the right thing in voting to open up the government. There are a select few people that did the wrong thing in putting language in the bill that would make themselves individually wealthy.”Bombs, cows, the Postal Service and lawsuitsGraham, who was an Air Force Judge Advocate General officer before entering politics, compared having his cell phone data pulled as part of the investigation to a case he handled earlier in his career after the Air Force “dropped a bomb on a guy's barn and killed his cow. And he was able to make a claim.”Graham also compared it to someone suing the government after being hit by a U.S. Postal Service truck, when asked by a reporter what he plans to do with the millions of dollars he will likely receive if he were to win the case. “You do whatever you want to do with the money if you've been wronged,” Graham said.  In addition to filing a lawsuit, Graham hopes to broaden the language so that organizations and private individuals can file suit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act if they feel they’ve been wronged similarly. “I will insist on a vote in the United States Senate to expand the ability of people to make claims that may have been harmed,” Graham said, adding that would likely include the Republican Attorneys General Association, the Republican National Committee and Turning Point USA.Graham rejected criticisms of the lawsuit provision from fellow GOP lawmakers, saying it doesn't represent “self-dealing.”“I understand politics, but I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about getting the right outcome,” Graham said. “I mean, if you don't want me to sue the government, that's up to you. I'm going to sue, whether you like it or not. I'm not going to put up with this anymore, and people in my spot shouldn't have to deal with this in the future.”",,,,2025-11-19 21:56:32.755507

Both measures involve the group Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts and challenged Knudsen’s decisions to reword the ballot statement on one, while declaring the other was constitutionally deficient. And both ballot initiatives are a part of a years’ long battle over the make-up and direction of Montana’s judiciary, including whether it should be partisan or nonpartisan.
Both challenges were brought simultaneously after Knudsen’s office approved Constitutional Initiative 132, but changed the description that would describe the initiatives to voters. Knudsen then said that Ballot Initiative 6 was insufficient due to a number of legal issues, including that it violated a clause of the state’s constitution.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts alleged that Knudsen had interfered unlawfully by rewriting CI-132 to bend them to his office’s political will. In Montana, ballot measures must pass through reviews by the Montana Secretary of State and the Attorney General’s Office for legal sufficiency.
  Constitutional Initiative 132 

Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts proposed a ballot measure that would amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
Knudsen’s office changed the proposed ballot statement that is meant to briefly explain the purpose to voters in a succinct manner. Knudsen’s office argued MNC failed to inform voters what “is meant by ‘nonpartisan.’”
Knudsen’s rewritten definition stated that “A nonpartisan election prohibits labeling candidates on the ballot according to the political party the candidate aligns with including labels like Independent.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, on the other hand, told the high court that Knudsen’s additional language would confuse voters and was unnecessary. Attorneys for the group claimed that voters didn’t need “nonpartisan” defined.
Most of the Supreme Court agreed that Knudsen’s office overstepped Montana law in the case, and rejected his changes.
“We will not invalidate a ballot statement simply because a better one could be written,” said the opinion written for the majority by Shea. “We disagree with the Attorney General that the statement requires a ‘working definition’ of ‘nonpartisan’ where the statutes pertaining to nonpartisan elections have never found it necessary to define the term and where Montana voters have ample experience with nonpartisan elections — the last 90 years of nonpartisan judicial elections being but one example.”
The justices were concerned that Knudsen’s that was injecting politics into a “straightforward proposition.”
“The Attorney General’s assertion that nonpartisan elections are ‘the policy position of the political branches’ uses many words to obscure a straightforward proposition. The term of art for ‘the policy position of political branches’ is ‘law.’ ‘Law’ is also a term of art that describes the provisions of constitutions,’” the opinion said. “Thus, the Attorney General’s statement that ‘petitioner is remiss to equate a legislative policy with a constitutional principle,’ might also be expressed as ‘Petitioner is remiss to equate law with law.’”
Chief Justice Cory Swanson concurred with the the majority in part and dissented in part, while Justice Jim Rice said he would have permitted the ballot description by Knudsen’s office.
  Ballot Issue 6 

In the other case, Ballot Issue 6 proposed two parts, amending Article VII of the Constitution to state that judicial elections would remain nonpartisan; and that any new court created after the amendment would consist of judges elected on a nonpartisan basis.
Knudsen declared the proposed measure did not pass legal scrutiny, based on a rule that ballot initiatives must involve a “single subject.”
That constitutional rule requires a proposal to only address or alter one subject. This prevents confusing the voters, or “logrolling” — the political practice of putting more than one item before the voters often so that a politically unpopular item can be carried because its paired with something more politically popular or palatable.
A unanimous Supreme Court said that while the two parts of Ballot Initiative 6 would seem to be about same subject — that judges in the state would remain nonpartisan — the justices said that how all judges are selected is different than whether they are partisan. It agreed with Knudsen, concluding that Ballot Issue 6 was “legally insufficient” and couldn’t be presented to voters.
The court said voters would really be making a choice on two distinct, if related, issues: “One to give voters the choice to require all judicial elections to be nonpartisan and one to give voters the choice to require that judges on any court created in the future must be elected.”
The court also said that while the proposal for future courts seems straightforward, in practice, it could lead to unresolved issues.
“BI-6 could have the effect of prohibiting the governor from appointing judges to fill vacancies on an interim basis until an election can be held. Or, it could affect the appointment of judges to oversee specialty courts,” the court said in its decision. “The question, however, is not how BI-6, if passed, should be interpreted, but whether the voters could readily understand the effect of (it).”
It also pointed out that not every “judicial office” in Montana is elected.
“Other statutorily created courts of limited jurisdiction, including the water court, workers’ compensation court, city courts and small claims courts have appointed judges,” the ruling said. “It is conceivable that voters may have differing opinions as to whether judicial elections should be nonpartisan and whether it should be required that courts created in the future have elected judges.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts were represented by Raph Graybill and Rachel Parker of the Graybill Law Firm in Great Falls, and Alex Rate of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana.
A nearly identical case appealed to the high court by another group proposing a nonpartisan judicial ballot initiative, CI-131, has yet to be ruled on. The attorney general similarly rewrote the ballot language on that initiative, brought by Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges. MNC joined MFIJ in their appeal.

This story by Alex Driehaus and Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 18, 2025.
FAIRLEE — A multi-year project to stabilize a rock ledge on Interstate 91 is expected to be completed in mid-December.
The stabilization project was scheduled to be completed by Friday of this week, but is running a few weeks behind schedule, said Bruce Martin, Vermont Agency of Transportation project manager. The $15 million project is still on budget.
“Besides a few delays, this project is going fairly well with so much that needs to be done,” Martin said.
The I-91 southbound lane between exits 15 and 16 that is nearest to the rock ledge will remain closed until the project is completed.
“We will not be shutting down the interstate entirely like we’ve had to earlier this year,” Martin said.
Workers are currently in the process of attaching wire mesh sheets to the ledge, which is 700-feet wide and is as much as 400-feet tall, Martin said.
The process of installing the steel mesh is intense and time consuming. Workers must drill holes deep into the rock ledge, then install rebar posts “20 feet — sometimes further — into the slope itself,” Martin said. Workers then fill in the holes with grout.
All that work must be done before the mesh sheets — around 40 of them — can be helicoptered in. “The steel material we’re using … it’s heavy,” Martin said, estimating that the mesh sheets are about 700 pounds each.
He noted that it is the largest rock cut in the state. “We’re trying to take care of it now so we don’t have to take care of it in the future,” Martin said. “It’s going to be stable for a very, very long time.”

Washington served up a new license plate Wednesday, honoring the state sport of pickleball.
In the works for three years, it is the second of seven specialty plates to hit the market since getting approved by lawmakers earlier this year.
“We’re thrilled to see our efforts become reality,” said Kate Van Gent, vice president of the nonprofit Seattle Metro Pickleball Association, the force behind the plate. “The goal has always been to celebrate the sport created here in Washington and enjoyed across the state.”
Pickleball is a tennis-like sport played with wooden paddles and a plastic ball. It was named the state sport under a 2022 law signed by then-Gov. Jay Inslee, in a ceremony at the Bainbridge Island home where the sport was invented in the 1960s. Today, it is one of the fastest-growing sports in the country.
Van Gent and fellow association leaders began pursuing a plate in 2023. Gathering the required 3,500 signatures on petitions was easy. Getting a law passed wasn’t. They came up short in 2023 and 2024
This year, state lawmakers included the pickleball plate in an omnibus bill pieced together and passed by overwhelming margins in each chamber. It is named “Bill’s Bill” for Sen. Bill Ramos of Issaquah, one of those leading the legislative effort, until his unexpected death a week before the session ended.
It is one of 13 specialty plates authorized in the law. Seven are getting phased in now. The timeline for the other six is tied to other factors, such as submitting signatures.
A set of pickleball plates will run $157.25, a bit more if you want to personalize them. After covering the state’s production costs, a portion of the fee will go to the sponsoring nonprofit.
Proceeds received by the association will be used for building and maintaining dedicated public pickleball courts.
In the days leading up to Wednesday’s launch, the association conducted an auction for the privilege to buy one of the first plates available. Those funds will go entirely to the association for its work to develop courts and promote the sport, Van Gent said.
Bees, a bear and a volcano
Earlier this month, the state licensing department rolled out a throwback plate design, featuring white letters and numbers on an all-black background. It had sold 177 by Nov. 4
A plate used briefly in the early 20th century had a similar design, according to the agency. Proceeds from the retro plates will go toward expanding and improving driver education.

Pollinators will star on the next new plate, though a release date isn’t set. The Washington State Beekeepers Association will use money raised for research and educational activities about honey bees. 
After that, a plate sponsored by the LeMay car museum in Tacoma is expected. Any funds generated will go toward education and job training related to automobiles. 
There is less clarity on when three other plates will become available.
A plate showcasing Mount St. Helens, Washington’s most active volcano, awaits a redesign after the first one failed testing.
The state Department of Transportation tests specialty plates to ensure they can be read by traffic cameras. Sometimes the colors or the size of the graphics can interfere. If that happens, changes are made, approved by the sponsoring organization, and the plate retested, officials said.
For two others, negotiations are taking place with the Department of Licensing and the state agencies sponsoring them.
One of those, Keep Washington Evergreen, will support the deployment of electric vehicle charging stations. Sponsored by the Department of Commerce, this plate will have green lettering on a white background similar to a design available in the 1970s. 
The other one on hold is a Smokey Bear plate, proceeds from which will be directed into wildfire prevention programs. This comes from the Department of Natural Resources, where former public lands commissioner Hilary Franz first championed it. 
Plates issued under the state’s new law will join the nearly 70 different special license plates in Washington recognizing the military, sports teams, colleges, farmers, orcas, lighthouses, square dancers and wine. Fees vary, with the money generally going to causes tied to each plate.
The 13 new plates will be the last for a while. The law, Senate Bill 5444, imposes a moratorium on the state Department of Licensing processing applications for additional plates until 2029. 
Six plates in the pipeline
Other specialty plates in the works include:

A working forests plate to support the Washington Tree Farm Program. That program helps certify small landowners who practice sustainable forestry.
A nautical northwest plate to celebrate Whidbey Island’s maritime communities. Money raised would go to Whidbey Island Maritime Heritage Foundation and Historic Whidbey. 
A donate life plate with proceeds going to LifeCenter Northwest to build awareness for organ donation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-20 01:20:34+00:00,CT Mirror,"Judge remands gas rate case to PURA, refers state attorneys to ethics committee",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/pura-marissa-gillett-rate-case-avangrid-remand/,New Britain Superior Court judge referred two attorneys representing PURA to the Statewide Grievance Committee to assess whether they misled the court.,"A judge overseeing the tumultuous legal battle between the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and two Connecticut gas companies on Wednesday agreed to allow a do-over of the companies’ most recent rate case after regulators admitted to a series of longstanding procedural errors by PURA’s former leader, Marissa Gillett.
At the same time the judge, Matthew Budzik of the New Britain Superior Court, referred two attorneys representing PURA to the Statewide Grievance Committee to determine whether they misled the court earlier this year during an effort to uncover Gillett’s personal phone records.
The decision was only a partial victory for the gas companies, Southern Connecticut Gas and Connecticut Natural Gas, which are both owned by Orange-based Avangrid. 
The lawsuit began as an appeal of PURA’s decision last year to slash the companies’ revenues by a combined $35 million, but it has since evolved to focus largely on Gillett and the actions she took while running PURA between 2019 and her resignation in October. In particular, Avangrid’s attorneys were looking into whether Gillett played any role in drafting a controversial op-ed last year accusing utilities of spreading “propaganda” — and whether she lied about her involvement.
After Gillett stepped down, PURA offered to resolve the lawsuit by reconsidering the companies’ request for a rate increase. But Avangrid sought to continue looking into allegations involving Gillett. 
During a hearing last week, Perry Rowthorn, an attorney representing the company, said, “all of these issues remain in play, and we need to get to the bottom of it.”
Budzik, the judge in the case, was more skeptical of that argument.
By sending the case back to PURA for new proceedings in the underlying rate case — this time with a new cast of commissioners recently appointed by Gov. Ned Lamont — Budzik said questions about the former chair’s alleged bias were moot.
His decision also quashed efforts by Avangrid’s attorneys to depose the two authors of the op-ed: state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, and state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex.
“The court does not have a roving commission to authorize investigations into matters that may be of interest to the parties, or to the public,” Budzik wrote in his opinion. 
In a statement Wednesday, Avangrid spokeswoman Sarah Wall Fliotsos said Budzik’s ruling was “unequivocal.”
“Under former Chair Gillett, PURA violated state law in order to achieve the outcome they wanted, one that exacted severe financial and reputational consequences for our companies, risked our customers’ experience of safe and reliable service, and harmed the public interest,” Fliotsos said. “Nor are these consequences limited to this rate case appeal alone, but they have permeated cases since 2023: it is clear from this decision that PURA must now fix them all.”
Budzik did say further investigation was warranted to look into the actions of two state attorneys involved in the case: PURA General Counsel Scott Muska and Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander. 
The judge’s concerns arose from statements those attorneys made about their efforts to recover text messages from Gillett’s phone that she exchanged with the authors of the op-ed.
A spokeswoman for PURA didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening.
Attorneys for the utilities first sought access to those texts in February, after several exchanges between Gillett and Steinberg discussing an op-ed were published by the Hartford Courant.
In their initial responses to those requests, attorneys for PURA said they could not find copies of the text messages. In an affidavit on June 6, Muska said he had asked both Gillett and her chief of staff to search their phones in an unsuccessful effort to locate copies of the text messages.
It was not until a hearing on June 23 that Hollander acknowledged to the court that Gillett had an auto-delete function on her phone rendering the sought-after texts irrecoverable.
“Moreover, and even more troubling, is that the circumstances of this case indicate that PURA actively sought to conceal the fact of the auto-delete function from opposing counsel and from the court,” Budzik said. “Attorney Hollander admitted that PURA was aware of the auto-delete function when it provided its initial discovery responses on May 1, 2025, and that someone at PURA chose to omit the fact of the auto-delete function from PURA’s initial discovery responses.”
Budzik went on to say that he had concluded Muska had intended to mislead both the court and opposing counsel in his June 6 affidavit. He added that he had no reason to believe that Hollander was personally aware of the deletion of texts, but he “ought to have made more reasonable and diligent inquiry of his client.”
In an phone interview with the Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday, Muska said that he first found out about Gillett’s auto-delete functions in mid-May, at which point he relayed his findings to Attorney General William Tong’s office. It was only after “much discussion” within that office, Muska said, that the decision was made not to reveal the auto-delete function to the court.
Asked why he did not mention his findings in his sworn affidavit, Muska said he was “tailoring” the affidavit based on cues he received from the attorney general’s office.
“The judge does not have, or does not appear to have, a full factual record of the case,” Muska said. 
A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office declined to comment on Budzik’s order Wednesday. Told later of Muska’s comments, the spokesperson, Elizabeth Benton, referred to a letter Tong sent earlier this month defending Hollander from criticisms from Senate Republicans.
“Assistant Attorney General Hollander is a dedicated public servant who has distinguished himself over many years by providing vigorous and diligent representation to his agency clients, including in many appeals where he has defended decisions by PURA to reject the utility companies’ requested rate hikes,” the letter read.
“Like many experienced attorneys, Mr. Hollander does his very best to represent his client agency in often complex and difficult matters, and he must advise his clients and represent their interests zealously, even when his clients have been accused of doing something wrong. It is highly inappropriate and unfair to hold Mr. Hollander responsible for the alleged actions of his clients, and to second guess his actions as a lawyer and an advocate.”
The Statewide Grievance Committee is a branch of the state’s judiciary established to review and adjudicate ethics complaints against attorneys. 
Steinberg, the lawmaker who was one of the authors of the op-ed, reiterated his previous assertions Wednesday that he had not discussed the op-ed with Gillett prior to its publication in the Connecticut Mirror on Dec. 19. However, he said he did not know whether she discussed it with his co-author, Needleman.
Needleman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Gillett has repeatedly denied, including under oath, they she helped to draft the piece. 
Steinberg said he was relieved by the judge’s ruling, which he said he hoped would “close this chapter” and allow PURA to return its focus on other pressing issues, such as Connecticut’s high cost of electricity and investment’s in the region’s power grid.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio House passed a bill that would require Ohio public schools to show a video produced by an anti-abortion group about fetal development to students during Wednesday’s House session. 
Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act,” would require schools to show either the ‘Baby Olivia’ video or a similar video to students every year starting in fifth grade all the way up through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year.

The bill, which now heads to the Ohio Senate, would also require showing students an ultrasound video at least three minutes long. 
All Ohio House Democrats present at Wednesday’s session voted against the bill. 
Ohio State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland, introduced the bill less than two months ago. 
There is an opt-out portion of the bill allowing parents to request in writing that their child be excused from watching the video. 
“This legislation strengthens science education in Ohio’s public schools by giving students a clear, age appropriate and factual understanding of early human development,” Miller claimed.
“The development of human life is truly beautiful. It is science. It is complex. It’s intricate, and it’s worthy of being taught.” 
The three-minute “Meet Baby Olivia” video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
Planned Parenthood notes that the video counts the embryo’s age from conception, which doctors do not do; claims a fetal heartbeat can be detected at six weeks despite there not being a heart formed and this sound actually an electrical flutter where the heart will later form; and inaccurately displays the look of the embryo, mischaracterizes its activity, and leaves out critical information about at what point it can survive outside the womb. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issues with the bill, saying the video shows gestational age two weeks earlier than stars and shows fetal development as more advanced than it is. 
A medical student and a doctor questioned the scientific accuracy of the Baby Olivia video during testimony. 
Ohio State Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, proposed an amendment that would have restricted showing the video only to high school students, but it was not added to the bill.
“It will limit it to grades 9-12, so that our students would at least have the ability and maturity to properly contextualize watching a video that was created by CGI and that is not medically accurate,” she said. 
Ohio Right to Life celebrated the House passing the bill. 
“Showing students how a baby grows in the womb isn’t and shouldn’t be controversial,” Ohio Right to Life Executive Director Carrie Snyder said. “It’s simply science.”
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio condemned the Ohio House for passing Ohio H.B. 485. 
“H.B. 485 does nothing to address Ohio’s high teen birth rate and STI rates, and instead forces school children to watch false medical information about sex education that is inappropriate at any age or grade, especially for elementary students,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio Executive Director Lauren Blauvelt said. 
Ohio is one of a handful of states without comprehensive sex education standards taught in schools.
Ohio’s curriculum stresses abstinence as a general policy and requires some instruction about sexually transmitted infections, according to the Ohio Revised Code. 
“I think the first step is establishing what through science we want to make sure we’re teaching our children,” state Rep. Phil Robinson, D-Solon, said. 
Similar bills have been introduced in more than 20 other states so far this session and Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, Tennessee, Iowa, and Indiana have enacted similar bills into law. 
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until fetal viability as determined by a patient’s physician. Ohio voters passed an amendment to the Ohio Constitution in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans who qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program received half of their benefits nearly a week late as a result of the federal government shutdown this month. Their full benefits were two weeks late, even though the state had emergency funds to prevent that.
Officials say the state never used the $5 million per week it set aside to keep people from waiting for food benefits because the state’s system had to be reconfigured to use state money rather than its usual federal funding source. SNAP is a federal food assistance program that is run by the state.
Division Director Deb Etheridge said the state is now prepared to react quickly if a similar situation arises in the future.
“We went through all the steps we needed to create an opportunity for a state-only benefit to be issued through our EBT contractor,” she said. “So in the event that anything like this happens again, we can move swiftly to issue that state-only benefit.”
Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed an emergency order declaration on Nov. 3, following a request by state legislators and similar action by other states. 
Etheridge said information technology and system operations teams had to scramble to come up with solutions, but by the time they found a way to get money to Alaskans, the federal government had begun to partially fulfill its obligations. 
She said the state was closing in on a solution when the federal government released 50% of the money for benefits on Nov. 4. She said that money was processed and ready for Alaskans to spend by Nov. 6.
Etheridge said the eligibility technicians that process benefits were not excessively burdened by the shutdown.
“Eligibility workers were doing business as usual, processing cases and managing, obviously, increased phone calls — people wanted to know where their benefits were,” she said. “The pressure came on our system operations and our IT.”
The shutdown delayed service in a state division with a history of slowdowns in recent years. The DPA has battled long backlogs in processing food benefit applications as a result of staff shortages and technology issues since 2022. The division made progress against its backlog before slipping again in 2023. Paperwork slowdowns kept thousands waiting again earlier this year.
Etheridge says the division is currently working to make sure people displaced by the October storms in Western Alaska continue to receive benefits, even if they have lost access to critical paperwork.

Former department employees said the videos, recorded in 2018, were shared widely on an encrypted WhatsApp group chat. The footage provides a deeper look into the culture of the jail, where a recent investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times revealed that guards and jail administrators routinely beat inmates.
In one video, Larry Buckhalter, stands before the camera in his prison jumpsuit and a party hat and sings “Happy Birthday” to “Barry,” an apparent reference to Barry Vaughn, the former head of the jail who is now undersheriff.
In the second video, someone off camera instructs Buckhalter to “tell him you love him.” 
“I love you, Barry!” he says, and gleefully announces it is his last day in jail. 
As he speaks, a man in uniform standing behind him slams a plastic sign to the floor. Startled, Buckhalter jumps and screams as people off camera laugh.
The videos were created days after Buckhalter had asked jail guards for a Coke in October 2018. Shortly after his request, the guards strapped him into an electrified vest, intended to keep violent inmates under control. Then they filmed him screaming and convulsing while they shocked him.  
“Now you get a Coke!” a female guard says at the end of the video. “It’s all over! I’m so proud of you, Larry!”

In an email, department attorney Jason Dare said that Buckhalter, who died in 2021, had a crack cocaine problem, but was “never found to be mentally incompetent by a court or health care professional.” 
“Larry celebrated countless birthdays and life achievements at the Rankin County Jail,” Dare wrote. “He never went hungry and was never brutalized, both of which he claimed were regular occurrences in the free world.”
Dare continued: “Although Larry could not give his side of the story for your article, these videos perfectly show his genuine affection for the RCSD. The fact you try to spin it as mockery is shameful.”
Laquanda Anderson and Derrick Shoto, Buckhalter’s niece and nephew, reviewed the videos and Dare’s response. They said their uncle lived with an obvious intellectual disability.
“Everybody knew he had a mental issue,” Anderson said. “And when people find that out, they take advantage of it.”
Buckhalter never mentioned these incidents, they said, but he told them he was afraid to return to the jail, saying that guards there called him “Crying Larry.” 
“He hated it at the jail,” Shoto said, adding that in the videos, “they’re clearly treating him like a puppet.”
Last week, Sean Tindell, commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, called the video of Buckhalter being shocked “appalling and utterly unacceptable.”
Mississippi Bureau of Investigation agents have been assigned to investigate the incident, he said.
Last week, The New York Times and Mississippi Today revealed that for years, jail officials had beaten and whipped inmates who broke jail rules or inconvenienced guards. 
More than 70 former inmates, along with former deputies and jail guards, described experiencing, witnessing or participating in the violence. Their allegations were supported by medical records, photos of injuries and department reports along with the cellphone recording of guards shocking Buckhalter.
After seeing the video of Buckhalter that accompanied the original investigation, two former deputies told reporters that additional videos of guards mocking Buckhalter had circulated over encrypted group messages. 
“They made the rounds,” said one of the two former deputies, Christian Dedmon.
Dedmon was one of five former Rankin County deputies and a local police officer — some of whom were part of a patrol shift called the “Goon Squad”— who were sentenced to federal prison last year for torturing three men. 
A 2023 investigation by Mississippi Today and The Times revealed that nearly two dozen residents experienced similar brutality from deputies during drug raids over nearly two decades.
Last year, reporters also uncovered an encrypted WhatsApp group chat where members of the Goon Squad shift traded pictures of rotting corpses and joked about rape and shocking people with Tasers.
One former Rankin deputy, who requested to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation from the department, shared the two new recordings of Buckhalter with reporters.
That former deputy, along with two former guards, said the video showing Buckhalter being shocked and the video of him singing Happy Birthday were both filmed in the office of Amanda Thompson, who was a jail lieutenant at the time and still works at the department. 
The former employees also said the third video was filmed in the office of Kristi Pennington, Sheriff Bailey’s wife, who also works at the department.

Deb Fisher in 2024.,"Dan Osborn speaking at the Omaha Education Association building while accepting the endorsement of the Nebraska State Education Association on Nov. 19, 2025. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The former labor leader running for U.S. Senate in Nebraska got endorsed by the state’s largest teachers union. 
The Nebraska State Education Association endorsed registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn in his Senate bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. 
The endorsement comes months earlier than the last time Osborn ran for Congress against GOP U.S. Sen. Deb Fisher in 2024, which happened in the run up to the general election. NSEA President Tim Royers said it was “very important” for the union to lay “a marker down early” for a candidate who cares about public education.
“It’s really become clear to us how important these federal races are … candidly, it wasn’t something that we felt in the last election cycle,” Royers said. “The biggest thing is there’s a very clear contrast in candidates in this race.”
Royers said NSEA members have shown their ability to mobilize voters in communities of varying size — pointing to ballot measures that they helped organize and can help Osborn “move the needle in a demonstrably positive way.” Osborn called the endorsement “huge.”

Osborn, a former Omaha labor leader, said he hoped local union members could knock on some doors for his campaign in the summer and help get his political message out across the state. 
He lost to Fischer by six percentage points, but his bid made him a national political name. His style of populism — focused on the working class, union organizing and kitchen table issues — has been copied by other independents seeking office in other states.
The Osborn-Ricketts race has been heated, with both spending much of the campaign criticizing one another.  That continued Wednesday, with Osborn criticizing Ricketts voting for Trump’s tax and spending bill for a provision that allowed the state to opt into a federal tax credit program for donating to scholarship-granting organizations for private K-12 schools — an idea Osborn called a “national school voucher scheme.” Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen opted into the program this year. 
“Our teachers deserve better support, better compensation and the respect that comes from doing the most important job in our society,” Osborn said. “My support for public schools means listening to the people who do the work every single day.” 
Ricketts and groups tied to the Senate GOP have spent much of the race so far trying to characterize Osborn as a Democrat. The Ricketts campaign had no immediate comment on the endorsement. The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)GOLDSBORO, N.C. — State Auditor Dave Boliek said Wednesday he wants his office and other statewide elected offices to have more input in North Carolina’s hurricane recovery efforts for the ongoing Helene rebuild and future disasters.
Boliek, a Republican, said he was recommending a “partnership” between lawmakers and all 10 elected statewide offices to revamp the state’s long-term response to natural disasters.
“I do think the entire Council of State needs to be brought in, along with legislative leadership, to assist in this,” Boliek said.
The auditor’s comments came during a press conference after his office released a report on ReBuild NC — the state’s long-embattled recovery program for eastern North Carolina established under former Gov. Roy Cooper, also known as the North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency or NCORR — that has experienced a budget deficit, untracked spending and years-long homebuilding delays.
His office detailed extensive bureaucracy errors within ReBuild NC that delayed construction, did not properly track payments to contractors and left survivors waiting in temporary housing and hotels for years. Those issues have been the subject of extensive reporting by NC Newsline and Inside Climate News.
In his recommendations and public remarks, Boliek called for broader changes to how North Carolina recovers from all disasters — changes that would involve input from his office and the rest of the Council of State, which includes five Republicans and five Democrats.
“I’m standing here as an elected official, telling you I’m willing to move this ball down the field and move it forward on behalf of the people of North Carolina,” he told reporters Wednesday. “And I have a real conviction and belief that the other members of the Council of State will step right up to the plate and join in, along with our legislative leadership.”
That could mean taking measures like establishing “key performance indicators,” or measurable metrics, to track government contractors, he said.
Boliek said he believes those changes need to start “immediately” as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina. A new, separate homebuilding program, called Renew NC, is repairing and rebuilding homes in the mountains, and will use up to $1.4 billion in federal money.
Officials leading Helene recovery efforts have repeatedly said the state has learned from mistakes made by ReBuild NC in eastern North Carolina. As of Wednesday evening, the western rebuilding effort, Renew NC, has 4,700 active applications; five homes have been completed and six others are under construction.
Lawmakers have pushed officials to speed along the process, which state officials say has been complicated by slow federal approval.
“We don’t want to stand up here eight years from now and give a similar report about how an agency failed the people of North Carolina because they didn’t have their financial house straight,” Boliek said.
Boliek did not, however, commit to a similar investigation into the Helene operation, saying it would be “unfair” to do so early on.
“We’ll give them a chance, make sure that they can get some results,” Boliek said.
The auditor’s office, which has seen a boost in funding and staffing from GOP lawmakers since Boliek’s election, has already sought to play more of a role in disaster oversight, creating an online dashboard that tracks Helene spending.
Other members of the Council of State have roles to play during disaster recovery, including agricultural aid, insurance assistance and stopping price gouging. But under the current structure of state government, the governor’s office and executive branch control much of the day-to-day recovery process.
“Since taking office in January, Gov. Stein has been committed to completing NCORR’s mission and getting people back into their homes,” a spokesperson for Stein’s office said in a statement to NC Newsline. “We are reviewing the report and will continue to work with NCORR to implement any needed improvements.”
Auditor’s report on ReBuild NC: A ‘logistical nightmare’
Boliek’s report tread on largely the same ground as prior news reporting and findings by legislators, outlining a program that he described as “a disaster from the start” and a “logistical nightmare.”
Applicants took an average of 936 days to get through just one of eight steps under the program, he said, and some families remained in temporary housing for more than 1,400 days.
Boliek focused in particular on contracts and line items for software and technology, like $25 million for a Salesforce platform that “really didn’t do the job for them,” he said. And while he believes that the state needs to continue partnering with the private sector, he said, “you can’t outsource governance.”
“We have to have management from the state level,” he said, calling for “reasonable expectations” with contractors.
During its investigation into ReBuild NC, Boliek said his office consulted with Craig Fugate, who led FEMA under the Obama administration. Fugate said ReBuild NC “spent a tremendous amount of time on process, when their job was swinging hammers.”
The head of ReBuild NC, in a letter to the auditor’s office dated Monday, said the agency had “significantly improved” its financial management and other processes, and has “actively shared lessons learned” with those leading Helene recovery efforts.
“NCORR continues to implement process improvements with regards to strengthening vendor management, local governments and construction vendors,” wrote Pryor Gibson, a longtime Cooper advisor and former Democratic lawmaker who now leads ReBuild NC.
Gibson and Boliek will both testify in front of lawmakers Thursday in Greenville, where a hurricane recovery oversight hearing is expected to focus on ReBuild NC.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4668-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 19:56:33.665005

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)One of South Dakota’s top lawmakers said Wednesday that it may be time to move beyond financial incentives and consider new regulations on agriculture to address the state’s polluted rivers and lakes.
“I think it takes more than the carrot to address this,” said State Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls.
Karr said he doubts the problem will be appropriately addressed “until we get serious about some different types of regulations.”
“And that’s pretty scary for folks, especially for those that are in the community that starts with the letter ‘A’ and ends with ‘G,’” Karr said. “We can sit here and talk about it, and dance around it all day. I think you can have some incentives, but we’re going to have to look at some restrictions as well, and regulate.”
He made the comments during a meeting of the Legislature’s Executive Board at the Capitol in Pierre.
The board had requested a report from the Legislative Research Council on surface water quality in South Dakota. Council analyst Lance Nixon presented the memo to the board. It says that over three-quarters of monitored river and stream miles in the state fail to fully support at least one of their intended uses — such as swimming, fishing or boating — with similar problems in many lakes.
80% of tested surface water in South Dakota fails to meet state standards

House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, pointed to long-running concerns such as high bacteria levels in surface water and the draining of wetlands. He said the state’s approach feels a century out of date, and he urged his colleagues to consider a more in-depth, future study on water quality.
Nixon’s memo highlights pollutants including sediment from highly erodible soils, fertilizers and chemicals from farm fields, mercury that falls from coal power plant emissions, and bacteria from livestock waste. It also flags emerging concerns about Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS, aka “forever chemicals”), the potential loss of federal environmental funding, and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it easier to drain wetlands.
Sen. Liz Larson, D-Sioux Falls, said the report proves what she has observed for years on the Big Sioux River. She cited E. coli levels above safe thresholds in the river, noting that much of the problem stems from livestock waste entering the river upstream.
“It’s been a problem for a long time, and I’ve not seen anybody interested in doing anything about it,” Larson said.
Karr referenced a bill he successfully sponsored in 2021. It allocated $3 million to help landowners contain livestock waste and plant buffer strips along streams that filter polluted runoff and reduce erosion. A recent final report on that program said it resulted in 67 buffer projects spanning 83 linear miles under 10-year contracts. The buffers prevent an estimated 1,500 pounds of phosphorus, 6,500 pounds of nitrogen and 1,000 tons of sediment from entering the Big Sioux River watershed each year.
Jay Gilbertson is the manager of the East Dakota Water Development District. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, he acknowledged the buffer program’s success but said he worries about what will happen when the contracts expire.
“I don’t know that we can sustainably keep giving out bigger carrots to the landowners who have participated,” Gilbertson said.
During the public comment section of Wednesday’s meeting, several people urged legislators to take Black Hills water issues seriously, warning that things like degraded streams and low summer flows are undermining water quality and trout fisheries. Hans Stephenson, who owns Dakota Angler and Outfitter in Rapid City, said he hopes lawmakers treat watersheds as “critical infrastructure” worth restoring.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge on Wednesday issued a preliminary injunction that blocks the enforcement of several direct democracy-related laws against Arkansas groups collecting signatures to qualify proposed ballot measures for the 2026 ballot.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and ballot question committee Save AR Democracy filed the original lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the laws against Secretary of State Cole Jester in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas in April.
Judge delays decision in lawsuit affecting Arkansas direct democracy 

U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks allowed two other ballot question committees, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, to intervene in the case in July. Both sets of plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction, and the court held a hearing on the motions in late September. 
Opponents of the laws, which govern the state’s petition and referendum process, argue they make it too difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot and violate the First Amendment. Supporters of the laws have said they help maintain the process’ integrity and avert fraud. 
In Wednesday’s 77-page ruling, Brooks granted in part and denied in part the motions for a preliminary injunction. “Because the claim against him is moot,” Brooks also dismissed Attorney General Tim Griffin who intervened as a defendant in the case. 
“We’re reviewing the order and considering our next steps,” Griffin’s spokesperson, Jeff LeMaster, said in a text message Wednesday evening. 
Brooks preliminarily enjoined, pending a final disposition on the merits, the secretary of state, who is responsible for overseeing elections, and his officers from:

Disclosing or facilitating disclosure to any member of the public any information provided by Plaintiffs or Intervenor-Plaintiffs pursuant to the Pre-Collection Disclosure Requirements of Arkansas Code § 7-9-601 
Enforcing Act 602 against Protect AR Rights, including by finding its petition insufficient based on the reading level of the petition’s ballot title 
Enforcing Act 241 and 453 against Plaintiffs, including by invalidating signatures, finding petitions insufficient, or pursuing criminal charges based on noncompliance
Enforcing Acts 218, 240, and 274 against Plaintiffs or Intervenor-Plaintiffs, including by invalidating signatures, finding petitions insufficient, or pursuing criminal charges based on noncompliance.

“In the General Assembly’s book, high rates of signature invalidation under the existing, highly regulated petition validation system are only evidence that the system has failed, not that the system has worked,” Brooks wrote. “These high rates of invalidation are used to justify more regulation, which will inevitably result in even higher rates of invalidation, justifying even more regulation and steadily chipping away at the right to direct democracy enshrined in the Arkansas Constitution.” 
Although the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee direct democracy, it does safeguard a person’s right to participate in public debate through politics, and many of the laws challenged in the lawsuit “likely infringe on this right,” Brooks wrote. 
“We’re delighted that the judge agrees with us that these laws are unconstitutional on their face,” said Bill Kopsky, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids treasurer. “We think we can prove that as the case goes on, and this gives us the ability to collect signatures without these unconstitutional laws preventing Arkansas citizens from exercising their rights.” 
Brooks’ ruling blocks new state laws, for now, that prohibit ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level; require canvassers to file a “true affidavit” certifying they complied with the Arkansas Constitution and state laws related to petition signature procurement; and require paid canvassers to be permanent residents of Arkansas.
Additional laws subject to the injunction include two that require canvassers to inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense and request a photo ID from them, and one that requires potential signers to read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them.

(Photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Holly Hugunin/U.S. Coast Guard)The recent Alaska Beacon op-ed, “Alaska’s coastal communities deserve a say in geoengineering of our oceans,” offers exactly the kind of leadership and perspective the world needs right now. Alaska’s coastal and Indigenous communities are reminding us that the ocean is not an inexhaustible resource—it’s home. 
Alaska sits squarely on the front lines of a changing ocean, where declining Arctic sea ice, increasingly frequent harmful algal blooms, and the devastation of storms like Typhoon Halong show how rapidly life defined by the sea is being reshaped. With their wealth of local knowledge, coastal Alaskan communities can offer valuable insights as to whether a method of marine carbon dioxide removal, or mCDR, which leverages natural ocean processes to remove a key greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, is feasible or futile. 
The scientific rationale for exploration of mCDR as part of a comprehensive effort to address a changing climate is clear. The ocean already absorbs about one-third of human-caused carbon dioxide and more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. Microscopic phytoplankton take up much of that carbon dioxide and produce roughly half of Earth’s oxygen through photosynthesis. They also form the foundation of marine food webs, sending large amounts of organic carbon into the deep ocean where it can remain stored for centuries.
In many regions, however, phytoplankton growth is limited by a lack of iron. That’s why scientists, including those involved in the Exploring Ocean Iron Studies group known as ExOIS, are investigating the impacts of adding small amounts of iron to stimulate blooms that might capture and sink carbon. Early experiments have hinted at promise—potentially hundreds of tons of organic carbon removed for each ton of iron added—but left critical questions unanswered about how long that carbon remains stored, and what harmful or beneficial ecological effects could follow.
Today, robotic floats, autonomous vehicles, satellites, and advanced biogeochemical models allow scientists to study these processes with unprecedented precision. We can now begin to test whether ocean-based carbon removal can work safely and durably at scale. But technology alone isn’t enough. Before carbon markets and industrial actors become more influential, we must build a three-legged stool of science, community engagement, and sustainable governance—each essential, none sufficient on its own.
That’s why the Community Leaders and mCDR, or CLaM, project is such a vital and timely step. By establishing a framework for local and Indigenous governments to participate directly in ocean-climate research, CLaM ensures that those closest to the coast have both a voice and a seat at the table. It recognizes that community input is not a procedural hurdle but the foundation of trust.
The scientific community is beginning to reflect that same ethic. Our consortium at ExOIS is advancing cautiously and transparently, guided by principles rooted in the Asilomar International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies, which emphasized openness, public oversight, and a readiness to stop if risks outweigh potential benefits. By doing so, ExOIS demonstrates that scientific rigor and social responsibility can reinforce each other rather than compete.
Together, CLaMS and ExOIS show how this field can mature responsibly–and it is growing rapidly. Commercial demand for ocean-based carbon removal is surging, with credit sales already reaching 795,000 tons in mid-2025. As ventures race toward the billion-ton scale, financial incentives will inevitably favor speed over transparency, accountability, sustainability, and community input. If global market demand outpaces sound governance, it will be too late to retrofit trust.
Fishing communities and marine scientists in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest carry a special weight. They built a globally respected model of careful marine-resource management. They are also living the reality of ocean change. Their voices—and their leadership—are urgently needed now. As ocean climate solutions come of age, the science-based guardrails and ocean management institutions of the North Pacific—deliberative bodies that include people who depend on and steward these waters—are essential guides to shape future governance of a fast-growing new ocean industry.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/jeffrey-beckham-opm-step-down-josh-wojcik/,"Gov. Ned Lamont to tap Josh Wojcik, key health policy leader in the state comptroller’s office, to lead the Office of Policy and Management.","State Office of Policy and Management Secretary Jeffrey Beckham of Tolland, a veteran fiscal policy administrator who stabilized Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget agency three years ago following a bribery and extortion scandal, will step down from the post before year’s end, according to a source.
Lamont is expected Thursday to name Josh Wojcik of Brooklyn, a key health policy leader in the state comptroller’s office, to succeed Beckham at the helm of OPM, the executive branch’s chief fiscal and policy planning agency.
A fiscal conservative, Beckham has been one of Lamont’s chief allies in defending the state budget caps that helped reverse years of deficits while eliminating a huge portion of Connecticut’s hefty pension debt.
Since Lamont took office in January 2019, Connecticut has dedicated $10 billion in surplus funds to its pensions for state workers and municipal teachers and another $3.3 billion to help build one of the largest rainy day funds in the nation.
Beckham joined the Lamont administration in April 2019 as OPM’s undersecretary for legislative affairs. 
But his career in state policy development and administration spans more than three decades and involves all three branches of government.
He served as staff counsel and director of communications in the Department of Administration from 2011 through 2019.
Beckham’s first stint at OPM ran from 2007 through 2010 under then-Gov. M. Jodi Rell, when he also served as undersecretary for legislative affairs. He also was a managing attorney at the state Department of Public Works from 2005 to 2007.
Prior to serving in the executive branch, Beckham spent 14 years as an attorney in the nonpartisan Legislative Commissioners’ Office, helping to draft legislation related to environmental, energy, commerce and fiscal issues. And he began his state service in the judicial branch as a temporary assistant clerk in superior court.
Lamont appointed Beckham as OPM secretary on March 11, 2022, shortly after the governor’s first budget director, Melissa McCaw departed to become East Hartford’s finance director.
McCaw, Connecticut’s first Black OPM secretary resigned more than three years ago shortly after news reports that the FBI had subpoenaed records of construction projects and grants overseen by her former deputy, Konstantinos Diamantis.
A federal jury last month found Diamantis guilty of using his former position overseeing Connecticut’s school construction financing program to enrich himself and his family.
The jury specifically found Diamantis, 69, guilty of 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
Wojcik is a veteran of the comptroller’s office since 2019. 
He has led the Health Policy and Benefits Services Division since 2022, overseeing benefits for more than 270,000 public sector workers, retirees, dependents and other individuals. The division manages a $2 billion health and welfare benefits budget.
Wojcik was a key figure behind several prescription drug benefit reforms and negotiations to secure major savings in pharmaceutical and other health care costs.
He also led efforts to develop Open CT, the state’s online portal to promote easy public access to fiscal data.
Wojcik, who served as a policy and budget analyst for the state Senate Democratic Caucus prior to his tenure in the comptroller’s office, holds a bachelor’s degree in international relations and a master’s of public administration from the University of Connecticut.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 19:56:33.665005
,California,2025-11-19 23:48:59+00:00,CalMatters,UC continues annual tuition hikes despite student appeals. Here’s how much it will increase,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/11/uc-tuition/,"The model regents approved allows the system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually, depending on inflation, and locks in that rate for students enrolling that year for up to six years.","In summary
The model regents approved allows the system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually, depending on inflation, and locks in that rate for students enrolling that year for up to six years. 


The University of California has renewed its policy of annual tuition hikes today after the UC Board of Regents voted 13 to 3 to approve the measure, despite fierce opposition from undergraduates.Broadly, what undergraduates will expect to pay for tuition doesn’t change once they enroll. The model regents approved still allows the system to increase undergraduate tuition and systemwide fees by as much as 5% annually, depending on inflation, and locks in that rate for students enrolling that year for up to six years.  
Each cohort of incoming students pays the same tuition, but what they pay is more than the previous year’s cohort, and less than what the next cohort will pay. This means that current undergraduate students would see no change to their tuition. Graduate students, however, would continue to see annual increases because they’re not on the cohort model.The revised plan begins in 2026-27.This “stability” plan is a way to ensure UC can collect more revenue to finance the ever-increasing costs of educating students that signals consistency and predictability to students and their families, UC officials contend. The approach is a departure from a boom-and-bust cycle at UC in which tuition stays flat for several years until recessions and state cutbacks prompt double-digit tuition spikes in consecutive years. That happened during the 2007 Great Recession. After six years, tuition had doubled.
The regents first adopted this cohort tuition model in 2021 and it took effect in 2022. Since 2021, tuition for entering undergraduates has risen from $12,570 to $14,934 this year. UC first began charging tuition in 1970 — the enrollment fees were $450.Students were livid in 2021 and remained so today.“Students should not be fighting for our lives,” said Diego Emilio Bollo, president of the undergraduate student association at UCLA. He spoke at a rally today with dozens of students opposing the tuition plan and said the UC should look elsewhere for money. “The UC should be fighting in Sacramento and in Washington, DC. And the students are not the UC’s backup budget plan.”
UC says 98% of California students with household incomes below $60,000 and who applied for financial aid don’t pay tuition, though student advocates say some undergraduates still fall through the cracks.
Regent Michael Cohen, who helped to secure more financial aid for UC students when the board voted to launch the cohort plan in 2021, said he supported the model today because tuition stays flat for individual students for up to six years after they see a tuition hike once. To him, that means students get an increasing discount, as tuition stays flat while inflation rises.Cohen added that the revenue from the tuition increases allowed the UC to enroll 15,000 more new California undergraduates. “That’s remarkable,” he said. State aid alone couldn’t have given more Californians access to the UC, he noted.
But Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis vehemently opposed the continuation of the tuition increases. She said these decisions should be reviewed at least annually, not left alone for years at a time. “Our students sleep in their cars. Our students go to food banks in order to be able to eat,” she said. “I think that any time we raise tuition, we should be going back and understanding whether or not we’ve done every other possible thing to avoid raising tuition.”The original plan proposed today would have led to endless ongoing tuition increases. But students and some regents were critical of the cohort model continuing without end, so the board voted to revisit the model in seven years.Guided by UC Office of the President officials, the board also lowered from 45% to 40% the share of new tuition revenue that flows to undergraduate financial aid. When regents installed this tuition hike plan, the return-to-aid figure was 33%.Counterintuitively, this means that low- and moderate-income students got thousands more in financial aid to cover tuition and additional living costs under these tuition increases than they would have had the UC not increased tuition. On the other hand, higher-income students, those from families with incomes above $120,000, generally paid hundreds of dollars more for their cost of attendance because they get less financial aid, median data from UC show. UC projections show that those trends will continue through the end of the decade.Still, some higher-income students receive UC grants from return-to-aid. For example, a quarter of students whose families make between $147,000 and $184,000 received a UC grant in 2023-24. Students receive financial aid based on a federal formula that takes into account household income, money in certain financial accounts and untaxed income, such as life insurance payouts and inheritances.About half of in-state undergraduate students at UC live in households with incomes below $120,000, UC data show.Funneling a portion of tuition increases to financial aid has resulted in an extra roughly $1 billion in financial aid for students, a UC finance official said today. Overall, 35% of UC undergraduates from California take out loans to attend the system and the average debt has been constant at about $17,000, said Shawn Brick, who heads financial aid, at the regents meeting. 
UC budget struggles
The drop in return-to-aid is a way to route more funding to campuses that have been rocked by federal cutbacks tied up in legal battles and state support that is less than Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature had indicated the UC would receive in past years.Already, the UC is enrolling about 4,000 more California students than the state is giving them money for. Because of this, UC reported that it brings in less money per student to educate them than the system collected four years ago — down to $28,000 from $30,000.Nearly 800 employees have been laid off across the UC system this year, UC President James B. Milliken said. “These layoffs reflect the seriousness of the financial pressures we are navigating,” he said this morning. 
UC has also fought to recover 1,600 federal research grants that the Trump administration suspended or terminated. While many have been restored through court orders, 400 are still defunded, totalling $230 million, Milliken said. Meanwhile the UC has sued to halt Trump from changing a formula for how much campuses receive in grant funds to maintain labs. At stake is another half-billion dollars. That money supports jobs and regional economies; the UC is the state’s second-largest employer.
UC officials persuaded the regents to make other technical changes that increase the odds that tuition for the next cohort would rise more than it has so far, but tuition increases would still be capped at 5%.One allows UC to defer the financial impact if inflation exceeds 5%. In that case, the percent that is above 5% would be applied to a future year when the inflation rate is lower. 
 Had this plan been in place since 2022, tuition would have risen by 1.5% more than it did this year, UC finance staff said.
The UC Regents also agreed to include another one-percentage-point increase in cohort tuition that would be dedicated to building maintenance or another campus need. Still, tuition increases wouldn’t exceed 5%. The system regularly asks for hundreds of millions in money but often gets much less. The system is able to issue bonds for new construction, but the amount is limited. 
In the original plan today, the additional revenue from this 1% bump would have been limited to structures that service students. Now, the extra 1% can be used by campus chancellors for other spending priorities. The system has a deferred maintenance backlog of $9 billion, UC officials said today.The UC student association said capital projects shouldn’t be paid for with tuition dollars. “We urge the Board to reject the proposed 1% step increase, or commit to dedicating a portion of the revenue to go to vital student supports, such as basic needs, retention programs and health services,” the group wrote in a public letter. 
Some students fall through the cracks
Even with generous financial aid, some California students at UC still incur hardship and a bureaucratic runaround. 
Joshua Mata entered UC Berkeley in 2019 intent on taking on no debt. He arranged to pay a friend $300 to use the parking spot in her apartment building to park a used van he bought  to sleep in. The friend provided him with a key to her apartment so he could bathe.He was no stranger to residing in cars — housing stability was sporadic after he moved to California to attend community college. A year into his studies, he received in-state tuition status. His story is unusual: He lived with his father in China, who taught English, until Mata graduated from high school and moved back to the U.S. to live with his grandmother for a year in Texas before driving to California.  
After three years at community college, he transferred to California’s top public university, thinking he’d retain his in-state residency status and the much lower tuition bill, with financial aid to both cover his enrollment fees and some extra money for living costs. A half-semester later, he dropped out: The campus rejected his in-state claim and froze his financial aid, leaving him with a roughly $40,000 bill, he recalled.He wishes the campus gave him more of a heads up during the summer so he could have cleared the issue before school started. “Maybe I’d have a degree by now,” he said.Though he re-enrolled in 2023, students with unique financial issues such as Mata must also be looked out for, said Alexis Zaragoza during public comments today. Zaragoza was a UC student regent when the UC board approved the cohort tuition model. While she opposed it, she led board members in increasing how much new tuition revenue flows to financial aid.
“Dozens of those students go through residency and income appeals, but those processes take months– sometimes up to 6 or 7 months, to be resolved. For low-income and even homeless students– those months are crucial. Many students drop out to avoid $30,000-plus charges, but are still charged them,” she said.Asked whether the additional revenue from tuition would flow toward more student services positions such as financial aid staff or those that deal with residency disputes, UC spokesperson Omar Rodriguez wrote in an email that “any new funding generated for operating support will be used at the discretion of each location to meet their local needs.”
A few dozen students briefly shut down the meeting on the vote today after they shouted prewritten slogans at regents condemning the ongoing tuition increases. The regents asked UC police to declare an unlawful assembly and a row of police clutching batons and wearing helmets with facial shields assembled as the students left the meeting chamber. There was no confrontation between police and protesters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111925-UC-Students-Tuition-Hike-March-MZ-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 18:57:50.630980

She said the food distribution center on Nov. 3 set a one-day record for the number of people it helped with groceries. That Monday, 180 people received food. And in that first week of November, the pantry served twice as many people as normal, she said. 
The government shutdown began Oct. 1. As it lingered, Loegering said the pantry stocked up, anticipating increased demand. She said the public also helped, with increased donations at grocery stores. 
“People were hearing the need,” Loegering said. 
Community donations accounted for 59% of the pantry’s food in 2024, according to its annual report.

Great Plains Food Bank spokesperson Darby Njos said last week the nonprofit that supports food pantries across the state expects to distribute 60% more food in November and December than normal. 
The deal to end the government shutdown included funding for SNAP and children’s nutrition programs, including school meals, and the availability of food during summer school breaks.
But there is some uncertainty about SNAP eligibility. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has said recipients will need to reapply for the program to keep receiving benefits. 
North Dakota Health and Human Services Director of Economic Assistance Michele Gee said in an email Wednesday that the agency is aware of discussions about reenrollment for SNAP participants, but there has been no confirmation or guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The state agency has information about SNAP eligibility on its website.
People can also contact the agency by email at applyforhelp@nd.gov or by phone Monday-Friday, 8 a.m to 5 p.m. Central Time at 866-614-6005 or 701-328-1000. People can also contact a local human service zone office.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Education is taking public feedback as it crafts rules for implementing several state education laws signed in 2025 — including one addressing fetal development education.
The board took several actions during its meeting Wednesday on rulemaking as directed by the Legislature earlier this year. This included beginning a period of public comments for rules on two laws signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, Senate File 175 on fetal development education, and House File 295 on community college accreditation.
Democrats had opposed both measures during the legislative session. The law on fetal development instruction was modeled after laws in other states that directly reference the “Meet Baby Olivia” video made by the anti-abortion group Live Action. Iowa’s law requires human growth and development classes for students in grades 5-12 include visuals, such as ultrasound video or computer-generated renderings or animations that depict “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The measure also includes a ban on showing materials about fetal development from entities that perform or “promote” abortions, or which contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to providers that perform or promote abortions.
Democrats and reproductive health care advocates say the law is a means to promote anti-abortion material in public schools, and could lead to the distribution of medically inaccurate information. These concerns were heightened by the ban on materials from institutions that perform or refer patients for abortion care, as the law does not exclude information from organizations that provide abortions when medically necessary or allowed under the state’s six-week abortion ban.
Thomas Mayes, general counsel for the Iowa Department of Education, introduced the proposal to amend parts of Iowa Code to implement these requirements — as well as making a clarification that the state’s ban on materials with descriptions or depictions of sex acts in K-12 schools does not conflict with the fetal development instruction requirements.
Mayes said in its current form, the rulemaking proposal is “strictly in line with the statute,” and does not contain any “elaboration” on parts of the law that could be in question.
“If there should be some elaboration, that would be have to be generated through public comment,” Mayes said. “So the proposal before you is to put this out for public comment, to allow folks to react to it — is the rule the third bowl of porridge, is it too hot, too cold or just right? And if it’s too hot or too cold, how should it be corrected, consistent with the underlying statute?”
Law limits accrediting agencies
The other law posted for intended rulemaking action was on state universities and community colleges, and accrediting bodies’ ability to take action against community colleges for following certain state laws. The measure states accreditors cannot take adverse actions against Iowa higher education institutions for following or refusing to break state law — and states that if a public higher education institute is “negatively affected by adverse action” for such a violation, the state attorney general can authorize bringing a civil action against the accrediting agency in question.
The rulemaking change would allow more accrediting agencies to sanction public higher education institutes. Under previous Iowa law and rules, the Higher Learning Commission was the only named agency able to perform this duty. The proposed change “broadens the menu of accreditors to any federally recognized accreditor that (the board) in the future may have approved,” Mayes said.
Both of the rulemaking proposals are open for public feedback before implementation. Public hearings will be held Dec. 30 at the Grimes State Office Building, in addition to having video conferences available. Public comments can also be emailed to Mayes.

Vermont law no longer allows for the death penalty, but Theodore Bland is charged under federal law, which does for certain offenses.

Federal prosecutors have formally put a former Stowe man charged in the 2023 fatal shootings of two Massachusetts men in Vermont on notice that they are seeking the death penalty against him.
The prosecutors had said during a hearing in Theodore Bland’s case last month in federal court in Burlington that they had received approval from U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi to pursue the death penalty.
On Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont formally filed their notice in court that they would be seeking Bland’s execution, if he were to be convicted of the capital crimes he is facing.

The three-page filing alleged that Bland, 30, committed each of the killings “in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse to the victim.” Charging documents also stated that Bland carried out the killings during drug trafficking crimes. 
The filing comes a little more than two years after authorities found the bodies of Jahim Solomon and Eric White in the woods of Eden, about a mile apart, on Oct 25, 2023. Both men had been shot in the head. 
The last time an execution took place in Vermont was in 1954. The state has since done away with its death penalty statute but Bland’s case was brought under federal law, which permits capital punishment for certain crimes. 
The families of Solomon, 21, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and White, 21, of Chicopee, Massachusetts, had reported them missing days earlier saying they had traveled to Vermont. 
Prosecutors in Bland’s federal case alleged that the killings occurred Oct. 12, 2023, when “Bland’s firearm discharges caused the deaths” of both men “in relation to a drug trafficking crime.” 
Attorneys Bruce Koffsky and David Sleigh, who both represent Bland, declined comment Wednesday on the latest filing by prosecutors.
Bland’s is the second case in which federal prosecutors in Vermont are seeking the death penalty against a defendant since President Donald Trump took office in January and lifted a moratorium on the death penalty in federal cases. In August, federal prosecutors in Vermont filed capital charges against 21-year-old Teresa Youngblut, formerly of Washington state, who has been charged in the shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont in January.
Both Youngblut and Bland are in custody as the cases against them are pending.

Amid the final dismantling of the state's motel program in July, 69A became a safe space for all in need of shelter and community. Now, the community space's landlord has other plans for the property.

This story by Virginia Ray was first published in The Commons on Nov. 18, 2025.
BRATTLEBORO — Come Dec. 6 when the lease runs out, the community art space on Elliot Street known as 69A will be closing. “We absolutely love our landlords, they’re amazing people,” said 69A Director Lisa Marie, about building co-owner Ashok Kumar. “Our lease is up and they have plans for this space, and the building’s for sale.”
The building at 69–71 Elliot St. went on the market in May and is listed for $1.15 million through the Southern Vermont Realty Group of West Dover. Lister records show the building has been owned by Kumar and Amrik Singh, under A&S Realty Trust, since 2008.
A caring place during a time of need
69A has certainly blossomed since artist Katie Bachler and her husband, Scott Berzofsky took out a one-year lease to make a community space.
Bachler and Berzofsky tapped into their savings to rent the space last winter in the aftermath of the national election and last year’s contentious local debate over “acceptable community conduct.” Without knowing the exact contours of how the space would actually be used, the former owners of Avenue Grocery did know they wanted to restore a community gathering place in the same spirit of the community convenience store that they briefly ran on Western Avenue in 2017 and 2018.
“We thought something was missing, a place for new ways of being to emerge, to care for each other, [to] provide something else, something emergent,” Bachler told The Commons at the time. “Like a space that could be an alternative to the behavior ordinance. Like a space to organize different ways of being, to learn from each other.”
She and Berzofsky started slow with a loose group of community members organizing events — book clubs and art shows at first — with the intention not to “over-prescribe what 69A was going to be.” Marie eventually opened the “10 to 4” program, referencing the hours 69A is open. The initiative offered two meals a day, a free store, and advocated “for people to get what they need.” 
Amid the final dismantling of the state’s motel program in July for those who were unsheltered and the already acute homelessness epidemic in the region, 69A became a safe space for all, offering free coffee, tea, water, Wi-Fi access, various gear and supplies (including tents, sleeping bags, flashlights, and clothing), restrooms, music and a social milieu.
The number of folks served varies from day to day. On Nov. 17, about 73 folks stopped in for various needs. Last week, the facility served 130 people in one day. About 50% of the people who use the facility are housed, and the other half are homeless. Ages range from infants to about 80.
The program has occasionally been controversial, with critics concerned that it was attempting to provide social services to a clientele its volunteers were not trained to treat. Others were concerned about altercations that required police help to address, and the space became a concern at several Selectboard meetings this summer.
Marie says 69A is not a shelter. “We’re not even technically a drop-in [place],” she said. “We’re just a community center” — just without the basketball hoop.
Lots to do, but where to do it?
As organizers begin the search for a new home, Marie also has eye on the present. 
“Winter’s coming and it’s really cold, and people are sleeping on pavements and benches and doing everything to survive,” Marie said. “And we’re going to do the best we can to provide what they need to make that happen.”
She is training overnight hosts for the new winter shelter, which will open at the Beloved Community Church in Brattleboro on Dec. 1. And until the group has to move, organizers will endeavor to keep regular hours weekdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
“We’re looking for a space and have had meetings with potential landlords, so we’ll see,” Marie said, adding that if a new location isn’t found before Dec. 6, she and others will do what they can to help by car and foot. “Just ’cause the doors on 69A Elliot St. are closing doesn’t mean that we’re done.”
One person has already died from the cold this winter, Marie said. “People dying because they’re homeless is an absolute crime. Whether it’s not being able to pay a bill, or having an addiction, or running from a domestic situation, none of it deserves death in the end.”
Selectboard member Isaac Evans-Frantz attends meetings at 69A and does what he can to bring concerns back to the town. “I’m deeply concerned for the well-being of the people who have found community and warmth at 69A Elliot St. over the past several months,” Evans-Frantz said. “There are hundreds of unhoused people living in Brattleboro, including many who do not have adequate, safe shelter.”
Evans-Frantz said the town as a whole can make a start by minimizing harm against unhoused community members.
“I’ve requested that the issues of no-trespass orders and removal of homeless encampments be placed on selectboard meeting agendas this fall,” he said. “At a time of federal cruelty against people living paycheck to paycheck, and against people in extreme poverty, Brattleboro must do better.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With some lawmakers again accusing the Utah Supreme Court of “legislating from the bench,” a legislative committee on Wednesday advanced a bill meant to fix a government immunity issue that its sponsor blamed on “judicial incompetence.” 
In its last committee meeting before the Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session in January, the Government Operations Interim Committee voted unanimously to endorse a draft bill being sponsored by a member of House Republican leadership, House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise. 
Snider, who has worked as a firefighter, is running the bill meant to make clear in Utah law that government employees including first responders like firefighters and paramedics have broad government immunity from lawsuits while providing emergency medical services. 
Snider said it’s been long understood that the state’s existing government immunity laws already widely protected first responders giving medical assistance — but he said the Utah Supreme Court turned that precedent on its head when earlier this year it issued a unanimous opinion in August remanding a lawsuit over a response to a 911 call, Armenta v. Unified Fire Authority, back to district court. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Snider and others supporting the bill — including attorneys for the Utah League of Cities and Towns and local fire chiefs — said that ruling now leaves paramedics, firefighters and other first responders vulnerable to “frivolous” lawsuits. 
The Utah Supreme Court, “out of some sort of unanimous malfeasance, I would say,” Snider said, found that “somehow now Unified Fire and all firefighters and all EMTs and all paramedics in the state are now liable for damages as they pursue protecting our communities.” 
“Let me be totally clear. Our Supreme Court has made our communities less safe,” Snider said. 
Having worked as a firefighter and emergency medical technician for 15 years, Snider said he and other first responders now worry that, because of the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling, they have to “operate under the assumption that even if I do everything right I am still somehow liable.” 
“Now that is in the back of the minds of every firefighter and every EMT in this state,” Snider said. 
Jared Tingey, legal director for the Utah League of Cities and Towns, said the league “fully supports” Snider’s bill. 
“We think the Supreme Court got it dead wrong and this fixes those changes,” he said. 
Armenta v. Unified Fire Authority
The court case at the center of Snider’s bill and his complaints with the Utah Supreme Court was filed by a plaintiff named Jorge Armenta against the Unified Fire Authority, Utah’s largest fire agency that serves more than a dozen cities and unincorporated areas.
Armenta sued after medical technicians with Unified Fire Authority responded to a 911 call from his wife, who called dispatchers after Armenta experienced shortness of breath and chest pain. The first responders evaluated Armenta and told him his condition appeared normal, suggesting he had experienced a panic attack and that he didn’t need to go to the emergency room. 
But a week later, Armenta was hospitalized for a “massive heart attack,” according to court documents. During surgery, doctors found a “100% blockage of Armenta’s right coronary artery,” the Utah Supreme Court opinion said, and Armenta believed that his injuries “will likely lead to heart failure and early death” unless he gets a heart transplant. 
Armenta sued Unified Fire Authority for negligence, alleging the damage to his heart would have been avoided if the authority’s medical technicians had “properly and timely diagnosed and cared for him.” 










Let me be totally clear. Our Supreme Court has made our communities less safe.


– House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise


Unified Fire asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing that Utah’s governmental immunity law protected it from being sued for giving Armenta emergency medical aid. The trial court agreed and dismissed the case. 
Armenta appealed to the Utah Supreme Court, asking it to decide whether Utah’s governmental immunity law protected Unified Fire from being sued for providing Armenta emergency medical assistance. 
In August, the Utah Supreme Court unanimously decided that the district court’s interpretation of “emergency medical assistance” was incorrect, having only looked at dictionary definitions of each word rather than looking at all of the words within the overall structure and context of the statute. 
Using a latin legal principle called “noscitur a sociis,” meaning “it is known from its associates,” the Utah Supreme Court determined that because the Legislature placed the term “emergency medical assistance” in a list with other activities like fighting fires and responding to natural disasters, the law says governments are protected when they provide “emergency medical assistance” during those types of listed emergencies. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The court also determined that the “constitutional avoidance principle” supported its conclusion, and that under that principle, the court presumed the Legislature did not intend for statutes to raise constitutional doubts. The court determined that if “emergency medical assistance” meant a response to a 911 call, that could raise questions about citizens’ access to open courts, which is a right guaranteed by the Utah Constitution. 
The court ultimately agreed with Armenta and reversed his case’s previous dismissal, remanding it back to district court for further proceedings. 
Snider and other lawmakers sitting on the Government Operations Interim Committee — including Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove — argued the Utah Supreme Court should have simply relied on the historical public record to determine the Legislature’s intent when it first passed the government immunity law decades ago. 
“Sometimes it’s not that complicated. It’s either clear in the language or it’s clear in the legislative intent, and it’s written in the legislative intent,” Brammer said. 
He argued the court did “mental gymnastics” to arrive at its conclusion. “I don’t know how they got here. It’s bizarre to me,” he said. “I’d love to ask them about it.”
Brammer — who has been critical of the state’s judiciary in the past — also said he’s concerned that “this was missed by five justices and they opined on it unanimously.” 
“That’s a big red flag on our Supreme Court,” Brammer said, “and whether they’re actually interpreting statute or just starting out with lip service and then doing what they want.” 
Another lawmaker, Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, raised concerns about what would happen without Snider’s bill and if lawmakers let the Utah Supreme Court’s interpretation stand. He worried that it could not only create a chilling effect on emergency responders in their day-to-day work, but also lead to increased costs to local governments and taxpayers. 
No Democrats sitting on the committee voiced any opposition to Snider’s bill and they all voted along with Republicans to endorse it for the 2026 legislative session, teeing it up for quicker consideration through the legislative process when lawmakers convene Jan. 20. 
Ongoing feud with the judiciary
Snider’s bill comes amid Utah lawmakers’ ongoing feud with the state’s judicial branch. It addresses another ruling multiple Republican lawmakers have disagreed with, criticizing the court’s interpretation of the law and arguing that the Utah Supreme Court’s five justices are ignoring “plain language” in Utah law or the Utah Constitution and are instead creatively misinterpreting it. 
Utah judge faces impeachment threats after ordering congressional map with 1 Democratic seat

In recent months, conservative legislators have been outraged by a series of court rulings, most recently in the state’s yearslong redistricting legal battle. Last week, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson sided with the plaintiffs in that lawsuit, rejecting a congressional map submitted by the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature and instead picking an alternative map drawn by the plaintiffs that creates a Democratic-leaning congressional district in northern Salt Lake County. 
At least one Republican legislator, Rep. Matt MacPherson, has said he plans to pursue articles of impeachment against Gibson, alleging she ignored a provision in the Utah Constitution that says that the Legislature “shall” redistrict. 
However, Gibson’s ruling was largely based on a previous, unanimous Utah Supreme Court decision last year that remanded the case back to her courtroom. That ruling made clear that the Utah Legislature’s powers have limits when it comes to altering or repealing “government reform” ballot initiatives. 
Utah’s redistricting court case largely revolves around Proposition 4, a ballot initiative narrowly passed by Utah voters in 2018, which established an independent redistricting process meant to guard against gerrymandering. 
Based on the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling, Gibson in August ruled that the Legislature overstepped when it turned Proposition 4’s independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore. 
She also ordered a “remedial” court process to pick a new map to replace the 2021 congressional map she voided as the result of an unconstitutional process. When Gibson picked one of the plaintiffs’ maps, she ruled the Utah Legislature’s preferred map failed to adhere to Proposition 4 to the greatest extent practicable. 
Utah judiciary issues rare statement addressing threats against judge in redistricting case

Since Gibson’s ruling — which legislative attorneys have said they intend to appeal back to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary — Utah’s Republican legislators and the Utah Republican Party have been accusing Gibson of “judicial activism” and violating the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches. 
Some have also questioned whether her actions could amount to “malfeasance,” which under Utah law is an impeachable offense. 
The political rhetoric has become increasingly heated. Earlier this week the Utah judiciary issued a rare statement saying Gibson has received violent threats. That statement also urged Utahns to respect existing avenues to appeal judges’ rulings and encouraged support of the institution and its public servants. 
“Utah’s courts provide a structured and transparent system for reviewing decisions and correcting potential errors, reinforcing public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process,” the judiciary said. “We encourage all Utahns to stand with the Judiciary in protecting the safety of our judges and employees and protecting the fair and impartial administration of justice.”

County commissioners passed a resolution to oppose nuclear waste storage, and in support of putting the issue to a statewide vote.
The post Energy-rich Campbell County wants nuclear, but not its radioactive waste appeared first on WyoFile .","Top officials in one of the nation’s most energy-prolific counties — home to uranium mining, oil, natural gas and the most productive coal-mining district in North America — are cautiously supportive of the nuclear energy industry’s burgeoning interest in northeast Wyoming. 
But they don’t want its radioactive waste.
The Campbell County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution Tuesday stating the body will not support storing nuclear waste locally. That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage. In anticipation that could change, the Campbell County resolution urges state lawmakers to allow “citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.” 
The five-member commission voted 4-1 in favor of the position, with Commissioner Jim Ford casting the single “no” vote. The county solicited public input on the matter for several weeks and redrafted the resolution multiple times, most recently during a Nov. 13 workshop. Commissioner Jerry Means said he proposed the resolution amid growing interest in Wyoming from nuclear energy companies, as well as often intense public debate about nuclear energy’s risks and benefits.

Opponents of the resolution, before and after Tuesday’s vote, warned it may send a signal to the industry, and to BWXT in particular, that it is not welcome in the community. While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler. He’s frequently credited for the industry’s recent interest in setting up manufacturing shops in Wyoming.
“So any resolutions against nuclear, they’re going to take very seriously,” Wandler recently told WyoFile. “They’re just going to go away and find someplace else to bring those jobs and to bring that revenue.”Wandler and other nuclear energy industry supporters note that people sometimes conflate BWXT’s plans in Campbell County with a different proposal in Natrona County. Radiant Industries, unlike BWXT, did include storing spent nuclear fuel, but the California-based company scrapped its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in October. The company cited a lack of “regulatory certainty” about whether the state would further loosen its ban on nuclear fuel waste storage — a key change in law needed to accommodate Radiant’s plan to store spent fuel from its microreactors at a campus outside the town of Bar Nunn.


Wyoming nuclear waste ban
Wyoming has flirted with the prospect of nuclear fuel waste storage for several decades and, so far, has stuck with a ban on storage — with one exception. Lawmakers passed House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.Lawmakers have considered loosening the ban further.
House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have potentially opened Wyoming’s doors to decades of nuclear waste that’s been accumulating at the nation’s nuclear power plants. That measure was rejected earlier this year along with Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” which would have accommodated Radiant’s proposal. An attempt to revive similar legislation between sessions this year was tabled.


Reached for comment after the resolution was passed, BWXT said it isn’t shying away from Campbell County.
“The resolution does not impact our proposed plans for a TRISO fuel fabrication facility in Gillette as our facility will neither create nor store high-level nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel,” BWXT Advanced Nuclear Fuels Senior Director Josh Parker told WyoFile via email.
Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming. Industry skeptics have also expressed fears that the federal government might force either an interim or permanent storage facility in a community that doesn’t want it.
“We all know laws can be changed every year,” Means said. “So this is basically getting out ahead of what I see for the future for Campbell County, because I do see people in our county, right here, [who] think that maybe we need to accept nuclear waste.”
The resolution
The commission’s 2-page resolution declared adherence to “the following guidelines regarding nuclear waste storage in Campbell County.”

No interim nuclear storage — domestically produced or relocated; 
No consolidated interim storage — domestically produced or relocated; 
No deep geological repository (caverns); 
No deep geological repository (bore hole); 
No exemptions granted for interim or consolidated storage, or geological repositories.

But what authorities or policy tools the county might use to enforce the guidelines are unclear.

According to the resolution, the commission “supports the development and siting of the nuclear industry in Campbell County, if such facilities do not produce, receive, or store nuclear waste, except what is currently permitted by Wyoming law as of the date of this resolution.” 
“We can’t override the state or the federal government,” Means told WyoFile. “It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste. It really has no [legal] backbone.” 
It also notes that “current Wyoming law does not allow for the people to vote on the specific issue of nuclear waste storage,” and resolves that “the Campbell County Board of Commissioners supports any change in state law that would allow citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”
Though several Wyoming lawmakers suspect there will be another attempt in the upcoming budget session to crack the door open wider for nuclear waste storage, it’s unclear whether there might be forthcoming legislation to allow for some kind of public referendum on the issue.

“Our resolution essentially says that, ‘Yeah, the Legislature should change the law to allow the citizens to vote on the issue,'” Commissioner Scott Clem, a former Wyoming representative, told WyoFile.
Radiant fallout
While opponents cheered Radiant’s pullout from Natrona County, the move shook many in the business community, particularly at the state level.
Gov. Mark Gordon pinned the blame on the far right of the Wyoming GOP.
“Members of the Freedom Caucus inspired ‘Club No’ convinced Radiant that Wyoming isn’t about leadership and problem solving,” Gordon said in a prepared statement in October. “‘Club No,’” he continued, “has ushered in a new culture of no matter who began or who commenced it, we’re against it. That is not the way Wyoming became the great state it is.”
Though it was not directly part of the Governor’s Business Forum agenda last week in Laramie, Radiant’s exit was a topic of discussion in the hallways and sometimes on the stage.
Many attendees “[are] mad about a certain project in the Natrona County area,” Wyoming Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell told the audience of about 500. “Why did we lose that? Because the vocal minority.”
For its part, the business council is ramping up efforts to garner support for nuclear energy development in Wyoming, according to Dorrell, both in general and for BWXT’s project in Campbell County, in particular. 
The state is putting its financial might behind the project as well. 
The Wyoming Energy Authority has recommended a $100 million state grant to support BWXT’s TRISO fuel manufacturing project. The grant, if approved by Gordon, would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024. 
The agency is accepting public comment on the grant recommendation through Nov. 25. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Legislation signed into Florida law in 2022 that changed how long juveniles can be held in pre-trial detention before adjudicatory hearings has led to a “drastic reduction” in crimes such as auto robberies, a top law enforcement official said Wednesday.
“There were kids 13, 14, 15-years-old prolifically across Florida who were out stealing cars, breaking into cars, breaking into cars taking guns, and it’s a big problem,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, speaking during the Florida Association of Counties legislative conference in Tampa. 
Previously, Gualtieri said, there were “no consequences” for misbehaving juveniles regarding such crimes, because the longest that a judge could hold them in custody was 21 days. “That’s it. The court lost jurisdiction. They could not hold a kid from the time the kid was arrested and trial was two years down the road,” he said. “Those kids didn’t care. … They got out and they just committed more robberies or more burglaries.”
That’s all changed following the passage of HB 7029 in 2022, he continued. That law allows courts to extend the detention period for juveniles in 21-day increments for serious offenses, although with the requirement that separate hearings be held to determine the need to continue those detentions.
“It was a sea change,” Gualtieri said, praising former Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Secretary Eric Hall for his work on the legislation. (Hall left the agency earlier this year to become president of Pasco-Hernando State College).
No push for a school safety package in 2026
Gualtieri, legislative committee chair for the Florida Sheriffs Association (FSA) and chair of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, said that this will likely be the first year since the Parkland school shooting in 2018 that there won’t be a push for a major school safety package when the Legislature begins its regular session in January.
“The schools in Florida today are much safer than they were in 2018,” he declared.
Gualtieri mentioned other proposals that the FSA will advocate for in the legislative session.
One would allow law enforcement officers to access a specific legal database to determine whether a citizen is disqualified from legally possessing or carrying a concealed firearm because of mental health or substance use problems as adjudicated by a court.
A second proposal would add the tranquilizer called Xylazine (also known as “tranq), a non-opioid sedative increasingly being found in the illegal drug supply and linked to overdose deaths, to the state’s trafficking statute.
A similar measure easily passed both chambers during the 2025 session but ultimately withdrawn from consideration. (In August, Attorney General James Uthemier reclassified Xylazine as a Schedule 1 controlled substance while providing an exemption for the drug for agricultural use.)
Another proposal would regard sex offenders. Florida law bans individuals convicted of certain sex offenses from residing within 1,000 feet of any school, child care facility, park, or playground. However, the law is silent on sex offenders visiting those locations. “We need to eliminate that,” Gualtieri said.
Property tax issue
The sheriff weighed in on the discussion about the potential constitutional amendment reducing or eliminating property taxes that could go before voters in November 2026.
Noting that the proposed resolutions in the Florida House include a carveout to protect law enforcement, Gualtieri said, “All that’s going to do is create a really bad sandwich with us in the middle. You [local governments] on one side, the state on the other. It’s not healthy, it’s not good.”
He expressed concerns about the flexibility of such a measure in law enforcement agencies’ budgets going forward.
“You’re going to have increased costs every year, and so what’s  going to happen with that? We’re all concerned about it.”

Castillo, in the company of his attorney, Frank Riccio, turned himself in at Troop G in Bridgeport. Castillo was released on a written promise to appear in court on Friday. 
Riccio said Wednesday that Castillo will plead not guilty and that the charges will likely be rolled into all the others that he is already facing.
Castillo is already facing more than 30 criminal charges involving abuse of the state’s absentee ballot system.
The first three complaints were related to the 2019 and 2023 Democratic primary elections in Bridgeport. 
The arrest warrant supporting the latest charge alleges that Castillo visited Angela King in her East Washington Avenue apartment, told her whom to vote for in the most recent municipal election and took her absentee ballot away with him.
King told investigators a “Spanish man” told her that he was doing “the voting thing.” She said he wrote down her name, address and phone number and told her an absentee ballot would come in the mail.
King said when the ballot came in the mail, the man returned and helped her fill out her ballot at the kitchen table. 
When investigators asked King “Did you vote for who you wanted to or did he tell you who to vote for?” she replied, “He told me,” the affidavit states.
She said the man then took her ballot and said he would mail it for her. The ballot was mailed to the city clerk’s office, according to the affidavit. 
Investigators showed King a photo of Castillo, and she identified him as the person who had come to her door, saying, “100 percent he took my ballot,” the affidavit states.
The affidavit also states Castillo appeared on video footage from inside Harborview Towers, where the woman lived, knocking on her door, in mid-October. 
Investigators weren’t as fortunate in the identification process with Anne Rodriguez, who lived in an apartment at the same address as King. 
Roidriguez told investigators that a “chubby” man asked her if she had received anything in the mail. She produced an absentee ballot, and the man told her whom to vote for, the affidavit states. She told investigators she did not know whom she voted for because she followed his instructions.
But when investigators showed her eight photos, she did not pick out Castillo’s, the affidavit states. Instead, she picked out a photo of a man who had died in April of 2020, records show. 
The new case was referred to the Chief State’s Attorney’s office by the State Elections Enforcement Commission.
SEEC has referred cases against 11 different defendants for election fraud from the 2019 and 2023 elections. All of those cases are pending except for that of Josephine Edmonds, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years suspended, with three years of probation. 
Several of the remaining defendants, including Castillo and Wanda Geter-Pataky, are due in court on Dec. 11.
Riccio said that the state’s attorney’s office has been meeting with defendants.
“The state is beginning to make offers to people,” Riccio said, adding he expects some of the people to get deal offers, but not those “in the top tier” like Geter-Pataky and Castillo.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0909_SR_BridgeportBallotHearing_041-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-19 18:57:50.630980

Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Photo courtesy of S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)A federal judge signed off Tuesday on a $34 million legal settlement between former owners of stock in South Carolina’s now-defunct SCANA Corp. and the auditing firm tasked with monitoring the utility company’s books amid the V.C. Summer nuclear expansion.
The deal, which comes more than eight years after SCANA and state-owned utility company Santee Copper abandoned the project in rural Fairfield County, holds accounting giant Deloitte & Touche LLP responsible for its failure to alert shareholders to the fraud associated with the multibillion-dollar project’s failure.
The payout is on top of a $192 million legal settlement between shareholders and Dominion Energy, the company that bought out SCANA. A judge signed off on that deal in 2020.
The total number of shareholders in line for a share of the funds is still unknown, according to Laura Posner, the court-appointed attorney from the firm Cohen Milstein who represented shareholders. She expects the number of beneficiaries to be largely the same in both cases.
Investors accused the accounting firm of shirking its duties as a gatekeeper and issuing misleading audit reports about the progress of the nuclear project, which never came to fruition.
By giving the company’s books a “clean” bill of health, Deloitte led investors to believe SCANA would complete the project in time to qualify for $1.4 billion in nuclear tax credits.
Shareholders claim Deloitte knew by November 2015, based on a report from an engineering firm hired by SCANA, that the project could not possibly have been operational by the 2021 deadline for the tax credits. The accounting firm continued to receive documents throughout 2016 and early 2017 that further warned of the project’s delay, shareholders’ attorneys claimed.
Posner also pointed to a memo from a Deloitte employee, penned after a SCANA accountant had sounded the alarm on cost overruns and delays, saying Deloitte should have done more to investigate the whistleblower’s claims.
Had Deloitte alerted investors, they “would not have purchased their SCANA shares, and certainly not at the prices they paid,” according to a statement from Cohen Milstein.
Instead, shareholders’ lawyers say their clients saw the stock price decline from $76.12 per share on July 6, 2016, to $37.39 per share as news of the fraud became public.
SC’s state utility enters negotiations on deal to restart failed nuclear project

Deloitte, in a statement last month to the Financial Times, said it “stands behind the quality of its audit work and is participating in this settlement to avoid the ongoing cost and distraction of extended litigation.”
The judge is expected to finalize the settlement at a hearing on Feb. 26, 2026. After that, it will likely be a year before each shareholder’s portion of the money shows up in their accounts.
In the meantime, Santee Cooper is in the process of working out a deal to offload the partially built reactors.
The utility company’s governing board voted unanimously to allow management to negotiate with Brookfield Asset Management, a New York investment firm with $1 trillion in assets. Talks are expected to continue through early December.
Santee Cooper has not made public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions. But the utility will use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility, CEO Jimmy Staton said last month.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-11-19 18:57:50.630980

(Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature are trying once again to establish a sandhill crane hunting season in the state and once again the issue has caused a heated debate. 
At a public hearing on a bill to establish a crane hunt Wednesday morning, Democrats and conservation groups complained that the proposal was a solution in search of a problem while hunters repeatedly insisted the only way to manage the crane population is through a hunt. 
The bill is the product of a Joint Legislative Council study committee convened last year — which spent months trying to find a compromise solution that would satisfy farmers concerned about the more than $1.5 million in crop damage the birds cause each year, hunting groups dead set on establishing a hunt and bird conservationists worried a hunt could damage a population that the state spent decades working to reestablish. 
Sandhill cranes were once gone from the Wisconsin environment, but years of careful work have reestablished the birds. However, many of the wetland habitats that originally served as the bird’s nesting sites have been replaced with farmland and the birds like to eat the corn seeds out of those fields. 
The compromise proposal barely eked through the study committee — which was divided along similar lines as Wednesday’s hearing. 
In the version of the bill under consideration now, a number of proposals meant to help farmers with the crop damage problem have been stripped out, including a program that would subsidize part of the cost for pre-treating corn seeds with a chemical that makes them unappetizing to the birds. 
Dave Considine, a retired state representative whose former district includes the Baraboo-based International Crane Foundation, said at the hearing it was a “travesty” that aid for farmers has been left out of the bill. 
“I thought we had a really decent compromise [in the study committee]. Now I come here to testify and we have given farmers no help, nothing,” Considine said. “Matter of fact, most of the science in the committee meeting, spoke of the fact that if anything [a hunt] may increase damage.”
Plus, a number of anti-hunt advocates questioned how holding a hunt in the fall is meant to deter crop damage, which largely happens in the spring before the seeds have sprouted. 
A number of pro-hunt speakers at the hearing pointed to Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which hold or are preparing to start sandhill crane hunting seasons. 
The difference, conservationists argued, is that the sandhill cranes that migrate through the eastern flyway (the region of North America of which Wisconsin is a part), use Wisconsin as their annual nesting ground. 
“Cranes are long-lived, and slow to breed one or two young annually,” said Ann Lacy, director of North American eastern flyway programs at the International Crane Foundation. “They do not have the same biology as ducks or geese; therefore, they cannot be managed similarly. They have unique biological considerations, especially in Wisconsin. What happens to these birds in Wisconsin has an effect on the Eastern Population as a whole.”
Despite all those concerns, hunting advocates refused to budge, even as several experts testified explaining the scientific reasons why a hunt won’t help the crop damage problem. For example, sandhill cranes mate for life and are extremely territorial but most of the damage in the state every year comes from single birds moving in larger flocks. If one or both members of a mated pair are killed in a hunt, that only opens up the pair’s territory to be taken over by an unruly group of unmated birds. 
“[We’ve] heard several times that hunting is not a tool that will help us against agricultural damage,” Todd Schaller, a member of the Wisconsin Waterfowl Association board said in response to the expert testimony. “I’m going to say, in my pragmatic thinking, that’s false.”
In 2021, Republicans in the Legislature proposed a similar bill to start a crane hunt. When announcing that bill, conservative rock musician Ted Nugent appeared at a press conference in which he called the birds “ribeyes in the sky.” On Wednesday, Tim Andryk of Wisconsin Ducks Unlimited argued people would be less squeamish about having a crane hunt in Wisconsin if they tasted the meat. 
“They’re just amazing when it comes to eating them,” Andryk said. “They’re a delicate, dark red meat … they’re such good eating that people that are opposed to hunting them, once they’ve eaten one, I don’t think they would be opposed to hunting.”

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) A physician assistant facing criminal charges for allegedly sexually assaulting female patients claims the state’s rationale for suspending his license is contradicted by the evidence.
Late last year, the Iowa Board of Physician Assistants issued an emergency order suspending the license of James Haag, who was practicing occupational medicine at MercyOne’s Bluebell Road Family Medicine in Cedar Falls.
In its order, the board cited Haag’s “predatory actions towards his patients (that) constitute a threat to public health.” The board alleged Haag “sexually assaulted multiple patients in his care” and that he posed “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In April, after a disciplinary hearing, the board concluded Haag’s conduct warranted a three-year suspension of his license.
Haag was also criminally charged in connection with the alleged assaults, and is currently facing two counts of third-degree sexual abuse, two counts of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, and three counts of simple assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a trial is now set for April 28, 2026.
With the criminal case still pending, Haag is seeking judicial review of the board’s decision to suspend his license. Responding to the board’s recent claims that there is “ample evidence Haag inappropriately touched four of his patients in sexual manner,” Haag’s attorney, Trent Nelson, has argued to the court that the issue isn’t what evidence the board relied upon, but whether the board’s stated findings are supported by that evidence.
Statements that the board attributed to the hearing witnesses as a basis for its decision are “inconsistent with the testimony provided under oath during hearing,” Nelson says in a brief filed with the court.
Among the alleged inconsistencies in the testimony and the board’s findings, as described by Nelson:
— Chaperone: The board found that a particular patient was not offered a chaperone, although the woman testified she was offered a chaperone.
— Gown: The board found that one patient’s gown was completely untied, although she testified it was not.
— Haag’s hand: The board found that Haag placed his hand under a patient’s gown, although she testified he had not.
— Timing: The board found that Haag moved his hands away from a patient’s groin when the chaperone entered the room, although the patient testified the chaperone did not come into the room until after the exam was over.
— Clothing: The board found that Haag put his fingers beneath one patient’s underwear, although the patient testified to the contrary.
“The Iowa Board of Physician Assistants found, in a published ruling, that Mr. Haag committed actions — alleged sexual abuse — to which the witnesses themselves testified, under oath, did not occur,” Nelson argues. “This cannot be tolerated.”
In his brief, Nelson also noted that in court filings made on behalf of the board, the state’s attorneys have alleged that Haag admitted to the police during the investigation he had no reason to think the alleged victims were working in coordination with each other, telling investigators, “I’ve got no indication that these guys are working in cahoots — because, like I said, I can’t find any connection.”
Nelson asserts the state’s lawyers have misattributed that comment to Haag when the evidence indicates it was made by a police officer.
The board has alleged that even if all of the factual discrepancies or contradictions in the case were settled in Haag’s favor, “his misconduct would still have been substantiated, and his license would still be suspended for three years.”
Board records show that as part of his work at Bluebell Road Family Medicine, Haag performed job-related physicals for individuals who worked at a local business.
The licensing board alleges that in July 2024, Haag examined four patients for purposes of their employment and in some cases “pressed his fully clothed pelvic area into the patient’s genitals or backside” and made “inappropriate contact with multiple patients’ breasts.”

(File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)South Carolina’s parole board on Wednesday approved releasing a Greenwood mother who’s spent nearly six years in prison for killing her abuser.
The 4-2 vote to parole Tiffany Janae Carroll followed a years-long effort by her family, her second grade teacher, and two GOP legislators. Backing their request, again, were the law enforcement offices that put Carroll in prison, which Rep. John McCravy said illustrates the rarity of the situation.
“If anyone ever needed to get paroled, it’s her,” said the Greenwood Republican, who noted “I’ve never advocated for anyone to get out on parole in my life except her.”
For the 38-year-old mother, the fourth time was the charm. Last year’s hearing ended one vote shy of the supermajority needed.
Her release could be days away — potentially in time to spend Thanksgiving with her five children, who range in age from 6 to 18. That’s the hope anyway, said her attorney, Rep. Travis Moore.
SC woman who killed her abuser again denied parole after nearly 5 years in prison

“She’s looking forward to seeing her kids,” said Moore, R-Roebuck, a former prosecutor who took on his first parole case for free.
Carroll and Moore again appeared before the parole board virtually from the women’s prison in Columbia.
For the fourth time, no one attended to oppose her release, McCravy said.
Technically, Carroll was granted “conditional parole.” Before she’s released, local parole officers must verify that she has a suitable home and employment lined up. Moore provided address options, including the homes of her sister, and an aunt and uncle. A catering business has offered her a job. If that falls through, McCravy told the board, he’ll hire her at his law office.
The parole board was left with no excuses, said Moore, who lives in Spartanburg County but has family in Greenwood.
Whether Carroll killed her then-partner, 27-year-old William Jamal Johnson, was never in question. She pleaded guilty but mentally ill to manslaughter in December 2019 for fatally stabbing him. But her supporters contend her 15-year sentence represented injustice, considering the abuse she endured.
Law enforcement officers responded to their home eight times between May 2016, a month before their son was born, and Johnson’s death, court records show.
Accounts vary on exactly what happened that day in September 2017, after the couple started arguing. At her first parole hearing, she told the board she was trying to leave “when he leaped out at me and hit me again.” She’s said she doesn’t remember what happened next.
What’s not disputed in the legal record is that Carroll at some point got a knife from the kitchen, cut him on the arm and ankle and stabbed him in the chest. After realizing what she’d done, she tried to save his life, applying pressure to his wounds. He died at the local hospital.
A manslaughter conviction usually requires inmates to serve at least a third of their sentence before coming up for parole. But at sentencing, then-Circuit Court Judge Verdin (now a state Supreme Court justice) permitted Carroll to be eligible after serving 25% of her 15-year sentence. That’s why she first came up for parole in 2021.
While in prison, Carroll has “availed herself to every program and opportunity to better herself,” Moore said.
That includes taking virtual classes through Claflin University, earning several work certificates, and working at the prison laundry. Her record shows no discipline problems.
Still, South Carolina’s parole board very rarely approves early release for any inmate.
People who sent letters of support again included the police chief of the department that charged her and solicitor who prosecuted her case.
“Mrs. Carroll’s case exemplifies someone who deserves another chance,” Greenwood Police Chief TJ Chaudoin wrote in a Sept. 9 letter to the parole board, echoing what he wrote last year.
Solicitor David Stumbo, who’s running for attorney general in 2026, maintains his office made the right decisions: Johnson’s death did not legally support a self-defense argument, despite the couple’s history and Carroll being a victim in the past. And the guilty-but-mentally-ill plea to manslaughter, down from the original murder charge, was “proper under the facts of the case,” he wrote in a separate letter to the board dated Sept. 9.
However, “we are confident that this incident of violence was isolated to Ms. Carroll’s particular situation at the time as a battered woman, and she is not the type of offender that would pose a danger to our community at large,” wrote the chief prosecutor for Abbeville, Greenwood, Newberry and Laurens counties.
Based on the outpouring of community support and the “unique circumstances that her case presents … I strongly support her application for parole,” he concluded in a repeat of what he wrote last year.
Asked what made the difference, McCravy gave credit to God.
“I think the Lord did. I think prayer did,” he said. “Our whole community was praying.”

David Ramba, representing the Florida Supervisors of Elections, told the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee on Wednesday that supervisors in the state want lawmakers to reinstate the checkbox on mail-in ballot envelopes, an item wiped away by a 2021 election law that requires voters to renew their vote-by-mail (VBM) ballots requests every two years instead of every four years.
As election officials told lawmakers in a similar committee meeting before the 2025 legislative session, the results from two special elections held earlier this year put in stark relief how voters are still not used to the change in law.
Referring to the Congressional District 1 election in the Panhandle, Ramba said there were 98,000 plus VBM requests on file in November 2024, when then-GOP U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz was running for re-election. After Gaetz resigned from the seat and a special primary election was held in January 2025, there were just over 12,000 VBM requests.
Ramba said the same situation took place in Florida’s Sixth Congressional District, where a special election was held earlier this year after Mike Waltz stepped down to serve as Donald Trump’s national security adviser. (He’s now U.N. ambassador.)
“It is a huge expense for our supervisors to go out and then solicit people who want to vote by mail,” Ramba said.
“When they do vote by mail, and we receive your ballot in the November ’24 general election VBM, we are confirming your personal information. We know your address. We sent you that ballot. We do not send ballots out to people who did not ask for them. We have confirmed your signature. We have counted your ballot. We believe there should be the opportunity for that valid voter to — we call it ‘check the box’ — to be able to ask to continue to be on that vote-by-mail list.”
Sen. Tina Polsky, a Democrat representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, said it’s become obvious that the law making it incumbent for voters to request a vote-by-mail ballot every two years after an election simply isn’t working.
“It’s not helping the electorate. The supervisors of elections have told us that. The numbers tell us that. All of our constituents tell us that. Every meeting I go to with constituents I end it by saying, ‘You must renew your vote-by-mail ballot,’ because people don’t know,” she said.
“And so we should — we in this committee should look at the data and say, ‘This didn’t work. This was a failed experiment.’ Let’s go back to how it was before with checking the box, because there was no fraud associated with checking the box because of the excellent list maintenance and everything that they do and all of the laws that have been implemented since that time and take a look at that.”
The request was one of just seven that the organization representing Florida’s 67 supervisors of elections made Wednesday to the committee.
Other requests included:

Exempt from public records personal information of election workers as “Critical Infrastructure Assets.”
Have the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles automatically provide the election supervisors the new numbers assigned to the voters who receive a new driver’s license or identification card (the issue stems from a 2024 law that could affect voters’ ability to vote by mail or have their signature on a petition ballot be counted).
Allow a voter now deemed “inactive” to become an “active” voter if he or she signs a ballot petition form.
Give supervisors of election the flexibility to choose different early voting location sites when the the main office is not suitable for early voting.
Eliminating the requirement to place a ballot cast in a provisional ballot envelope if polling hours are extended by the governor beyond 7 p.m. on election night.
Expand the list of offenses involving “critical infrastructure” to include the theft or tampering of election equipment and/or ballots.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A new report finds Rhode Island’s bus network is out of compliance with the state’s transparency law for quasi-public agencies, including failing to publish online reports for the last five years detailing payments to third-party contractors.
The Office of Internal Audit and Program Integrity found the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) lacked formalized project management standards in an 11-page report published Nov. 7. The report is required to happen every five years under the state law governing quasi-governmental agencies. The latest evaluation uncovered three major issues at the cash-strapped bus agency.
1. A lack of management policy and standards
The report notes auditors had planned to review that RIPTA has not formally adopted procedures for initiating and managing capital and infrastructure projects. The only manuals provided to auditors were drafts.
“This lack of standardized monitoring practices and documentation increases the risk of project delays, cost overruns, inconsistent oversight, and noncompliance with state and federal expectations for capital project management,” Andrew Manca, the state’s chief of internal audits, wrote in the report.
The report offers no comment on the drafted policies, but agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in an email Wednesday auditors found no issues with what they read.
“Our conversations with auditors have suggested that this draft policy is exactly the approach to be taken to comply with best practices,” she said.
The anticipated completion date for that formal adoption is Feb. 1, 2026, according to the audit report.
2. Inadequate project performance monitoring 
Auditors reviewed financial documents for eight capital projects and found RIPTA had incomplete files.
“Documentation was missing or incomplete, including project charters, baseline schedules, performance metrics, budget tracking reports, and evidence of ongoing performance evaluation or corrective action,” Manca wrote.
The main way RIPTA keeps track of performance of its capital projects is via a dashboard maintained through Microsoft Excel, the report notes. While this dashboard is intended to serve as a centralized tool for oversight, auditors observed that it is “highly manual in nature” and contained several data gaps. 
The report includes a response from RIPTA management stating that its project tracker spreadsheet will be updated to include “detailed logs,” along with automatically calculating performance indicators with checkboxes or completing key steps in a given project.
3. Incomplete and outdated contracting reports
RIPTA did not follow the state law requiring agencies to post online an annual report listing third-party vendors who provided at least $150,000 worth of services no later than Dec. 1. 
That included the contractor responsible for the efficiency report that was initially due to state leaders in March but wasn’t completed until Aug. 1. Documentation on the agency’s use of public money and its performance was the major reason state leaders refused to fully fund all of RIPTA’s operations in the fiscal 2026 budget. A multimillion deficit forced the agency to enact sweeping service reductions impacting 46 of its 67 routes.
At the time of the audit, the most recent report available on RIPTA’s website was from the first quarter of 2020.
“No additional reports have been made available to the public in more than five years,” Manca wrote. “As a result, information regarding high-value contracts, vendor compensation, and outsourced services has not been available for public review, limiting the transparency intended by the statute.” 
RIPTA has since added its last five years worth of contractor reports and promised to post all future ones on an annual basis, according to the report.
“This was an oversight,” Raposo Perry said, referring to the reports being absent online. She added that contracting reports have been submitted to the Secretary of State’s office on an annual basis.
Asked to comment on the overall findings of the report, Raposo Perry declined. “We cannot speak to decisions made in prior years,” she said.“However, under new leadership, we are prioritizing stronger policy frameworks to strengthen our business practices going forward.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson have yet to thoroughly review the audit report.
“But at first glance it appears that the agency is taking positive steps to remedy the project management policy and transparency compliance issues that had been identified,” they said in a joint statement to Rhode Island Current.
The legislative leaders added they will meet with RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand “in the coming weeks” to formally discuss the audit.

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)A bill regulating certain medications, which could include medication abortion drugs, was passed out of an Ohio House committee on Wednesday, on its way to a full House vote.
Though there were a several testimonies submitted opposing Ohio House Bill 324, the House Health Committee didn’t take long to approve the measure.
An amendment brought by one of the sponsors of the bill, Republican state Rep. Meredith Craig set out to clarify that the medications in the measure wouldn’t be prohibited outright, an amendment she said was encouraged by the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants.
In a previous hearing, Lora Miller, director of governmental affairs for the council, said the “extremely broad definitions” in the bill could impact access to things like blood thinners and antibiotics, causing unnecessary costs and delays in care for Ohioans.
The bill is an overarching drug regulation bill that would task the Ohio Department of Health with identifying medications that have “severe adverse effects” in more than 5% of users.
The data would be collected through insurance claims, FDA information, and reports from patients.
If a drug is determined to have severe effects in more than 5% of users, the drug would need to be prescribed through an in-person process, rather than through mail-order or telehealth means.
A follow-up appointment would also be required under the bill.

Opponents of the bill say the accessibility of some drugs, including the medication abortion drugs, could be stifled by research that was not peer-reviewed, and was self-published by special interest groups who may have biased opinions that seep into the research.
Two amendments brought by the Democratic members of the committee were swiftly tabled without explanation by committee chair Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland.
One would have required that any medical studies cited to determine severe adverse effects of drugs be peer-reviewed, evidence-based, and from a medical journal or academic institution.
Another tabled amendment would have exempted drugs that are already classified by the FDA from going through state scrutiny as well.
All testimony was accepted as written, and no one spoke in committee on Wednesday. The statements included 12 in opposition, one in support from Dayton Right to Life, and two “interested party” submissions.
Margie Christie, policy director for the Dayton anti-abortion group, specifically mentioned medication abortion drugs in her testimony supporting the bill.
She said the bill would provide “necessary safeguards” for medication abortion pills and the complications they can have.
Mifepristone and misoprostol, the common two-drug combination used for medication abortions, have been approved by the FDA for use for decades.
The safety of the drugs has been studied in research also spanning decades, showing statistically rare instances of severe complications.
This research was cited by medical professionals and academics who spoke out in opposition to the bill in a previous hearing.
The medication was the target of a different bill heard in a Wednesday hearing.
Ohio Senate Bill 309 would require medical providers to give a statement that would be signed by any patient before they are prescribed mifepristone.
The statement informs patients that they are able to bring legal action against doctors, medical facilities and others if complications arise from the use of the drug and a patient was not informed.
Bill sponsor Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, said the evolution of the FDA approvals of the drug to include less in-person requirements shows the need for more laws requiring doctors to inform patients of their rights.
In 2021, the FDA allowed the medication abortion drugs to be distributed through telehealth visits, something state legislators tried to prohibit in the state, but which is currently ongoing as a lawsuit goes forward.
While Koehler denied that the bill infringed on the right to access the medication, he said the legislation was “an opportunity for abortion pill providers to ensure their patients are properly informed and reevaluate their desire to be held legally liable in offering this drug.”
“Any drug that I take comes with warnings and information on what it can do when it’s trying to help me get better, this is a drug that’s used in a different context,” Koehler told the Senate Health Committee.
“I think people still need to know that complications can come from it.”
Medical professionals have argued the bill is unnecessary because patients are already required to hear the potential risks to any medication as part of medical training.
According to some experts, the bill may have a chilling effect on the doctor-patient relationship, and make doctors wary of prescribing the medication, therefore impacting access.
Committee member state Rep. Beth Liston, D-Columbus, asked if Koehler had any peer-reviewed evidence on the dangers of the medication, “given that you’re basically contradicting what medical providers are otherwise doing.”
Koehler said more medical research would come as the bill continues to work its way through the legislative process.

Ohio’s public schools will be required to display at least some of the documents on the list in each classroom of each school, according to Ohio Senate Bill 34.
Other documents on the list include the U.S. Constitution, the Articles of Confederation, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Northwest Ordinance, the Magna Carta, and the mottos for Ohio and the United States.
Bill sponsor state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, said in an earlier committee hearing on the bill that students would see documents that have “served as the backbone of our legal and moral traditions as a people.”
In Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate Education Committee chair Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, doubled down on that argument after the leading Democrat on the committee, Sen. Catherine Ingram, introduced an amendment to remove the Ten Commandments as one of the allowed documents in the bill.
“I personally don’t understand the reason for (removing the document), because many of our founders in fact relied on the Ten Commandments,” Brenner said, adding that there were “other influences there that were brought in using the principles of the Ten Commandments.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ingram said the text shouldn’t be included for a host of reasons, most significantly that the document is not a “founding” document, no matter its impact on the state and national founders.
“When you start talking about the founding documents, the Ten Commandments may have been, when you went to church, you went home and you did those things with your own religious beliefs,” Ingram said.
“But that is not considered a founding document, despite the fact that (John) Adams or whomever used that for their own rationale as to what their beliefs were.”
She pointed to testimony against the inclusion of the Ten Commandments that has come in the months since the measure was introduced.
Rabbi Megan Doherty, of the National Council of Jewish Women, testified against the bill in March, saying “treating this sacred scripture as just another item up on the wall in the classroom of a secular school, as S.B. 34 would, demeans and trivializes a text that is holy to many and will inevitably exclude students of minority faiths.”
Dr. Christina Collins, executive director of advocacy group Honesty for Ohio Education, submitted testimony on Tuesday, opposing the bill as well.
She said it “is not responding to any demonstrated problem.”
“While the Ten Commandments hold deep personal significance for many individuals and faith traditions, their placement in public classrooms crosses a constitutional boundary,” Collins wrote.
“Public schools must never be pressured, directly or indirectly, into religious endorsement or indoctrination.”
The bill has the support of D.C.-based evangelical non-profit The Family Research Council, The Christian Business Partnership, and the Ohio Christian Alliance, all of whom previously submitted testimony approving of the bill.
Brenner said the Ten Commandments is just one of the documents on the list, and may not be chosen by any school districts to be one of the documents displayed in classrooms.
Ingram said by including the religious text as if it were a historical document, “here again, we are doing that indoctrination that we cry so much about.”
The attempt to remove the Ten Commandments from the list was tabled along party lines in the committee, as was another effort by Ingram to amend the bill.
The other amendment would have required local school boards to have three public hearings on the selection of the documents, to allow public input before the decision is made, she said.
Brenner said local school boards can decide for themselves if they’d like public input.
“This is going to go to the local school boards anyway, they’re going to be able to determine which ones are going to be on display,” Brenner said. “It’s up to those local school boards how they want to conduct it.”
The bill will now move on for a vote of the full Ohio Senate before moving on to the Ohio House.

(Washington State Parks)Sales of Washington’s pass to access state parks and other recreation areas fell after an Oct. 1 price hike, but fee collections increased.
Figures presented to the state Parks and Recreation Commission on Wednesday show a 23% drop in the number of annual Discover Pass sales in October, compared to last year. Revenue from the passes climbed 16% year-over-year. Day pass sales and revenue slipped 2%.
The decline in annual pass sales was anticipated. Even with fewer sales, the state expects to bring in more money with this fall’s $15 price increase.
“Definitely in the annual pass, we did well for revenue,” said Laura Holmes, State Parks’ administrative services director, told the commission. “We’re right on track with projections.”
Lawmakers during this year’s legislative session approved raising the price of the annual state public lands pass to $45 from $30. Transaction fees can apply too, including a $5 charge for online sales. It was the first price increase since the pass system was established in 2011.
Discover Passes are required for motor vehicle access to state parks and other recreation sites. Combined with camping fees, revenue from the passes makes up about three-quarters of Washington State Parks’ income for the fiscal year that began July 1.
The agency predicts that Discover Pass sales will fall by an average of about 15% over the current two-year budget cycle.
Holmes noted the dip in October came after more people purchased passes in September, before prices went up.
“We were significantly over projections there,” she said, referring to September sales.
State Parks’ operating budget is about $258 million, and its construction budget is around $148 million. So far, the agency’s revenue is about $1.1 million, or 2%, ahead of expectations for this budget biennium, which runs through June 2027. 
The agency saw its operating budget trimmed by nearly $15 million as lawmakers bridged a budget gap this year. Officials said that the cuts would not result in significant reductions in services or access for visitors to state-run park and recreation sites.
Some Discover Pass revenue also goes to the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Natural Resources. But Washington State Parks receives the lion’s share. The figures in Wednesday’s report reflect overall revenue and sales for the passes, not just the portion going to State Parks.
The state park system is on track to have about 40 million annual visitors through the end of 2025, about a 1% increase over last year. State parks are separate from national parks and other federally-managed land open to recreational visitors in Washington.
Last week, State Parks announced 12 days in 2026 when visiting state recreation lands will be free, with no Discover Pass required. The first is New Year’s Day.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ParadisePoint_Campground.jpg,,,2025-11-19 17:58:21.145190

The deployment, which is expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1, marks the latest escalation in a series of rapid-fire immigration crackdowns unfolding nationwide — from Chicago to Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina — as the Trump administration moves aggressively to fulfill the president’s campaign promise of mass deportations.
In Louisiana, the operation is unfolding on the home turf of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally who has moved to align state policy with the White House’s enforcement agenda. But, as seen in other blue cities situated in Republican-led states, increased federal enforcement presence could set up a collision with officials in liberal New Orleans who have long resisted federal sweeps.
Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to run the Louisiana sweep, has become the administration’s go-to architect for large-scale immigration crackdowns — and a magnet for criticism over the tactics used in them. His selection to oversee “Swamp Sweep” signals that the administration views Louisiana as a major enforcement priority for the Trump administration.
The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the operation. “For the safety and security of law enforcement we’re not going to telegraph potential operations,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
In Chicago, Bovino drew a rare public rebuke from a federal judge who said he misled the court about the threats posed by protesters and deployed tear gas and pepper balls without justification during a chaotic confrontation downtown. His teams also oversaw aggressive arrest operations in Los Angeles and more recently in Charlotte, where Border Patrol officials have touted dozens of arrests across North Carolina this week after a surging immigration crackdown that has included federal agents scouring churches, grocery stores and apartment complexes.
Planning documents reviewed by the AP show Border Patrol teams preparing to fan out across neighborhoods and commercial hubs throughout southeast Louisiana, stretching from New Orleans through Jefferson, St. Bernard and St. Tammany parishes and as far north as Baton Rouge, with additional activity planned in southeastern Mississippi.
Agents are expected to arrive in New Orleans on Friday to begin staging equipment and vehicles before the Thanksgiving holiday, according to the people familiar with the operation. They are scheduled to return toward the end of the month, with the full sweep beginning in early December. The people familiar with the matter could not publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
To support an operation of that scale, federal officials are securing a network of staging sites: A portion of the FBI’s New Orleans field office has been designated as a command post, while a naval base five miles south of the city will store vehicles, equipment and thousands of pounds of “less lethal” munitions like tear gas and pepper balls, the people said. Homeland Security has also asked to use the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans for up to 90 days beginning this weekend, according to documents reviewed by the AP.
Once “Swamp Sweep” begins, Louisiana will become a major testing ground for the administration’s expanding deportation strategy, and a focal point in the widening rift between federal authorities intent on carrying out large-scale arrests and city officials who have long resisted them.

(Getty Images)The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission on Wednesday approved $153.9 million in loans and grants to dozens of sewerage and water systems across the state, the governor’s office announced.
The majority of the funds come from the Clean Water Revolving Loan Fund, a pot of federal money used for wastewater system improvements. Systems ranging in size from Little Rock’s Water Reclamation Authority, which serves more than 200,000 people, to a wastewater system serving 150 people in Blevins will receive a total $81.3 million in loans, according to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Arkansas approves $13 million for water projects

Nearly $55 million in loans will come out of the Clean Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund, which similarly funds drinking water system improvements.
State funding will be used for roughly $16.8 million in loans and grants, while $1.1 million in grants will be paid out by the Small, Underserved and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program.
In the announcement, Sanders touted efforts by her administration to strengthen Arkansas’ water and wastewater infrastructure using $2.7 billion in federal and state funds. Funding for the two revolving loan funds increased in recent years as a result of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.
“Everywhere you look, Arkansas’ communities are expanding and demanding more from our infrastructure,” Sanders said. “That’s why my administration is committed to providing funding for these latest projects, ensuring Arkansas’ water systems can keep up with demand so every Arkansan has clean water to drink and wastewater systems that work.”
Most of the loans from the two revolving funds come with principal forgiveness, meaning the borrower will not have to repay the loan in most instances.
A full list of the approved projects can be found on the Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s website.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Ethics Commission is considering establishing a penalty for complaints filed in bad faith.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen during a Wednesday commission meeting proposed adding the penalty as part of a larger update to the commission’s rule process.
“I’ve heard many legislators and others complain about weaponizing the system,” Sagsveen said.
If the executive director determines that a complaint was filed to “harass or impugn the reputation of the respondent” or was otherwise filed for a deceptive purpose, the director will notify the commission, according to his proposal. The commission may then order the complaint filer to demonstrate that the complaint is legitimate.
The filer may respond in writing or request a hearing in front of commission, the amendment says.
Campaign finance at heart of latest skirmish between executive branch, ND Ethics Commission

If commissioners conclude that the complaint was filed in bad faith, the amendment would permit them to hand down a penalty. The commission could fine the filer up to $500 for first offense and up to $1,000 for each additional offense. The commission could also include a “non-monetary directive” as part of the penalty, it says.
Commissioner Ron Goodman questioned how other state government agencies would respond if the commission moved forward with the proposal. He noted that executive branch officials, including the Attorney General’s Office, have openly questioned the scope of the commission’s ability to impose penalties.
“I realize there’s a risk in adopting this, but I believe that there is a positive public purpose in adopting a rule like this,” Sagsveen said.
The commission approved adding the penalty to a larger list of proposed changes to its complaint rule, but held off on adopting the changes Wednesday. The commission indicated it would take up the matter again during its December meeting.
Ethics Commissioner does not have the support to keep serving, governor argues

Also Wednesday, the commission set a special meeting for next week to consider finalizing a letter to the Attorney General’s Office responding to several comments the agency made alleging that the commission had overstepped its authority.
The commission also discussed a request for a legal opinion the Secretary of State’s Office submitted to the Attorney General’s Office seeking clarity on the Ethics Commission’s jurisdiction related to issuing advisory opinions. 
Commission Chair Cynthia Lindquist said she was disappointed that the Secretary of State’s Office did not notify the commission it was requesting the opinion.
“We’re at odds, and we should not be,” Lindquist said during Wednesday’s meeting. “I’m still trying to figure out, how do we get to the table? Well I don’t know, is there a table anymore?”
Wednesday may have been Sagveen’s last Ethics Commission meeting. 
Sagsveen’s term expired in August, but he has continued serving on the board while Gov. Kelly Armstrong and the Senate majority and minority leaders debate whether to reappoint him. The legislators support reappointing Sagsveen, but Armstrong does not.
Armstrong in a letter late Wednesday told Sagsveen he “no longer has consensus” from all three officials to serve past his expired term.

The health care apocalypse has arrived. 


In the past month, many of the 30,000 Vermonters who get their health insurance through Vermont Health Connect — part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as it’s popularly known — are experiencing sticker shock. Average health insurance premiums on Vermont Health Connect are projected to more than double, the highest rate increases countrywide.
This is a disaster foretold. Democrats in Congress have warned for months that unless pandemic-era health insurance subsidies were extended, the 24 million Americans who get their health insurance through ACA marketplaces would see astronomical price hikes. Yet, despite a 43 day government shutdown, Republicans in Congress and President Trump refused to extend subsidies. 
The price tag for inaction has just arrived.

Vermonters are now faced with excruciating choices. Middle-income participants are facing additional premiums of $10,000 per year for individuals and $32,000 for a family of four. Others are considering going without insurance all together. 
“We can’t take out a second mortgage on our house to afford one year of health insurance,” said Arica Bronz, a pilates instructor from Winooski, where she lives with her husband, a primary care physician, and their two daughters. 
Bronz’s monthly family premium will rise from $1,100 to $2,700 per month in 2026. After factoring in a $15,000 annual deductible, she said that in case of a serious medical event, her family will pay $47,000 before their insurance kicks in. 
Bronz feels she has no choice. She is going to cancel health care coverage for her family.  “We’re trying to get all the scans done and just make sure we’re tip-top healthy before we make the leap. I can’t tell you how much sleep I’ve lost considering what it’s like to jump in this day and age to no health care for a family.”
If too many people drop health care coverage, experts warn that Vermont’s struggling health care financing system could enter a death spiral. 
“I have a tremendous fear that what we are watching before us is the undoing, the dismantling of our healthcare financing system,” said Michael Fisher, Vermont’s chief health care advocate. “This is devastating and it’s self-inflicted. And the majority in Congress think it’s the right thing to do.”
Fisher nevertheless said that those whose income falls within 400% of the federal poverty level — around $130,000 for a family of four — may still qualify for subsidized health care premiums.
As Arica Bronz contemplates a future without health insurance, she said, “We don’t have a safety net. Hopefully that will inspire us to just be really thoughtful and careful. … It’s kinda terrifying.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo / New Jersey Monitor)Advocates fighting soaring hospital costs renewed their calls Wednesday for New Jersey lawmakers to pass legislation that would require price transparency, cap price hikes and bolster oversight of medical providers.
Legislators have less than two months to act on the bill, with the current legislative session set to end in January. Union leaders and other bill supporters gathered at the New Jersey League of Municipalities’ annual conference in Atlantic City to demand action.
“Hospital pricing is the fastest growing portion of the health care industry, outpacing even pharmaceuticals,” said Deborah Cornavaca of the New Jersey Education Association. “They far outpace the rate of inflation and certainly our wages. At this current trajectory, only the wealthiest will be able to afford health care in our nation. We do not accept that future.”
Under legislation introduced in February, hospitals and health care entities that ignore transparency requirements and yearly cost caps would have to follow a corrective action plan — or face civil penalties of $10 a day per bed and be barred from collecting medical debt from patients.
Advocates pointed to a settlement New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin announced last week with Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield as proof of why such accountability is overdue. The insurer will have to pay the state $100 million to resolve claims that it made false statements to win a contract managing the state’s public worker health plans and then ignored a contractual provision so it could overcharge the public plans.
“On the heels of this announcement, it is clear that we need to take action now to create a health care system in New Jersey that is affordable, transparent and accountable,” said Ana Maria Hill, New Jersey state director and vice president of the 32BJ SEIU union. “Even when the state did its best to protect consumers and establish cost-saving measures, Horizon blatantly disregarded their contractual obligation.”
Cornavaca also cited Gov. Phil Murphy’s medical debt relief initiative as evidence of a need for change. More than 780,000 New Jersey residents have had over $1.3 billion in medical debt forgiven in a partnership between the state and the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt, according to an October announcement.
Plainfield Mayor Adrian Mapp, who heads the New Jersey Urban Mayors Association, threw his support behind the bill too, saying exorbitant medical costs strain municipal budgets.
“As the mayor of Plainfield, budgeting is an important part of my job,” Mapp said. “We are putting the health care system on a budget.”
The New Jersey Hospital Association opposes the legislation and has blamed insurers for driving up medical costs.

In the press conference, the Bay City Democrat said that “we are very quickly arriving at a place where we will have two separate countries” in regards to affordability, including health care affordability. 
She criticized Republican leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives for “ignoring” health care, saying, “We are finally back in session, and there’s not a single bill on the floor for consideration or in committee for consideration that deals with this problem.”
She emphasized how this would impact Michiganders in her district, from small business owners to parents. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Most moms have had that experience where you wake up at 2:00 in the morning, with the kid with the high temperature and the croupy cough, and you’re worried, and you’re just waiting for your doctor’s office to open,” she continued. “Imagine how many people are going to drop their health insurance because they simply can’t afford it, who will know that they cannot take their child to the doctor’s office in the morning.”
Jim Milanowski, the president and CEO of the Genesee Health Plan, and Amber Bellazaire, a senior policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, both explained that if health care costs increase, people will choose to decrease their health insurance coverage or eliminate it entirely. 
“When premiums rise this dramatically, people are forced to make really hard decisions,” Bellazaire said. “Some might downgrade to plans that have sky high deductibles, and others will just go without insurance entirely.”
Milanowski noted that people going without insurance could actually increase health care costs for everyone, regardless of insurance, as uncompensated care would increase. 
Bellazaire also noted that, ahead of the hard deadline of Jan. 15 to enroll in the ACA marketplace, the question of whether or not tax credits will be extended has “created significant uncertainty for families planning their 2026 coverage.”
“Americans do not want President Trump and Republicans to take away their health care. 64% of Americans support the Affordable Care Act,” said Dianne Byrum, director of Protect Our Care Michigan. “Eight in 10 Michiganders want Medicaid left alone or even strengthened.” 
McDonald Rivet, throughout the call, urged her fellow lawmakers to take up the issue before that January deadline and to extend the tax credits to prevent the price hikes from going into effect.

Let’s Grow Kids focused efforts simultaneously on all levels of the state’s child care system for a decade, an approach CEO Aly Richards called a “full-court press” that other advocates are beginning to model. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  After a decade, Vermont’s child care ‘juggernaut’ passes the torch.","One of Vermont’s most influential advocacy groups closed its doors for the last time at the end of October — but its work will continue.
Let’s Grow Kids, an organization that pushed for and guided public funding for child care in Vermont over the past decade, was designed to shut down this year. The cornerstone achievement of the campaign — according to the organization’s leadership — was Act 76, Vermont’s 2023 landmark child care law. 
That legislation established a new 0.44% payroll tax and directed the revenue, along with annual earmarked state funds — roughly $125 million each year — toward income-based child care subsidies. Now, households earning up to 575% of the federal poverty level qualify for tuition assistance from the state, making child care free or close to it for lower-income households and more affordable for higher earners. The new funding also guarantees higher and more stable revenue for local providers.

The new influx of funding is transforming Vermont’s child care industry, both advocates and providers say. 
Jocelyn York, a teacher who has held leadership positions at several Vermont child care centers, said the law has allowed centers like hers “to be able to continue to exist.” Equally, the tuition assistance has provided “a lot more peace of mind for families,” she said, as the cost of high-quality child care continues to rise.
Since the law passed, more Vermont child care centers have opened than closed each quarter, reversing a longstanding trend in the other direction, according to the Let’s Grow Kids 2025 impact report. As over 100 new providers launched, more than 1,700 new slots have been created in the system, and thousands more kids have been enrolled in the expanded tuition subsidy program.
Nonetheless, Aly Richards, the nonprofit’s former CEO, said the work is far from over.

“We’re a catalyst for systemic policy change,” she said, adding that Act 76 merely “set the conditions for the full fix.”
As Let’s Grow Kids sunsets, aspects of its work will be taken up and extended by other early childhood education-focused organizations across the state. Building Bright Futures, the state’s independent early childhood advisory body, will continue providing data-driven evaluations and policy recommendations to the Statehouse. Vermont’s chapter of First Children’s Finance and the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children, both led by former Let’s Grow Kids staffers, will help support the state’s providers through financial and workforce challenges.
The Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, a leaner and more tightly focused nonprofit that has been supplementing the larger organization’s work since 2020, will also continue its political advocacy with a much smaller team.
The time-limited nature of the Let’s Grow Kids campaign has been essential to its success in both fundraising and advocacy, according to Richards. Her team, she said, “put ourselves out of business on deadline.”
Indeed, the organization’s model was so effective that other leaders around the state — and the country — are eyeing the Let’s Grow Kids model and record of results.
Earlier this year, a group of advocates and business leaders launched a new housing advocacy campaign called Let’s Build Homes. Among them are former Burlington mayor Miro Weinberger, who serves as executive chair, and Vermont Housing Finance Agency Executive Director Maura Collins. 
Weinberger said the branding of his organization “alluded” to that of Let’s Grow Kids. He even met with Richards and other leadership to get their blessing.
“The kind of action … inspired by the name, was appealing to us,” Weinberger said. “We do see ourselves as trying to do for housing what they did for child care, in the sense of elevating and inspiring collective action on a key Vermont issue.”
Though Let’s Build Homes is not tied to a specific closure date, part of their initial pitch cited a Vermont Housing Finance Agency report saying that Vermont needs roughly 30,000 more homes within the next five years. 
“We’re serious about that,” Weinberger said. “We think that that is achievable.”
It’s the kind of confident optimism, and willingness to take on “the single most achievable but ambitious goal,” that Richards said other states, and other political projects, might learn from Let’s Grow Kids.
A ‘full-court press’
Let’s Grow Kids began with Rick Davis, who in 2000 co-founded the organization’s precursor: the Permanent Fund for Vermont’s Children. Davis said that Buzz Schmidt — an early supporter of the movement in Vermont and founder of GuideStar International, a database tracking the effectiveness of nonprofits and charitable organizations — provided the crucial framework of a time-limited campaign.

Davis said the idea struck him as “brilliant.” With his board’s approval, he transitioned his Permanent Fund into Let’s Grow Kids, and hired Richards, then a deputy chief of staff for Gov. Peter Shumlin, to lead the campaign. 
As the nonprofit winds down, remaining assets from its various forms are being redistributed, some as grants to providers and advocacy organizations, and some in the form of a legacy fund operated by the Vermont Community Foundation.
Richards said in an interview last month that her role in the child care reform effort has been as “a believer.”  She had already been focused on early childhood education for Shumlin following a realization that the issue was “upstream” of many of the state’s most pressing issues — demographic balance, workforce development and the opioid crisis, among others. 
From the statehouse, she noticed a disconnect between lawmakers and Vermont’s network of early childhood educators. There was not a stable channel of communication between lawmakers and the troubled system they were working to fix.
“We can’t get organized if … we haven’t built trust,” she said.
Richards and her team of staff, powered by the 501(c)(3) nonprofit’s nearly $80 million in total private and public funding over the course of its lifetime, acquired a reputation for effectiveness as the years went by. Let’s Grow Kids organized public and private support for its new focus on child care, and in Richards’ words sought to “ready the system for investment,” which meant increasing Vermont’s care capacity, and connecting local providers with grants and technical assistance.
Financial records show that Let’s Grow Kids used its resources boldly, outspending its reported revenue by millions of dollars most years and dipping into considerable but dwindling assets from its frontloaded capital campaigns. At its peak, the nonprofit employed nearly 40 people.
The Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, as a financially separate 501(c)(4), could be even more politically directed in its approach, lobbying sitting officials and endorsing candidates in statewide races.

It was a simultaneous effort at all levels of the state’s child care system, Richards said — a “full-court press.” 
“Are we doing good work? That’s nice,” she recalled reflecting sardonically as the years went by. The real question, she said, was always: “Are we on track to win by 2025?” 
It was this all-out approach, according to former CEO of Bennington’s Global-Z International and fellow child care advocate Dimitri Garder, that powered the movement and made it attractive to crucial donors, particularly in the business community. Such supporters are able to make big contributions but are wary of perceived waste — planning to close down on a specific date in advance inspired confidence, he said. 
That didn’t mean the campaign was always popular in its forcefulness, Garder added — he had heard some lawmakers describe the group’s lobbying as heavy-handed.
“They were a juggernaut, you know?” he said. “Not everybody loved that.”
Noah Futterman, a spokesperson for the Action Network, said the campaign had sometimes needed to push hard for what it wanted — but that was the nature of the work.
“Effective advocacy movements need to be relentless and unapologetically focused on their mission,” he said in a text message. “Real systems-change is hard.”
‘An investment in our children’
When Act 76 finally passed in the 2023 legislative session, it did so through bipartisan support that powered an override of Gov. Phil Scott’s veto.
Let’s Grow Kids’ leadership said supporters — in the statehouse and elsewhere — came to the issue with widely varying priorities for desired outcomes of Act 76.
Studies have shown that access to high-quality child care has far-reaching beneficial impacts on a number of economic and public health metrics, including developmental outcomes for children and workforce participation, especially for mothers.
Davis said for him, the work of child care advocacy had begun with a focus on social equity for kids. But as compelling as that argument might be emotionally, he said, getting the Legislature  to approve a new source of revenue required demonstrating that an investment of this size would also create a return on investment for the state.
Garder agreed. Coming to the issue via the Vermont Business Roundtable, a body of business leaders in the state that was deeply involved with advocacy for child care, he said it was unusual for a bill involving a hike in taxes to gain such broad support among his colleagues.
Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry, one of the bill’s sponsors, was among the Republicans who supported the changes against the governor’s wishes. 
For Marcotte, who chairs the House Committee on Commerce and Economic Development, the proposal wasn’t just throwing money at the problem — studies and testimonies had forecast a relatively immediate boost for the state’s finances. The Rand Corporation, in a commissioned report, predicted that the new tax revenue would likely not cause significant hardship, but might boost the state’s gross product by up to $280 million each year.
“I think that people see it as a future investment in the economy of the state, and an investment in our children,” Marcotte said.
Richards said for her, the various justifications for progress on child care don’t need to exist in the same hierarchy for everyone.
“Tell me what you care about, and I’ll tell you why child care is your thing,” she said. “This is the right thing to do for kids.”
‘Feasible’: A new era for child care
Act 76 brought a level of investment that requires ongoing attention, Richards said. While her organization is shuttering, other players in Vermont’s child care industry will continue to advise and support the state’s implementation of new policies.
“We’ve left an ecosystem behind,” Richards said of her partner organizations. “They are in great shape.”
First Children’s Finance Vermont, directed by former Let’s Grow Kids staffer Erin Roche, will lead the business side of the effort. The newer organization, which Roche founded three years ago, offers loans and grants, financial analysis services and hiring consultations to the state’s child care providers.
Roche said workforce issues remain a major outstanding problem in the state’s child care industry — a labor shortage, relatively low wages, and scant benefits have made it difficult to keep pace with the publicly funded boom. Roche is looking to help providers navigate the workforce issue, along with former Let’s Grow Kids colleague Sharron Harrington, who runs the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children.
Futterman said the Let’s Grow Kids Action Network will be supporting the passage of S.119, a bill that seeks to implement a state-controlled process for licensing early childhood educators, among efforts to further increase child care access and affordability this legislative session.
Richards herself will stay on as an adviser and board chair for the Action Network, and several former Let’s Grow Kids staff occupy the nonprofit’s three other positions. 
It’s not surprising to Roche that ex-Let’s Grow Kids staff are in a number of such leadership positions around the state. “They invested so much in the leadership abilities of their staff,” Roche said of Richards and her team.
The emphasis on data-driven reports, and close tracking of the new legislation’s impact, will continue through Building Bright Futures, the state’s independent advisory organization for services to kids from birth through age eight.
Morgan Crossman, the nonprofit’s executive director, said her organization’s Early Childhood Data and Policy Center aims to continue bringing reports to legislators that “help them understand the impact of the law.”
“(Let’s Grow Kids’) absence will be a significant shift in the field and across the state,” Crossman said, but she is confident in the network of organizations the nonprofit is leaving behind.
Building Bright Futures released its five-year strategic plan for Vermont’s early childhood education system last month. Among its priorities are workforce development, support for parents in the workplace and ensuring quality of care.
For many providers, however, Act 76 has already been a lifeline.
Before Jocelyn York became co-executive director of Turtle Island Children’s Center in Montpelier, she worked at the Neighborhood Schoolhouse, an early childhood education center in Brattleboro. Both organizations, she said, were on a “rocky road” prior to the passage of Act 76.
The end of pandemic-era assistance for child care was abrupt, she said, and the cost of tuition was rising fast due to inflation, among other factors.
“Lots of people are struggling to pay,” she said, “and so we weren’t really sure what we could budget for every month.”
York said that throughout the uncertainty surrounding public funding and when providers could expect to see it arrive, Let’s Grow Kids was “so amazing” in its communication and attentiveness to providers. 
While gaps remain in the state’s support of the child care industry — particularly for infant and toddler care, York said — the new tuition assistance has been transformative.
“It was feasible to think about moving forward,” York said. “It’s not fixed for everyone, but it’s much better.”
Turtle Island just moved into a new space, and is licensed to enroll up to 77 kids, York said. 
York’s experience is par for the course among Vermont’s child care centers, according to advocates. Providers across the state have told VTDigger that Act 76 allowed them to open or expand their business, or stopped it from closing.
Let’s Grow Kids, and the change they pushed through, “made a huge change for the landscape of early childhood (education), particularly in Vermont, but also … creating a model for the rest of the country,” York said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)A Latino civil rights organization hoping to prevent the Trump administration from denying in-state college tuition rates to some immigrants can intervene in a lawsuit challenging a Kentucky policy, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) sought to intervene in the lawsuit on behalf of Kentucky Students for Affordable Tuition (KSAT). The group is an unincorporated association of college students who are immigrants living in Kentucky without permanent legal status who under current Kentucky policy qualify for in-state tuition. In-state tuition is much cheaper than rates charged non-Kentucky residents.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed the challenge to Kentucky’s tuition policy earlier this year, suing Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Kentucky education officials. The department argued the policy discriminates against U.S. citizens. The case is in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Kentucky. 
The DOJ and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) had reached a tentative settlement to enjoin the state policy, pending a decision on MALDEF’s request to intervene. 
“The Department is in the process of reviewing the court’s opinion and will continue efforts to ensure U.S. students are not treated like second-class citizens,” a DOJ spokesperson told the Kentucky Lantern on Wednesday. 
CPE is reviewing the order but did not have a comment on Wednesday, a CPE spokesperson said. 
In his order allowing MALDEF to intervene, U.S. District Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove wrote that the student group had asserted it was not aware that state officials “did not represent KSAT’s interests until the parties moved for entry of a consent judgment enjoining the enforcement” of the state policy. 
MALDEF’s motion had said if the Kentucky regulation is overturned, the students’ tuition could increase up to 152%. Some of the students’ rates will increase from $446 to $897 per semester credit hour. The students represented had attended or planned to attend Kentucky public colleges and universities this fall.
Kentucky Republicans have criticized Beshear for not stopping the state regulation on tuition. Earlier this year, Republican state Rep. T.J Roberts, of Burlington, filed a bill to undo the Kentucky policy. It didn’t get a committee hearing in the GOP-controlled state legislature.
The DOJ has made similar challenges in other states in recent months. After taking office this year, Republican President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing his administration to stop the enforcement of state policies that allow in-state tuition for immigrants who lack permanent legal status.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3826-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-19 17:58:21.145190

He said the ACLU has been able to reach about one-third of the group members and they wish to pursue their claims either back in the U.S. or through a virtual hearing. “They are still very, very traumatized about what happened,” Gelernt said, adding that many fear being returned to CECOT if they come back to the U.S.Remote hearings?Davis argued that if the men want to continue with their habeas claim, then they would have to be detained in the U.S., rather than make the challenge virtually. “To fulfill a habeas, they have to be in our custody one way or another,” Davis said. He said they would likely be taken to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but said that was not definite. Gelernt said the federal government should provide a plan in order for the men to make their due process claim.  “Some may want to know if there is a remote option, if they found a sufficiently safe hiding place within Venezuela,” Gelernt said.Boasberg agreed, and said the U.S. Supreme Court also agreed when it ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of the wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia as part of a due process case. Abrego Garcia was also taken to CECOT and detailed the physical and psychological torture he experienced there.",,,,2025-11-19 17:58:21.145190

The Cabell-Huntington Health Department will stop distributing syringes as a part of its harm reduction program on Dec. 16. The halt in services will be the latest in a years-long string of syringe program closures across West Virginia due to politics and policy changes.
Dr. Michael Kilkenny, chief executive officer and health officer of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department
Dr. Michael Kilkenny, health officer and chief executive officer of the health department, said the closure was due to “several forces,” most recently an executive order from the Trump administration and waning support of philanthropists.
The Cabell-Huntington Health Department started offering syringe services in September of 2015 in an effort to address disease spread as the heroin epidemic raged. It was the first of its kind in the state. 
The health department’s harm reduction program — which includes the syringe distribution — gets federal funding through a grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The health department has not used federal, state or local funding to purchase syringes, Kilkenny said. For syringes, the program depended on donations. 
“The philanthropists are not willing to invest money in an effort that has such apparent political volatility,” Kilkenny said. “So rather than use their money to purchase syringes for something that could be closed at any minute, they are not offering us any support for syringes, so we can’t buy syringes.”
Trump issued the “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” executive order on July 24. The executive order directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to prevent discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration not to fund harm reduction programs or safe consumption sites, which the order says are “[efforts] that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.”
Trump’s executive order comes after years of fights over science and against stigma when it comes to confronting drug addiction in West Virginia. Since 2018, lawmakers both locally and statewide have imposed restrictions on syringe programs that health officials say only harm the people who need them most.
Syringe services programs offer people who use injection drugs sterile syringes, as well as safe disposal of syringes and screening and care for other diseases. According to the CDC, the programs play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections. They also are shown to reduce needle litter in communities and increase the likelihood of someone who uses drugs entering a recovery program.
Last year, according to information provided to West Virginia Watch, the Cabell-Huntington Health Department distributed more than 363,500 clean syringes to people in the region. That was more than 45% of all clean syringes distributed in the state and the highest distribution rate of any syringe service program operating.
Several years ago, an HIV cluster tied to drug use hit Cabell County hard. Kilkenny said rapid expansion of that outbreak was controlled within a year largely because of the syringe service program.
“We have much fewer cases than we did in 2019, 2020, but we still have ongoing transmission, and yes, [an uptick is] a deep concern of ours, as far as taking this tool away from the response and trying to then bolster the response in every other way that we can,” Kilkenny said. 
As of Nov. 2, Cabell County reports 16 new HIV diagnoses in 2025, with 12 of those tied to IV drug use. That’s higher than the 14 total cases reported last year, according to the state Office of Epidemiology and Prevention Services.
In recent years, health experts have repeatedly urged caution when looking at the state’s HIV numbers. They question how adequate the state’s testing infrastructure is and what efforts are being made to ensure high-risk populations in particular are being surveyed.
Kilkenny said most of the program’s clients have been “generally disappointed” when they’re told of the closure, but they’re also aware of the political reality. 
“They are not necessarily surprised, but disappointed,” Kilkenny said. “We’ve tried to maintain the highest level of prevention that we could sustain, and it looks like we’re going to lose this tool.”
Kilkenny said the health department will continue to offer other harm reduction services, including distributing naloxone and testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infections and referral to treatment. 
“We are going to continue, and we’ve always had a very strong presence of linkage to care, so that if someone wants to stop using drugs, we can get them into a program immediately” he said. “So we’re going to continue offering support towards recovery.”
He said the health department is looking to enhance its clinical services so that more HIV cases are virally suppressed in order to prevent transmission of the disease. 
“We’re going to continue to work very diligently. We’re going to use every tool we can use to prevent infection,” Kilkenny said. “One of the ways to do that is to make people aware of their infection and then get them treated to where they’re not infectious. That’s a good thing about HIV, in particular. When you’re adequately treated, you don’t infect other people.”
Kilkenny said health officials are disappointed the program will close, but the department has to adapt to shifting policies. 
“We have to be as effective as we can be, using everything we’ve got available,” he said. “So we’re going to keep on serving these clients. We’re going to keep on helping people, and we’re going to hope for the best.”

They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded.,"Plant life of an inland wetland in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)The Environmental Protection Agency wants to take away federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands in Louisiana and the rest of the country, allowing them to be polluted or developed without the need for permits under a new set of proposed regulations the agency unveiled Monday. 
The EPA’s long-awaited proposed rules would change what counts as federally protected waters in the United States. They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded. 
The draft regulations cover what are called the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS. They include new definitions for what counts as a wetland that falls under the protection of the Clean Water Act.
In short, the proposed updates require wetlands to touch permanent bodies of water — such as lakes, rivers or streams — and have visible surface water for at least part of the year in order for federal safeguards to apply.
Most at risk in Louisiana are the non-coastal, inland swamps that make up about 59% of the state’s wetlands area, according to an analysis from the Environmental Law Institute. 
Environmental advocates argue the rules would put important ecosystems, flood control measures and pollution management at risk, while legal experts worry the definitions will only add more confusion to an already complex topic.  
The public will have 45 days to submit a comment on the proposed WOTUS rules once they are officially published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The EPA will then consider whether any comment warrants revisions in the proposed regulations, which would be incorporated into the final version. The Trump administration has not laid out a timeline for putting the new rules into effect.
“I think it’s a big alarm for pretty much wherever you are, that federal oversight over wetlands is drastically limited, and there is not a backup plan to deal with this,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy. 
“It’s going to create a lot of … problems for states and local communities going forward who have relied on federal oversight and the mitigation for wetlands and development,” she added. “There will be confusion.”
The removal of certain federal wetlands protections follows the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA, which pared back federal authority to enforce the Clean Water Act. An Idaho couple successfully challenged the agency when it stopped them from developing their property, with justices interpreting the definition of Waters of the United States to mean “’only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing.”
The proposed rule raises questions in Louisiana as to whether future construction could disqualify even more wetlands from Clean Water Act protection, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a Louisiana-based environmental advocacy group.   
Central to whether or not a wetland is protected is whether or not it touches a lake, river or bayou on which a boat can navigate. 
“In Louisiana, that can get a little squishy,” Rota said.
The Louisiana Legislature passed a law earlier this year that defines wetlands separated from surface water connections by manmade levees as “fastlands,” excluding them from state protections. With the newly proposed federal WOTUS definitions following the same deregulatory lines as Louisiana, certain wetlands here would no longer have any safeguards against development, advocates say. 
Plus, Louisiana now allows future construction of levees and berms to disqualify wetlands from state protection. Even if an area has coverage under the law today, it could lose it if a levee is built around it in the future, Rota said. 
State Sen.“Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, who authored the legislation, said this is an area in which revisions to the proposed WOTUS rule are necessary. 
“In public comment, they can go through all of those and get some good answers for stuff like that,” said Fesi. “I don’t want to go fill up a swamp that’s full of cypress trees.”
Fesi added that he is “excited” about the proposed rules and believes current building codes are adequate to address concerns over building in flood-prone areas. 
“I think there’s been a lot of rules put in place that protects against some of the problems” with flooding, he said. “Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.”
Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development. For example, any area that touches the navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico falls under the Clean Water Act, and the state’s coastal zone construction restrictions protect other areas.
More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act. These areas would need to meet the federal definition of having surface water at least during the wet season as well as continually touch a waterway like a lake, river, stream or bayou. 
“Hopefully this will not have a huge impact on coastal restoration activities and protecting our coastal wetlands,” Rota said. “But our coastal wetlands are only as healthy as our internal wetlands and internal waterways that are feeding them.”
“Whenever you remove some of these more upland wetlands or ephemeral streams that supply either fresh water, nutrients … it could still have an impact,” he added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9859-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services paid over $900,000 in fines as a result of noncompliance with a competency restoration consent decree. 
Under the federal consent decree, the agency is subject to fines based on their ability to reduce the waitlist for competency restoration services on a set timeline. 
The fines began accruing Oct. 1, and the agency paid $928,400 on Nov. 10 with funds appropriated by the Legislature for this purpose, said Maria Chaverri, an agency spokesperson. 
The consent decree settled a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Mental Health Department violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. The Legislature approved the settlement in March. 
It’s expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services on a set timeline, as required. 
“Much of our foundational work has focused on training and centralizing data, crucial to untangling a complex system and preparing for improvements,” Chaverri said in a statement. “This will be a long process, and we’re committed to completing it.”
The fines are based on the number of people on the waitlist and how long individuals have been awaiting mental health services. 
Seven months after the settlement’s approval, the Mental Health Department was supposed to reduce the wait time to 60 days. As of Oct. 22, the average wait time for admissions to Oklahoma Forensic Center was reduced from 214 days to 79 days, an agency spokesperson said.
After 16 months, the agency is required to reduce the waitlist to 21 days, according to the consent decree. The settlement includes other benchmarks between seven and 16 months. 
The daily fines range from $100 to $500 per individual on the waitlist, depending on how long the person has spent awaiting services beyond the “maximum allowable” wait time, according to the consent decree. 
The lowest tier fine costs the Mental Health Department $100 per day for each individual on the waitlist for one to seven days longer than allowed. The fine can reach $500 per day per individual that waits more than 60 days beyond the allowed wait time. 
Court-appointed consultants previously released reports in June and September that found that while the Mental Health Department has made changes to improve services and comply, but hasn’t done enough to meet the required benchmarks of the settlement. 
Plaintiffs had sought additional, separate monetary sanctions against the Mental Health Department for noncompliance following these reports, but a judge declined to issue an order doing so. 
The state agency requested $17 million from the Legislature for the upcoming fiscal year to implement a court agreement to fix the state’s competency restoration system and to cover any related fines for noncompliance.

(iStock /Getty Images Plus)The House continues to fast track legislation to expand the class of people who can file wrongful death lawsuits against physicians and hospitals, despite the fact there’s no companion bill in the Senate.
Members of the House Judiciary Committee voted 15-1 to approve HB 6003, which would revamp Florida’s wrongful death laws in two ways: Parents of single, childless, adult children 25 and older could file wrongful death lawsuits arising from alleged medical malpractice; and adult children could pursue claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice.
In wrongful death suits, plaintiffs can recover economic damages and non-economic damages such as lost income and services, mental pain and suffering, and loss of companionship.
State Rep. Dana Trabulsy via Florida House
Fort Pierce Republican and bill sponsor Rep. Dana Trabulsy made an impassioned plea Wednesday afternoon for committee members to support the bill.
“It’s really important that while I have this opportunity in the Florida House, whether it’s for medical malpractice or any other piece of legislation that I file and run or vote for, that I know that I have fought for people that can’t fight for themselves. That is the only way I’ll be able to rest my head on my pillow when I leave is knowing that I can account for my own actions,” she said. 
“And so I want each of you to account for yours, too. And when you vote on this bill  today, if you can look at these families and let them know that their loved ones’ lives matter with a yes [vote] or didn’t with a no [vote].”
Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed identical legislation last year but the action hasn’t seemed to dissuade the House from pursing the changes again this year.

Lobbyists, lawsuits, and caps
The legislation has attracted scores of lobbyists on both sides of the the debate, from insurance interests to organized medicine to AARP Florida.
Proponents of HB 6003 say it fixes Florida’s “free kill” law, a moniker coined to describe the different legal protections in Florida statute based on someone’s age, family, and marital status. Conversely, opponents, including the governor, argue the bill would increase the number of lawsuits and result in higher medical malpractice premiums. They have coined their own name for the proposal: “jackpot justice.”
Some opponents, though, say they could be swayed to support the measure with an amendment to limit damages that can be recovered for all medical malpractice cases, not just the newly expanded class of litigants in HB 6003.

Florida has not had caps on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice lawsuits since 2017, when the Florida Supreme Court ruled that they are unconstitutional. But the makeup of the court has changed since then. DeSantis has appointed five of the seven justices and business and medical interests are eager to put the matter to a new test.
While House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, has been steadfast in its opposition to capping damages, Senate President Ben Albritton, R-Wauchula, has been more open to the idea. An attempt to place a $1 million cap for medical malpractice and wrongful death failed by a one-vote margin in the Senate earlier this year. The Senate ultimately voted to pass the legislation without the caps but the governor vetoed it.
DeSantis referred to caps on damages (and attorney fees) as “safeguards” in his veto message.
“Any approach to medical negligence reform without including proper safeguards is a risk for Floridians because it would make the legal landscape ripe for predatory trial attorneys. I encourage any future legislative action to include regulatory reforms and these safeguards, striking a balance between providing relief and accountability, while preserving quality access and care for Floridians,” the veto letter notes.
Public testimony
Members of the House Judiciary Committee listened to about an hour of public testimony before voting to advance the bill. Only Miami Lakes Republican Rep. Tom Fabricio voted against the bill.
Florida Hospital Association General Counsel Kristen Dobson told committee members that Florida is in the midst of a medical malpractice insurance crisis and the legislation would only make the situation worse.
“Escalating insurance rates make it increasingly difficult for health care providers, particularly those practicing in key specialties like obstetrics, family medicine, emergency medicine, and orthopedics, to secure affordable and adequate coverage. This is not hyperbole,” she said, adding that a “major hospital” in south Florida recently saw its reinsurance costs increase by 73%. She did not name the hospital.
“To be clear, escalating insurance costs are not indicative of some sort of quality issue. They are because of Florida’s highly litigious medical malpractice environment,” she said.
Dobson and Florida Justice Reform representative Andy Bollen, a defense attorney, both testified that since DeSantis’ veto of the bill this spring there have been “nuclear verdicts” in Florida medical malpractice cases. The phrase, Dobson said, describes jury awards exceeding $10 million. Two months ago, a Tampa Bay jury awarded $70 million in a malpractice case,  Dobson said. Nearly 73% of the verdict was for noneconomic damages.
Bollen discussed another large medical malpractice verdict in Orlando in which a jury awarded three plaintiffs $15 million each.
But committee member Rep. Michael Gottlieb, a criminal defense attorney and Democrat from Davie, wasn’t shocked by the jury awards.
“You know what I hear when I hear ‘nuclear verdict?’ I hear gross negligence. The reason a jury is awarding somebody $15 million is somebody made a huge mistake, something that was blatantly obvious, and somebody made it a huge mistake. That’s why you have a nuclear verdict. That’s why a jury says you need to pay more than anybody else should pay, because you breached the standard of care. Your causation was so high and you committed a huge harm. That’s why we have nuclear verdicts, not because people’s mentality is changing.”
Retired Ocala obstetrician and Florida Medical Association representative Dr. Douglas Murphy also hammered away at the recent nuclear verdicts and the potential damage the bill could do to the health care delivery system. Murphy criticized the advocates’ description of the legal system as “free kill.”
“I’ve heard the devastating stories of adult children who have died due to poor care and the inability of their parents to sue on their behalf, and my heart truly breaks for those people. Malpractice unfortunately occurs, and yet, I have never met any physician who intentionally tries to harm or kill a patient. Referring to this bill as the “free kill” bill is both insulting and misleading, he insisted
Kristy Meadows is a proponent of the legislation but also struggles with the “free kill” description.
Her father, Teddy Meadows, died on April 6 after being discharged from a south Florida hospital.
“They dismissed his symptoms. They dismissed his test results, and he was discharged without a diagnosis, without any treatment. And he died days later,”  she told the committee.
“I hate that it’s called free kill. I hate that someone can refer to my dad as a free kill. But sadly, I think that name effectively describes what this law does. I think it discriminates against unmarried adults with no minor children, and it denies equal rights under the law based on age and marital status. It also allows medical negligence to occur just against these particular persons in Florida, and it allows medical negligence to occur without consequences, and that inherently decreases the overall quality of health care. ”

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — Immigration enforcement and federal officials surrounded a seafood market in Newark Wednesday and detained workers in the second raid conducted at the warehouse this year. 
It’s unknown how many Ocean Seafood Depot workers were detained during the raid that started around 8 a.m. at the market on the corner of Adams and Delancey Streets. Advocates who conduct rapid responses to raids across the state said they are starting to hear from family members who are looking for their loved ones. 
“We’re trying to confirm how many workers, if they have a case — I think everybody’s going to be checking in with their folks,” said Li Adorno of Movimiento Cosecha. “We’re going to start to piece the answers together.” 
About 40 masked agents from different federal agencies — some wearing tactical gear and holding rifles — shut down the block of Adams Street to conduct the raid. Several workers were pulled out of the depot and given red wristbands to denote they were not detained. 
Jenny Garcia, a longtime immigration activist who responded to the raid Wednesday morning, said she spoke to people who said they were zip tied before being asked about their immigration status by Homeland Security Investigation and Federal Bureau of Investigations officials. 
“We’re seeing this pattern of this dehumanizing marking on who is allowed to leave the raid and who is going to be taken,” she said. 
About 12:30 p.m. the last agents pulled away in white vans and black SUVs as activists gathered on the sidewalk yelled at them to leave. 
Christine Cuttita, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Homeland Security agents “executed a court-authorized search warrant as part of an active criminal investigation involving labor operations at Ocean Seafood.” 
She declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond for comment. 
Federal officials had a warrant to conduct the Wednesday raid, unlike the first enforcement episode in January. During that raid in the first few days of President Donald Trump’s second term, several people, including a U.S. military veteran, were detained. 
Since then, immigration officials have been actively conducting raids across the state. Twenty-nine people were arrested during an August raid in Edison, and, two weeks ago, enforcement officials arrested 46 workers at an Avenel warehouse. Several of those detainees are still being held at Delaney Hall, a federal immigration jail in Newark. 
Workers waiting outside the market declined to speak with reporters Wednesday. The scene was tense between activists and some workers who said they voted for Trump and supported ICE raids at their workplace. One woman, who said her friend was taken, cried on the sidewalk as she hugged friends. 
Adorno noted there was “a lot more ICE presence this time around.” And he added that, this being the second raid at the seafood depot, some people are aware of the risk, but immigrant workers without legal status may still be taking jobs here. 
“If you may run the risk of being detained, you’re going to try to avoid any place where a raid has happened,” he said. “But the reality is that people are struggling. People need to work.” 
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a staunch advocate for immigrants who was arrested and charged with trespassing at Delaney Hall earlier this year, did not immediately respond for comment. His charges were later dropped. 
Rep. LaMonica McIver, who is facing trial over alleged assault during the scuffle outside the jail during Baraka’s arrest, said the Trump administration is “using fear as a tool.” 
“They have been doing so since Jan. 23 when they raided this same Newark market. We owe it to our neighbors to stand up for them,” she said on social media. “That’s exactly what I’ll keep doing.”

John Arch of La Vista, speaker of the Nebraska Legislature. Oct. 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers will begin their 60-day legislative session in January with a larger projected deficit than the hole they just filled during the 90-day session this year.
The new projected deficit stands at roughly $471 million, as confirmed by Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent during a meeting Thursday of the Nebraska Legislature’s Tax Rate Review Committee.
“I wish it was rosier, but we’ll figure it out,” said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the committee’s chair, at the end of the meeting.
Lawmakers this spring grappled with a fluctuating deficit that at one point grew to $432 million. After some cuts, they ended the session with a projected surplus of about $4 million by the end of the biennium in 2027.
However, state senators left a structural deficit that would have grown to about $129 million by the end of the following biennium in 2029.
Shortly after the session ended, new estimates and revenue numbers pushed the current two-year budget back into a projected shortfall of about $95 million at the previous Tax Rate Review Committee meeting in July. That meeting also grew the next biennium’s projected deficit to $218 million.
Then, at Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board’s latest meeting Oct. 31, board members lowered predictions for expected state revenues by roughly $367 million over the next two fiscal years.
Those adjustments alone grew the shortfall to about $451 million. In addition, higher-than-expected obligations for community college aid and special education reimbursements brought the projected deficit to $471 million.
The next biennium’s projected deficit grew to at least $690 million, but Patent said it could be up to $1 billion more based on the forecasting board’s latest projections. She said she calculated the out-year deficit based on Nebraska’s historical revenue growth, which typically ebbs and flows every few years.
The state’s monthly tax receipts for 2025 have been a mixed bag, but overall monthly revenues have fallen below past forecasts. The latest receipts for October show a net gain of $311 million, which Patent said was modestly above the projections for that month.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista, who serves on the committee, noted that the state’s current trend of lower revenues can be explained in part by the Legislature’s decision in 2023 to gradually lower individual and corporate income tax rates, which subsequently lowered the state’s annual revenues. These reductions are slated to halt at 3.99% in 2027, at which point Arch said he expects to see more growth in Nebraska’s economy.
“It’s kind of a reset over a period of years as you lower the rates,” Patent said. “So that’s anticipated that we’d get back on trend with the economy.”
Another contributor to the deficit is the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Congress passed this summer. Nebraska’s Department of Revenue released a report in September estimating that the bill would cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two fiscal years, which was factored into the latest forecast.
Patent’s report outlined an avenue for lawmakers to potentially lower the projected shortfall to about $311 million, based on state agencies’ mid-biennium budget requests. A majority of agencies requested budget reductions, which would total roughly $160 million in additional general fund dollars over both years, if lawmakers approve the requests as written.
Typically, Patent said she calculates for an extra $5 million in general fund spending through mid-biennium adjustments.
Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, said he was surprised by a few of the budget requests asking for higher appropriations. The largest of these would cover the state’s Medicaid shortfall, with the Department of Health and Human Services requesting an extra $56.5 million for the current fiscal year, and $77.1 million for fiscal year 2026-27. Patent said the increase is linked to higher-than-expected utilization of the service.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh entered the verdict in March after China did not defend itself in the lawsuit. Speaking to reporters at her office Wednesday, Hanaway said she is working to compile a list of properties and other assets owned by government agencies named in the lawsuit.
“It’s been a long process for us to be able to enforce that judgment, but now we’ll enforce that judgment, much like any other judgment in this area,” Hanaway said.
The state will not try to take assets from companies owned by Chinese citizens or businesses, she said.
That would put the Smithfield Hog Production operation in north Missouri, previously known as Premium Standard Farms, off-limits. The farm is owned by China-based WH Group and is one of the most valuable Chinese-owned assets in the state.
“We can’t go after Chinese individuals or companies necessarily,” Hanaway said. “I might be proven wrong over time, but my belief is that we’ve got to go after those assets actually owned by China.”
In his ruling, Limbaugh wrote that China concealed the true nature of COVID-19 so it could stockpile protective gear that could limit spread of the virus.
“China’s pattern of actions strongly suggests that it had knowledge of the existence and human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus as early as September 2019,” Limbaugh wrote. “China’s actions also suggest that China engaged in a deliberate campaign to suppress information about the COVID-19 pandemic in order to support its campaign to hoard PPE from Missouri and an unsuspecting world.”
Limbaugh found that Missouri lost tax revenue due to the pandemic and will experience a long-term loss of revenue as well, accepting the $8.04 billion estimate for the period 2020 to 2051. He added the state’s increased cost for protective gear, estimated at $123 million, due to the hoarding and tripled the amount to set the final judgment.
The judgment is against the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, several national agencies, provincial and local governments around Wuhan and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The case was first filed by Eric Schmitt, who is now a U.S. Senator, and continued by Andrew Bailey, now co-deputy director of the FBI. Hanaway was appointed attorney general in September.
The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent. 
In a statement to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said China would retaliate if assets are seized. The lawsuit is “purely malicious…. with extremely sinister intentions. China firmly opposes them and will not accept any so-called default judgments. We demand that the US return to rationality and correct its mistakes.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer).Kentucky’s utility regulator and the Kentucky attorney general will appeal the dismissal of a complaint they brought before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that alleged Kentucky Power customers were unfairly covering costs of transmission projects in other states. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week dismissed the complaint brought this year by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) and Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russel Coleman against American Electric Power and its subsidiaries including Kentucky Power, which serves 160,000 customers in 20 Eastern Kentucky counties. 
The state utility regulator and Coleman had argued in a complaint filed in March that Kentucky Power customers were subsidizing — to the tune of $66 million from 2017 through 2022 — electricity transmission projects “hundreds of miles away” because of a cost-sharing arrangement for such investments across seven states. The arrangement included various AEP subsidiary utilities that are part of the PJM regional power grid. Kentucky Power customers pay among the highest average residential utility bills in the state, as both the Kentucky PSC and attorney general noted.
The transmission projects under scrutiny are referred to as supplemental or self-planned projects, or local transmission upgrades or investments that utilities individually plan within their own footprint. Critics have argued in recent years such projects lack proper oversight from state regulators and FERC to determine their necessity and cost-effectiveness.
FERC, which regulates interstate transmission and wholesale electricity markets, in its order dismissed the complaint because the attorney general and the state regulator failed to establish the cost-sharing arrangement for supplemental projects was “in a manner that is unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.” 
Kentucky Public Service Commission Chair Angie Hatton and AG Coleman told the Lantern both parties plan to appeal the dismissal. 
“Because we perceive a need to protect Kentucky Power ratepayers from longstanding unfair transmission costs, we do plan to file a motion for rehearing at FERC,” Hatton said in a statement to the Lantern. 
Coleman in a statement through a spokesperson, said, “We’ll keep fighting this unfair system that has taken advantage of Kentucky families for far too long. My responsibility as Attorney General is to promote affordable and reliable energy for Kentuckians, and that’s exactly what we’ll continue to do.” 
Emails and a call to a press office for American Electric Power asking about the complaint dismissal were not returned.
Claire Wayner, a senior associate at the nonpartisan think tank RMI that focuses on energy policy, co-wrote a report last year that targeted the “regulatory gap” among state utility regulators, FERC and regional power grid operators that allow such supplemental projects to receive little oversight. 
Wayner told the Lantern the complaint from Kentucky officials is an example of how “a state is trying to take action to close the regulatory gap.” 
“They can make one-off complaints to FERC,” Wayner said. “What I would like to see to really comprehensively close the regulatory gap is for PJM and its transmission owners and its states collectively to take actions to implement regional-first planning and ensure that these supplemental projects are really fully being integrated” to benefit ratepayers.
She said such “regional-first planning” would have utilities submit local transmission infrastructure needs to regional power grid operators such as PJM with such operators identifying what local projects are needed in a region. She pointed to a regional power grid operator in New England that will independently review utilities’ proposed local projects. 
“States can feel more confident in either issuing permits for these projects or denying permits for these projects based on information they get from the independent reviewer on things like the prudence of these investments, cost estimates, whether these assets actually need to be replaced or could have been designed in a more efficient manner — that sort of thing,” Wayner said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0033-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Researchers and public health advocates said Wednesday that water quality and land use continue to be modifiable elements impacting public health, and in particular cancer, in Iowa. 
The experts spoke to a crowded conference room in the Olmsted Center at Drake University during the 2025 Iowa Nature Summit that touched on policies, practices and programs impacting a variety of Iowa’s natural elements.
Panelists at a session titled, “Nature and Public Health: Cancer, Water Quality and More” agreed that there is enough research demonstrating the link between agricultural practices, like fertilizer and pesticide application, in Iowa and adverse public health outcomes. 
“We know enough,” Audrey Tran Lam said. “I think what’s needed is more of a change in our level of acceptance of the evidence that’s out there.” 
Tran Lam, the environmental health program director at the University of Northern Iowa, said the public health field looks for “upstream solutions to downstream problems.”

A pressing “downstream problem” in Iowa is the rate of new cancer incidents, which is the second-highest in the nation, according to the latest Cancer in Iowa report. The state is also one of just two states with rising rates of new cancers. 
Dr. Richard Deming, the medical director of MercyOne’s Richard Deming Cancer Center in Des Moines, said these trends mean Iowa will soon have the highest rates of new cancers in the nation. 
Deming said there are a variety of factors that can contribute to developing cancer, many of which are not unique to Iowa. Two factors he said are unique to Iowa are radon exposure and environmental exposures. 
Radon is a naturally occurring, radioactive gas that seeps into houses through cracks in the foundation, or other openings, as soil and rock break down. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shows that all counties in Iowa have a high potential of elevated indoor radon levels. 
The same EPA map shows other states also have high radon levels. 
Deming said pesticide and chemical application in Iowa, however, is “vastly different” than that of other states. 
“We have more pounds, if not tons of chemicals per square mile, and that is different,” Deming said. 
He said it’s not “realistic” that research will be able to find “exactly which combination” of the hundreds of agricultural chemicals cause which cancers to the same extent that cigarette smoke can be linked to lung cancer.
“But it’s not that we don’t have evidence,” Deming said. 
According to Deming, there are already a “number” of scientific reviews that show links of pesticides and nitrate contamination to certain types of cancers. 
“We have enough research to show the association, next we need to have public health policy … to help modify behavior,” Deming said. 
In the meantime, Deming’s top recommendations for Iowans are to test and mitigate for radon and to filter drinking water. 
The environmental correlation to cancer was also the focus of a series of listening sessions led by Iowa Environmental Council, the Harkin Institute for Public Policy & Citizen Engagement and Iowa Farmers Union. The sessions are part of a broader study of the correlation between cancer and the environment which is set to release in January. 
What’s happening upstream? 
Tran Lam said Iowa’s landscape is currently about 85% farmland, primarily in corn and soybean rotations. She said less than 1% of the state is dedicated to organic production. The state also leads in hog and egg production in the country, which Food & Water Watch estimates generates 109 billion pounds of waste each year. 
Tran Lam said it takes a “firehose” of synthetic inputs to “prop up” this landscape. She cited a 2023 USDA figure that found Iowa farmers applied 53 million pounds of herbicides to cropland that year. 
“This 53 million pounds number does not encapsulate the entire chemical burden that goes into conventional farming practices,” Tran Lam said, noting that pesticides, fertilizers and fungicides are also part of the “burden.” 
According to Tran Lam, research continues to emerge that shows low doses, or “environmentally relevant” doses of these chemicals are showing up in human bodies. 
She said nitrate pollution in public drinking water continues to be a problem in Iowa, which is also the “easiest point of public intervention for public health professionals to wrap their heads around.”  
Nitrate contamination was a topic of wide discussion in central Iowa this summer as elevated nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers led Central Iowa Water Works to issue a lawn watering ban for its more than 600,000 customers. 
Later in the summer, a multiyear study commissioned by Polk County found that agriculture was the top contributor to central Iowa’s elevated nitrate levels. 
Tran Lam said while the EPA limits nitrates in drinking water to 10 milligrams per liter, “the epidemiology is there” to show that exposure to lower concentrations can also cause adverse health outcomes like: colorectal cancer, thyroid disease and neural tube defects. 
She said crop diversity — “even if it’s not an organic, regenerative system,” — is key to solving some of these problems. Rotating in some small grains to a traditional crop rotation can help reduce the inputs put onto the landscape in Iowa, she said.
Adam Shriver, director of nutrition and wellness policy at the Harkin Institute, suggested more public-health oriented policies as a solution moving forward. 
“It’s not whether it’s being covered in the media or not, whether people in this room are talking about it, but whether the people who are making decisions and making policy are doing things to address that issue,” Shriver said. 
Shriver suggested the state do things like fund a water monitoring network across the state that previously lost funding, modernize manure management plans, develop a map of drainage tile systems across the state and change policies to incentivize farmers to avoid planting crops on marginalized land. 
The other panelists agreed that policy, rather than voluntary action, will be necessary to mitigate some of these environmental factors. 
“We already know of policies that would be beneficial, and if we just leave everything as voluntary, we probably won’t get much done,” Deming said. “Let’s get the experts in agriculture together and then figure out how to use incentives and penalties to drive behavior that we know will reduce the chemicals getting into the water.”
Water quality was the topic of several other sessions at the summit Wednesday, including one on the economic impacts of Iowa’s water trails, one that called water quality Iowa’s “newest civil rights issue” and another that advocated for citizen water quality monitoring with programs like the Nitrate Watch at Izaak Walton League of America.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado awarded nearly $1 million across seven cities to spur construction of accessory dwelling units, the state Department of Local Affairs announced Wednesday.
The grants are meant to reduce barriers in ADU construction, which the state has heavily promoted as a method to increase affordable housing units across the state. An ADU is a secondary and usually smaller residential space that shares a lot with a primary home. A 2024 law that went into effect this summer requires many municipalities in the state to allow ADU construction wherever zoning already allows for single-family homes.
“Colorado is leading the way on the freedom to build an accessory dwelling unit on your own property, and these grants will cut through red tape to help more Coloradans build and access these opportunities,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement.

The grants include from $325,000 for Grand Junction’s ADU production program, $105,000 for a fee waiver program in Larimer County and $37,500 in Longmont for an ADU pre-approved plan update.
“Colorado families and communities are desperate for solutions to help address the housing crisis and build more homes for working Coloradans,” Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat who sponsored the 2024 law, said in a statement. “These grants will help homeowners build an ADU on their property, making life more affordable and allowing more Coloradans to age in place.”
A little over 80% of the municipalities subject to the 2024 law are compliant, according to the governor’s office. Twelve are not compliant, which affects their consideration for various state grants from DOLA, the Office of Economic Development and International Trade, the Colorado Energy Office, and the Colorado Department of Transportation.
A handful of cities — Arvada, Aurora, Glendale, Lafayette, Greenwood Village and Westminster — sued the Polis administration in May over his threat to withhold funding if they do not adhere to recently-passed housing laws, including the ADU policy. They argue that their status as home-rule cities gives them a level of autonomy over land use codes. That lawsuit is still pending.
The second round of ADU grant applications will open in February.

They’ve lingered outside a laundromat leaving people afraid to leave a nearby church. Vested agents and unmarked cars went to a tortilla bake shop and then a grocery store. 
For two weekends in a row, and the second time in seven years, they shattered the calm in what one Forest resident said has always been “a peaceful place full of Hispanic people.”
Starting Nov. 2, residents saw Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers wearing lettered vests stating “Police ICE” and “ERO” – Enforcement and Removal Operations. Unmarked cars accompanied them, and at least two ICE officers were present, according to photos taken of the agents that were circulated within the community through social media. 
Zully Lopez, who has lived in Forest for three years and grew up in nearby Morton, first became aware of ICE’s presence while she was at church Nov. 2. Members were talking about photos circulating of a sighting of agents near a laundromat on Hill Street. 
Then Lopez heard from a family member at Iglesia El Buen Pastor, a church on Pine Street whose parking lot entrance and exit are located near the laundromat. Over the phone, the family member said some people didn’t feel safe leaving, so they waited inside for an hour. Church officials could not be reached for comment.

Immigration agents detained a person from the laundromat, and then their van pulled into the church parking lot, blocking it for a few minutes. Later, Lopez said she and other members of the community learned that ICE went to a tortilla bake shop on Hill Street and detained a woman there. 
“Why stop there? Were you trying to intimidate?” asked Lopez, who is an American citizen. “That’s what you were trying to do, trying to intimidate good Christians of Missisisppi of that church and people who were trying to wash their clothes.” 
The next week, ICE officers returned. Residents reported seeing them on U.S. 80 where they stopped a truck and talked to the driver. Lopez said the area is near a Guatemalan grocery store. That Sunday, Enforcement and Removal Operations officers parked outside a Mexican grocery store, La Moreliana. It’s not clear whether anyone was detained.

A spokesperson from the Department of Homeland Security was not available for comment Tuesday or Wednesday about the presence of ICE officers and detention of people in Forest. 
Nationally, as of mid September, nearly 60,000 people have been detained by ICE and Customs and Border Protection, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration data by Syracuse University. 
The Associated Press reported Tuesday that the Department of Homeland Security is preparing to deploy roughly 250 federal border agents to Louisiana and Mississippi in an initiative dubbed “Swamp Sweep” aimed at arresting nearly 5,000 people in the two states. Citing internal documents and people familiar with the operation, AP reported the initiative would heavily focus on southeastern Louisiana with additional enforcement in southeastern Mississippi.
Lopez said the immigrants in Forest have done nothing but work hard and came to the United States to pursue a better future for their children, which is what her parents did for her. 
Jeremy Litton, an immigration attorney who represents people from around the state, said guidance from the agency and a Board of Immigration Appeals decision have created a situation where people are being detained indefinitely without options for bond.

Even though she is an American citizen, Lopez said she feels targeted in Forest because of her skin color. 
A couple of weeks ago, Mississippi Highway Patrol stopped her family at a roadblock. Her husband was driving and she was in the backseat with their baby. They are Latino and have brown skin. 
A trooper asked if they have legal immigration status and if they were from there. Yes, Lopez’s husband replied. Then the trooper asked for his Social Security number, but before Lopez’s husband could provide it, the other said he didn’t have to because he spoke English well enough. 
The troopers let them go, but Lopez said she doesn’t feel safe anymore. 
A spokesperson from the Department of Public Safety, which oversees the highway patrol, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. 
In September, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled federal immigration officers can stop people without reasonable suspicion based on their apparent race or ethnicity, if they speak in Spanish or accented English, if they are in a place where immigrants are known to gather and if they work in specific jobs that immigrants are known to work. 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Latina, wrote in her dissent that such a decision has enabled the Trump administration to declare all Latinos, regardless of U.S. citizenship, as “fair game to be seized at any time” if they fit the criteria. 
Lopez lived through the 2019 raids across poultry plants in central Mississippi. 
That morning in August 2019 was the first day of her sophomore year at Morton High School. Then came a call from her father saying immigration agents were at PH Food where her mother worked. Lopez remembers going to the principal to say that students needed to be informed because some of their parents worked at the plant. 
Lopez headed to PH Food while her father picked up her younger siblings from school. At the plant, she saw the buses loading people up and others handcuffed. Her mother was on one of the buses, and Lopez said that was when she realized immigration officers could take her, even though she had work authorization. Her mother was let go once ICE determined she had a Social Security number. 
She remembers seeing classmates distraught about their parents and some children who had to spend time at churches because their parents had been taken away. Lopez said she helped take a group of children to a church and heard a young girl ask if her mother was gone because she was working overtime. 
Since the raid, her mother was able to obtain legal permanent residency, commonly known as a green card. But her father, who entered the country without authorization decades ago, was deported to Mexico in August. He will have to wait 10 years before he can come to the United States because of his prior entry. 
That 2019 experience also changed the trajectory of Lopez’s life. She had worked at a bank and saw herself becoming a certified public accountant. But she felt called to help people navigate immigration matters.

Roughly one third of the graduates, or six trainees, are headed to the Alaska State Troopers, in wildlife or state trooper roles. The state law enforcement agency has struggled with vacancies in recent years, which leaders have said has limited its ability to address time-sensitive criminal investigations. 
“We’re getting better. The vacancies are certainly higher than we would like them to be now, which I think is the case, not only across Alaska, but across the country. We would like to see those vacancies a lot lower than they are,” said Austin McDaniel, the department’s director of communications. 
With the new recruits, there are currently 55 commissioned officer vacancies out of 411 funded positions, about a 13 percent vacancy rate, which McDaniel said is an improvement for the department. 
“It’s very promising to see our vacancies in the fifties, that’s a great place. We’ve seen them in the upper seventies and even low eighties here over the last five years,” he said.
McDaniel said the vacancies are not currently impacting the state troopers responsiveness to the public and calls for service. But he said certain operations can be limited, depending on the department and region.
“One of the big impacts we’ll see is less, maybe, proactive policing, less troopers out looking for crime, especially public impact crime that might be occurring, less traffic enforcement, things like that,” he said. “We’ll still be able to, and still do today, respond to calls for service from the public, whether it’s a 911 call or a nonemergency call.” 
McDaniel said while some vacancies are standard due to turnover and the length of hiring and training times, the department is continuing to work on recruitment, hiring and training. 
At the law enforcement training academy, based in Sitka, new recruits completed 17 weeks and 1,000 hours of basic law enforcement training, including classroom and hands-on training. Trainees were instructed in use of force and de-esclation tactics, physical fitness, driving, and firearms, as well as exposed to pepper spray and shot by a Taser. Recruits were recognized at a Nov. 14 graduation ceremony, where some also received awards for physical fitness, firearm use, driving and overall performance as valedictorian. 
Some graduates are headed to local police departments in Kodiak, Kotzebue, Petersburg, Sitka and Juneau, as well as to the Anchorage Airport Police and Fire unit. One recruit will go to a village public safety officer post with the Association of Village Council Presidents in Western Alaska. 
“We are honored to welcome these new officers into Alaska law enforcement,” said James Cockrell, the commissioner for the Alaska Department of Public Safety in a prepared statement. “They should be proud of all the hard work they put in during the rigorous training at the academy. I am confident they will uphold the highest standards of professionalism and integrity while they serve the people of our great state.”
McDaniel explained new recruits are hired through respective departments, and after completing basic training they will return and continue several weeks of field training and evaluation, in a typical one year probationary period. 
For state troopers, McDaniel said recruits first go through a several week hiring process. “That includes a very intensive background check, a polygraph examination, a psychological examination, an oral board interview, a medical evaluation, and a physical fitness test. They have to complete all of those steps, and then they’re offered a hire date,” he said.
The Department of Public Safety began a new program last year for early hires to begin four to six weeks of training before the academy, McDaniel said, doing ride-alongs, working on physical fitness and learning about the department. “They’re able to go through and really familiarize themselves with the department, and recruits that participate in that have an exponentially higher likelihood of completing the training academy,” he said.
This year, about one quarter of recruits, or six trainees, did not complete the academy training program, he said, for a variety of reasons. “It’s a challenging profession, especially in a place like Alaska,” he said. “It’s not a job everyone can do.”
Upon graduation, state trooper graduates continue to their first duty assignments in Fairbanks, Soldotna or the Matanuska-Susitna Valley Borough, for two years. “We do our training in those communities because of the volume of calls we get there. New troopers are able to get exposure to a lot of different things that they can then bring on to other areas of their career,” McDaniel said. From there, Troopers can elect to transfer to other communities around the state.
Average pay for a new trooper with no experience in their first full year is $127,000, McDaniel said. The state offers a base pay of $93,000 per year, plus various incentives such as bonuses for certain shifts and rural posts, as well as offers for subsidized housing, retirement benefits, moving expenses and a patrol vehicle.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A group of Black New Jersey leaders called on legislators to pass a series of criminal justice and voting reform bills before the end of this year’s lame duck session and urged Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill to look to the state’s Black leaders when staffing her administration.
They said lawmakers should reject bills that would end the attorney general’s supervision of the New Jersey State Police and lower the bar to charge minors accused of certain crimes as adults.
“The easy part is over. We already elected somebody. Now, we’ve got to get down to it,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who ran against Sherrill in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, said during a speech at St. James AME Church in Atlantic City.
They urged additional assistance for Black first-time homebuyers and increased public contracting opportunities for Black-owned businesses, as well as action to close the state’s racial wealth gap.
And they called on legislators to pass, and Gov. Phil Murphy to sign, bills that would create a state-level Voting Rights Act, codify use-of-force policies issued by the Attorney General’s Office, allow for the early release of some seniors serving jail sentences, and end New Jersey’s lifetime jury duty ban to those with felony convictions.
“Our state in New Jersey is worse than Alabama’s. It’s a permanent disqualification on jury service of folks who have been convicted of a crime. That’s a population of more than 500,000 people. Nearly a quarter of them are Black,” said Ryan Haygood, president and CEO of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.
And they said Sherrill’s cabinet appointments and judicial nominations should reflect New Jersey’s diverse population, arguing the state’s non-white voters delivered her a 14-point victory on Election Day.
The state’s white voters narrowly backed former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (D-Somerset) at the polls this month, chiefly due to support among white men, but Sherrill won non-white voters’ support by broad, sometimes overwhelming margins.
“This is why we are here today to correct the narrative that has largely ignored this truth: Black people delivered,” said Rev. Charles Boyer, the founder of Salvation and Social Justice.
The speakers praised Sherrill’s selection of Centenary University President Dale Caldwell, who is Black, to run on her ticket as lieutenant governor but warned the administration against turning him into a clearinghouse for issues affecting the state’s Black communities.
“Dale Caldwell’s responsibilities are vast and overwhelming. One of them is not the be the Black whisperer,” said Haygood, adding, “He works on the inside to effectuate the vision that she has because we hold her accountable to it, not that he carries it all, because as you all know, that’s a setup.”

,DC,2025-11-19 21:22:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Stock trading by members of Congress could be banned in bipartisan push,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/stock-trading-members-congress-could-be-banned-bipartisan-push,,"WASHINGTON — At least 25 bills have been introduced this Congress to further limit lawmakers and their family members from trading individual stocks, and representatives across the aisle renewed pressure Wednesday on U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson to take up the issue.Their contention is members of Congress hold a serious advantage over everyday Americans when buying and selling stocks because of their access to information on Capitol Hill.The House Committee on Administration convened Wednesday morning to hear how existing guardrails laid out in the 2012 STOCK Act fall short and consider the options to revamp it.The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, shortened to the STOCK Act, codified that members of Congress, congressional employees and other federal officials are not exempt from federal insider trading laws. The law also required that lawmakers and certain congressional staffers must disclose stock transactions that amount to over $1,000 within 45 days.The law built upon the late 1970s-era Ethics in Government Act that established financial disclosure requirements for officials in all three branches of government.“While rules already govern how public officials trade stocks, stronger restrictions may be necessary to restore trust and ensure officials are not profiting from their positions,” said Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis.Ranking member Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., said that he “unequivocally” supports a ban on members of Congress trading individual stocks and “that ban should extend to the co-equal branches of government as well.”Law seen as ineffectivePolicy experts before the committee poked holes in the protective measures already on the books.“Despite allegations of improper conduct, no member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the (STOCK) Act, nor do any public records exist indicating that officials have ever paid statutory fines for STOCK Act disclosure errors,” said James Copland, senior fellow and director of legal policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute. Trust in lawmakers and government officials to self-police is eroding, argued the experts and several committee members. Roughly 86% of the public across party lines wants to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks, according to a 2023 survey from the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.Dan Savickas, vice president of policy and government affairs for the advocacy group Taxpayers Protection Alliance, said data collected by stock activity trackers and journalists reveals Congress’ sticky entanglement with the market. According to a January 2024 report from Unusual Whales, a platform that monitors lawmakers’ stock transactions, dozens of members who traded in 2023 outperformed the S&P 500 Index. A New York Times investigation published in 2022 found 3,700 stock transactions by members of Congress from both parties from 2019 to 2021 “posed potential conflicts between their public responsibilities and private finances.” Savickas said a number of issues exist in the law’s current form, not least of which is that the STOCK Act “does not prevent conflicted trading by members of Congress, but merely requires them to report when and if they do so.”Plus, many report them late without consequence, he added. Additionally, a violation is only subject to a $200 penalty and enforcement is left up to the executive branch, leaving it vulnerable to subjectivity and politics, Savickas said.Some members of the committee questioned how lawmakers would be taxed should they be forced to divest, and how to navigate specific family investments. That included Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., whose family owns 20% of a community swimming pool he and his family have long used.“How do we make sure that we're not eliminating me or making me sell something that I feel strongly about? This has been part of my childhood, part of all my kids’ childhoods,” Griffith said, adding that his son coached the local swim team to the championships last year.“How do we protect that while curing the ills of people who are trying to do bad things?”‘As crooked as a dog’s leg’During a press conference ahead of the hearing, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said “this place is as crooked as a dog’s leg, and it needs to stop.”Burchett joined Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., in urging Johnson to bring to the floor the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a bill joining together several members’ proposals from this year.The bill would prohibit Congress members, their spouses, and any dependent children and trustees from owning, buying or selling securities, commodities, futures and certain other assets. If enacted, a lawmaker and their family members would have 180 days to divest. Those newly elected would have a 90-day timeline to do so. The ban would not apply to diversified funds.“Everybody standing here along with a number of others have been working on this issue for some time,” Magaziner told reporters. “We all worked together over the course of the summer to come up with a single, unified bill. So we have one bill, one strategy, and now it is on leadership to get this done and give us a vote,” he continued.Other leaders on the issue who’ve signed onto the joint effort include Reps.  Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., Chip Roy, R-Texas, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Joe Neguse, D-Colo. Nearly 80 others signed as cosponsors in addition to the 16 original names.Fitzpatrick said lawmakers “have to get this done, we will get this done this Congress.”“Mark my words, this bill, or a bill, will come to the floor, hopefully through an open amendment process where we can make this better,” Fitzpatrick told reporters.“If we are all willing to accept the premise, and I hope everyone is, that members of Congress unequivocally have access to inside information — we do — if you accept that premise then we have to do something on the stock trading front,” he continued.Johnson timeline for actionWhen asked by States Newsroom if Johnson has a timeline for bringing any of the proposals to the floor, a spokesperson responded in an email, “We’ll defer to House Admin (committee) for the time being whether they plan to markup a bill etc.”Johnson told Punchbowl News in September that a stock trading ban bill is “a tough issue.”In May, Johnson said he worried whether a ban would affect who could serve in Congress because salaries haven’t risen in several years.“But on balance, my view is we probably should do that because I think it’s been abused in the past and I think, sadly, a few bad actors discolor it for everyone,” he said.",,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-19 21:20:43+00:00,CT Mirror,CT United Way seeks donations for homelessness prevention fund,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/ct-cash-assistance-united-way-homelessness/,The United Way of Central and Northeastern CT is seeking donations for a cash assistance fund to prevent people from becoming homeless.,"Residents of most towns in northeastern and central Connecticut will be eligible again for direct cash assistance, a push to keep people housed during colder months that officials said Wednesday has become more urgent over the past several months.
For the first time, the United Way of Central and Northeastern Connecticut is asking for individual donations for its Rapid Response Fund for Homelessness and Housing. The organization is putting $100,000 into the program to get it started.
This is the third year that the United Way has offered cash assistance. Residents in its 56-town service area can contact their town human services department to access the program. Most aid is around $300, although each request is considered individually, officials said.
“This is a preventative measure. We do not want people to fall into the shelter system. We want them to be warm and housed this coming season,” said Eric Harrison, president and chief executive officer of the United Way of Central and Northeastern Connecticut.
State officials, including Gov. Ned Lamont, gathered at the State Capitol on Wednesday to urge Connecticut residents to donate to the fund. The announcement came as homelessness service providers worry over potential federal cuts to their funding. Lamont said while he thinks the state has made progress, the number of people experiencing homelessness is rising.
“It’s now getting dodgy. You’ve seen some numbers have picked up in terms of homeless,” he said, adding that the state is trying to increase rental vouchers and shelter beds. “It’s not easy. The federal government is yanking back [money] all the time.”
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development plans to change the way it allocates funding by focusing more on treatment programs and less on a program called rapid rehousing that aims to get people into housing as quickly as possible. It also limits funds for organizations that aid people who are transgender or nonbinary and rewards groups for asking about people’s immigration status.
It also encourages homeless service providers to involuntarily commit people experiencing homelessness to psychiatric facilities if they consider they may be ‘a danger to themselves or others.’
“This action comes at a time when Connecticut is already experiencing a severe rental shortage, historic increases in homelessness, and a statewide public health crisis declaration related to homelessness,” says a Nov. 14 letter that organizations representing homeless service providers sent to state lawmakers.
The changes represent “the most significant federal withdrawal from homelessness housing in decades. It dismantles the core of Connecticut’s system and places thousands of our most vulnerable residents at immediate risk,” the letter says.
Lamont said the administration is looking at the issue. Connecticut Department of Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruno said the department may have additional funding to supplement the money that service providers need.
Lawmakers last week approved a $500 million flexible fund to allow Lamont to make up for federal cuts.
“We will take a look at that, but you’ve got to remember that every week, we get another brutal threatened cut from the federal government,” Lamont said. He pointed to recent problems with SNAP funding as an example.
“Now there’s some threats in terms of housing cuts,” Lamont said. “We do have a $500 million reserve there to take care of the most vulnerable in need, to make sure that nobody is sitting outside, can’t get a place to stay in January if it’s due to the fact that the feds have cut back on things.”
Mosquera-Bruno pointed to numerous programs DOH has in place to help people experiencing homelessness including cold weather funding to add 985 shelter beds.
While the state won’t add money to the United Way fund, officials encouraged individuals to donate.
“The activation of this fund is truly a lifeline for families,” said Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9019-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

Mora County residents are grappling with newly detected metal contamination in private wells, which the state Health Department alerted the public to on Nov. 14, 2025. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)  As fear ripples across the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar about newly discovered  toxic metals in Mora County groundwater, elected officials and residents are increasingly wondering whether a federal office overseeing a multi-billion-dollar wildfire compensation fund will step in to help. 
On Friday, the New Mexico Department of Health issued an alert to Mora County residents telling them to test their private wells following the discovery that high levels of dangerous metals like antinomy, arsenic and uranium in the groundwater exceeded federal safe drinking water limits. In the meantime, health officials recommended those with private wells drink bottled water. 
NMDOH also noted the metals are found in suppressant materials used to fight wildfires like Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire that burned through a 534-square-mile area in 2022, including much of Mora County.
But even though state officials and New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández  — as well as the independent geologist who discovered the elevated levels — are pointing to the wildfire as the likely culprit for the contamination, whether federal officials will release some of a huge compensation fund to help test private wells or provide water filters is an open question, they told Source New Mexico this week. 
NM officials issue warning over high metals in Mora County groundwater

Leger Fernández, in an interview with Source New Mexico on Tuesday, called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to quickly review evidence presented about the role of fire suppressants in causing the contamination. The agency is overseeing a claims office with a $5.45 billion fund Congress created to compensate victims of the fire, which the Forest Service accidentally ignited in botched prescribed burns in early 2022.
“If [the metals] are a consequence of the fire, it is my belief that they should be covered by the Hermits Peak money that I secured for these claims,” she said. “And we need to make sure that FEMA reads the report to understand that this is not naturally occurring contamination and that they are heavy metals that come from the fire suppression efforts.”
Dianne Segura, a FEMA spokesperson, told Source New Mexico on Wednesday the agency was working on a response to Source’s questions about the contamination. Source will update this story with the agency’s response when it’s received.
FEMA to appeal ‘noneconomic’ damages ruling for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims

According to attendees, FEMA officials didn’t attend a packed, emergency meeting Wednesday morning at the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Mora, where state and local officials described the contamination and their options for next steps. Segura told Source on Tuesday that the agency had not received a “formal invitation” to the meeting and didn’t know whether agency officials would attend.
At the meeting Wednesday, state Environment Department officials collected names of people seeking private well tests. They also described results from recent tests showing the metals were not at elevated levels in the public drinking water system.
Recent delays on ‘cascading events’
The latest environmental crisis in Mora County resurfaced frustration with FEMA’s Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Claims Office, which has so far paid out about $3.24 billion of the fund, according to an update the office posted Tuesday on Facebook. 
Much of the recent frustration centers on how the office handles claims from fire victims who suffered damage from post-fire flooding and debris flows, which the agency refers to as “cascading events” caused by the wildfire.
Even though federal officials committed to covering claims for post-fire flooding, victims have told Source in recent weeks that the office has either not approved their requests to reopen their claims for compensation or has not responded.
In early November, Leger Fernández and other members of the New Mexico congressional delegation criticized the agency in a letter for failing to keep its promise to honor “cascading event” claims. 
State and local officials told Source this week that they believe the newly discovered contamination constitutes another “cascading event” that the funds should cover. They are calling on the claims office to pay for private well tests and water filters.
Leger Fernández told Source on Tuesday that the agency had not responded to the delegation’s recent letter, and that she’s concerned FEMA will continue to ignore requests for reopened claims for the metal contamination. 
“We need to use this process to address this as a ‘cascading event’ if it is a consequence of the fire,” she said. “And it looks like it is.”
Mora County Commissioner Veronica Serna told Source she tried to confront FEMA officials on Monday in-person at the claims office headquarters in Santa Fe, but was unable to find the office’s director, and left even more frustrated, she said. 
She says she’s also sent about a dozen letters to FEMA in recent weeks from different fire victims who have not received compensation for “cascading events.” That doesn’t bode well for the agency’s response to the contamination, she said. 
“I’m not sure what’s going on with this claims office, and I really feel bad for people,” she said.

‘I’d rather have a burned mountain’
Geologist Kate Zeigler, who runs an independent geologic consulting firm, has been testing private wells in Mora County each summer since 2023, and found no concerning levels of contaminants in 2023 and 2024, she said. But the results of her latest round of testing from this summer were “so concerning,” she told Source in an email, that she quickly summed up findings into a report that she sent to state agencies, which then issued the alert Friday. 
Zeigler’s four-page report dated Oct. 4 said tests of 55 private wells in the summer of 2025 detected a sudden increase in a range of metals beyond levels the Environmental Protection Agency deems safe for human consumption. 
The report also cited a 2024 study of California watersheds that linked increased heavy metal levels to fire suppression materials used in fires across the West between 2009 and 2021. The study concludes that fire suppressants contributed approximately 380,000 kilograms of toxic metals to the environment in that period.

Zeigler elaborated on her findings during the Wednesday meeting, showing maps of 55 well sites where tests detected elevated levels of antimony, arsenic, manganese, cadmium and uranium, a subset of which were beyond EPA limits.
The news of the contamination has been deeply distressing to Paula Garcia, a lifelong Mora-area resident who also directs the New Mexico Acequia Association, she said at the meeting Wednesday. She called on the Forest Service to share with the public details of how much fire suppression it dumped on mountainsides to fight the blaze, and she fears the ensuing contamination will imperil drinking water for years to come.

(Photo by Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)A panel that recommends adjustments to how much Colorado covers Medicaid costs presented a plan to lawmakers on Tuesday that is vastly different, and more expensive, than the one the governor’s office wants to see implemented, leaving lawmakers to question the role of that panel overall.
Members of the Medicaid Provider Rate Review Advisory Committee made the presentation at the Capitol in Denver to the state Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee, which is in charge of crafting the state’s budget. The governor’s plan came through the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.
The discussion comes at a time when Medicaid, the joint federal and state health care insurance program for certain low-income residents, faces cuts from new federal policy, and the state is heading into another fiscal year with a revenue shortfall.
“I think (the advisory committee) was set up so we can have an understanding of where these rates should be set if we could, in a perfect world, meet our budgetary needs at this moment and ensure we are adequately paying providers,” Joint Budget Committee Chair Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, said. “But how are we to understand and interpret what MPRRAC is presenting us and then what the department is presenting us?”

Tuesday’s presentation was a first step in a long process of writing their spending plan.
The state considers Medicaid provider rates — the amount it reimburses medical providers — on a three-year cycle, and this year’s review includes physician services, dialysis, physical and occupational therapies and prosthetics, among other services. The advisory committee was formed a decade ago to help the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, or HCPF, review provider rates, which are generally tied to a percentage of what the federal government pays for Medicare services, the health insurance program for older adults. The committee takes into account stakeholder feedback and care access when forming its recommendations for provider rates.
But the state does not have to go with the advisory committee’s suggestion, and typically does not.
“This is the third time I’ve been through this, and the recommendation is not what we end up using, and I’m puzzled why we continue this process,” Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican, said.
In his budget proposal, Gov. Jared Polis suggested an across-the-board rate for Medicaid services at 85% of the Medicare benchmark. The national average is about 75% of that benchmark. Medicaid, which is administered by HCPF, is one of the fastest growing parts of the already-strained state budget. Polis wants to slow that growth, starting with next year’s budget.
“The biggest challenge with an across-the-board cut is that it doesn’t allow us to be thoughtful about what areas are going to be most impactful for the individuals in our state. It also makes it very hard for providers of care to make predictable decisions,” Megan Adamson, chair of the advisory committee, told JBC members.
“We heard a fair amount of feedback around the impacts on sustaining a practice and offering sustainable wages,” she said.
The advisory committee recommended different rates for each service it considered, and pulled all rates up to at least 80%. For some highly-used services, such as dental work for people with intellectual disabilities, it recommended a 150% rate.
Those rates would reflect the difficulty in providing those types of services, Adamson said.
The advisory committee’s plan would cost about $26 million, including $9 million from the state’s general fund. HCPF’s plan would save the state $8 million and $2.3 million from the general fund.
“In a budget cut year where it is difficult and we do have to offer reductions to rates, it becomes a question of where do you pick and choose those reductions? And this year, as we’ve done historically, the department generally opted for an across the board approach,” said Josh Block, the HCPF deputy chief financial officer.
“We’re constantly trying to find a balance, understanding what the fiscal realities of the state are and knowing the challenges we face today and will face in the future — the overall sustainability of Medicaid, and what can we do to make sure that providers keep their doors open?” he said.
About 100 people rallied on the steps of the state Capitol in Denver on Tuesday after the provider rate discussion, calling on the state to reject funding cuts for behavioral therapy and treatment for children with autism. Advocates argue that the governor’s proposed provider rate could jeopardize access to services like applied behavior analysis, which helps with communication and social skills.

(Screenshot from Arkansas Legislature live feed)The Arkansas Board of Corrections voted to pay the attorney it hired to sue over legislation watering down its authority just over $300,000 during its Tuesday meeting.
The corrections board will pay the Hall Booth Smith law firm $307,193.55 from the Department of Corrections’ general revenue funds for Abtin Mehdizadegan’s legal representation in lawsuits related to Acts 185 and 659 of 2023, which shifted authority to hire and fire the department’s secretary and the directors of two of its divisions from the board to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
The board sued Sanders and the secretary of the department — which was Joe Profiri at the time and is now Lindsay Wallace — almost two years ago, arguing that the laws improperly shifted power reserved to the corrections board under the Arkansas Constitution to the governor.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James sided with BOC Chair Benny Magness and the board earlier this month, declaring both laws unconstitutional in a summary judgment.
“Amendment 33 is unambiguous,” James wrote in her ruling, vesting control over the state corrections system — including the leaders of it — with the Board of Corrections. She ruled further that the board was entitled to its attorney and issued an injunction preventing Attorney General Tim Griffin or other state officials from interfering with the board’s ability to pay Mehdizadegan. Griffin had filed his own lawsuit and asked the court to stop the board from paying Mehdizadegan.
Judge says Arkansas corrections secretary serves at pleasure of Board of Corrections, not governor

The corrections board’s complaint against the governor and the corrections secretary came after months of increasing tensions in 2023 between board members and Sanders and Profiri as they sparred over Profiri’s push to add more prison beds despite the department’s ongoing staffing issues.
The situation erupted into a bitter legal fight when the board abruptly suspended Profiri in December 2023, then filed a legal challenge against the two laws when the now-former corrections secretary said he would continue to show up to work anyway because he reported to Sanders. The board fired Profiri in January 2024.
Sanders quickly hired Profiri as an adviser — where he continues to make his previous salary and is paid more than Wallace and Sanders’ own chief of staff.
Griffin sued the board over its hiring of Mehdizadegan the day after it sued Sanders, alleging the body had flouted Arkansas’ open meetings law and that it didn’t have the authority to hire outside counsel. That case is still awaiting a judgment in circuit court.
In the case filed by the board, James rejected a motion to disqualify Mehdizadegan from representing the board, and the state Supreme Court ruled James’ decision was not reviewable when Griffin appealed. Griffin asked the justices to rehear the appeal, but they declined to do so in September, setting up James’ ruling this month..
Griffin has appealed James’ summary judgment ruling.
Board member Lee Watson said the state could try to claw back the money paid if it succeeds in its appeal, but that it would have to be done via a court order.
“As we learned yesterday, even the governor complies with court orders when they’re repeated,” Watson said, apparently in reference to Sanders’ reluctant compliance with two court orders in cases regarding her scheduling of special elections.
Mehdizadegan will continue representing the board in Griffin’s appeal and in the lawsuit the attorney general filed against it, which is still before a circuit court.
“We are proud of the work we performed on behalf of the Board of Corrections and are gratified by the Court’s ruling,” Mehdizadegan wrote in a statement. “We appreciate the Board’s unanimous decision to authorize payment for the services we provided. Our hope is that future counsel will approach constitutional conflicts of this nature with the same respect for the rule of law that guided our representation.”

Two alleged whistleblowers are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co. and its affiliates for alleged racketeering, wrongful termination and concealment of information from state regulators.
The lawsuit alleges Farm Bureau officials repeatedly concealed from regulators in Iowa and other states instances of fraudulent activity committed by company agents or employees. The defendants’ conduct in the matter amounts to racketeering, obstruction of justice, and mail fraud or wire fraud, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit was filed by James Newton and Brent Meskimen, former police officers who later became special investigators for Farm Bureau. They are suing Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Co., FBL Financial Group, Farm Bureau Financial Services, and the West Des Moines law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Also named as defendants in the case are several Farm Bureau executives and attorneys.
The lawsuit claims Farm Bureau officials “engaged in a scheme to defraud insurance policyholders, insurance and other governmental regulatory authorities, and other participants in the insurance industry who are complying with their mandatory duty of reporting fraud and other fraudulent or other illegal acts.”
It also claims the defendants violated Iowa’s law on the wrongful discharge of employees in violation of public policy. That law prohibits the termination of employees for refusing to participate in illegal conduct or for acting as whistleblowers by reporting or objecting to illegal conduct.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Calls to Farm Bureau, Farm Bureau Financial Services and the law firm of Wickham & Geadelmann were not immediately returned Wednesday.
Break-in at policyholder’s residence
The lawsuit claims that as far back as 2011, Farm Bureau officials failed to report to state regulators evidence of fraudulent activity within the company, but the “straw that broke the camel’s back” was an insurance adjuster’s alleged break-in on a policyholder’s property.
According to the lawsuit, a residential fire occurred at the policyholder’s Nebraska residence on May 5, 2023, and the policyholder immediately filed a claim for losses.
In the course of investigating the claim, Farm Bureau’s Special Investigation Unit learned that an adjuster working for the company had used a credit card to pick the lock of the policyholder’s garage near the scene of the fire to determine whether it contained items the insured claimed as being lost in the fire, the lawsuit alleges.
Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Farm Bureau’s general counsel, Wickham, and advised him Farm Bureau had an obligation to inform the policyholder of the illegal access to their garage.
According to the lawsuit, the company’s assistant general counsel, Karl Olson, “eventually agreed” to allow Meskimen and Newton to meet with the policyholder and inform them of the illegal garage entry by the adjuster, but barred Meskimen and Newton from disclosing that two third-party vendors hired to investigate the claim had also been inside the garage.
The lawsuit claims Olson and Property Casualty Claims Vice President Anthony Kimmi then agreed that all “poisonous” documentation pertaining to the illegal entry, including photographs, should be placed in a separate file using a canceled insurance policy associated with a Minnesota policyholder who had no association at all with Nebraska fire.
After the new file was created for information about the garage, efforts were made to “lock down” the file to ensure limited access to its contents, and Kimmi directed the staff to suppress all printout capabilities from the file, the lawsuit alleges.
On June 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Wickham, the general counsel, at the Farm Bureau home office in West Des Moines and reported that they “could no longer in good conscience be associated with this file,” the lawsuit claims, telling Wickham “it was wrong ethically and that it violated state statutes, claims best practices, Farm Bureau core values, doing what’s right, and that it could very well be criminal and could potentially violate privacy rights.”
According to the lawsuit, Wickham responded by saying he’d speak to Farm Bureau leadership “to make sure this never happens again,” to which Meskimen allegedly said the directive to create the file “came straight from General Counsel Wickham’s own assistant general counsel, Olson.”
After Newton, Meskimen and the Special Investigations Unit concluded fraud had been committed by the company, the findings were allegedly relayed to Paul Swinton, a vice president and assistant general counsel of property and casualty at FBL Financial Group, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit claims Swinton refused to forward “the significant majority of the findings” to regulators in Iowa and Nebraska for their review and investigation, despite mandatory-reporting requirements.
Lawsuit: State regulators kept in the dark
According to the lawsuit, the 2023 incident was not the first time Swinton and Newton clashed over information that wasn’t being shared with state regulators.
“Newton and Meskimen were often and continually directed not to make mandatory referrals to the appropriate Departments of Insurance for review and investigation by the appropriate insurance regulators in states where FBL Financial Group was operating and conducting business, including Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico,” the lawsuit alleges.
Among the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit:
— Forged signatures: In the spring of 2023, a Farm Bureau agent in Kansas admitted he had forged the signatures of approximately 50 of his policyholders, without their permission, over a period of three to four years, and that the forms contained false and misleading information to support of the clients’ insurance policy applications. Farm Bureau “refused to allow Newton and/or Meskimen to submit this admitted fraudulent conduct to the Kansas Department of Insurance,” the lawsuit alleges, despite a state law requiring such reporting.
— Two fired agents: In 2022, Swinton refused to share information with regulators about two fired Farm Bureau agents. In one of the two cases, a Kansas agent admitted to having forged at least 900 various documents with clients’ signatures, allegedly with the clients’ consent, and another 100 documents without the clients’ consent. Swinton allegedly refused to share information with regulators about the two firings. The lawsuit claims that after Newton wrote in an annual report that he had concerns with such matters going unreported, Wickham “was furious” and instructed him to never put anything in writing like that again.
— Fraudulent claim: In 2023, after a Farm Bureau agent was fired for filing a fraudulent claim on his own home in Utah, Swinton or others within the company refused to allow Newton and Meskimen to submit information on the agent’s conduct to the Utah Department of Insurance, despite a state law requiring such a referral.
— Father’s altered policy: In 2018, the company’s Special Investigations Unit determined an Iowa agent had altered a customer’s policy after a fire so that the policy included a Ford Mustang that was consumed in the blaze. The customer was the agent’s father and a retired Farm Bureau agent. The lawsuit claims Swinton barred the unit from referring the incident to the Iowa Department of Insurance.
Newton and Meskimen are fired
The lawsuit alleges that while the unreported instances of fraudulent activity date back to 2011, it was the May 2023 garage break-in that “the tipping point for Newton and Meskimen.”
The lawsuit alleges that on Aug. 30, 2023, Newton had an in-person meeting with Wickham and insisted the information related to that case needed to be referred to the Nebraska Department of Insurance. “Wickham responded by telling Newton that if he made that referral his career would be over,” the lawsuit claims.
On Nov. 9, 2023, Newton and Meskimen allegedly met with Karen Rieck, the vice president of human resources for Farm Bureau Financial Services, and voiced their concerns about the lack of referrals to state regulators.
A week later, Newton received a phone call from Wickham and Rieck, in which Wickham said Newton had “essentially resigned” by refusing to report directly to Swinton. The lawsuit alleges Newton indicated he had no problem reporting to Swinton but that if Swinton was not going to make the mandatory referrals related to fraud, he would do so himself.
“As a result, Newton was fired,” the lawsuit claims. Meskimen was allegedly fired five days later after telling his superiors that he, too, would make such referrals if they were required by law.
The lawsuit claims that shortly before the two men were fired they each were given positive performance reviews, with Newton described by his superiors as “one of the most well-respected employees in the organization” and Meskimen described as a trusted leader whose “integrity is beyond reproach.”
In addition to Swinton, Olson, Kimmi and Wickham, the named defendants in the lawsuit include Daniel Pitcher, chief executive officer of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services, and Ronald Mead Jr., the chief operating officer for property casualty of FBL Financial Group and Farm Bureau Financial Services.

In their letter to the Michigan Strategic Fund Board, the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan said the fund’s guidelines for the state’s new sales and use tax exemptions for data centers improperly characterize the law’s clean energy requirements, thus incorrectly authorizing enterprise data centers to claim exemptions they are not eligible for. 
In order to qualify for these exemptions, data centers must procure at least 90% of their annual forecasted energy from clean energy sources within six years. According to the law, they can either generate clean energy on site; contract with an electrical utility, energy cooperative, or municipal utility in the area where the data center is located, or participate in an energy provider’s voluntary green energy pricing program. 
However, the coalition of environmental groups said the strategic fund’s guidelines incorrectly state that a data center can meet those requirements simply by contracting with a utility provider that is subject to Michigan’s clean energy regulatory framework, as energy providers are not required to meet any clean energy standard until 2035. 
While the law that created the exemption also requires the Michigan Strategic Fund to deny or revoke an applicant’s tax-exempt status if they do not comply with the clean energy requirements, the letter’s authors argue that under these guidelines, companies would be allowed to claim exemptions even if they fail to meet the 90% standard.
“By allowing enterprise data centers to claim tax exemptions in violation of the Tax Acts, [the Michigan Strategic Fund] is undermining the Legislature’s clear intent to mitigate the environmental harms of data centers,” the letter states. 
In a statement, Charlotte Jameson, the chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council warned that data centers across the country are prolonging the life of fossil fuel power plants, and sparking the construction of more. 
“Michigan’s legislature clearly recognized the threat of energy intensive data centers to our climate and acted to ensure the onus was on data centers to power their operations with 90% clean energy,” Jameson said. “Being good corporate citizens in Michigan requires data centers to do their fair share to transition the state to clean, affordable energy. We urge the Strategic Fund Board to correct their guidance, which currently renders the law’s 90% clean energy requirement meaningless and undermines Michigan’s clean energy future.”
Danielle Emerson, the public relations manager for the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which administers the Michigan Strategic Fund’s programs, confirmed that the board had received the letter. 
“It will be included in the packet for their next public meeting in December, just as all written communications to the Board are,” Emerson said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2158463644-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-11-19 16:57:42.130671

Malone, a medical doctor, rose to prominence in 2021 for amplifying false information about the COVID-19 vaccines. His fabricated claims include linking the death of a high school athlete to the vaccine in 2021, although the teen had died in 2013. Malone also blamed the vaccine for “causing a form of AIDS,” the Associated Press reported. 
Malone has also echoed the conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 pandemic was a plot by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Major health organizations, the vast majority of health professionals and government officials consider the COVID-19 vaccines to be both safe and effective. 
Malone’s social media posts also promote a variety of other falsehoods, including that there is a connection between pedophilia and the “trans movement.” He has also shared an AI-generated video of Anthony Fauci, the face of the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, transforming into a humanoid reptile, a reference to conspiracy theory that shapeshifting reptilian aliens have infiltrated high-level government positions to influence human society. 
“Gradually, gradually recovering from five years of being defamed, gaslit and blacklisted for speaking truth to power,” Malone wrote of his Pennington appointment in a social media post on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. 
Pennington spokesman Ernie Ballard said Malone’s appointment is gratis, meaning he will not be paid. Pennington is an academic, health-focused research center known for its work in nutrition, though it also studies other health topics, including epidemiology. 
“Over time, Pennington Biomedical has had adjunct appointments with hundreds of faculty from across the globe,” Ballard said. “These gratis (unpaid) appointments help facilitate research collaborations. Dr. Robert Malone’s adjunct appointment will focus on providing insights into the current federal landscape in Washington, D.C.”
Malone is closely affiliated with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., another prominent vaccine skeptic and source of health misinformation. In June, Kennedy appointed him to the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, an independent panel key to vaccine policy and access in America. 
In 2021, Gov. Jeff Landry invited Kennedy and Malone to appear at a state legislative hearing on requiring the COVID-19 vaccine for K-12 school attendance, which Landry, then the attorney general, opposed.
Malone was banned from Twitter for spreading false information about the pandemic, though he was restored to the platform in 2022 when it was acquired by Elon Musk, who has also spread health misinformation.

It is “critical” for lawmakers to rein in spending and increase revenues long term, he said.","In summary
California’s independent legislative analyst is warning that the state faces a nearly $18 billion deficit. It is “critical” for lawmakers to rein in spending and increase revenues long term, he said. 


California will face a nearly $18 billion budget deficit in the new fiscal year due to higher than expected spending, despite an economic boon largely driven by AI enthusiasm and strong revenue, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office said Wednesday.
To make things worse, the $17.7 billion shortfall could balloon to an annual $35 billion by fiscal year 2027-28, as spending continues to grow and debts come due, the office warned in its annual fiscal outlook.
The gloomy forecast is a refreshed look at California’s financial future since June, when the state Department of Finance projected a $17.4 billion deficit for the upcoming fiscal year. The widened budget gap could undercut the legacy of Gov. Gavin Newsom, as he will likely be forced  to make tough budget choices in his last year as governor. 
It also means that for the fourth year in a row in his tenure, California is projected to have a deficit despite revenue growth. 
“Today’s fiscal outlook underscores the challenging decisions ahead,” said Assembly Budget chair Jesse Gabriel of Encino. He said the committee “remains committed to crafting a responsible budget that prioritizes essential services, uplifts working families and protects our most vulnerable communities.” 
But state Sen. Roger Niello of Roseville, the Republican vice chair of the Senate Budget Committee, attributed the structural deficit to Democrats’ “unstoppable spending problems.”
“The state must assess the effectiveness and sustainability of the programs that were created during the surplus and make necessary corrections,” he said in a statement. 
Since June, the state has witnessed stronger-than-expected tax revenues, raking in $6 billion more than projected between July and October. But the revenue gains in the new fiscal year will “almost entirely” go toward K-12 schools, community colleges and state reserves by constitutional requirements, the office projected. 
Additionally, the fiscal challenges California faces have also persisted, if not deepened, due to steep federal cuts to health care and housing and homelessness services, as well as growing stock market uncertainties driven in part by Trump’s drastic tariff shifts. It raises a major question as to if, and how, the state can absorb the costs of those policies.
Spending outpacing revenues
The state is projected to spend $6 billion more than previously anticipated next year, including $1.3 billion implementing Trump’s budget, which is expected to kick millions of Californians off Medi-Cal, hike health care premiums and shift much of the cost for programs such as food stamps onto the state, the LAO said. The increase is largely because the state must now shoulder a larger share of the cost to continue to provide benefits, said Carolyn Chu, chief deputy analyst with LAO.  
The added cost of the federal cuts to health care will grow to $5 billion annually by fiscal year 2029-30, the office projected. 
California also stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for permanent housing under new policies the Trump administration rolled out last week, just as some counties are starting to see drops in their homeless population. Homelessness agencies warn that thousands of Californians could be kicked out of their subsidized housing and back on the streets.
The loss of federal funding could put more pressure on the state to step in with financial assistance — at a time when Newsom has expressed no interest in releasing more homelessness dollars to cities and counties. 
Blaming local officials for stagnant progress on homelessness, Newsom in January proposed zero dollars for the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, the main source of homelessness funding for local governments. The Legislature later successfully negotiated a $500 million investment — half what it used to be — and delayed the funds until next year with virtually no guarantee they will continue.
Graham Knaus, CEO of the California State Association of Counties, told CalMatters he expects the state to follow through on its funding commitment.
“We are now facing a federal government that is eviscerating the same funding at the federal level, so we should expect a substantial increase in homelessness,” he said. “And our only chance is for the state to stand with us … and protect those that are the most vulnerable.”
Fourth fiscal year in a row of deficits
The annual forecast by the nonpartisan fiscal adviser is a mere snapshot of California’s fiscal future and can be drastically different from the state finance department’s own projection, which is expected in January. In January 2024, Newsom’s office projected a $38 billion deficit for fiscal year 2024-25 — roughly half the $68 billion budget shortfall the LAO had projected a month before.  
Earlier this year, California’s Democratic leaders scrambled to plug a $12 billion budget hole in fiscal year 2025-26, relying on internal borrowing, dipping into state reserves and halting new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants to avoid other deep cuts to social services. They largely blamed Trump for the shortfall, arguing the threat of sweeping tariffs and federal funding loss plunged the state into “deep uncertainty.”

But even before Trump retook office, California already faced a structural money problem, in part due to the state’s heavy reliance on wealthy earners’ income tax and capital gains, which rise and fall with the stock market.
The last time California faced a $35 billion money problem was in 2011, when then-Gov. Jerry Brown declared a “wall of debt” consisting of loans and deferred payments. But that was as California recovered from the Great Recession, said Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek.
“This wall of debt (today) is being accumulated in the absence of a recession,” he told reporters during a press conference Wednesday.
The state for three years used “temporary fixes,” such as internal borrowing, spending down reserves and suspending tax credits to plug multibillion-dollar budget holes, but now it’s “critical” for state lawmakers to reduce spending, raise revenues, or both, the legislative analyst warned. 
“California’s budget is undeniably less prepared for downturns,” the analysts noted in their report.
“Continuing to use temporary tools — like budgetary borrowing — would only defer the problem and, ultimately, leave the state ill‑equipped to respond to a recession or downturn in the stock market.”
How sustainable is the AI-driven economy?
While all signs point to high uncertainty and low consumer confidence in the state economy, tech companies’ investment in AI has propelled the stock market to a “record high” and boosted tech workers’ income — the “lone bright spot” in the state’s economic outlook, Petek said.
But how sustainable will it be? Petek is cautious. 
The stock market appears to be “overly exuberant,” as some investors are borrowing more to buy high-cost stocks, a sign of a stock market downturn, the report notes. Even if the market holds, lawmakers should treat it as a temporary or unsustainable gain, Petek said.
And there’s no guarantee that revenue gains from the stock market would be enough to fill a deficit of $30 billion to $35 billion, which the state is projected to hit in a few years. Since the state is constitutionally required to spend roughly half of any excess revenue gains on schools and reserves, it would need $60 billion in revenue higher than anticipated to close a budget gap that big, Petek said.
“Our view is that that’s highly unlikely to occur,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

Leaders of 11 different ballot question campaigns told CommonWealth Beacon they believe they have collected and filed enough signatures to keep their proposals in the mix, clearing the steepest hurdle en route to the 2026 election.
Several steps still need to happen before any of those questions are a lock, but if organizers maintain their current course, voters will be empowered with a suite of monumental policy decisions about slashing the state’s income tax rate by one-fifth, mandating rent control statewide, recriminalizing recreational marijuana, and more. 
There’s a solid chance that 2026 becomes a historic election. The record for most statewide questions on the ballot in a single year is nine, which has happened three times – in 1994, 1976, and 1972 — according to Secretary of State William Galvin’s office. 
In an interview, Galvin said the field is shaping up to “represent a high tide of ballot questions” — a fact he thinks reflects widespread discontent with the slow pace of lawmaking on Beacon Hill. 
“There’s a unanimity of opinion among groups who don’t agree on much else that they’re not going to get anything done in the Legislature, so they’re going to go to the people,” he said. 
One question is already guaranteed to go before voters next year. Opponents of the state’s sweeping new law have already successfully petitioned to put a repeal question before voters, using a different avenue than the initiative petition process all other proposals took. However, because the law was enacted late in the term, the repeal question was ineligible for the 2024 ballot and will instead appear in 2026. 
If all 11 other questions still in the mix make it before voters, the total at next year’s election could reach an even dozen. 
Proponents of each new measure (not the gun law repeal) must gather at least 74,574 signatures from registered voters and file them with local election officials for certification by the end of the day Wednesday. 
Crossing the required threshold does not automatically guarantee a spot on the ballot. Signatures can be invalidated over technical issues, like improper marks on the form, and no more than one-quarter of the total haul can come from a single county. 
Galvin will not officially announce which measures collected enough signatures until next month — once certification is done, campaigns must refile signatures with his office by December 3 — and several additional requirements will follow that. 
But public announcements and on-the-ground intel so far offer an early glimpse at what’s still in play. 
Here are the campaigns whose leaders feel confident about hitting the initial signature requirement and moving forward: 
Rent control revival 
The “Keep Massachusetts Home” campaign, led by advocacy group Homes for All, announced Tuesday that it gathered more than 124,000 signatures. 
Their proposal would reverse the 1994 state ban on rent control — narrowly implemented by a ballot question — and in its place impose a statewide cap on rents at annual inflation or 5 percent, whichever is lower. 
It would be one of the strictest rent control policies in the country and apply to all of Massachusetts, not just cities and towns that have expressed an interest in the idea. That big swing has triggered difficult decisions among progressives. 
Income tax rate cut 
A business-backed coalition called the Massachusetts Opportunity Alliance is confident it’s on track to ask voters whether to slash the state’s income tax from 5 percent to 4 percent over a three-year period. 
Chris Anderson, president of the Massachusetts High Technology Council, said the push gathered more than 87,000 signatures. He argued that cutting the income tax by one-fifth could relieve voters from the state’s notoriously high cost of living. 
“People who leave Massachusetts cite high costs, and taxes are the top of that list,” Anderson said. 
But the proposal could also create massive headaches on Beacon Hill. Reducing the income tax rate by a percentage point could cut tax revenues by roughly $5 billion, experts say, at a time when elected officials are already grappling with budget pressures stemming from the federal government. 
The question of whether to reduce the flat income tax rate could appear before voters just four years after passage of another ballot question that imposed a 4 percent surtax on the state’s highest earners. 
Mandatory tax rebates 
Another question the Mass. Opportunity Alliance is pushing would overhaul the state tax collection cap, a law known as Chapter 62F. 
Anderson is also confident the measure is poised to advance after supporters collected more than 86,000 signatures. 
The proposal would tweak a law enacted by voters in 1986, which requires the state to return money to taxpayers when revenues surpass a certain threshold. Under the question, Beacon Hill would be more likely to bump into that cap, limiting the amount of money the state can expect to collect and forcing more frequent rebates. 
Chapter 62F had become largely forgotten until it burst back into the spotlight in 2022, when the state had to refund nearly $3 billion. 
Recriminalize recreational marijuana 
A decade after nearly 54 percent of voters supported legalizing recreational cannabis use, they might be asked whether to reverse course. 
Organizers are “confident” they have submitted enough signatures to put a question on the 2026 ballot that would ask “if recreational marijuana should be repealed,” according to Wendy Wakeman, a spokesperson for the campaign. 
“The rollout of marijuana sales in Massachusetts has been rife with corruption,” Wakeman said. “The results of legalized marijuana have been higher traffic incidents and problematic experiences of parents, employers, and mental-health professionals. Medical marijuana under our question would remain unchanged, but it’s time to take another look at the unfettered sale of a controversial product.” 
Recreational marijuana has been popular among Bay Staters since it launched, but oversight of the industry has been marked by disruption and upheaval. Lawmakers are moving toward an overhaul of the Cannabis Control Commission. 
Subject the governor’s office and Legislature to the public records law 
Massachusetts and Michigan are the only two states where the Legislature and the governor’s office both consider themselves exempt from their public records laws. 
Amid a sustained period of scrutiny on Beacon Hill, voters might be asked to change that through a ballot question that would require the governor’s office, the House, and the Senate to open up access to their records. (The question would not affect the judiciary, which is also exempt.) 
Auditor Diana DiZoglio, a transparency crusader who took over leading the campaign, said Wednesday that supporters submitted more than 100,000 signatures. 
“The people have had enough of the corrupt actions by top Massachusetts officials who fancy themselves above the law and hide public records regarding basics like financial data and state contracting information,” DiZoglio said.

Rein in legislative stipends 
Transparency and good-government reformers also want to force the Legislature to curtail the use of stipend pay, and they say they submitted more than 90,000 signatures behind their question. 
Under current policy, lawmakers can earn thousands of dollars more per year in “stipends” for holding positions in party leadership or atop legislative committees. Skeptics argue that system encourages representatives and senators to rubber-stamp what legislative leaders require, or risk getting low-paying assignments as retribution for stepping out of line. 
“A legislator should work for the people, not for legislative leadership,” said Scotia Hille, executive director of Act on Mass. “Right now, the incentives are very much shifted in favor of legislative leadership.” 
The proposal would significantly overhaul the stipend system and limit how many stipends a single lawmaker could earn. 
House Speaker Ron Mariano has argued that legislative leaders are best equipped to determine which lawmakers should be awarded more responsibility and the pay that comes with it. 
“Every organization, the longer you’re involved, the more work you do, and the higher responsibility you have, you get increases in pay,” he said in August, according to the State House News Service. “And I think it’s one of the ways to keep people thinking about this job as a potential career.” 
All-party primaries 
Another campaign is pushing a question that would replace the state’s partisan primary elections with an “all-party primary” system, in which all candidates would appear on a single primary ballot and the top two vote-getters would advance to the general election, even if they are from the same party. 
Jesse Littlewood, the campaign manager, said organizers submitted about 98,000 signatures and so far have seen a high rate of validation. He said he’s “confident” the measure will advance. 
Massachusetts has notoriously uncompetitive state elections, and Littlewood said more than half of contests here over the past decade have had just a single candidate. An all-party primary system, he argued, would encourage more people to run. 
“A lack of competition slows down the process of hearing from voters, communicating and working with elected officials, and making sure that voters’ preferences are taken into account,” Littlewood said. “More competition means more responsiveness, that no votes are taken for granted, and that elected officials understand what their constituents really want to accomplish and are there to deliver for them.” 
Election Day voter registration 
Like the other activists who decided to pursue ballot questions, Galvin, the state’s top elections official, got tired of waiting for the Legislature to act on his push for Election Day voter registration. 
So the secretary launched a campaign to circumvent Beacon Hill and go directly to the public with his proposal, which would allow eligible prospective voters to register at their polling place on Election Day. 
Under current law, no one can newly register to vote, change their registration, or change their party affiliation in the 10 days before an election. Galvin said that deadline forces “literally tens of thousands of people in Massachusetts” to submit provisional ballots that are ultimately rejected every cycle.  
“I am convinced the resistance in the Legislature is too great, and there’s still a gap we have in our electoral process,” he told CommonWealth Beacon. “It disproportionately affects poorer people who are tenants and move around [and] people of color.” 
CPCS collective bargaining 
Labor groups pushing a measure on behalf of public defenders say they’ve gathered more than 110,000 signatures. 
The question, backed by SEIU Local 888 and the National Association of Government Employees, would clear the way for workers at the Committee for Public Counsel Services to collectively bargain. 
SEIU Local 888 president Tom McKeever said the proposal could affect hundreds of attorneys and support staff at CPCS, which is aggressively staffing up using new state funding. 
“These folks are doing yeoman’s work, and they want to be able to have the same rights as every other state employee in the Commonwealth,” McKeever said. “One hundred and eighty other state agencies have the right to collectively bargain, and CPCS does not.” 
The question would not affect private bar advocates, whose pay dispute earlier this year created upheaval in the courts. 
Starter home zoning 
One question filed by Pioneer Institute senior housing fellow Andrew Mikula takes aim at the state’s housing crunch with a zoning reform.   
Mikula said the campaign submitted about 103,000 signatures on the measure, which would prohibit municipalities from requiring minimum lot sizes for single-family homes to be greater than 5,000 square feet or to have at least 50 feet of frontage. 
Supporters dubbed their campaign “Legalize Starter Homes,” and Mikula said the effort would clear the way for more development of smaller homes. 
“Massachusetts is in the throes of a harrowing housing shortage that has raised prices and contributed to a lot of outmigration, especially among young people who are trying to form families for the first time,” he said. “By allowing homes to be built on smaller lots, academic research shows that facilitates the construction of smaller, lower-cost homes and also more homes.” 
Land and water conservation fund 
Rounding out the field, proponents say they gathered more than 100,000 signatures on a question that would redirect revenue from the state’s sales tax on sporting goods toward water and land conservation. 
The “Protect Water and Nature” campaign said the measure could steer $100 million per year toward creating outdoor recreational spaces, preserving natural areas, and protecting drinking water. 
“It’s clear that voters want to prioritize and protect our rivers, lakes, forests, farms, and other natural areas, especially as federal funding for land and water conservation is under threat,” said campaign supporter Andrew Sharpe. “With this ballot question, we can deliver clean water, healthy forests, more trails and parks, and access to the outdoors and nature for everyone in Massachusetts — all without raising taxes.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0531-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

(Photo: Getty Images/Antonio Hugo)The Wake County Public School System released data Wednesday showing how student enrollment has been affected by the federal immigration crackdown that began in the Triangle Tuesday.
While no immigration enforcement activities were reported at any of its campuses, the system recorded 19,471 absences on Nov. 18. That means nearly 11% of students in the district opted not to attend school on Tuesday, an increase of 7,841 absences above baseline data the school district examined. That represents a 67% jump in absences over an average day.
More than 110 schools in the district reported an absence rate above 10% on Tuesday, according to Lisa Luten, the chief communications officer for Wake County Schools.
Raleigh’s Baileywick Elementary School saw one of the steepest declines in attendance, dropping from nearly 91% on Monday to 68% on Tuesday with 161 children absent.
School administrators, teachers, and support teams are now actively reaching out to families across the district to ensure students stay connected to their classrooms, Luten said.
Anxious NC students ask how to respond
The news forced parent Amanda Paoloni to have a difficult conversation with her 14-year-old daughter this week. The 8th grader had seen stories about the U.S. Border Patrol crisscrossing North Carolina. She asked what she should do if her best friend were approached or taken by unidentifiable armed and masked men.
Paoloni said she knew her daughter’s best friend is of Mexican descent, but never once thought about her immigration status or that of her parents.
“What I do know is, she is kind. Quick with a smile, encourages my daughter to read, and laughs at her jokes,” Paoloni said at the Wake County School Board meeting Tuesday evening.

Paoloni said she did her best to explain in simple terms that a teenager would grasp how to best manage her fear and adrenaline while being the most help in the moment.
But her daughter had so many other questions.
How do we know these people are ICE?
Why aren’t they identifying themselves?
What happens if they aren’t ICE?
How is this legal?
When the teenager said there was no way she would let an unidentified masked man take her best friend without a fight, Paoloni was scared.
“I looked at her and I said, ‘If you enter a physical altercation, you will lose,'” she told the school board.
Paoloni said this was not a conversation about learning, but rather a conversation about survival.

“Children cannot learn when they are in survival mode. Fear destroys the conditions required for student achievement: focus, memory, emotional regulation and a sense of safety,” said Paoloni.
Board member Christina Gordon, who has three children in Wake County’s public schools, acknowledged having a similar conversation with her own boys about the fear created by the threat of ICE enforcement.
“When fear enters our classrooms, it disrupts everything for everyone,” said Gordon, who has taught in both Wake and Durham County public schools. “I want to be clear, our commitment is to students, not to systems that destabilize their wellbeing.”
School board member Lynn Edmonds called the presence of masked federal agents a form of domestic terrorism.
“The presence of ICE, whether it’s here in Wake County or elsewhere, causes real, unnecessary and long-term trauma,” said Edmonds.
No one during Tuesday’s open comment period spoke publicly in support of the stepped up enforcement effort.
Immigration raids and learning loss
Long before the border patrol enforcement, Wake County’s school leaders made improving consistent attendance a top goal. Missing just two days a month can add up to more than two weeks of lost learning each year, according to information on the school district’s website.

A recent study by Stanford University finds immigration raids in communities with large immigrant populations have resulted in increased student absenteeism. The study found that even when the raids lasted just a few days, school absenteeism remained elevated for several weeks.
Irene Godinez, executive director of Poder NC Action, a nonprofit group advocating for immigrant rights, is the mother of a nine-year-old student in the Wake school system. She said the toxic stress caused by these unpredictable, unannounced raids goes well beyond learning loss.
“One in four children in the U.S. live in mixed-status families. Even U.S. citizens and children carry the constant fear that a parent may be taken from them,” she cautioned.
Godinez pointed to the case of a Durham 13-year-old who died by suicide in late February after being bullied about her family’s immigration status.
Godinez also urged school board members to adopt a non-punitive attendance policy during this immigration enforcement surge.
“Realistically, families experiencing terror cannot be burdened with proactively advocating for their child to be excused from class, not when they are protecting themselves from being hunted,” Godinez said.
Superintendent Robert P. Taylor has said the school district honors all laws protecting the privacy of Wake children and will remain focused on the well-being and education of every student, regardless of their background.

Skiers, snowboarders and snowmobilers encourage a backcountry safety mindset — to reduce fatalities — at the annual Wyoming Snow and Avalanche Safety Workshop in Jackson. 
The post What is ski cutting and why is it controversial? appeared first on WyoFile .","Among ski professionals, “ski cutting” can be a taboo subject. Talking about it can feel like navigating a conversation with a teenager about safe sex.
“We all know it’s happening,” said Brenden Cronin, borrowing the analogy from a recent article in The Avalanche Review. “Why aren’t we potentially teaching people to do it safely?”
That’s the question a panel of ski and snowmobile professionals tackled during the Wyoming Snow and Avalanche Workshop in Jackson this past weekend. Some 500 people — both professionals and recreationalists — attended the two-day workshop, featuring experts from across the nation and Canada who spoke about snow and avalanche safety and how human behavior factors into the equation.

Professionals use ski cutting to test snow stability and remove unstable snow before avalanches get bigger or less experienced skiers venture onto the slope. 
A skier traverses the top of a slope, often making an aggressive turn, hoping to release loose snow below, but it requires special considerations and expertise. It’s only appropriate for certain kinds of snowpack and when no one is at risk of being buried lower on the slope. It requires properly identifying and using safe zones since practitioners who ski cut slopes are in danger of becoming entrained in avalanches they provoke. As more and more recreationists are using the technique, professionals are considering whether to discourage the practice or teach its proper use.
Professionals use ski cutting to lessen avalanche hazards at ski resorts, above highways, at industrial sites and for backcountry skiing clients. Panelist Mark Stanley now mitigates avalanche risks for a remote gold mine in northern British Columbia, where more than a hundred avalanche paths cross the access road. But before moving to the industrial sector, Stanley worked as a Canadian ski guide and routinely ski cut slopes, sometimes with big results. 
“For me, ski cutting is a passion,” Stanley said, causing the crowd to burst into laughter. “I’m not joking guys. It’s been an invaluable part of my progression in the world of being an avalanche professional. Without ski cutting, I don’t think I would be here. I’ve saved my own life doing it, and I’ve saved other people’s lives.”
“I do think it is one of the more dangerous ways that we mitigate avalanche hazard because you’re using your body to start an avalanche.”Chrissie Oken, Ski Patroller
Ski cutting came with the job of guiding clients exploring terrain from helicopters, snowcats and backcountry lodges. 
“I did it to protect the people that were paying me to take them skiing. I was there to deliver a product, and I took people skiing down things where there was no other option,” Stanley said. “I had to ski cut a slope to get out of there.” 
Times have changed, he said, and he doesn’t think it’s “necessarily the cowboy show” today that he once experienced. Still, ski cutting remains a valuable tool, but deciding when to use it can be tricky.
“I think there’s so much that goes into deciding, when is too much,” he said. “Personal risk tolerances, company risk tolerances and so much about the actual feature and the snowpack… goes into it.”
Chrissie Oken has worked as a ski patroller at Vail, Colorado, since 2015. She also worked for the Lander-based National Outdoor Leadership School for a decade as a mountaineering, backcountry skiing and avalanche instructor in Alaska, the Tetons, New Zealand and the Himalaya. When working as a ski patroller, she ski cuts in a “conscientious manner,” she said, because “I do think it is one of the more dangerous ways that we mitigate avalanche hazard because you’re using your body to start an avalanche.”
Oken urged caution in teaching the technique to recreationalists. She worried about “risk creep” and people getting a false sense of control.
But panelist Lisa Van Sciver, who has worked as a ski patroller, avalanche forecaster and ski guide in the Tetons, pushed for showing more people how to ski cut properly because they’re choosing to ski risky slopes regardless and having one more tool might help reduce harm.
Whether or not recreational skiers plan to ski cut a slope, they need to know about it, Cronin told WyoFile after the panel discussion. 

Brenden Cronin has worked as a highway avalanche forecaster, ski patroller, avalanche educator, heli and snowcat ski guide, snowmaker and contract avalanche forecaster.
“I think that’s one of the underlying concerns for everybody that was up there on that stage. It is out there. You can see YouTube videos about it,” Cronin said, adding that a local guide service is now marketing it as a technique being taught to clients in the mountains.
Cronin has worked as a highway avalanche forecaster, ski patroller, avalanche educator, heli and snowcat ski guide, snowmaker and contract avalanche forecaster. He recently started his own business selling and servicing Remote Avalanche Control Systems. How does he define ski cutting? 
“You start from a safe zone, usually a pile of rocks or tucked in the trees, and you generate speed as you go out and across the starting zone of the avalanche path and you make a really, really hard aggressive turn,” Cronin said. “You’re really trying to put all of your weight into it with the complete intention of triggering an avalanche.”
While the panel coalesced in favor of at least broaching what can be a taboo topic outside of professional circles, Cronin cautioned that more discussion is needed around setting parameters for when it’s appropriate before recreationalists start doing it.
Some parameters did surface during the panel. For one, never ski cut a “hard slab.”
“That’s a big one,” Cronin said. How do you know it’s a hard slab? There’s a snowpit test that involves pressing a fist, then four fingers, one finger, a pencil and a knife into the wall of the pit to assess the hardness of layers in the snowpack. When skiing, Cronin said, hard slab feels “like trying to edge across styrofoam.”
With a hard slab, the avalanche can break above the skier or snowmobiler, and it tends to break in large, dense blocks that can step down to deeper layers, he said. “It’s not forgiving.”
He also sees some consensus around not ski cutting when more than 30 centimeters of new snow has fallen and not ski cutting above a persistent weak layer. But there are gray zones. Still, he’d like to see the ski community work on defining best practices.
“Just like sex education, right, like it’s evolved over time,” Cronin said. “Maybe we’re going to have some things that we teach that aren’t the best way to present it. But we have to keep trying and eventually, maybe we’ll find a good formula.”
During the panel, one audience member asked about ski cutting while on belay, which means the skier is attached to a rope.
“I have never, never used protection,” Stanley said, getting a chuckle from the crowd, given some of the afternoon’s innuendos. Seriously, though, he said, if “in order to trigger it, the potential of you getting swept down the slope is so high you need a rope then, to me, you should not be there. That’s just not something you should be playing with.”
Professional backcountry snowmobiler Duncan Lee joined experts on a ski cutting panel during the 2025 Wyoming Snow and Avalanche Workshop in Jackson. Lee also gave a presentation contrasting how he applies avalanche education depending on whether he’s out snowboarding or snowmobiling in the backcountry. Ten years ago, avalanche education wasn’t made for motorized users, Lee said, so he had to adapt it for how people ride.  (Duncan Lee)
Triggering unstable snow is not just a consideration for skiers. Now in its eleventh year, WYSAW also put extra emphasis this year on including education tailored for snowmobiles and motorized snow bikes. A professional backcountry athlete for FXR Racing, Duncan Lee talked about his experience as both a snowboarder and a sledder and how he applies avalanche education differently depending on whether his trip is human-powered or motorized. Lee also participated in the ski cutting panel. 
“On a machine, if you get into avalanche terrain, so we’re talking steeper slopes, it’s much harder to actually turn a sled on edge and get over to an island of safety or out of the start zone,” Lee said. “So actually, fundamentally in my eyes, a ski cut is generally not used on a snowmobile.”
Alternatively, Lee said he does test the snowpack’s reactivity by playing on small, inconsequential features with his sled. Panelists encouraged skiers to follow that playful approach to learn more about how snow reacts by hopping on small features like a wind lip, where there’s no risk of being buried, to see what happens.
Panelists also talked about being aware of people possibly traversing below and getting visual confirmation that the coast is clear before ski cutting a slope. Whether motorized or human-powered, backcountry enthusiasts should avoid stopping and congregating beneath avalanche paths, where human triggers or natural conditions could set off a slide, speakers stressed. 
People share avalanche observations on the Briger-Teton Avalanche Center website, and Cronin sees reports showing people either don’t understand ski cutting or were caught in a slide while skiing and use the term “ski cutting” to cover their tracks. 
If nothing else, Cronin wants backcountry enthusiasts to drop the shaming and be more open about their mistakes so the community can learn from those experiences. He praised Jackson filmmaker Chris Kitchen for sharing his story about being in a group of seven people caught in a large avalanche in the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort backcountry in February 2025. Kitchen described for the audience how his group fell into traps identified by experts at WYSAW. 
They had let their guard down after skiing all day and not seeing signs of instability. They put away their radios. They deviated from their original plan of what to ski. As communication broke down, Kitchen ended up clustered with other skiers on a small rock that wasn’t a safe zone. 
Luckily, no one was hurt. A key takeaway for Kitchen was to always follow the protocol of one person on the slope at a time.
“It doesn’t matter if there’s a hundred tracks in Rock Springs or if there’s one,” he said, “but I certainly won’t be on that traverse or any traverse with a bunch of people ever again.”
The annual educational workshop, modeled after other SAW’s held around the Western U.S., aims to make backcountry safety a top community priority to eliminate fatalities as part of Teton County’s Backcountry Zero initiative.
“The wheels were really set in motion in 2015, and then picked up steam after the accident that spring on Mount Moran that took the lives of Luke Lynch and Stephen Adamson Jr.,” said Matt Hansen, communications director for the Teton County Search and Rescue Foundation. At the time, Adamson was on the foundation’s board and an early champion of Backcountry Zero. 
“We’ve seen how tragedy can devastate a community,” Hansen said. “We understand how accidents happen, but it’s up to all of us to make sure we do everything possible to prevent such tragedies from occurring.”

Connecticut was not the third, but the fourth state with the highest residential electricity rates in the U.S. as of August 2025, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The average price of electricity in the state was 30.29 cents per kilowatt-hour, behind Hawaii, California and Massachusetts. 
Connecticut draws much of its power from natural gas from power plants connected to a network of pipelines that stretches across several states. That gas is also used to heat homes and power stoves, hot water heaters and local industries, increasing demand and prices.
Customers in Connecticut pay more than $200 per month for electricity, or more than twice as much as customers in states such as New Mexico and Utah.

Free.,"Immigration officers targeting Latinos causing unlawful arrests, group says",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigration-officers-targeting-latinos-causing-unlawful-arrests-group-says,,"WASHINGTON — Federal immigration officers are making unlawful arrests in the District of Columbia because they are relying on ethnicity to identify targets, immigration advocates argued in federal court Wednesday.Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are allowed to make warrantless arrests if an officer has probable cause or reason to believe a person is in the United States without legal authorization and can escape before a warrant is obtained. But the immigration advocates challenging ICE's methods say the officers are using ethnicity-based criteria that has led to wrongful arrests.“People are living in fear that they will be arrested unlawfully or subject to detention,"" Ama Frimpong, the legal director of immigration advocacy group CASA and lead counsel in the case, said.CASA is seeking class certification for people affected by the policy.U.S. Justice Department attorney John Bardo said the Trump administration was against class certification because it would cause “micromanaging” by the courts for federal immigration officials and he argued that the plaintiffs in the class have different immigration statuses.“You don't even have commonality among the four plaintiffs,” Bardo said.U.S. District Senior Judge Beryl A. Howell said she would make a decision on class certification and whether to narrow a preliminary injunction soon. Quota challengedThe suit stems from President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration in the district that flooded the 68-square-mile capital with federal law enforcement and National Guard troops. As a result, there has been an uptick in aggressive immigration enforcement.Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said officers should arrest 3,000 people per day on suspicion of being in the country without legal authorization. Bardo confirmed that policy in court Wednesday, but said the figure was a goal. Questioned by Howell, he said the quota was not leading to unlawful arrests and that officers were properly trained. Profiling policyA policy that allows officers to target people based on factors like ethnicity and accent has also swept up U.S. citizens and legal residents. Groups challenged the policy, and the U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard it. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a 6-3 decision temporarily allowing profiling based on ethnicity that citizens face few problems in having their immigration status verified if federal agents apprehend them.The four individual plaintiffs in the case in Howell’s court are immigrants who have some form of legal status such as a pending asylum case or temporary protections but were arrested by federal officers. They argue they were targeted because of their ethnicity and fear they will continue to be targeted because they are Latino. They have moved for class certification.One plaintiff, B.S.R., said in his declaration he was arrested twice by officers in the district, despite having a pending asylum claim.Another plaintiff, N.S., said in his declaration that was leaving a Home Depot after buying supplies and was arrested by officers, even after he showed his documentation showing he had Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela. He was transferred to several ICE facilities across the country and detained for 28 days before he was released and able to return to his family in the district.A third, R.S.M., has a pending application for a visa category for victims of a crime who are helpful to law enforcement in cases. In her declaration, R.S.M. said that during her arrest, officers scanned her husband's face, and found he was not the person they were looking for. “For a moment, I was relieved and thought they would not arrest us, but one officer said it did not matter that my husband didn’t match the person they were looking for, and the officer decided to arrest us anyway,” she said, adding that only one officer out of the seven who arrested them was in clothing that identified them as law enforcement.R.S.M. said she was released and given an ankle monitor, but her husband is still detained.‘Like being kidnapped’In a declaration submitted to the court, the lead plaintiff, José Eliseo Escobar Molina, detailed how he was detained by federal immigration officials. Escobar Molina came to the U.S. in 1998 and obtained Temporary Protected Status in 2001. The status is granted when the Department of Homeland Security deems a national’s home country too dangerous to return to due to violence, natural disaster or other unstable environments.He lives in the district neighborhood of Mount Pleasant, which has a large Salvadoran immigrant population, with his significant other and their two sons, both U.S. citizens. Escobar Molina, who works in construction as a scaffolder, said he was getting in his truck to head to work.“Officers dressed in plainclothes got out of the vehicles,” he said in his declaration. “First, two of them grabbed me by the arms and immediately handcuffed me, and then the two officers from the other Suburban came over and grabbed me by the legs.”Escobar Molina said the officers didn’t identify themselves and he tried to inform them of his legal documentation, which he said was in his wallet.“I felt like I was being kidnapped,” he said. “Once in the car, I told them again that I had papers. The driver of the car, who was one of the officers that handcuffed me, told me, ‘Shut up b–-h! You’re illegal.’ After he yelled at me, I stayed silent. I did not try to resist arrest or to flee.”Escobar Molina said he was asked no questions from any law enforcement officer before being transferred to a facility in Chantilly, Virginia. He said that during his 23-hour detention, all he was given was “one small bean burrito, something sweet, and a glass of water.” Officer mistakeEscobar Molina said while at Chantilly, Virginia, one of the officers at Homeland Security said his TPS “doesn’t count as being legal here,” and he was then transferred to Richmond, Virginia. TPS for El Salvador is still valid, and DHS extended the status earlier this year. Escobar Molina said once he was at Richmond, an ICE supervisor realized the mistake and said he was free to leave.  “He said to me, ‘Sorry you had to live through this. These are new officers. They do not know what they are doing,’” Escobar Molina said, recounting his interaction with the ICE supervisor. “He gave me a copy of my TPS approval notice and told me to carry it with me so I could show it if officers stopped me again.” Escobar Molina said when he was arrested in the summer, it was the first time he had been arrested since being in the U.S. for more than 20 years. “I fear the same for my sons because even though they are U.S. citizens, they are Hispanic just like me,” he said. “I told them to carry their U.S. passports with them at all times just to be safe.”",,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

The deficit stays.","In the four months since the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom enacted a new state budget, revenues – primarily from personal income taxes — have outstripped expectations by several billion dollars.
The uptick has buoyed hopes within the Capitol that California’s chronic budget deficits might disappear if the revenue surge continues. That would spare Newsom and legislators from having to dream up more accounting gimmicks, deferrals and loans to cover the gap between income and outgo.
However, the Legislature’s fiscal advisor, Legislative Analyst Gabe Petek, threw cold water on those rosy scenarios Wednesday. He sees recent revenue gains as a spike driven by an artificial intelligence boomlet in Silicon Valley that’s likely to implode, as have previous tech-related bubbles.
“With so much exuberance surrounding AI, it now appears time to take seriously the notion that the stock market has become overheated,” Petek says in his annual fiscal overview, which predates the governor’s introduction of a new budget. “History suggests that the stock market is prone to overreact to major technological advances, even if the technology itself turns out to be revolutionary.”
Instead of savoring a surge in revenues that would erase what officials are calling a “structural deficit” that is somewhere in the $10-20 billion range, officials should anticipate a larger gap, Petek says.
“Under our revenue and spending estimates, the Legislature faces an almost $18 billion budget problem in 2026‑27,” Petek says. “This is about $5 billion larger than the budget problem anticipated by the administration in June, despite improvements in revenue.”
The analyst notes that California’s constitution requires the state put money toward public schools and reserves, which will  “almost entirely offset revenue gains,” and toward other spending that’s running about $6 billion over the current budget’s estimates.
“Starting in 2027‑28, we estimate structural deficits to grow to about $35 billion annually due to spending growth continuing to outstrip revenue growth,” Petek says.
It should be noted, not for the first time, that California’s chronic deficit is not caused by an economic downturn, which has occurred in the past, but rather by an enormous error by Newsom and his budget advisors three years ago.
In 2022, they projected a permanent increase in revenues, based on a one-time spike, leading Newsom to declare a $97.5 billion budget surplus, boasting “No other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this.”
Confident that the money would be there, Newsom and lawmakers fattened up the spending side of the budget, only to learn that the supposed surplus was based on what was later acknowledged to be a $165 billion overstatement of revenues over four years.
Ever since, revenues have failed to cover the elevated spending, and Newsom and lawmakers have covered the gaps with the aforementioned gimmicks. They have incurred more than $20 billion in internal loans from special funds that must be repaid. They also have drawn down reserves that were supposed to cover genuine emergencies, not political shortsightedness.
Newsom and his staff are now in the final throes of drafting an initial 2026-27 budget that will be his last as governor and will be unveiled in January. The question is whether he will face the fiscal music and finally write a truly balanced budget or employ more short-term fixes and dump the problem on his successor.
That would mean either making real cuts in spending or raising taxes, both of which would take some courage. The past has not been encouraging.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/091824_Dreamforce_FM_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757

If the high court throws out the […],"Denise Lieberman of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, center, speaks Wednesday about the Supreme Court hearings on laws requiring a government-issued voter ID and barring paid voter registration solicitors (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Supreme Court must decide if voters need government-issued ID cards and whether people trying to register new voters can be paid.
The judges on Wednesday heard a pair of cases arising from a 2022 law that also established two weeks of early voting before each election. If the high court throws out the voter ID portion of the law, it would trigger a provision that also scuttles the early voting period.
The Missouri NAACP and the League of Women Voters filed both lawsuits and got a split result at the trial court level in Cole County. Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the photo ID requirements were “everyday burdens” that did not violate voter rights but that the limitations on individuals and organizations running voter registration campaigns “chill speech and advocacy related to voting and decrease participation in elections.”
Together, the outcome of the two cases will determine whether Republicans have finally succeeded in goals they have sought for years — stricter limits on acceptable voting identification and higher obstacles for organizations engaged in voter registration campaigns.
Opponents of the voter ID requirements aren’t arguing that there should be no requirement for identification, Jason Orr of the ACLU of Missouri told the court Wednesday. It is the limited list of acceptable identification that violates voter rights, he said.
To vote under the 2022 law, a person must present a Missouri drivers license, non-driver identification or another identification card issued by Missouri or the federal government with a photo, birthdate and expiration date.
“This type of state photo ID requirement does not pass muster under the Missouri Constitution,” Orr said.
Beetem’s ruling misses the mark, Orr said, because people with mobility issues who cannot obtain documents such as a birth certificate or who have misspellings on their documents have far more trouble than others getting identification issued.
The burdens “certainly are not shared by majority citizens, but they are real, and they frustrate the ability of some Missourians to exercise this right,” Orr said.

Missouri Republicans have been trying since 2006 to enact the photo ID requirement. Prior to the 2022 law, every attempt had been rebuffed by the courts. Before the law took effect, acceptable identification included a school ID, a voter card issued by their county clerk or a utility bill in their name at their voting address.
The photo ID requirement protects the integrity of elections and there is little evidence it has prevented Missourians from voting, said Lou Capozzi, state solicitor general.
People without ID can cast provisional ballots that will be counted if their signature matches the one on file, he said. In 2022, he said, only 116 ballots were not counted.
In his ruling, Beetem decided that the individual plaintiffs named in the lawsuit had not shown sufficient injury to sue and neither had the NAACP or the league as organizations. Capozzi noted that in his arguments.
“They could present the court with a single person unable to vote under the law,” he said.
At a news conference after the hearing, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said 116 “is not a lot of votes” and it shows the law is working as intended.
“The goal is that anybody who is trying to vote  who shouldn’t be voting because they’re an illegal immigrant, because they don’t live in Missouri, because they’re trying to vote more than once, doesn’t get that opportunity,” Hanaway said.
Denise Lieberman of the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition said she sees 116 votes not being counted as a violation of all Missourians’ rights. The inclusion of both the voter ID requirements and limitations on signing up new voters in the same bill shows the intent to make it harder, not easier, to vote, she said at a news conference.
“The burdens to voters of a strict photo ID requirement to vote, the burdens on political speech of the voter registration and absentee ballot solicitations, are not academic,” Lieberman said. “They are not simply a matter of constitutional debate. These affect real voters here in the state of Missouri.”
The voter registration provisions bar paid voter registration solicitors, require anyone working to register voters to be a registered Missouri voter at least 18 years old and to file paperwork with the secretary of state’s office. The law also banned the practice of paying people to collect absentee ballots on behalf of homebound voters.
Arguing to overturn Beetem’s ruling, Deputy Solicitor General Michael Patton said the lower court ruling accepted too broad a definition of soliciting. Organizations can engage in voter registration drives that direct people to sign up through official government websites, he said, but cannot have individuals fill out cards that are turned in by the group.
Judge Paul Wilson was skeptical. He asked where else the limited definition would be acceptable.
“Should we apply that in a soliciting sex case, saying that if it does not result in a completed transaction, it isn’t soliciting?” Wilson asked.
Patton said the intent to receive sexual activity is what qualifies the act as soliciting. 
And if a person working for a voter registration drive does not intend to personally collect registration forms, he said, it would not violate the law.
“Unless there is an exchange of a completed application, we do not believe that is soliciting,” Patton said.
The law includes criminal penalties for people who violate the restrictions on registering new voters. That has a chilling impact on free speech because it is open to interpretation, Kristen Mulvey of the Missouri ACLU told the judges.
The state has been unable to provide a consistent definition, Mulvey said. That will lead local law enforcement to make its own interpretations, she added.
“It is not the secretary of state,” Mulvey said, “but each of the 115 prosecutors who are also defendants in this case, who are tasked with enforcing the criminal provisions.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lieberman-Chapel-II-11192025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 15:58:01.551757
,DC,2025-11-19 20:07:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/spiraling-health-insurance-costs-stymie-members-us-senate-panel,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. senators began debating how to reduce health care costs for Americans during a hearing Wednesday, where experts’ varied recommendations and comments from lawmakers previewed the rocky and potentially long path ahead. Republicans on the Finance Committee argued the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has led to a spike in health insurance costs for individuals  that shouldn't be offset by tax credits any longer. Democrats urged their colleagues to extend the enhanced subsidies for at least another year to give Congress more time to address larger, more complex issues within the country’s health insurance and health care systems. Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said the hearing marked “the first step in building the foundation for” health care reform.“We need both short-term and long-term solutions,” Crapo said. “In the short term, we cannot simply throw good money after bad policy. If we keep advancing a system that drives up premiums, we will make this problem even harder to solve.”“Instead, we should set the groundwork for giving Americans more control over their health care choices,” Crapo added. “Rather than accepting the current system of giving billions of taxpayer dollars to insurers, we should consider providing financial assistance directly to consumers through health savings accounts, which are now available on the Obamacare exchanges through a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill.”Such tax-advantaged accounts are used to save money to pay for medical expenses and generally are used in conjunction with a high-deductible insurance plan, but an HSA “is a trust/custodial account and is not health insurance,” according to the Congressional Research Service.The ACA, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, overhauled the U.S. health care system with the intent of reducing high rates of uninsured people and ending insurance industry practices such as exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and the sale of policies with high costs and skimpy coverage. The law also expanded Medicaid and, for individual coverage, introduced the health insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, that now are at issue.According to the health organization KFF, the number of uninsured Americans fell from about 14% to 16% in the years preceding passage of the law to a record low of 7.7% in 2023.Pessimism about health care actionOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the panel, rebuked Republicans for focusing on other policy areas throughout the year instead of making improvements to health care.“Sitting on your hands has consequences,” he said. Wyden doesn’t see a way for Congress to extend the enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of the year for people who get their health insurance from the ACA marketplace, despite Democrats pressing for that during the 43-day government shutdown that ended in mid-November. Wyden expressed support for working with Republican senators to address health insurance companies’ structure, though he said he is “skeptical” his GOP colleagues will actually approve legislation on that particular issue in the months ahead. “Now if they are serious about taking on the crooks that dominate big insurance, like UnitedHealthcare, I’m all in,” Wyden said. “In my view that starts with a laser focus on lower costs for consumers, going after fraud where it truly exists, and cracking down on middlemen.”‘Very little that this Congress can do’Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president at the center-right American Action Forum and former chief economist at the Council for Economic Advisers during the President George W. Bush administration, told the committee the structure of the Affordable Care Act poses problems. “As a piece of health policy, economic policy and budget policy, the ACA has always been a troubling construct,” Holtz-Eakin said, later adding there is “very little that this Congress can do to change the outlook” for 2026. Holtz-Eakin testified that Congress is long “overdue for a real rethinking of health care policy at the federal level” that he believes should focus on two primary areas. The first is to “rationalize the insurance subsidies” and the second is to address what he referred to as “high-value care,” which he said should include Medicare, the health program that covers 69 million Americans over 65 and some people with disabilities. “Medicare is a great budgetary threat, and so I encourage the committee and the Congress as a whole to take a hard look at that and make some progress toward better health care outcomes and better budgetary outcomes,” Holtz-Eakin said.  Jason Levitis, senior fellow of the Health Policy Division at the left-leaning Urban Institute and a Treasury employee who led the ACA implementation at the department during the Obama administration, urged lawmakers to address the “too complicated and segmented” health insurance marketplace. Levitis said the best short-term option for Congress would be to extend the enhanced tax credits for ACA enrollees during 2026, despite the time crunch. “At this point the only feasible option is a clean extension of the existing enhancements,” Levitis said. “The marketplaces have already built that option and have been preparing for months for the possibility of an extension.” Former Trump adviser says ACA ‘failed’Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute and a former special assistant to President Donald Trump at the White House National Economic Council, said bluntly that the Affordable Care Act has “failed.”“The law entrenched an inefficient insurance-dominated health sector with massive subsidies flowing straight from the Treasury to health companies,” Blase said. The subsidies for ACA marketplace plans, he said, were “ill-designed and inflationary,” urging lawmakers not to extend them for another year.  “The enrollee share of the premium is capped regardless of the total premium. When enrollees pay only a small slice of the premium or no premium at all, insurers face almost no price discipline,” Blase said. “Insurers can raise premiums knowing the taxpayers will absorb almost all of the increase.”Blase said he believes the ACA’s regulations on health insurance companies are one of the reasons costs have spiked. “For example, under the medical loss ratio, insurers must spend a minimum share of premium revenue on medical claims. In other words, to increase profits, insurers must increase premiums,” Blase said. “The ACA’s essential health benefits require plans to cover the same set of services regardless of what people want or need. These rules increase premiums and wasteful spending.”The medical loss ratio was included in the ACA in response to insurers who spent “a substantial portion” of premiums on administrative costs and profits, including executive salaries, overhead and marketing, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.‘We all believe we need to reform’Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters separately from the hearing the debate over how to restructure health insurance to bring down costs has highlighted the “differences of opinion” among GOP lawmakers. “We've got a lot of people who have strong views, but the one thing that unites us is we all believe we need to reform, and we've got to do something to drive health care costs down,” Thune said. GOP leaders, he added, are “looking for solutions that will lower health care premiums, not increase them. And what we see today is just constant inflationary impacts from some of these policies of the past.”Trump, who would need to support any health care overhaul bill for it to move through Congress, wrote in a social media post Tuesday that he wants lawmakers to send money straight to Americans, without detail on how that would work. “THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH,” Trump wrote. “THE PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE AND BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, INSURANCE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE! Congress, do not waste your time and energy on anything else. This is the only way to have great Healthcare in America!!! GET IT DONE, NOW.

If not, they may have to tap into other funds to cover the program in case of a severe recession.
Traditionally, if the economy declines, the federal government offers to cover a larger portion of Medicaid to give states a breather while they experience revenue difficulties. But, Utah economists are afraid that with the current federal deficit levels, the federal government may become unable to offer that option during a future downturn.
“This is not like a hair-on-fire thing, but it’s also not fake, it’s real,” Jonathan Ball, legislative fiscal analyst, told the Executive Appropriations Committee. “It’s something we should be thinking about, and over the long term, we should be building contingencies.”

Currently, the state’s two accounts that work specifically as buffers to cover Medicaid expenses have $449.2 million in total. The Medicaid Affordable Care Act fund, which currently has $342 million, will be enough to cover all Medicaid expansion costs in the worst economic case scenario, Noah Hansen, economist at the Office of the Legislative Fiscal Analyst said in a presentation.
In 2025 the federal government funded 64.4% of the traditional Medicaid program in Utah, not counting the expansion. But, the economists are making projections for a future in which the federal government covers 50% of the program, its lowest-possible contribution. 
A restricted account for the traditional Medicaid program, which currently has $107.2 million in it, would be insufficient, Hansen said. Additionally, that Medicaid rainy day fund can only be used if the cost of the program grows over 8% a year, Ball added. However, the way that’s calculated is unclear in statute. 
“Is that 8% growth just natural growth of cost, or would a declining (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) rate qualify as cost growth?” Ball said, advising lawmakers to start thinking about an answer to that question in the next few years.
General rainy day funds, since they are designed to create a buffer to economic risk, and not to tighten the gap in the case of losing federal funds, are “way insufficient,” Ball said. 
Something else to consider, he said, is the extent of uses for the Medicaid Affordable Care Act fund, which was created for the full Medicaid expansion approved through a citizen initiative. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“Do you have the ability to modify that statute so that it could be used outside the (Medicaid expansion) population?” Ball asked. 
But, if the Legislature were to consider that option, it could likely spark a constitutional question, since like Proposition 4, the ballot measure that established an independent commission to draw Utah’s congressional maps, the Medicaid expansion was approved by a citizen initiative. 
And, according to a Utah Supreme Court decision on the redistricting legal fight, “the people’s right to alter or reform the government through an initiative is constitutionally protected from government infringement, including legislative amendment, repeal, or replacement of the initiative in a manner that impairs the reform enacted by the people.”
However, these “stress tests” of Medicaid are not taking big changes into account — one of them is a new work requirement passed this year in Congress’ spending package widely known as the “big, beautiful bill.” In Utah approximately 7,900 people who now have to start working, or show proof of job applications in order to remain eligible for the federal program.
“That’s a significant change,” said Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City. “You’ll have thousands of Utahns dropping out of the program, so that should be also accounted for.”
But, beyond that, Escamilla said, the state may also have to consider conducting other stress tests derived from the potential loss of health care for thousands of Utahns. 
“We’re going to have thousands of Utahns with no health care coverage. I mean, are we stress testing our emergency rooms?” she said. “I don’t know. Maybe we should start considering a stress test on our emergency room capacity to take people who are going to be completely uninsured.”

The orchestra consists of conspiracy theorists, bigots, anarchistic libertarians, fascists, misogynists, evangelicals, gun fanatics, anti-environmentalists, nativists, and ultra-capitalists, and each makes their contribution to our 21st-century national anthem of dissonance.
In New Hampshire, where Republicans control the House, Senate, governor’s office, and Executive Council, that frenzied composition scores our days. From the opening pomp of privatized public education, through the “Ride of the Valkyries” inspired assault on immigrants, civil rights, and programs that support social progress and services, every misanthropic stanza follows the downshift beat of our defining anti-tax lunacy and the geographic, social, and economic inequality it faithfully delivers. 
While each individual player is largely focused just on the sound of their own instrument, with some horn blasts more blatantly hateful than others, the invisible hand conducting this monstrosity understands the true power of the collective disharmony. The performance is a benefit concert for the modern robber barons, for whom there is no sweeter melody than the battle cry of an electorate at war with each other instead of them.
In isolation, every note is sour. Consider, for example, New Hampshire Republicans’ reignited crusade, in all of its low-information glory, against the state’s Office of Health Access.
Early this year, Rep. Mike Belcher, a Wakefield Republican, proposed legislation targeting what was then known as the Office of Health Equity, among other civil rights programs that Belcher and his band of Republican co-sponsors labeled DEI and therefore “evil.”
One of Belcher’s sympathetic House colleagues, Rep. Jess Edwards, of Auburn, said he had the same initial reaction but then learned that the state Department of Health and Human Services had merely chosen a regrettable name for the office. Edwards said that as it turns out, and much to his own amazement, the office was actually just trying to “remove barriers to make sure we all have an equal access to care.” You know, like equity. 
There was also the little detail, bewildered state officials said at the time, that the services provided by the Office of Health Equity — including for refugees and people with disabilities — are required under federal law.
In a rare moment of conservative sanity, a compromise was eventually reached and the office was preserved, albeit under the less-woke letterhead of “Office of Health Access.” 
A happy-ish ending? Well, not so fast. Republicans are wise to DEI trickery, they say, so last week they launched another assault on that old office with the new name. On Nov. 12, the House Health and Human Services Committee advanced legislation, despite the bill being “problematic,” to once and for all eliminate the Office of Health Access, federal requirements be damned.
Why would Republican lawmakers waste so much time trying to destroy programs that the state Department of Health and Human Services would just have to recreate elsewhere? Because DEI. 
To understand why Belcher and others in his tinhorn section believe DEI is so evil, I suppose you have to consider the definitions behind the acronym. Merriam-Webster says “diversity” means “the state or practice of including people of different races, cultures, etc. in a group or organization.” Equity means “fairness or justice in the way people are treated.” And inclusion means, simply, “the act of including.”
Apparently it’s not enough that Republicans are rewriting the past; they’re also coming for the dictionaries. In the new lexicon, diversity, equity, and inclusion are synonymous with evil. A truly just and equal society, the conservatives argue, would be “morally reprehensible.”
That’s the kind of up-is-down, black-is-white moment we’re stuck in.
There was a time, as discordant as our national history may be, when such moral backwardness would have gotten you remanded to silence at the farthest political fringe.
Not anymore. Now you get a primo chair on the Republican stage, where no measure is too absurd to be amplified.

Indiana Farm Bureau’s annual “market basket survey” found the cost of a 10-person Thanksgiving dinner averages $53.62, up 0.6% from 2024. That compares to a national average price this year of $55.18.
The expected cost of $21.09 for a 16-pound turkey is virtually the same as last year, with produce prices the driver of the slight overall increase, according to Indiana Farm Bureau Chief Economist Todd Davis.
Those higher prices are seen in carrots and celery for a veggie tray (43 cent increase), sweet potatoes (30 cent increase), pumpkin pie filling (24 cent increase) and peas (14 cent increase). 
“Fresh produce markets can be very volatile, and many of these items saw an increase in wholesale and retail prices nationally,” Davis said. “Those retail prices reflect an increase in factors beyond the farm gate, including transportation, labor, fuel, packaging and more that contribute to the overall increased cost of the product.” 
The survey’s price calculation includes the 16-pound turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls, peas, a carrot and celery veggie tray, whole milk, cranberries, whipping cream, ingredients for pumpkin pie and miscellaneous baking items.
The Farm Bureau says its market survey was conducted in early November by volunteer shoppers across Indiana who search for the best prices at their local grocery stores while not using coupons or special promotions.
With the turkey making up 39% of the total dinner cost, the Farm Bureau points to Indiana ranking fourth in national turkey production as helping the state’s turkey price being about 2% less than the national average.
“The concentration of turkey production in this region provides lower processing and marketing costs, which gets the turkey from the farm to the Thanksgiving table efficiently,” Davis said.
Still, a Thanksgiving meal in Indiana costs about 25% more than it did in 2019, reflecting a trend of post-COVID-19 pandemic inflation that’s still affecting grocery prices.
The Thanksgiving meal survey found a cost of $42.66 in 2019, but it has fallen about 12% since hitting a peak of $61 in 2022. 
The Indiana Farm Bureau pointed to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics showing that only 15.9 cents of every retail food dollar can be attributed to farm production. The rest is for food processing, packaging, transportation, wholesale and retail distribution and food service preparation.
“Many consumers don’t realize that farmers are price-takers, just like them,” said Janis Highley, the Indiana Farm Bureau’s 2nd vice president. “We don’t set the prices, and the amount farmers are being paid doesn’t cover the increase of their input expenses.”
President Donald Trump earlier this month boasted that prices are falling under his administration — pointing to the cost of WalMart’s Thanksgiving bundle being 25% less. But this year’s package contains less food than in 2024.

Multiple lawmakers referenced the alleged crimes committed by two Lancaster Country Day School students in 2023, where investigators found they used AI to generate nude images of 48 female classmates and 12 others who were acquaintances of the students. Administrators reportedly didn’t report the content because of the gap in state law. The case has not yet gone to trial.

“That situation underscored how quickly technology can be weaponized against children by bad actors and how unprepared the current law is to respond,” Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery) said.
Pennycuick called the creation of AI-generated child sexual abuse material “one of the most disturbing trends,” adding that adults and children alike used the technology to craft explicit content. 
A committee amendment incorporated portions of a similar proposal from Sen. James Malone (D-Lancaster), adding minor dissemination of sexually explicit material of another child to the state’s definition of child-on-child abuse.
“When it comes to protecting kids, there should be no sides. The bill represents a strong, collaborative effort to protect our kids in an ever-changing technological landscape that is being reshaped by AI,” Malone said. 
Pennycuick described the measure as an extension of her previous work with her cosponsors and a coalition of child protection advocates “to safeguard children in an era where technology changes faster than our statutes can keep up.”

One of those cosponsors, Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster), echoed lawmakers’ commitment to legislating in the fast-changing world of AI, adding a message for impacted families. 
“I don’t only ask my colleagues for an affirmative vote, but I want to say, ‘Thank you,’ to those victims and those families,” said Baker. “Throughout the pain that they endured, going through these horrendous cases of seeing their daughters online in compromising positions or nude positions, it absolutely took courage to come forward.
“Not only to remedy this system, to do the right thing, but, more importantly, protect kids in the future.”

The Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) told a group of lawmakers and first responder representatives Tuesday that the department has resources to help first responders find treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
ADMH Commissioner Kimberly Boswell told the Interim Study Commission on PTSD in First Responders that the department’s app Connect Alabama can be used to help first responders locate resources to treat PTSD. 
“First responders and public safety officers can access the most up to date information about what resources are available in the community. It does have a services locator tool,” Boswell said.

The commission is tasked with using existing funding, likely from ADMH, to help first responders with PTSD. At its meeting in October, the commission discussed what first responders need. Through a survey, the commission found that a lack of education on PTSD resources and stigmas around mental health were big issues.
“We need to make sure that we keep in mind how reporting PTSD to a supervisor, whatever may be, ensures that these men and women serving in emergency services are not going to be chastised for reporting these things,” Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville, said via Zoom. 
According to a 2023 study on data from 2015-2017, about 1% of all suicides in the United States were first responders. Most of them were law enforcement officers, followed by firefighters.
“It’s not a personal failure or weakness, it’s a natural psychological response to traumatic events,” Boswell said. “Getting that message out is one of the things that I think this committee could do that is really important to getting folks to understand that this is not a personal failure.”
ADMH has created a flyer targeted at first responders. The flyer includes the 988 national suicide hotline, a QR code for the Connect Alabama app and a QR code for crisis centers located across the state. Another app, VitAL, is similar to Connect Alabama and specifically for veterans and first responders.
“Anyone who’s in a behavioral crisis in our state can call that number and receive help 24/7. It is operated by the Department of Mental Health through crisis call centers in our state,” Boswell said.
The local answer rate for the 988 hotline was 90.7% in October, according to ADMH. When a call is not answered locally, callers are often told to call 911 for local assistance, Boswell said.
According to the Mayo Clinic, both the symptoms of PTSD and when they arise can vary from person to person. Typically, symptoms appear within the first three months of the traumatic event, but it could also take years and last for a year, or more. Symptoms are grouped into four categories, according to the Clinic: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.
The commission is made up of representatives from the Alabama Fire College, ADMH, legislators, the Legislative Services Agency, the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA), the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) and the Alabama League of Municipalities. 
April Turner, the state head injury coordinator for Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, told the commission how traumatic brain injuries (TBI) roughly doubles PTSD risk. But many first responders are not diagnosed because of the “invisible” symptoms of a mild TBI, also known as a concussion.
“First responders’ culture, like the military, promotes loyalty, selflessness and courage, which can help and harm their mental health and reaching out for help when they need it themselves,” Turner said. “It is crucial that we address traumatic brain injury alongside PTSD.”
Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris, chair of the commission, said connecting first responders to existing resources is the commission’s goal, and the flyer will be crucial to that goal.
“I would hope the League of Municipalities will make sure that this is a priority, that this hangs in every one of their municipalities, and that the various groups with associations do the same,” he said. “Especially all those that have all these resources in this app.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AL_Re_CC_070323-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-19 14:58:13.932357

Jason Esteves in a metro Atlanta district that spans Cobb and Fulton counties. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderTwo candidates vying to replace former state Sen. Jason Esteves to represent a metro Atlanta Senate seat are headed to a runoff election next month after neither candidate managed to secure more than 50% of the vote in a six-way special election held Tuesday. 
Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, resigned from the state Senate in September to focus on his campaign for governor.
Former Cobb County School Board member Jaha Howard and retired state Rep. Roger Bruce will be advancing to the runoff after receiving 33% and 25% of the vote, respectively, according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s office. Senate District 35 includes portions of Cobb and Fulton counties.
Over 5,000 voters showed up to cast their ballot for Howard, a dentist and Smyrna resident who centered his campaign around supporting small businesses, eliminating obstacles to health care access and reducing energy costs.
Howard has also been a candidate for state school superintendent, and ran for a seat on the Cobb County commission earlier this year, finishing second in the Democratic primary. 
He previously ran for state Senate in 2017, but came under fire after sexist and homophobic comments he posted on Facebook between 2011 and 2014 were unearthed. He later apologized for the comments, and eventually lost that race to attorney Jen Jordan. 
In this year’s race, he received an endorsement from state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, one of the two openly gay lawmakers in the chamber.
Howard did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment Wednesday.
Ahead of the special election, much of the Democratic establishment coalesced behind Bruce, who was first sworn in as a state representative in 2003 and served for 22 years, until his retirement in 2024. Bruce said earlier that he was inspired to return to politics because of the political climate in Washington.

In an interview Wednesday, Bruce said his tenure at the state Capitol proves he has a record as an effective legislator, and helped drum up enthusiasm among his former constituents in Fulton County. However, he acknowledged that his campaign has work to do ahead of the runoff.
“I was known in Fulton County for the work that l’ve done, and we won overwhelmingly in Fulton County,” said Bruce, whose House district has spanned portions of Fulton, Douglas and Cobb counties during his time as a representative. “I was not as known in Cobb County.”
“Now we’ve just got to spend more time making sure people get to know my history,” he added.
Other candidates in the race included Democrats Erica-Denise Solomon and John Williams, Republican Josh Tolbert, and Corenza Morris, who ran as an independent.
Howard and Bruce will face off again during a runoff election held on Dec. 16. Early voting for the runoff will begin on Dec. 1.
Early voting for the special election partially overlapped with statewide races for the Public Service Commission, prompting the Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration to request that the date be moved to coincide with the PSC election. However, Gov. Brian Kemp denied the request in a Sept. 26 letter, arguing that changing the date would shorten the time for candidates to campaign. Critics of Kemp’s decision saw the move as a strategy to avoid boosting turnout in a left-leaning area. 
Two Democrats running for the commission ending up winning in a landslide this month, thanks in part to coinciding local races in metro Atlanta.

Every female Republican member of Michigan’s House sent a letter on Tuesday to the Michigan High School Athletics Association, or MHSAA, calling on them to confirm whether or not the student, who plays for the Ann Arbor Skyline High School volleyball team, had received a waiver from the association in order to play on a girls’ sports team. 
“Girls train all year for this moment. When necessary eligibility documents are missing, female athletes lose the ability to safely and fairly compete. Families deserve certainty that the same standards apply to everyone,” Rep. Donni Steele (R-Orion Twp.) wrote in a press release accompanying the letter.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A spokesperson for the House GOP confirmed that, as of 1 p.m. on Wednesday, the lawmakers had not received a response from the athletic association. 
LGBTQ+ advocates at Equality Michigan in the state pushed back on those claims coming from Republican legislators, adding that coverage of the student has led to “singling out a minor and encouraging adults to attack a child online.”
“Kids should be able to play sports without being targeted online and bullied by adults,” wrote Erin Knott, the executive director of Equality Michigan, in a statement. 
Current Michigan High School Athletics Association guidelines do not prohibit transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams at the high school level, but do require submission of documentation that details the gender listed on a number of documents for the student, as well as information on the status of the student’s medical transition. 
“The MHSAA executive director will determine eligibility for MHSAA tournaments on a case-by-case basis,” guidelines read, as well as requiring a student, or their parents if the student is a minor, to waive certain privacy rights to disclose relevant information to the association. 










Let’s be clear about what is going on here. One right-wing sports blog has spent months attending games to surveil students, digging through a minor’s legal records, and publishing 11 articles encouraging strangers to target a child. They are putting children in harm’s way.


– Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan


The letter from lawmakers asks the Michigan High School Athletics Association to “immediately confirm whether a complete and approved gender-identity waiver was received and approved before the athlete’s first regular-season contest in 2025,” and to declare the student ineligible for the remainder of the postseason if the waiver was not approved. 
The question of this student’s eligibility was first raised by a right-wing sports blog that features figures including anti-trans activist Riley Gaines, which has published nearly a dozen articles on this student since September. 
“Let’s be clear about what is going on here. One right-wing sports blog has spent months attending games to surveil students, digging through a minor’s legal records, and publishing 11 articles encouraging strangers to target a child,” Knott wrote in her statement. “They are putting children in harm’s way.”
LGBTQ+ advocates condemn House resolution asking to bar transgender girls from high school sports

Transgender girls and women in sports have been the target of conservative attacks in recent years, and President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February banning transgender athletes from any women’s or girls’ sports team. However, the Michigan High School Athletics Association has continued to allow participation under the waiver guidelines, in line with Michigan’s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which was updated in 2023 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity. 
As of March, when Republican lawmakers put forth a bill to ban all transgender athletes in Michigan from girls’ and women’s sports teams in alignment with Trump’s order, the association had received and granted just two waivers for transgender students to participate in high school sports in the state — out of around 175,000 high school athletes.

As Delaware’s first integrated high school marks the legacy of the “First Five,” Salesianum leans on its civil rights roots to form “Salesian Gentlemen” grounded in faith, service and justice.







WILMINGTON, Del. — Seventy-five years ago, five teenage boys walked quietly into Salesianum School and changed Delaware history.
On Nov. 14, 1950, Thomas Connell, Alfred Connell, James Owens, Fred Smith and Willie Jones — now known as the “Quintus Five” or “First Five” — became the first Black students to enroll at the all-boys Catholic high school in Wilmington. Their admission, arranged by Principal the Rev. Thomas A. Lawless, made Salesianum the first racially integrated high school in Delaware, four years before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education.
Their decision did more than integrate one campus. It helped define Salesianum’s identity as a civil rights trailblazer and cemented its role as a Catholic institution committed to justice, faith and service.
A school shaped by faith and inclusion
Founded in 1903 by the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales, Salesianum was Delaware’s first Catholic high school for boys. From its earliest days, the school’s mission has been to form “Salesian Gentlemen” — young men devoted to faith, service and leadership under the motto “Live Jesus.”
When the Quintus Five enrolled in 1950, that mission was put to the test. At a time when segregation was still the norm, their quiet arrival signaled that the school’s values would not remain theoretical. By opening its doors to Black students before any legal mandate, Salesianum took a public stand that Catholic education in Delaware would be measured, in part, by its commitment to human dignity and racial equality.
Over the decades, the school has produced generations of alumni who have gone on to leadership in business, government, education and community service. Many point back to the integration of 1950 as a turning point that helped shape Salesianum’s sense of responsibility to the broader community.
James Owens ’53 (last surviving member of Quintus 5)
Breaking barriers in Delaware education
In 1950, most schools in Delaware reflected the segregation laws and customs of the era. The decision to admit the Quintus Five into Salesianum’s student body broke that pattern.
Their presence shattered the racial barrier in Delaware’s Catholic high schools and set a precedent that rippled beyond one building on Broom Street. By integrating on principle — before court orders or political pressure — Salesianum offered an early model for how educational institutions could move toward equality.
Educators and community leaders now point to the Quintus Five as a reminder that Delaware’s story of desegregation did not begin or end in the courtroom. It also unfolded in hallways, classrooms and cafeterias, where teenagers learned, studied and played sports together in ways that had been almost unthinkable just a few years earlier.
Quiet courage, lasting leadership
Walking into a previously all-white high school in 1950 demanded courage. The climate of the time included entrenched segregation, open prejudice and resistance to social change.
Yet the Quintus Five chose to enroll, supported by their families and backed by school leadership. Their decision signaled to the wider community that Black students belonged in every classroom — not as an exception, but as equals.
That act of quiet courage has become part of Salesianum’s identity. Faculty and alumni say the story of the First Five continues to shape the school’s understanding of leadership, justice, and faith in action. It is held up as an example of how young people, simply by claiming their place, can help shift an entire community’s expectations.

A community legacy honored 75 years later
In 2025, Salesianum and the Wilmington community marked the 75th anniversary of the milestone with a series of tributes. The celebration included formal proclamations, the unveiling of a commemorative plaque on campus and a symbolic gesture that resonated deeply with students and alumni: the retirement of the number 5 from all Salesianum athletic uniforms.
The number, once just a jersey choice, is now reserved to honor the Quintus Five and their role in integrating the school. For student-athletes, it serves as a daily reminder that the privilege of wearing a uniform is tied to a much older struggle for inclusion and dignity.
At the anniversary events, James Owens — the last surviving member of the Quintus Five — addressed students directly, challenging them to pursue excellence while treating others with respect and humanity. His message underscored the belief that academic success, athletic achievement and moral responsibility belong together.
A hub for faith, service and civic life
Today, Salesianum remains a cornerstone of Wilmington’s Catholic and civic community. The school emphasizes the spirituality of St. Francis de Sales, encouraging students to integrate faith with action through service projects, outreach, and civic engagement.
A strong culture of brotherhood connects students, alumn,i and faculty, with mentorship that extends well beyond graduation. The school frequently partners with Wilmington nonprofits, parishes, and civic organizations, reinforcing its role as a community anchor.
Salesianum also continues to invest in its future and the city’s cultural life. In 2025, the school announced a historic $20 million gift to build a new Arts and Innovation Center, expanding opportunities in creativity, technology and leadership development for students.
Serving young men in grades 9–12 from across Delaware and neighboring states, the school promotes a whole-person approach to education — balancing academics, athletics, arts, and faith formation to develop compassionate, resilient leaders. Nearly all graduates are accepted into their first-choice colleges.
Students also participate in BRIDGE trips abroad, retreat,s and service-learning programs that broaden their worldview, linking the values first tested in 1950 to challenges facing communities around the globe today.
A story taught, not just remembered
The legacy of the Quintus Five is not limited to plaques, ceremonies or a retired jersey number. Their story is woven into Salesianum’s mission and curriculum, taught as an example of how Catholic education can respond to injustice.
Teachers use their experience to help students understand the lived realities of segregation and the responsibilities that come with privilege. Student leaders and alumni often point to the First Five as a call to action — a reminder that each generation has its own work to do in advancing justice and equity in schools and neighborhoods.
For families, especially those navigating issues of race, opportunity and education, the Quintus Five stand as proof that young people can be catalysts for systemic change.
For Wilmington, their story underscores the idea that progress is not solely the result of landmark court cases or sweeping legislation. It can also begin with a single open door, a single school leader willing to take a risk and five teenagers ready to walk through together.
And for alumni, the “Salesian Gentlemen” identity — shaped by faith, service and the example of the Quintus Five — continues to inspire a lifelong commitment to justice, community and faith.
Seventy-five years after they first entered Salesianum’s front doors, the impact of Thomas Connell, Alfred Connell, James Owens, Fred Smith and Willie Jones is still unfolding. Their bravery transformed a single high school into a beacon of integration and helped define a school that remains, to this day, a leader in education, service and innovation for Wilmington and Delaware.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-Mar-19-2024-12-53-22-AM-002.jpg,,,2025-11-19 14:58:13.932357

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)The federal Department of Energy closed a $1 billion loan to finance the restart of a nuclear reactor at the former Three Mile Island plant, where energy will be produced to power Microsoft data centers in PJM’s transmission region.
Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project. He added that the reactor will be a strong source of clean energy, which will offset the added demand on the power grid created by data centers.
“We’re appreciative of [the loan],” Rodgers said. “It’ll be helpful to Constellation. And for the government, we’re going to pay it back in full with interest, so ultimately the taxpayer will get a return.”

Three Mile Island was the site of one of the worst nuclear power disasters in U.S. history, when one of its two reactors partially melted down in 1979, releasing some radioactive material into the surrounding environment. While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.
The other on-site reactor, which shuttered in 2019, is what will be brought back online by Constellation Energy. It’s being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”
The taxpayer-backed loan is financed through the Trump administration’s Energy Dominance Financing Program, which will back projects aimed at boosting energy infrastructure capacity for the U.S. Artificial Intelligence industry.
The project, however, has faced some pushback from community members who live near the reactor, some of whom lived through the 1979 incident.
At a public hearing on the reopening in July, a number of people voiced concerns about the risks of another meltdown being shouldered by Middletown and the surrounding communities in Dauphin County, while virtually all of the energy created will go towards powering data centers.
Others spoke in support of the project, with many welcoming the construction jobs it will bring and the potential positive impacts on the local economy.

(Photo courtesy of Colorado Parks and Wildlife)With the third winter “release season” in Colorado’s gray wolf reintroduction plan just weeks away, state wildlife officials are scrambling to find a source for additional relocated wolves.
A deal to source up to 15 animals from British Columbia is in doubt after the federal government, under pressure from livestock groups and conservative activists, ordered Colorado Parks and Wildlife not to import Canadian wolves. Officials in the Republican-controlled states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, home to large and well-established wolf populations, have made it clear that they won’t help Colorado’s restoration efforts.
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

And one of Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s few remaining options was taken off the table Saturday when its request to capture and relocate wolves from Washington was rejected by wildlife commissioners there.
“I certainly heard loud and clear from Washingtonians this morning, (on) all different sides of the aisle, saying it’s just not the time for us to support this,” said Lorna Smith, a conservation advocate and member of the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission.
 Declining wolf populations in Washington a factor in denying Colorado’s request

Colorado’s restoration plan calls for annual releases of 10 to 15 relocated wolves for the program’s first three to five years, with an initial target population of 50 individuals. Colorado Parks and Wildlife captured and relocated 10 wolves from Oregon in December 2023 and another 15 from Canada in January 2025.
In an Oct. 28 letter to Washington wildlife officials, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis wrote that while the state’s goal is to secure up to 15 wolves again this winter, “even 5-7 would be extremely helpful towards successful species recovery.” Colorado Parks and Wildlife Director Jeff Davis, speaking to the commission in Washington on Saturday, reiterated that Colorado would cover the costs of capture and relocation operations, which could take place at any point through the end of February.
Washington’s reported wolf population declined in 2024 for the first time since confirmed wolf packs were reestablished in the state in 2008. Kelly Susewind, director of the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, told commissioners that the decision was up to them.
“We’ve assessed this with our staff — we feel that biologically, we can accommodate the request, should you choose to go that way, without interfering with our recovery effort,” said Susewind.
But on a motion from Smith, who cited the “cautionary message” of Washington’s declining 2024 wolf count, the commission voted 8-1 to deny Colorado’s request.
“I myself am really torn on this issue, because of course I’d love to see wolves recovered across the Rocky Mountain range, including Colorado,” Smith said. “But Washington’s wolves, I don’t believe are in a position to assist with that at this point in time.”
 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service orders state to halt any efforts to source wolves from outside a specified area

After two years of winter releases, Colorado currently has a population of around 20 adult or yearling gray wolves, with an unknown number of new pups born to four confirmed breeding packs in 2025. Survival rates for relocated wolves have been lower in Colorado than in previous reintroduction efforts in the northern Rockies, but Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials say their efforts are on the right track.
District Court in Montana hears arguments over wolf hunting regulations

Livestock groups — who opposed the 2020 voter-approved ballot measure requiring wolf restoration and have sought to delay or pause its implementation ever since — scored their biggest victory to date in the fight against the program last month, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ordered Colorado Parks and Wildlife to halt any efforts to source wolves from outside a specified area in the northern Rockies, including Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and eastern portions of Washington and Oregon.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service letter claims that sourcing wolves from outside the northern Rockies is “violative” of the permit the agency issued for Colorado’s experimental wolf population under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act. But while the state’s 10(j) permit, issued in 2023, identifies northern Rockies wolves as a “preferred donor population,” it does not contain any such requirement or limitation on relocation operations.
“The 10(j) rule does not mandate that Colorado’s wolves come from specific states, period,” Thomas Delehanty, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement at the time.
While Polis wrote in his letter to Washington officials that the state “disagree(s) with the legal basis for (the USFWS) analysis,” Davis said at last week’s meeting of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission that Colorado Parks and Wildlife is “working very diligently to be consistent with the letter.”
As it has for every year of the reintroduction program’s operation, a coalition of livestock groups and rural county commissioners has submitted a petition to pause additional wolf releases until at least November 2026.
In a brief statement Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Luke Perkins said the agency “continues to evaluate all options to support this year’s gray wolf releases in alignment with the approved Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan and the 10(j) Rule.”

Jackson officials requested more time to review the financial records of JXN Water, the third-party utility running the city’s water and sewer systems. The city and utility reached an agreement over access to the records just prior to the status conference. 
Jackson City Attorney Drew Martin told Wingate the city would have an official response to the court on Dec. 19 after presenting its findings to the city council on Dec. 16. 
JXN Water first brought up the need for a rate increase in a financial report in February in which it said the utility was quickly running out of money. It then formerly proposed the increase — which it said would be come out to about 12% on the average bill — in April. The Jackson City Council unanimously voted it down.
Mayor John Horhn, who took office in July, has also spoken out against the increase. Under Wingate’s 2022 order appointing Ted Henifin to take charge of the utility, Henifin doesn’t need the city’s approval to move forward with the proposal. The order only requires JXN Water to present the increase to the city, and that it wait 365 days between increases.

Despite the mayor and city council already speaking against the proposal, the city argued in court that it needed access to JXN Water’s financial records to offer an informed opinion. The city’s agreement with JXN Water gives Jackson’s financial adviser full access to the utility’s records, with a stipulation that the city not release any information from the records publicly without first consulting Henifin.
Wingate’s 2022 order shields JXN Water from any public records requirements, although intervenors in the case, represented by the ACLU, argued against the exception. 
Mitch McGuffey, attorney for JXN Water, emphasized the need to enact the rate increase before the year ends. Waiting would push back when the utility could increase rates again because of the 365-day requirement, he said. In addition to the 12% increase this year, JXN Water plans to implement smaller increases in 2027 and beyond to keep up with inflation. 
Overall, the utility is losing $1.2 million a month from a lack of revenue, McGuffey added. Henifin also pointed to funds needed to repair two large sewer overflows, one on Mill Street and another along I-55 in north Jackson. 
In the end, Wingate sided with the city, and kept an injunction in place preventing JXN Water from advertising a rate increase. Under the judge’s order, the utility needs to inform the public of any increase 30 days before it goes into effect. If the judge were to allow JXN Water to go forward with the increase on Dec. 19, the earliest it would go into effect would be Jan. 18, 2026. 
By the time of the next meeting, the city may also have new information on restructuring its bond payments as well as on any efforts from the state Legislature to provide new revenue to JXN Water, Martin, the city attorney, added. McGuffey agreed that such changes could reduce how much the utility needs to raise rates.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/19124934/IMG_6111.jpg,,,2025-11-19 14:58:13.932357

(Image by Montana Department of Commerce)The Montana Department of Commerce is polling people on new designs for the state’s “Welcome to Montana” highway signs that greet travelers at the border.
This spring, Gov. Greg Gianforte and Commerce unveiled an update of the state’s branding — the first update in more than a decade — with a new logo, color scheme and imagery.
Now, the department is looking to revamp the state’s highway signs to reflect the new look.
“There’s no better feeling than crossing state lines back home to Montana,” Gianforte said in a press release. “Our highway signs give our families, friends and visitors the warm welcome they deserve. I am excited to see what Montanans choose.”
Three designs have been selected for Montanans to vote on, each incorporating aspects of the new brand and elements of the state.
Mitch Staley, chief marketing officer for the state, describes the designs as a “1990’s style license plate line, the middle design that is very similar to the welcome signs previously displayed prior to 2014 and a new design that features the mountains and badlands landscapes that make our entire state a one of one.”
“Commerce has opted to have one design for all state entrances for brand recognition and strength. We’re confident these signs will be as iconic as signs of the past,” Staley told the Daily Montanan.
Commerce’s website for voting on the sign designs, visitmt.com/welcome-sign is live now and voting is open until Dec. 31, 2025.
Current highway welcome signs were installed in 2014, according to the department. The Montana Department of Transportation will work to install the new welcome signs next spring once weather and access allows, as many of the state’s border crossings are on mountain passes.
Currently, the state’s welcome sign designs include various animals, including black bears, pronghorn and elk, and vivid landscapes including Glacier National Park, riverscapes and prairie lands.

Kevin Steele filed to run as Florida chief financial officer, a local fire captain on Wednesday became the first candidate to announce his bid to replace Steele in House District 55.
Walter Price hopes to succeed Steele in the Pasco district, according to a press release announcing his candidacy. He also announced the support of state Sen. Ed Hooper, the chamber’s appropriations chair, and Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco.
Walter Price is running to replace Rep. Kevin Steele in HD 55 (Via Walter Price).
“As a firefighter and community servant, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges our families face and the strength which makes Pasco County such a special place to live,” the Republican said in a statement. “I’m running for the Florida House to ensure our community’s voice is heard — to protect our families, strengthen public safety, and help small businesses thrive.”
Rep. Steele, whose term ends in 2026, announced Tuesday morning that he had filed to run for chief financial officer with the support of U.S. Sen. Rick Scott. Steele is challenging incumbent CFO Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican appointed to the post in July by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The race could prove contentious, reinvigorating a 2015 clash between Ingoglia and Scott — by proxy — when Ingoglia defeated Scott’s choice for Republican Party of Florida chair. There’s speculation that Steele may be endorsed by President Donald Trump, although he told the Phoenix after a committee meeting Tuesday that he’ll “let the announcements speak for themselves.”
He didn’t clarify what announcements, nor from whom. Steele did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on whether he’d back Price as his replacement.
Price, who has yet to file to run in the deep-red district, has served as a captain with Pasco County Fire Rescue for the past decade. He’s largely stayed out of the political sphere, although in 2010 he ran for Pasco County property appraiser.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)The hospitalization of an Ada County infant with suspected botulism is believed to be linked to a national recall of an infant formula, Idaho health officials say.
The case is the only one in Idaho that state officials believe is linked to the recall of ByHeart Whole Nutrition’s infant formula. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is investigating the source of the contamination. 
The recalled formula was available in stores throughout Idaho, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced in a news release Wednesday.
According to the release, parents should stop using any ByHeart infant formula products immediately and should wash items and surfaces that may have touched the formula using hot soapy water or a dishwasher.
“While infant botulism is rare, it can progress quickly and requires prompt medical attention,” said Idaho state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn. “We want parents and caregivers to know that we are working closely with our federal partners to understand the extent of this outbreak and ensure that affected products are removed from circulation. If your baby has consumed this formula, please watch for symptoms and seek medical care right away.”
Infant botulism is a rare, serious illness. Symptoms, which usually start as soon as 18 hours after digestion but can take up to 30 days, include:

Constipation
Difficulty swallowing or poor feeding
Weak facial expressions
Loss of head control

If a child does develop symptoms, the local public health district may want to collect the formula container for testing and may ask for product information, such as the lot number and best by date on the formula, the release said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, announced Wednesday he will run again for the state Senate, ending his consideration of a gubernatorial bid in 2026.
Bousselot had announced an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor in April, shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds had said she would not seek reelection. The Ankeny Republican said he had received encouragement from several other Republicans to consider running for the top state leadership position, including from former Gov. Terry Branstad. Bousselot served as Branstad’s chief of staff and as director of the Department of Management for Reynolds before his election to the Iowa Senate in a 2021 special election.
“I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and encouragement from Iowans regarding my potential campaign for governor,” Bousselot said. “While visiting dozens of counties this summer, I heard the stories of optimism for our state and opportunity for their families. Ultimately, after prayer and reflection with my family, it is not the right time for me to pursue a run for governor.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Iowa Republicans will have an open gubernatorial primary field in 2026, the first time in more than a decade that the race will not include an incumbent GOP governor. Bousselot was one of several interested parties to throw their hats in the ring after Reynolds’ announcement — others included U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, state Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman, who have all launched official campaigns. Adam Steen, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, and Zach Lahn, who has worked for the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, have also joined the race in recent months.
On the Democrats’ side, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and Julie Stauch, a Democratic political consultant, are running to become their party’s nominee for governor. Bousselot has made critical remarks about Sand, who is considered the frontrunner in the primary race, for trying to appeal to Republican and moderate voters in his campaign. He has also claimed Sand is not adequately performing his duties as state auditor, saying Sand “has been running for governor since the day he was elected auditor, and not doing the job.”
Other high-profile Republicans, like Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and state House Speaker Pat Grassley, had said they were considering running for governor earlier in the year, but ultimately chose not to pursue a campaign.
Bousselot said he will seek reelection to the Iowa Senate in a new seat — Senate District 23, currently held by former Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver. Bousselot currently represents District 21.
District 23, which encompasses parts of Polk and Dallas counties including areas of Bondurant, Polk City and Grimes, will be an open seat in the 2026 election as Whitver announced in September he was stepping down from his leadership role and would not run for reelection.
Whitver, who has held the majority leader position since 2018, was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2024, and said treatment has shown positive progress but remains ongoing. Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, was elected later in September to take over as Senate majority leader. Whitver said in a statement he supported Bousselot’s run for his seat.
“He is a humble, hard-working legislator who listens to his constituents and serves his district and the state well,” Whitver said.
Bousselot said he is “so grateful for the opportunity to serve in the Iowa Senate,” and believes there is more work to be done in the Legislature to improve life for Iowans.
“Important work remains on making Iowa more affordable, a more competitive environment for business and investment, improving education for Iowa kids, and keeping our communities safe,” Bousselot said. “For those reasons and to continue serving my state, I am seeking re-election to the Iowa Senate … and look forward to earning the support of voters.”

[Photo/Courtesy]A coal-fueled power plant in West Olive, Mich. which was originally set to shut down at the end of May will continue operating after President Donald Trump’s Administration issued another extension. 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the first order prolonging the plant’s lifespan on May 23, with the Department of Energy saying the move was intended to minimize blackouts in the Midwest ahead of high energy demand expected over the summer, despite projections from the energy grid operator, MISO, that it would have enough energy supply to meet expected consumer demand. 
The latest order will extend operations for the plant through Feb. 17, 2026.
Consumers Energy, which owns the plant, initially sought a shut down of the plant in 2021 as part of its plan to go coal free and transition to clean energy resources. The shutdown was approved by Michigan’s energy regulators, the Michigan Public Service Commission, alongside the grid operator, which determined the shutdown would not violate its reliability criteria.  
Consumers Energy projected the plant’s closure would save energy customers $650 million by 2040. However, between May 23 and Sept. 30, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day.
Additionally, testimony presented as part of a legal challenge to the extension found that during the grid operator’s tightest energy margin over the summer, they had an energy surplus greater than the 10 times the amount of energy produced by the Campbell plant. 
In a statement, Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The costs to operate the Campbell plant will be shared by customers across the Midwest electric grid region – not solely by Consumers Energy customers,” Wheeler said. “We are planning to submit a cost recovery filing to [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] later this year outlining net costs to operate the plant during the first 90 days.”
Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the environmental groups challenging the Department of Energy’s previous orders, called the mandate a “guaranteed way to needlessly hike up Americans’ electricity bills and make air pollution worse.”
“These half-a-century old plants are simply too expensive to operate, too dangerous for our health and break down too often to be counted on,” Kelly said. “To keep costs down, we should be unleashing – not blocking – the cheapest, fastest and cleanest sources of electricity onto our grid, including solar, wind and battery projects.”
Alex Kellogg, the federal energy accountability manager for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters said in a statement that the Trump administration had guaranteed a rate hike, slamming Trump’s energy emergency order as a sham to keep the plant operating. 
“His move to keep Campbell open is making our bills higher and our energy dirtier just to score political points with the dying coal industry that backed him heavily in the election,” Kellogg said. 
Activists, officials call for closure of Ottawa County coal plant as utility looks to recover costs

Michael Lenoff, a senior attorney at EarthJustice, which is also challenging the Department of Energy’s previous orders, emphasized the environmental toll of keeping the plant running.
“These aging coal power plants are increasingly unreliable and prone to breaking down,” Lenoff said. “They’re also filthy, dumping toxics into nearby waters (such as Lake Michigan) and spewing pollutants into the air we breathe.”
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is also disputing the Department of Energy’s past orders, the plant releases several millions of pounds of health-harming pollutants and more than 10 billion pounds of carbon dioxide into the air each year. It also releases roughly 100,000 pounds of water pollution into Lake Michigan each year, including 10,000 pounds of toxic metals.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,,,2025-11-19 13:58:54.552824

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)State Treasurer Stacy Garrity announced Wednesday that interest will be forgiven on loans her office awarded to counties and human service providers that were impacted by the budget impasse.
Garrity began offering loans with a 4.5% interest rate for some services, like pre-K programs and rape crisis centers, roughly three months into the impasse that saw state funding dry up after the June 30 deadline.
They were intended as a lifeline for local governments and human service providers which faced difficult choices over whether to cut programming and staffing, dip into their reserves, or seek potentially higher-interest loans from more traditional sources.
“The ability to waive interest is monumental, ensuring that every dollar can be channeled directly into the essential services that impact the lives of our friends and neighbors who depend on the vital support these organizations provide,” Garrity said in a press release.

Loans totaling more than $42.2 million were given to 62 organizations, including one county government, two rape and domestic violence crisis centers, 13 Head Start agencies and 46 Pre-K Counts providers.
The program, however, became a controversial one as negotiations over the 2025-2026 budget dragged on until an agreement was reached earlier this month.
Some Democratic lawmakers said that the Treasury Department did not have the authority to provide such loans unilaterally. Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office also argued that the move allowed Garrity’s Republican allies at the state Capitol to prop her up politically by dragging out negotiations. Garrity is the current frontrunner in the Republican gubernatorial primary to unseat Shapiro in 2026. She has received the endorsement of GOP legislative leaders. 
But some recipients praised the program.
“The Budget Bridge Loan served as a powerful strategic boost that kept FCCA moving forward during a difficult transitional period,” Jackie L. Roberson Jr., executive director of the Family Children & Community Association was quoted as saying in a Treasury press release.
However, when the loan program was first announced, they came with an interest rate of 4.5%. Some eligible recipients said they would be unable to shoulder even that cost.
The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, for example, said in early October that they were eligible for a loan of around $5.8 million, but would be unable to afford the roughly $260,000 in interest they expected to pay.
Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said he welcomed the attempt to ease counties’ burden during the impasse, even if most counties were hesitant to take up loans because of the expected 4.5% interest.
“I think a lot of our members didn’t feel right asking taxpayers to foot that burden,” Kopko said.
Questions over the legality of the program were effectively settled when the 2025-2026 budget passed last week with a provision allowing the interest on the loans to be forgiven, and clarifying that future treasurers will not have the authority to unilaterally make similar moves going forward.
Kopko, however, said that the association  will advocate for interest-free loans for counties during future budget impasses going forward.

(Getty Images)The New Hampshire Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an attempt by a police officer to remove her name from New Hampshire’s Laurie List — the state’s database of officers with reported credibility concerns — despite the officer’s arguments that the conduct was long ago and irrelevant.
The case stemmed from an incident in 2013 in which a Concord police officer was fired after being accused of obtaining a colleague’s firearm without permission and lying to superiors about it.
The officer, referred to anonymously as “Jane Doe” in the opinion, had taken the colleague’s firearm with her on a trip to transport a prisoner to a hospital. The colleague had realized the gun was missing from its locker and had alerted her supervisors. Those supervisors called Jane Doe at the hospital and asked her to read the serial number of her firearm. After the number matched the colleague’s gun, Doe allegedly gave conflicting and false accounts to those supervisors over the incident, according to the court.
After an internal affairs investigation found that Doe “struggled to answer specific questions” about what happened, Doe was fired and the Concord Police Department submitted her name to the “exculpatory evidence schedule” 
That list exists to let prosecutors know of any past misconduct that could be a liability if prosecutors put an officer on the stand in a criminal trial. 
In order for a police officer to be added to the list by the Department of Justice, there must be a “sustained finding that the officer has engaged in conduct negatively reflecting on the officer’s trustworthiness or credibility,” according to the state statute. 
Doe later sued Concord, alleging gender discrimination and wrongful termination, and obtained a settlement with the city in which the city agreed to move her disciplinary records out of her personnel file and officially label her departure a “negotiated resignation.”
Years later, and after the 2021 passage of a law requiring public release of the Laurie List, Doe brought legal action against Concord and the Department of Justice seeking to remove her name from the list before it was released. 
Doe argued she should not have been added to the list because her “alleged misstatement of fact” did not rise to the level of being potentially exculpatory evidence in any future criminal court case. She contended that the factual record surrounding the firearm was “immaterial to any policy violation.”
Doe also argued that because the disciplinary documents relating to the firearm incident were removed from her personnel file, she should not have been added to the Laurie List. 
And she said it is unlikely that she would be a witness in any foreseeable criminal cases, and that her inclusion in the published list “would serve no purpose other than to publicly embarrass her.”
But the Supreme Court rejected that argument and said the mere fact that it is unlikely for Doe to serve as a future witness is not enough for her to be excluded from the list. The real test, the court held, is whether the officer’s misconduct would or would not be admissible by a court during a trial; if it would, the likelihood of the trial happening does not make a difference.
“There is no dispute that, after multiple proceedings, the plaintiff was found to have been untruthful,” the court ruled. “The sustained findings that the plaintiff lied to her colleagues and supervisors could be admissible to impeach her credibility if, in the future, there arises a criminal case at which she is called as a witness.”
Since the 2021 law, the Supreme Court has heard several cases in which officers have asked for their names to be removed, and in some cases, the court has ruled with the officers. On Tuesday, the court reiterated that officers should only remain on the list if their alleged misconduct relates to their truthfulness — misconduct allegations that don’t involve deceit or lying are likely not relevant for the Laurie List.
“We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiff’s personnel information contains ‘potentially exculpatory evidence,’” the court concluded Wednesday.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/policesirens-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 13:58:54.552824

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)The New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Care Department this week presented an $8.2 million budget request to state lawmakers, which includes an 11% funding increase from last year.
ALTSD Secretary Emily Kaltenbach met with the New Mexico Legislature’s interim Legislative Finance Committee Monday to discuss several priorities the department’s budget request will address, including expanding Adult Protective Services, community-based aging programs, emergency readiness and outreach efforts.
“New Mexico’s older adults need a strong, responsive support network,” Kaltenbach said in a written statement. “Each year, we see more aging seniors aging in need — this budget strengthens frontline services families rely on, invests in protection for our most vulnerable, and positions us to be prepared for the future.”
According to Kaltenbach’s presentation, New Mexico’s population of people 65 and older is expected to increase by more than 80,000 people between 2020 and 2040, with Catron, Harding and Sierra counties reporting the highest percentages of adults 60 and older. The presentation also noted that 42% of New Mexico seniors have an annual income of less than $40,000, and 9% of seniors receive less than $10,000 annually.
“What’s concerning is those are rural counties that have fewer services and supports, fewer family members, longer distances to travel for support. So we’re very focused on looking ahead to make sure that we’re building out systems of care to support our older adults across all of New Mexico,” Kaltenbach told committee members.
She explained that the increase to the budget proposal includes $1.5 million to fund about a dozen full-time investigative caseworkers and supervisors for Adult Protective Services; $500,000 to add 30 to 35 slots for the Senior Employment Program; $5 million to “strengthen” direct services and increase participation at senior centers, particularly for Tribes, Pueblos and Nations; and about $1 million for departmental operational costs. 
The department is also asking for $2.6 million for special budget requests, which include funds for the annual New Mexico Conference on Aging, educational outreach and emergency preparedness.

Kaltenbach noted that the number of reports to Adult Protective Services and subsequent investigations have increased year-to-year, with more than 15,000 reports made in the 2025 fiscal year. Kaltenbach said the division anticipates increasing to 18,000 reports this year.
“These cases are more complex. We’re dealing with behavioral health issues,” she said. “This is a critical safety net service for our older adults. This is addressing abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Not only are they out in the homes doing these investigations, we also do a lot of prevention work.” 
She added that the Aging Network Division also provides “safety net services” such as food, transportation, respite care, caregiving and homemaker services. Food insecurity is “top of mind,” Kaltenbach said, particularly because of the large number of seniors in New Mexico who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and recent delays to federal funding.
“Our senior center providers are in crisis mode,” Kaltenbach said. “Some of them were concerned about closing their doors…Our $5 million ask is both to keep the lights on and expand services.”
Rep. Rebecca Dow (R-Truth or Consequences) told Kaltenbach during the meeting that she was “very concerned” about the department’s budget, particularly because her district in the southwest part of the state — including Sierra County — is home to large numbers of rural seniors. She said the “most cost effective way” for seniors to remain in their communities and age in place is to “adequately fund the programs” run by ALTSD. 
She said her 74-year-old mother and her 72-year-old aunt are among the older New Mexicans living in rural communities and being supported by family members.
“[Seniors are] choosing between the copays they have for their health insurance and the programs, the supplemental programs that they have to add and the costs they have for their prescription medication, and they’re choosing between food. And it is absolutely heartbreaking,” Dow said. “We have to fund this.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HK7A0115-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 13:58:54.552824

(Photo by Janine L.

The dozen members include representatives from philanthropic and community organizations, employees, and maternal health experts whose role will be to offer guidance and recommendations during a review process that will continue through the spring. Their first meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 24, at the hospital, Rhode Island Current has learned.
The meeting will not be open to the public, Nicole Searles, a spokesperson for the hospital said.
Newport Hospital birthing center supporters pack special meeting at City Hall

The panel’s formation follows up on a commitment made in July by the hospital’s operator, Brown University Health, in response to public outcry over the possibility that the health system could shut down the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center. A special meeting of the Newport City Council on July 15, drew 200 people to witness the council pass a resolution advocating for the birthing center’s continued operation.
Brown University Health President and CEO John Fernandez originally referred to the group as a “task force” charged with assessing the birthing center’s quality of care, patient safety, access, finances, operations, and its impact on the community and statewide, according to a July 29 memo. The group would conduct its work over the next year, Fernandez said then.
The 12 panel participants are: 

Lori Allan, RN – The Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center 
Carol Bazarsky – Newport Hospital Foundation Board 
Emily Blosser, MD – Obstetrician-Gynecologist, Medical Director, Newport Women’s Health 
Alex Hammer Ducas – Social Enterprise Greenhouse

Rebecca Hurd, CNA, CLC – The Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center 
Elizabeth Lynn – van Beuren Charitable Foundation

Latisha Michel, CLC, CBE, CHW – Certified Perinatal Doula, Ready Set Latch Go, LLC 
Sydney Ormerod – Women’s Resource Center, Newport Health Equity Zone (HEZ) 
Alexandra Quick, PT, DPT – Mae Physiotherapy 
Methodius Tuuli, MD – Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women & Infants Hospital  

“We are grateful to the members of the panel for generously agreeing to bring their time, experience, and perspectives to an important dialogue about the future of maternity care in our region” the hospital’s president and chief medical officer, Dr. Tenny Thomas, said in a statement. “We look forward to working collaboratively with the panel. Their valuable community input is vital as we plan for the future of the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center.” 
Searles said the panel will not have a chairperson.
The birthing center opened in 1995 and was named in honor of Newport philanthropist Noreen Stonor Drexel in 2003. Drexel, who passed away in 2012, made improving health care and education a primary focus of her work. The birthing center’s work supporting and educating new breastfeeding mothers earned it a “Baby Friendly” designation from the World Health Organization and UNICEF in 2004, when it became the 40th U.S. hospital to earn that distinction.
The birthing center recorded a total of 479 births in 2024, according to Rhode Island Department of Health data. Women and Infants Hospital in Providence had 8,229 births.
South County Hospital in South Kingstown had 729 births while Kent County Memorial Hospital in Warwick had 450 and Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket had 432.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Ethics Commission member Murray Sagsveen no longer has the support to continue serving beyond his expired term, Gov. Kelly Armstrong argued Wednesday.
The governor and two other members of the Ethics Commission Selection Committee remained at a stalemate over reappointing Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney.
Sagsveen’s term ended Aug. 31, but he has continued serving until the position is filled. Armstrong argued that a lack of consensus from the committee means Sagsveen can no longer serve. He said he plans to send Sagsveen a letter at 5 p.m. Wednesday outlining his position.
“It is by our discretion and our discretion alone,” Armstrong said. “He no longer has that consensus.”
Vacancies to the Ethics Commission are filled by a consensus vote of the governor and the Senate majority and minority leaders, according to the constitutional amendment that created the agency. The selection committee has now met four times without coming to an agreement about reappointing Sagsveen. Armstrong, who has argued that a “reset” is needed on the commission, said Wednesday it is “untenable” for Sagsveen to continue serving.
While the selection committee met in the governor’s conference room, the Ethics Commission held its monthly meeting at the Capitol. Ethics Commission Executive Director Rebecca Binstock said during the meeting that the commission has always operated under the policy of commissioners serving until they’re replaced.
“That has been a longstanding policy of the commission,” Binstock said. “Early on, it was included in the code of ethics that ensured that commissioners knew they were subject to that.”

Binstock said that forcing commissioners to step down after their terms end could leave the commission in a situation where they can’t meet quorum.
Armstrong disagrees with that stance. 
“How long is the wrong question. Under what authority is the right question. It’s not until his replacement is picked. It is by consensus of this group,” Armstrong said. “Only we by consensus can agree Mr. Sagsveen’s service past his expired term is necessary for the commission to carry out its essential work.”
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan have advocated for keeping Sagsveen on to promote continuity.
Hogue, R-Minot, who has called Sagsveen his “top pick” among other finalists, said he was sympathetic to the governor’s position and agreed an appointee should not be able to serve permanently after their term has expired. Hogan, D-Fargo, said she would be gathering additional legal opinions on the subject. 
Also Wednesday, the selection committee appointed Fargo attorney Mark Western to a position on the Ethics Commission.
Western will fill the remainder of the term set to expire next summer that was vacated by the death of former Ethics Commission Chair Dave Anderson. 
“I would hope that we could reappoint him next summer,” Hogue said. 
Previously the selection committee appointed Pam Sharp, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, to another opening on the commission.

Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has signed leases for an additional 22,000 square feet of privately owned office space in Waterbury as it prepares for the governor’s controversial return to office mandate to take effect starting Dec. 1.
The state inked three agreements Monday for offices on Pilgrim Park Road, which is near the southern end of downtown Waterbury. The buildings are a short distance from the Waterbury State Office Complex, which sits on the other side of South Main Street.
Monday’s leases include about 4,260 square feet on the first floor of 5 Pilgrim Park Road, 12,000 square feet on the second floor of 5 Pilgrim Park Road and 5,400 square feet on the second floor of 93 Pilgrim Park Road, according to the agreements, which were provided to VTDigger. All three office spaces are for the Vermont Agency of Human Services, according to the leases.
The agreements take effect Dec. 1 and run through November 2030. The state is set to pay about $430,000 for all three office spaces over its first year renting them.

“If you are planning to travel by plane over the winter holidays and need to renew your REAL ID or obtain one for the first time, we urge you not to wait — go online or visit your local BMV soon,” said Cathie Curtis, deputy secretary of the state for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. According to the department, more than 70,000 REAL ID driver’s licenses are due for renewal in the next year.
Since the federal government began requiring travelers to present a REAL ID or passport to fly commercially and enter certain federal buildings, Maine BMV offices have seen “record-breaking number of customers,” Curtis said. 
As of Nov. 1, more than 430,000 Mainers had a REAL ID, an increase of 131,000 this year. A REAL ID issued by the State of Maine bears a gold outline of the state with a star in the upper right-hand corner of the card.
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said the online portal will reduce BMV traffic “helping to open up more availability for in-person services for those who need them and reducing wait times at branches.”
Residents using online renewal cannot change any information on their current license or ID card and will need their social security number and a valid credit card to complete the transaction in the online portal.
Initiated as a security measure in the wake of 9/11, REAL IDs allow for some information sharing between states. Before their implementation, critics raised concern about personal privacy and potential for data breaches. 
Having a REAL ID is optional and a standard Maine ID is valid for all in-state purposes.

The ruling came after the North Carolina Assisted Living Association and dozens of companies challenged the 8% cut to Medicaid rates for personal care services in administrative court. 
Personal care services involve feeding people, helping them walk, bathe, and use the bathroom. 
In affidavits, adult care home operators said that they had cut non-essential staff, switched to lower quality, less expensive food vendors, and even trained maintenance staff to provide direct care.  Some administrators added direct care work to their duties. 
Operators said that if the cuts continued, they would have to close or stop accepting people who are insured with Medicaid. 
Administrative Law Judge John C. Evans on Nov. 7 ordered the state to pay adult care homes the full Medicaid rate for personal care services. The order blocking the rate cut is meant to preserve the status quo until a decision on the assisted living companies’ petition for a preliminary injunction is decided. The order expires on Nov. 24, unless a court extends it. The case was assigned to a mediator. 
The assisted living association is the second group to successfully avoid Medicaid rate cuts suspended, at least temporarily, since the state Department of Health and Human Services imposed them on Oct. 1. Providers of autism therapy won relief from a 10% rate cut in Wake Superior Court last week. 
NCDHHS reduced provider rates because it said the state legislature did not provide enough money to cover Medicaid expenses for the entire fiscal year. A dispute between Republicans in the state House and Senate prevented legislative approval of additional funds. 
Leading Republicans have since united in their criticisms of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, calling the rate cuts premature. Republicans claim Medicaid has enough money to pay its bills into next year while waiting for additional funds to be approved.
In their petition, lawyers for the adult care homes maintained that the rate cut violates state and federal law. DHHS does not have the authority to reduce the Medicaid personal care service rates set in state law, the complaint said. Moreover, Medicaid rates can’t be cut unless the federal government approves, the complaint said.
State lawyers representing NCDHHS said in their written response to the complaint that the agency did not violate state law or federal regulations. Adult care operators’ statements about harms did not show they were immediate or irreparable, or that they were caused by the rate cuts, the state lawyers wrote. 
The judge’s decision underscores the need for the legislature to appropriate additional funds to Medicaid, NCDHHS said in a statement this week. 
“Any reinstatement or reversal of the provider cuts without additional funding from the General Assembly means the program will run out of funding sooner, putting the entire state Medicaid system at risk,” the NCDHHS statement said. 
If the legislature fully funds Medicaid, the agency said, “the Department will reevaluate all cuts and take action to reverse or modify cuts to ensure NC Medicaid can operate within the appropriated budget.   
“We understand these provider rate cuts are devastating to people, providers and communities that rely on NC Medicaid,” the statement continued. “NCDHHS did not want to take this extremely difficult step of making these significant reductions for NC Medicaid services. However without additional funding from the General Assembly, it was unavoidable.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/justice-scales-gavel_GettyImages-1536x1010-1-1024x673.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 12:57:33.699844

The move came at the request of the D.C. National Guard and was authorized by Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, according to a news release.
“Hoosiers are proud of our Guardsmen, who are well-trained and fully prepared for this mission,” Braun said. “We are grateful for their service and support in our nation’s capital.”
The deployment is part of a federal mission — under the command of the D.C. National Guard — which is supporting efforts by civilian agencies and local law enforcement to reduce crime and minimize property damage in the district. Indiana members will replace soldiers and airmen from other states who have been mobilized since August.
“National Guard soldiers and airmen are uniquely qualified to help in these types of situations. Our Hoosier Guardsmen regularly prepare, train and work side-by-side with civilian first responders, and our Guardsmen are ready for this mission as well,” said Maj. Gen. Larry Muennich, the Indiana National Guard’s adjutant general.
Members will train at Camp Atterbury prior to departure in early December. Additional training will be provided by the D.C. National Guard when Hoosier troops arrive.
Most hail from units based in Bloomington and Gary, home to field artillery and engineer battalions.
The mission is expected to last four months at most.

(Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)New Mexico’s youth repeatedly return to juvenile jails in large part because of a lack of prevention programs and gaps in behavioral health services, according to a new Legislative Finance Committee report.
The committee presented its findings to state lawmakers Tuesday afternoon and warned that secure facilities operated by the state Children, Youth and Families Department have seen increases in detained kids since hitting a low-point in fiscal year 2021. Staffing challenges have compounded those increases and led some county juvenile jails to turn away children who face charges, while portions of CYFD facilities with beds and cells sit empty due to inadequate staffing.
Juvenile justice issues are acutely felt in New Mexico, which often ranks 50th for overall child well-being in the national Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Kids Count report. In fact, New Mexico’s children face disproportionately high risks of becoming involved with the criminal justice system because they experience outsized rates of adverse childhood experiences like gang involvement, physical abuse and household substance abuse, according to the LFC report.
The report, which primarily focused on CYFD facilities where children are sentenced after courts adjudicate their criminal cases, attributes the rise in incarceration to CYFD officials increasingly overriding the results of their risk-assessment tests to detain “low-risk” children, as well as to an increase in charges of battery, fighting, carrying a deadly weapon on school property and cannabis possession in restricted areas.
“Most juvenile justice referrals are for misdemeanors, rather than for felonies,” Guillermo Caraveo, an LFC program evaluator who co-presented the report to state lawmakers, said on Tuesday. “New Mexico has not redirected funds to build a system of preventative and treatment services for youth,” which results in those children returning to the justice system.
When CYFD diverts children from incarceration, the report says the agency doesn’t track the   “specific services, sanctions, or alternatives” the youth receive. Once those children and teenagers are released, they often encounter a lack of mental health resources across the state.
And detention comes with a steep price tag: $345,000 annually to detain a child in one of CYFD’s secure facilities, the report said. By comparison, the annual cost of community supervision by a juvenile probation officer runs less than $15,000 per child and the annual cost of delinquency prevention programs is $836 per child, the report said.
“We can graduate a kid from Harvard for the same amount of money that it takes us to pay for one juvenile for one year in our facility,” Rep. Mark Duncan (R-Kirtland) said at Tuesday’s hearing. “I’m trying to wrap my mind around that. We definitely need to get these kids before they have to go to these facilities.”
The state spends six times more on these facilities than it spends on “multisystemic therapy treatments” — treatments focused on kids with antisocial behavior that involves their families, friends and schools — and the state spends less on this therapy than it did a decade ago, according to the report. 
“New Mexico’s gaps in available behavioral health and treatment services have worsened,” it said. “In essence, New Mexico is diverting low-risk youth away from the juvenile justice system, but the state lacks an adequate system of community services to send youth to.”
In 2022, state lawmakers set aside $20 million for the New Mexico Health Care Authority to build the infrastructure for Medicaid-eligible behavioral health services for kids across the state. CYFD used that money for non-Medicaid-eligible services that weren’t in line with national best practices according to Tuesday’s report, which accused the child welfare agency of lacking “an action plan for addressing the state’s service gaps.”
The LFC report recommends the Legislature prioritize delinquency prevention and therapeutic programs and amend state law to require CYFD to validate its risk-assessment tools for pre-trial detention once every three years, at a minimum, beginning in 2026.



 The Legislative Finance Committee’s “policy spotlight” report on juvenile justice, presented Tuesday, also recommended that CYFD: 


create a publicly accessible plan to increase the state’s capacity for “front-end” services, including evidence-based behavioral health and treatment services;
reduce staffers’ ability to override the department’s risk-assessment tools;
prioritize staffing its juvenile facilities by reducing spending on overtime and reducing funds spent on Family Services Division employees when facing capacity constraints;
track data on which services or alternatives youth are diverted toward by juvenile probation officers;
track the number of operational beds and staffers in juvenile facilities;
annually project the average daily population at secure facilities.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) speaks at a June 6, 2025 town hall in Lansing. | Kyle DavidsonIn recent weeks, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin has led the call to curb President Donald Trump’s executive powers, with one of her Michigan colleagues echoing that cry after voting to release the Epstein files. 
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Tuesday joined Slotkin, a fellow Democrat from Holly, in calling for an end to the presidential pardon, with Stevens criticizing the president for weighing a pardon of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for enabling sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in sexually exploiting more than 250 underage girls.
“It is ridiculous that presidents of both parties have the authority to excuse the most heinous crimes.” Stevens said in a statement on Tuesday. “We’ve seen Donald Trump abuse his power again and again, and now he could pardon a person who helped run a child sex trafficking ring with Jeffrey Epstein along with the other pedophiles Epstein helped enable.”
In a video shared to social media earlier this week, Slotkin explained her reasoning for supporting a ban on the presidential pardon.
“I don’t think it makes sense in the modern world,” Slotkin said.

She pointed to Trump’s decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao, who founded the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The company helped to create the code for the type of crypto offered by the Trump family’s crypto currency company, World Liberty Financial. In May, a state-owned investment firm in the United Arab Emirates used World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency to make a $2 billion investment in Binance, with a Bloomberg report noting the deal could transfer millions of dollars to the Trump family annually from interest bearing assets.
“It just brings up this real whiff of pay to play, that if you invest in the President’s ventures, you’re going to get yourself a presidential pardon,” Slotkin said. “That’s why I think we should just get rid of the presidential pardon. I didn’t like it when Democrats did it. I don’t like it when Republicans do it, it’s something that we should get rid of. It just does not work in a modern day democracy.”
‘I’m popping a flare’: Slotkin says Trump is using ‘same playbook as every authoritarian in history’

On Nov. 9, Trump issued a pardon for 16 individuals accused of participating in a scheme to certify Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump in the 2020 election, which he lost. Charges against 15 individuals were dismissed in September, while a 16th had reached a cooperation agreement with the Michigan attorney general’s office earlier in the case. In exchange his charges were dropped. 
Meanwhile, Slotkin and five of her Democratic colleagues in both the House and Senate earlier this week called on members of the military and intelligence agencies to refuse illegal orders from the Trump Administration.
Slotkin has also introduced legislation alongside Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to place limits on the president’s ability to deploy the National Guard into American communities. 
“The U.S. military should always remain apolitical and should never be used as a domestic police force on our streets at the whims of a President,” Slotkin said in a statement about the bill. “This legislation ensures that no president, Democrat or Republican, can turn our soldiers against our citizens by seeking to restore checks and balances in these domestic deployments.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_1591-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

Connecticut utility regulators voted to block the sale of the Aquarion Water Company to a quasi-public entity on Wednesday, following months of criticism from opponents who said the deal threatened to raise water rates for nearly 250,000 customers.
The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted 4-0, denying the utility’s sale to the South Central Regional Water Authority. PURA’s decision cited concerns with the proposed structure of a newly created entity to oversee Aquarion and its ability to meet its “managerial responsibility” to customers.
Eversource, Aquarion’s owner, announced its plans to sell the water company to RWA in January as part of a deal worth $2.4 billion. The transaction involved $1.6 billion in cash and $800 million in debt.
The sale would have created a new quasi-public entity, the Aquarion Water Authority, with rates controlled by a board made up of members from each of the towns served by water utility.
Critics of the deal, however, argued that it would remove PURA’s oversight of the state’s largest water utility, which could lead to escalating costs for consumers. Under state law, PURA only approves rates for investor-owned utilities, not those that are publicly owned.
Utility officials projected that Aquarion’s customers would see annual rate increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade under the new quasi-public authority, according to filings submitted to PURA.
“This deal was a costly loser for Connecticut families and PURA was right to reject it,” Attorney General William Tong said in a statement Wednesday. “Eversource desperately wanted to offload Aquarion, and they concocted this maneuver to extract as much cash as possible by guaranteeing the new entity free reign to jack up rates. Eversource is free to find a new buyer, but should understand that any new attempt to end public regulatory oversight over water bills for hundreds of thousands of Connecticut families is going to be a non-starter here.”
In a statement following Wednesday’s vote, Eversource spokewoman Jamie Ratliff lamented the failure of the deal after lawmakers pushed through controversial legislation last year allowing the RWA to pursue a bid to purchase Aquarion. 
“The special act approved by legislators in 2024 indicated that the state was interested in an expanded non-profit model,” Ratliff said. “However, once tested, that same special act proved difficult to overcome for PURA to move away from an investor-owned model.”
A spokesman for the RWA said the authority is reviewing PURA’s decision.
Backlash to the proposed deal came from many corners, including consumer advocates, state lawmakers, environmental groups such as Save the Sound and local officials, who raised concerns about the loss of future tax revenues. (Nonprofits and public entities are generally exempt from paying property taxes in Connecticut.)
In 2024, Aquarion paid a total of $19.4 million in local property taxes in Connecticut, according to Ratliff. As part of the proposed sale, the applicants had agreed to pay no less than that amount through a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT, agreement.
In its final decision on the proposed sale, PURA cited no concerns with the new authority’s finances or technical ability to provide “safe, adequate and reliable” service to customers. Instead, it was concerns about the structure of the authority itself, and the loss of outside oversight, that led regulators to block the sale. 
“This was the result of an imperfect process, it’s an imperfect product and an imperfect governance structure,” said Commissioner Holly Cheeseman, who is one of three new members of PURA’s board appointed by Gov. Ned Lamont last month.
“We can’t go back,” she added. “We can only rule on the application before us.” 
The other PURA members who voted to block the sale were Vice Chair David Arconti, Commissioner Michael Caron and Commissioner Janice Beecher.  The newly appointed chair of PURA, Thomas Wiehl, did not participate in Wednesday’s vote due to his prior involvement in reviewing the deal as an attorney for the Office of Consumer Counsel.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saugatuck.jpg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)MANHATTAN — Kansas organizations took part in a first-in-the-world project designed to move silt out of Tuttle Creek Lake in an effort to change projections showing the lake will be 75% full of silt by 2074.
The collaborative study, a project of the Kansas Water Office and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, plans to remove silt from the lake by using water injection dredging, which will shift silt out of the lake into the Big Blue River, said John Shelley, associate research professor at the University of Kansas, at last week’s Governor’s Conference on the Future of Water.
“​​Before the dam was built, there was about 5.3 million tons of sediment per year washing down the Big Blue River, and 5.3 million tons of sediment per year washing out of the Big Blue River,” Shelley said. “But then we built the dam and it causes this large lake, which results in 98% of the sediment being trapped in the lake. Instead of 5.3 million that used to go out, now we have about 107,000 tons of sediment per year that leave the lake.”
To put it in perspective, Shelley said to imagine taking a 1/50th slice of a jelly bean in a liter of water. That’s how much silt currently leaves Tuttle Creek Lake.
Although water injection dredging isn’t a new process, it has never been used in a lake, Shelley said.
Four basic strategies are used for managing sediment, he said: reducing the sediment coming in, redistributing sediment within the lake, routing sediment around or through the lake before it deposits, and removing it after it has deposited.
Water injection dredging is done by pumping clear water from a 120-foot barge to the bottom of the lake. Because muddy water that is stirred up is denser than the clean water, the muddy water “plunges” to the bottom of the lake and moves laterally, Shelley said.
Such a process happens naturally in some lakes and is called a density current, he said.
“The whole idea of water injection dredging is: Let’s induce a density current but do it closer to the dam so that then it can travel, and it’s close enough that it’ll travel to the dam and can be discharged downstream,” Shelley said.
The project has been in the works for several years, with preliminary work being done to test the sediment, consider what pattern the dredge should move across the lake, and consider how the Big Blue River, which the sediment is flushed to, will be affected.
This year, the project received $7.1 million in a federal grant and $2 million from the state to do the demonstration project, which began Sept. 27, Shelley said. A dredge moved in a predetermined pattern across Tuttle Creek Lake for 10 days, with 20 hours each day of active dredging. The project calls for two more 10-day dredgings to occur in the spring and summer.
Keith Gido, a Kansas State University professor, joined the project because of his expertise as a river ecologist. He and other researchers are collecting samples along the Big Blue River to measure any effects the dredging operation is having downstream.
“The dredging worked, so it moved these sediments down through the dam, and that increased the turbidity in the water, so there was a bunch of suspended sediment in the water,” he said. “As the water levels dropped, those sediments are deposited.”
Most of the sediment dropped to the river bottom but some was deposited on the shore, he said. Although many of the water samples Gido’s team took still require analysis, he said they were looking for specific issues.
“One of the things that we were concerned about was that sometimes when you have a lot of suspended sediments in the water, the oxygen concentrations will decline because there’s a lot of organic matter that’s decomposing and using up oxygen,” he said.
Lakes across the state are losing percentages of their main pools of water because silt is filling them in. This graphic, shared at a recent Kansas Governor’s Conference on the Future of Water by John Shelley, who is working on a dredging demonstration project, shows how silt is affecting lakes across the state. (Submitted: John Shelley)
Although there was a small drop in oxygen levels, Gido said, it was not near a critical value that might cause fish to die or other serious issues. When there are major storms, it’s normal for sediment to be stirred up.
“What happened was within the bounds of what we expect based on natural variability that we’ve seen due to rainstorm events and such,” he said.
Another concern was the release of sulfur oxides that make the river smell “a little funky,” Gido said. A Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks technician told Gido that when the dredging was occurring, fishermen who were below the dam moved downstream to get away from the smell and the mud being released, but quickly moved back when it settled.
The project team, which consisted of 12 different organizations and research labs, set constraints — such as concentration limits and water quality — and determined the point where they would have stopped dredging or released more water for dilution, Shelley said. There was robust monitoring both at the lake and along the river during the dredging.
Downstream deposits on the shore of the river may be new to people who live near its banks, but it’s something that commonly happens on the Kansas River, Gido said.
If Tuttle Creek continues to lose more of its water area to silt, that would eventually cause downstream problems, too, he noted.
“A major reason the dam was built was for flood control,” Gido said. “The ability of that reservoir to control flooding is a function of how much capacity it has, right? It’s lost half of its capacity to hold water, and if it loses more, then it’s going to really compromise its ability to trap water and reduce flooding.”
Researchers will continue to assess the effects of dredging on the lake and downstream in different seasons with the upcoming 10-day sessions.
“The main point of this project — it’s not to dredge a certain volume of sediment or lower the bed level to a certain elevation,” Shelley said. “It’s really to answer questions.”
The questions are varied and include how much sediment can be moved out of the lake using water injection dredging, how much it will cost to move per cubic yard, and what are downstream impacts. The barge also moved at different speeds and patterns, so they will analyze those factors to determine what is most effective, Shelley said.
If this project can answer questions so a long-term plan could be made, then it would be successful, he said. The eventual goal would be to maintain the lake where it currently is by being able to remove the same amount of silt as comes into the lake each year.
Data is being processed and analyzed, and a webinar will be held in January to share the results of the first dredging operation, Shelley said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB120537-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-19 12:00:08.020085

UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett came to the university in July 2023 for an initial three-year contract, which would expire June 30, unless extended. He is currently leading a plan to cut $27.5 million from UNL’s budget.

NU Regent Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City, who represents a sprawling 45-county district in western Nebraska, said in a statement Wednesday that she “fully” supports Bennett and his budget actions.
She said his decisions consider available resources and are informed by institutional data meant “to protect the future of UNL.”
Wilmot said she understands people’s lives and careers will be changed by the cuts. But she cautioned that UNL continuing to dip into budget reserves has contributed to current problems. She joined the regents in 2023 and has frequently focused attention on taxpayers before board votes.
“It is understandable individuals have internalized the pain felt by the proposed cuts,” Wilmot said in an email. “However, personal attacks are harmful to the university that we all love. I fully support Doctor Bennett and his efforts to ensure the fiscal viability and future of UNL.”
Budget problem ‘hasn’t changed’
The UNL Faculty Senate voted 60-14 on Tuesday to express “no confidence” in Bennett’s performance and ask that the eight elected regents and NU President Jeffrey Gold consider firing Bennett or negotiating his removal. It was the first such resolution to pass in UNL’s nearly 157-year history.

Reached just after the Faculty Senate vote on Tuesday, Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the NU Board of Regents, said he knew faculty were discussing a no-confidence vote, and “what they do is 100% their opinion.”
Kenney said he doesn’t think the rebuke of Bennett changes how he’ll approach budget-related votes come Dec. 5, when regents will consider $6.74 million in Bennett-proposed academic program eliminations
“We were short a lot of money to start with,” Kenney said. “That hasn’t changed.”
A spokesperson for Dr. Gold and the NU system on Tuesday said faculty-shared governance is “one of many voices” in higher education and that NU values their input at UNL.
“However, ultimate decisions rest with the Board of Regents,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln declined to comment Tuesday. The five other elected regents did not respond to Examiner calls seeking comment.
The Examiner on Wednesday also reached out to Pillen, UNL Student Regent Libby Wilkins and the UNL Staff Senate. Student representatives on the NU Board of Regents can cast nonbinding votes on board action. Faculty serve in advisory roles but their representatives cannot cast symbolic votes. Staff have no role in regents meetings.
Bennett desired contract extension
When Bennett was hired in 2023, regents made no comments on his hiring at that summer meeting. He became UNL’s 21st chancellor and is the first person of color to lead UNL.
UNL faculty overwhelmingly pass historic ‘no confidence’ vote against chancellor

Bennett, in October, told the Examiner he had “no idea” if or when a vote extending his contract might come.
“But I sure hope it comes quickly, because I love being here, love being a part of the community, and clearly we have important work yet to do,” Bennett said Oct. 5.
That same day, Gold said he favored extending Bennett’s contract but said it was up to the regents. Gold previously served as chancellor of the University of Medical Center for 10 years, a campus that will likely soon merge with UNL for accreditation and research reporting purposes as UNL continues to seek readmittance to the prestigious Association of American Universities.
It’s unclear if the merger would bring other changes to NU. For example, UNMC has been led by an interim chancellor since Gold became president in July 2024. The two campuses are also led by the same business and finance leader, Anne Barnes, who concurrently is a member of Gold’s cabinet.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Reliable and affordable energy is what keeps our country running. It fuels businesses, supports families, and gives communities the foundation to grow.
Nowhere is that clearer than in South Carolina, where record population growth and major industrial expansion are pushing electricity demand to unprecedented levels.
Yet many projects that could expand supply and strengthen the grid are stuck waiting on approvals that take years to complete.
These delays stem largely from federal reviews that move far slower than the needs of fast-growing states like South Carolina.
The longer they wait, the higher costs climb for everyone.
The issue is not a lack of investment or ingenuity. South Carolina has become a national magnet for advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle production, aerospace suppliers, and next-generation logistics.
BMW’s continued growth in Spartanburg, Bosch’s battery component expansion, new industrial parks in Greer, Gaffney, and Laurens County, and a wave of suppliers serving Siemens and GE Vernova all depend on a modern, reliable grid.
But the bureaucratic process that governs the infrastructure needed to power these projects, transmission lines, substation upgrades, and grid interconnections moves too slowly and has become overly complex.
Developers often face overlapping reviews, shifting requirements, and legal challenges that can drag on for years.
The 732-mile TransWest Express transmission line from Wyoming to Nevada, for example, took nearly 18 years just to secure permits before breaking ground.
Duke Energy shuffles costs to make proposed Carolinas merger more attractive to SC

To support BMW expansions, battery component suppliers, and new industrial development corridors along the Interstate 85 spine, Duke Energy needs timely approvals for new substations, high-voltage transmission lines, and large-scale grid upgrades that often take longer to permit than to construct.
When these projects stall, reliability and affordability for families and businesses are put at risk.
When projects take too long to build, communities lose out on affordable power, new jobs, and private investment.
According to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, as much as $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment nationwide is tied up in the federal permitting process. A meaningful share of that investment is aimed at fast-growing states like South Carolina — if the infrastructure can actually be built.
Permitting reform is about restoring common sense. It means keeping environmental standards strong while making the approval process clear, efficient, and predictable.
The goal is not to cut corners, but to cut confusion.
That can be done by establishing firm timelines so projects can move from proposal to construction without endless waiting; designating a single coordinating agency to avoid duplicative reviews; prioritizing high-impact projects such as Upstate transmission upgrades; and creating a clear judicial review process so infrastructure that meets every requirement is not stuck in court for years.
Streamlining the process would save time and money without weakening safeguards. Federal reforms are especially important because many transmission projects require approvals from
multiple federal agencies before South Carolina utilities can even begin construction.
Today, a routine transmission line needed to power a new industrial supplier in Spartanburg County can take years longer to approve than to build. Substation upgrades serving fast-growing communities around Greer, Powdersville, and the western Upstate must often navigate multilayered reviews that move more slowly than the growth they are intended to support.
With targeted reforms, builders could move forward with confidence, and communities would benefit from lower costs and greater reliability as new energy sources and delivery systems come online sooner.
Permitting reform also strengthens America’s energy independence, and South Carolina’s competitiveness.
Much of the region’s electric grid is operating with equipment deep into the second half of its lifespan, even as demand accelerates. Federal energy analyses show that the United States will need to double the size of its electric grid by mid-century to support artificial intelligence, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and population growth, all trends already reshaping South Carolina.
When infrastructure can be built faster, energy becomes more affordable and more secure. Local industries, from battery manufacturing in the Midlands to aerospace and advanced-materials
suppliers across the Upstate, can expand with confidence.
And new employers deciding where to invest will see a state prepared for continued growth, not constrained by outdated processes.
Modernizing how projects are approved is not a partisan issue. It is a practical step toward a stronger economy and a more resilient energy system. Families deserve affordable electricity and
reliable service, and they deserve a government that helps make that possible.
The time to act is now. Modernizing the federal permitting process will lower costs, strengthen reliability, and keep energy affordable for every family and business in South Carolina.

The governing board of Proud To Partner Leadership Academy didn’t consider any plans for improvement during its meeting Tuesday night, though the Statewide Charter School Board demanded such a plan by Nov. 26. 
“There’s nothing to fix,” said Sharri Coleman, board chairperson for the academy.
The statewide board dropped the charter school to probation, one step away from closure, last week over concerns of weak finances, poor organization and low academic quality, all of which the school’s leaders dispute.

Chief among state officials’ concerns was a report that Proud To Partner Leadership Academy, known as PTPLA, had only one teacher on its payroll. The school now has more than 100 students enrolled after starting the school year with 56.
Statewide board staff said they observed a “profound lack of student instruction, supervision and engagement” during three school visits in recent weeks.
PTPLA Superintendent Dawn Bowles said she refused to allow a state official to make a fourth visit after the probation vote. She said she denied entry to the school because her students are “emotionally scarred” from the visits and from the recent media attention.
Bowles said the school laid off three teachers after low enrollment caused budget constraints. Those three teachers continued working full time without pay while another remained on payroll, she said in a 45-minute presentation refuting state officials’ allegations. 
“When I spoke with each of them about the budget cuts that had to be made, they each said, ‘I’m not going anywhere, Ms. Bowles. It doesn’t matter if I’m getting paid or not. I’m here,’” she said of the teachers.
Bowles noted three other paid staff — the school counselor, a dean of leadership and herself — also hold teaching certifications.

PTPLA’s board voted Tuesday to rehire the three laid-off teachers on part-time status, though they’ll continue working full time. Bowles said she expects they will return to full pay when more state funding arrives in January. 
The board also approved an adjusted budget for the 2025-26 school year without sharing any details.
Bowles acknowledged some of the state officials’ complaints were true. PTPLA missed two deadlines to file financial reports with the state this year and had to pay fines, she said. 
The school also finished the 2025 fiscal year with a $274,222 deficit, which she said is “not supposed to happen.” A $400,000 grant from the Walton Personal Philanthropy Group later lifted PTPLA out of debt, Bowles said.
The statewide board’s director of school performance, Skyler Lusnia, gave a brief presentation of the deficiencies Tuesday night before receiving several pointed questions from PTPLA’s board. 
“What our concern is, is the totality of it all,” Lusnia told the board. “There are multiple concerns, and if it was just one thing, we would have never gotten to this point.”

The board members dismissed Lusnia after their chairperson, Coleman, repeated their three requests: That the statewide board review information and documents from PTPLA, publicly apologize and immediately remove the school from probation. 
Coleman said Lusnia had presented “incorrect” information that led to PTPLA’s demotion.
The fact that school leaders met Tuesday without establishing an improvement plan “does raise concerns,” said Brian Shellem, chairperson of the statewide board. He said the Nov. 26 deadline to produce a plan still stands.
“We’re going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they will provide us the plan,” Shellem said after observing the PTPLA board meeting. “If the corrective actions have already been made, even prior to our board meeting, great. Just show us what that is in writing. Provide us the documentation that all the kids were being taught. Wonderful. We’ll look forward to any and all evidence of what it is that’s being done.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-19 15:23:59+00:00,CT Mirror,"ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from CT, other Democratic states",Jonathan Shorman | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/19/ct-ice-courthouse-arrests-resistance/,"Officials worry raids risk keeping people from testifying in trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.
In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.
“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.
Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.
They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.
The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.
In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.
States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.
Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.
“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.
But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.
“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”
Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.
“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.
Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.
Knowing where a target will be
Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.
Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.
“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.
In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.
“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”
An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.
McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.
Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.
Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.
Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.
Trump administration court actions
But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.
The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.
New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.
U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.
“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.
The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.
In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”
Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.
Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses
Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.
Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.
“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.
Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”
Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.
“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.
Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.
“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.

It’s part of a $7.4 billion settlement announced by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday.
Connecticut’s settlement money will be used for opioid treatment and prevention, and to give direct support to victims and their families, said Attorney General William Tong.
“But no amount of money and justice will make whole the lives lost and families destroyed by the Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma’s craven pursuit of profit,” Tong said.
Tong is one of 55 attorneys general across the country, including New York, who sued Purdue and the Sackler family for their role in the opioid crisis.
The funds will be distributed over the next 15 years. Connecticut will get a majority of its $64 million share of the multi-billion-dollar settlement over the next eight years.

,California,2025-11-19 15:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Community Benefits,sponsor,,,,,https://calmatters.org/sponsored/2025/11/community-benefits/,"Across California, communities and developers are coming to the negotiating table in an effort to distribute prosperity. Community Benefits Agreements can help.","Construction of a new stadium or solar farm can spark both alarm and promise for local residents, and for good reasons. Often, communities are sidelined in decision making about these projects, and the benefits of such large-scale developments are not always evenly distributed. 
Historically, when these opportunities arrive, local officials have held public hearings where residents could voice concerns. However, this type of engagement has its drawbacks. It tends to favor vocal residents with the time and resources to attend. Moreover, research shows residents who attend these public hearings are disproportionately project opponents, rather than those who are pushing for more energy infrastructure or housing. And, ultimately, there is no guarantee that local electeds will take community feedback into consideration.Community Benefit Agreements (CBA) have emerged as one way to increase local control over development decisions and ensure that economic and other gains from new infrastructure are more widely shared. 
What is a CBA?
A Community Benefit Agreement is a legally binding contract between a developer and local governments or community groups such as labor unions, neighborhood associations, or environmental advocates. 
In exchange for specific, tangible benefits, such as job training programs, affordable housing units, local hiring guarantees, parks, reduced electricity rates, or direct financial payments, local organizations agree to support a proposed project – or at least not oppose it. In this way, CBAs might be able to help speed up approval processes and accelerate development by navigating potential community opposition.


CBAs to Support Clean Energy Development
As California moves toward its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045, communities are beginning to see many more wind and solar infrastructure projects — particularly those in the inland and rural counties of the state. As of November 2025, there are 282 planned utility-scale solar projects in California. Their total planned capacity is 59,721 megawatts (MW).
Historically, Community Benefits Agreements have resulted from extensive advocacy and organizing by local community members. However, instead of pushing communities to self-organize for these benefits, California has begun to require clean energy developers to enter into legally-binding agreements with local community organizations in order to benefit from streamlined permitting at the state level. 
CBAs for renewable energy are becoming increasingly prominent in policy and some jurisdictions both in California and other states have institutionalized community benefits: 

Riverside County’s Policy B-29 requires large solar projects to pay approximately $150 per acre.
Imperial County’s Public Benefit Program collects fees from solar projects to issue grants for infrastructure improvements and job creation. 
California’s AB 205 now requires developers seeking state-level permits for large solar and wind facilities to execute a CBA
Michigan’s recent legislation mandates that developers enter Host Community Agreements with minimum payments of $2,000 per megawatt.
New York established a Host Community Benefits program with annual fees per megawatt issued as electric bill credits to residents of municipalities hosting renewable energy projects

The Promise and Challenges of CBAs
The promise of CBAs is that they give communities direct power to negotiate for their needs and preferences. However, it can be unclear who actually represents “the community.” Because CBAs are often negotiated by select community groups, they can lack democratic accountability. And just as the residents attending a public hearing may not be representative of the demographics of a community, with varying and unequal access to economic and political capital, the same could be true of the community groups who participate in negotiating CBAs. 
As a result, some critics view CBAs as essentially allowing developers to “buy off” opposition in order to streamline approvals. The importance of timing in these agreements doesn’t improve optics: offered too early, benefits might feel like bribes; too late, they may seem like unjust compensation for negative impacts. 
In the end, CBAs are private contracts and the details of many agreements stay hidden. As a result, despite many examples of CBAs in and outside California, surprisingly little is known about their actual structure, benefits, and outcomes. Many important questions remain unanswered, including whether CBAs speed up or slow down development. Which communities successfully negotiate CBAs, and which don’t? What happens when negotiations are unsuccessful? Who follows through to ensure commitments are fulfilled?
CBAs are a promising vehicle to address the potential tensions between the need to quickly build more infrastructure and the desire to engage communities in decision-making. Nonetheless, more research is needed to understand their effectiveness in delivering real benefits to communities while enabling progress on housing, energy, and other new development.

His testimony came Nov. 18, 2025, at the Capitol. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature video) TOPEKA — The secretary of the Kansas Department of Revenue offered to create within the state agency the job of ombudsman to provide information and guidance — not legal counsel — to Kansans interested in representing themselves in property tax appeal cases.
Secretary Mark Burghart said Tuesday during an interim tax committee meeting of the Kansas Legislature that the objective of the extra employee would be to better prepare individuals interested in contesting county property tax valuations that were heard by the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals.
The idea of an ombudsman was raised in September by Kristen Wheeler, chair of the state tax appeal board, in response to dramatic growth in the board’s caseload.
The concept received a positive response from several legislators, including Sen. Caryn Tyson, a Parker Republican who chairs the interim House and Senate tax committee. She urged Burghart to begin preliminary planning for the hiring of an ombudsman. She suggested the task might be done without the 2026 Legislature adopting a bill specifically granting the revenue department permission.
“It sounds to me like you could actually implement this without statute,” Tyson said. “I think that would be the ideal solution.”
Kansas has more than 2 million individual taxpayers, Burghart said. The Board of Tax Appeals, or BOTA, during the 2024 fiscal year reported an increase of 700 cases on its general appeal docket. There were 300 additional property tax appeals and 300 more appeals related to tax exemptions.
“This position is important. It think it’s needed. It does make sense to me that it live in the Department of Revenue,” said Sen. Craig Bowser, R-Holton. “Why do we have a large number of tax appeals right now? It’s because our taxpayers are surprised with very large, unexpected tax bills. So, they appeal.”
Burghart said the Department of Revenue currently had an individual responsible for general taxpayer advocacy. A person dedicated to property tax affairs should initially be limited to an educational role that involved assisting taxpayers with their understanding property valuation procedures and BOTA’s appellate process. The ombudsman could explain deadlines, required forms, evidentiary expectations and appeal options.
“The creation of this position, initially framed as an educational and navigational resource rather than a legal representative, would be one way to help expedite appeals before BOTA by improving the quality and completeness of taxpayer filings,” Burghart said. “That, in turn, supports the Legislature’s objective of addressing BOTA workforce and caseload concerns.”
“We would make it abundantly clear that we are not giving legal advice,” the revenue secretary said. “The ombudsman would not serve as the legal representative of any taxpayer … and would not advocate for specific valuation outcomes in individual cases.”
Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, questioned whether the Department of Revenue could unilaterally initiate an ombudsman program. Burghart said adding a new staff position to the agency could be worked into the budget, which already included personnel assigned duties associated with assisting taxpayers.
“It’s helpful for that to be part of the discussion so that people understand, when we’re talking about new employees, how that happens,” she said.
Burghart said the Legislature had options in terms of shaping the work of an ombudsman or advocate dedicated to property taxation. The person could be informally added to payroll in the Department of Revenue or the individual could be located in a newly created state office founded, which would require passage of a state law.
The ombudsman also could be established as a law school clinic led by students or as a nonprofit affiliated with the Kansas Bar Association, he said.
He said an ombudsman should be appointed by the state revenue secretary after consultation with the chair of the Board of Tax Appeals and the revenue department’s director of property evaluation. It’s not necessary to include the post among jobs requiring Kansas Senate confirmation, he said.
If the program proved beneficial in terms of BOTA’s case docket or processing times, Burghart said, the Legislature could consider broadening the ombudsman’s role into direct representation or formal advocacy of taxpayers in BOTA proceedings in which counties were involved in the cases.
If the Legislature chose to deepen the ombudsman’s role regarding property tax cases the personnel should no longer be based within the revenue department, he said.
Wheeler, the BOTA chair, said the taxpayer assistance position must be filled by a person with specialized expertise in taxation appeals.
She said BOTA was neutral on whether the position needed to be located at BOTA, but “parameters of the position and its location deserve further consideration and debate.”
She said it was unlikely the state could quickly implement a student-staffed taxation legal clinic at law schools at University of Kansas in Lawrence or Washburn University in Topeka.
“Even if there was interest in this type of clinic, it’s likely that creation of a clinic would take substantially more time than creating a staff position,” Wheeler said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-221336-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-11-19 09:56:45.301552
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-19 14:14:24+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,‘They’re making a huge bet’: Rent control referendum splits progressives,Chris Lisinski and Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/theyre-making-a-huge-bet-rent-control-referendum-splits-progressives/,"If a campaign to instate rent control across the Commonwealth makes it to the ballot, voters will need to weigh whether every municipality should adopt a measure more stringent than earlier attempts by Boston, Brookline, and Somerville.","IN THE THREE DECADES since voters narrowly banned rent control in Massachusetts, every swing to revive even the mildest version of the policy has connected with nothing but air. 
Requests from Boston, Brookline, and Somerville withered on Beacon Hill, statewide bills stalled out, and ballot measures fell apart at early junctures. Progressive elected officials and advocates have settled into a frustrated rhythm: Come before indifferent lawmakers every session and ask, unsuccessfully, to leave rent control decisions in the hands of cities and towns that want it.   
Today, the movement to limit rent increases has new momentum, with an updated ballot question coursing toward voters in 2026. It might seem like a boon to the left, but to some who have spent years slowly building support for rent control, the campaign also poses an ultimatum. 
That’s because the initiative petition does not seek simply to lift the ban, nor to allow rent control in the handful of communities that have requested it. The proposal instead would apply one of the nation’s strictest rent caps to all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, from Williamstown to West Tisbury and everywhere in between. 
It’s a dramatic, swing-for-the-fences approach that the campaign, led by advocacy group Homes for All, sees as simpler messaging. 
“We’ll continue to support the local option bill at the State House, and we know that is often the way the state Legislature likes to do policy,” said Homes for All executive director Carolyn Chou. “We’ll continue to push that, but we feel that if we go in front of the voters, we need to be presenting something that will impact their lives immediately.”  
The strategy has put many longtime supporters of capping rents in an awkward position, at a time when housing prices are soaring across Massachusetts and the state vacancy rate is one of the lowest in the nation. Should they spend whatever political capital they’ve built over the past decade on a measure far more dramatic than has previously been suggested? Or should they stay on the sidelines, with the risk of alienating allies or undermining momentum? 
With advocates buoyed by last year’s votes to boot the 10th grade MCAS test as a graduation requirement, allow ride-share drivers to unionize, and open up the Legislature’s books, few progressive politicians are eager to downplay the rent control measure’s chances or be associated with real estate interests over the average renter.   
That would be, they say quietly, political suicide.  
But not everyone is eagerly jumping on board yet.  
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, perhaps the state’s most high-profile supporter of rent control, so far has not thrown her support behind the question, though some of her Boston allies are more enthusiastic. The incoming mayor of Somerville, which green-lit the most ambitious local rent stabilization proposal since the ban, wonders why the statewide pitch needed to be more complicated than simply allowing rent control back into the housing toolkit. 
Several other elected officials and organizers said they would vote for the measure while openly questioning the strategy of going so big in a state where municipalities guard what little local control they have. In private, some worry that the Homes for All group leading the campaign is headed down a path that could set the movement back decades. 
“This is more aggressive than any proposal that has ever been discussed in anyone’s memory in Massachusetts and perhaps anywhere,” said Rep. Mike Connolly of Cambridge, who still intends to support the measure. “They’re making a huge bet that has a lot of consequences.”  
That line of thinking, in turn, has ruffled feathers among supporters, who think it’s essential for anyone with an interest in rent control to maintain a consistent message given the inevitable blitz of opposition from the real estate industry.  
Rep. Sam Montaño of Boston, a longtime rent control supporter who backs the ballot question, described comments by Connolly and others as “frustrating.”  
“What’s the point of saying you have an issue with it if we are moving forward?” Montaño said. “The real estate industry is going to outspend us by a margin of, like, 20 to one. Why are you giving them any more power to say there’s division within the coalition?”

Proponents say the ballot question is bold, but simple. 
It would cap most rent increases across the state at either the annual change in the Consumer Price Index or 5 percent, whichever is lower.  
Owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units would be exempt, as would newly constructed units for the first 10 years of hosting residents, most public housing, housing in educational or religious institutions, or units typically rented to visitors for fewer than 14 days. 
Most other rent-control proposals floated in Massachusetts or enacted elsewhere in the United States give landlords more flexibility. 
Boston, Brookline, and Somerville — the three cities that submitted home-rule petitions over the past few sessions to the Legislature seeking rent control — each sought to limit rent increases at the CPI change plus an additional margin, effectively allowing landlords to go a bit beyond inflation.  
Statewide laws in Oregon and Washington limit rent increases to inflation plus 7 percent, or 10 percent, whichever is lower. California similarly sets its state cap at inflation plus 5 percent, or no more than 10 percent in the highest-inflation years, while allowing some communities to craft their own policies. 
The city of St. Paul, Minnesota limited rent increases at 3 percent annually with a few options for landlords to seek exceptions. Voters approved that measure in 2021, and the city soon experienced a dramatic downturn in housing production — the seventh largest production plummet in the entire Midwest according to federal data — though other Minnesota municipalities without rent control also experienced pandemic-era downturns. 
St. Paul’s city council in May voted to exempt units built after 2004 from rent control, amending the voter-approved law. 
COMPARE: Details of rent control laws and proposals






The new Massachusetts ballot measure’s tight limit on rent growth mirrors legislation filed in several consecutive lawmaking terms Rep. David Rogers of Cambridge, Montaño of Boston, and Sen. Patricia Jehlen of Somerville, the House version of which is due for a hearing before the Legislature’s Housing Committee on Wednesday.  
In an interview, Montaño said the bill is “as close to the middle as you can get” at balancing what tenants can afford with increases high enough to empower landlords “continuing to invest” in properties.  
However, that bill offers rent control as an opt-in tool that any city or town could deploy after securing approval at the local level – not an automatic statewide mandate, as the ballot question seeks – and it would also allow communities to restrict no-cause evictions. 
Both Wu and Somerville Mayor-elect Jake Wilson have leaned toward a nuanced local approach rather than deploying a one-size-fits-all requirement. 
As the Somerville City Council crafted its 2023 home-rule petition with a working group’s recommendations, Wilson said, they mulled Somerville’s particular rent prices and housing pressures. 
“I would say the rule of thumb should be something that is ultimately fair to a landlord and fair to a tenant, where it would not break the bank either on a one-year basis or over a sequence of years for a tenant looking to stay in their home,” he said in an interview, “and it would allow a landlord to make the kind of improvements and investments in that property to maintain it as a good housing unit.” 
The ballot proposal, which Wilson now says he will enthusiastically get behind and work to pass, is a far cry from a one-off tailored local measure or even a blanket permission for cities and towns to pursue their own types of rent control without needing legislative sign-off. 
“I will say that the approach that seemed the most logical to me was just a straight up repeal of the prohibition on rent control,” said Wilson, a current at-large city councilor. “The folks behind this say they have polling that shows good support for this prescriptive law-of-the-land model. I’m trusting them on that, and I’m hopeful that this ballot measure ultimately succeeds, so that we can bring in the rent stabilization needed to stanch the bleeding that our communities are experiencing from displacement.” 
Wu has kept the measure at arm’s length. 
When asked in August about the proposal, she told GBH that it “would not be what I would have supported for the City of Boston.” She said at the time that she would “have to figure out what to do about this, because this may be the only shot for a while,” she said. 
Almost three months later, Wu’s stance remains unenthusiastic.  
“The mayor has not yet taken a position on the ballot question,” a city spokesperson said on Friday in response to a CommonWealth Beacon inquiry. 
“She believes that although communities across the Commonwealth are all facing intense housing pressures and the steep cost of housing is Massachusetts’ biggest competitive liability, each city’s specific needs and conditions require nuanced and specific solutions,” the spokesperson said.  
Boston’s proposal would allow rent hikes of inflation plus 6 percent, up to a 10 percent year-over-year cap — higher in every scenario than what the ballot question would require. The city’s measure would also, unlike the ballot question, allow the rent to be raised to market prices in between tenants, prompting Boston officials to argue that additional tenant protections would be needed to make sure landlords could not force out a renter to raise rents. 
Wu took some heat from both the left and the right over her more modest rent stabilization pitch. Rent control advocates said it was an anti-gouging measure at best, leaving significant rent hikes on the table. Real estate groups said it was a more reasonable proposal than other municipalities put forward, but they argue that rent control fundamentally harms the housing market and their businesses. 
Montaño told CommonWealth Beacon she did not refile the Boston home rule “because the mayor asked me not to.” Frankly, she said, “it’s not going anywhere.” (Wu’s office did not respond to questions about whether the mayor decided not to pursue the rent control home rule this session.) 
Some of Wu’s allies in City Hall are more eager to back the ballot measure. At-Large City Councilor Henry Santana introduced in September a nonbinding resolution to declare support for the ballot effort. 
“Putting rent control back on the ballot would let current Bostonians, many of which are at risk of displacement and housing insecurity, show their support or opposition for a measure that would directly impact their lives,” Santana said. Wu endorsed Santana and measure co-sponsors councilors Enrique Pepén and Ben Weber in their city council races this fall. 
The nonbinding resolution, however, faced opposition from some of the moderate councilors and remains in the council’s committee on housing and community development. 
Organizers for the ballot measure appear to be on solid footing so far. The campaign announced on Tuesday it collected more than 120,000 signatures ahead of a Wednesday deadline. While the final number certified by elections officials could be lower, the preliminary haul is well above the nearly 75,000 required to advance to the next stage.

Homes for All has lined up some influential allies. A quintet of labor groups — the SEIU Massachusetts State Council, the Massachusetts Teachers Association, UAW Region 9A MA Cap Council, UFCW Local 1445, and the Boston Teachers Union — last month endorsed the statewide ballot measure. 
Labor leaders say they hear regularly from members that housing costs are increasingly top of mind, and they want to pursue almost any tool imaginable. 
“Without bold action to slow the rising cost of housing, the essential workers who keep Massachusetts going won’t be able to afford to live here,” SEIU’s Dave Foley said in a statement. “By supporting rent stabilization, we’re demanding basic protections against excessive rent hikes to keep people in their homes and stabilize communities all across the state.” 
Landlords and developers have long opposed most rent control ideas, instead contending that Massachusetts must focus on quickly building new housing to rein in skyrocketing prices. 
Now staring down the prospect of one of the nation’s strictest policies, opponents have been quick to mobilize. Last month, the heads of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, the Massachusetts Association of Realtors, and commercial real estate development group NAIOP wrote to mayors and regional chambers of commerce lobbying against the measure. 
NAIOP CEO Tamara Small said she’s already hearing from prospective investors who intend to withdraw their plans if Massachusetts implements rent control. 
“The risk cannot be overstated,” she said in an interview. 
It’s not just the statewide application that concerns the real estate industry. Opponents said preventing rents from increasing beyond inflation, even while waiting for a new tenant, could make it difficult for property owners to absorb rising utility costs or invest in needed repairs. 
The ballot question would also define base rents as what landlords are charging on January 31, 2026 — 10 months before the measure could reach voters. 
Greater Boston Real Estate Board CEO Greg Vasil said industry groups are prepared to mount a campaign against the ballot question. “We’re fighting for the future of the Commonwealth, our housing future, and so we’ve got to do what it takes,” he said.  
“It’s going to be wildly expensive, but given the irreparable harm this would do, we’re certainly committed to fighting this,” Small added. 
The solution Small would like to see, she said, is simple: “production, production, production.” 
The new rent control ballot measure may clear its signature threshold just a week after a bracing report from the Boston Foundation on the state’s housing crunch. 
Massachusetts renters are navigating a market among the most expensive and constrained in the nation, according to the 2025 Greater Boston Housing Report Card. The Zillow Observed Rent Index, which tracks changes in market rents across housing types, in September found the benchmark rent in Boston’s metro area stood at nearly $3,000 per month without including utilities costs — the fifth highest in the US. 
According to BostonPads, a housing market research and tracking site, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Greater Boston is around $2,600 a month. That’s up about 3.9 percent from two years ago.  
The Boston metro area’s rental market is “especially tight,” according to the Boston Foundation report, trailing every other comparable major metropolitan area with a vacancy rate of just 3 percent. A stable rate is closer to 5.6 percent. 
“Low vacancies also give landlords more market power to push up rents and create the conditions for greater discrimination,” Boston Foundation researchers wrote. “Section 8 voucher holders, for instance, have a much harder time finding rental opportunities in tight rental markets.” 
To deal with existing overcrowding and accommodate future growth, the Healey administration says the state must build at least 222,000 housing units over the next decade. But, permitting and construction in Boston, the most populous city, is lagging according to city and federal data.

Two years ago, Connolly, the representative from Cambridge, began collecting signatures to advance a ballot question that would have allowed any city or town to regulate rents at whatever maximum increase they each deemed appropriate — a local-option system, not a statewide mandate — as well as to limit evictions, building demolitions, and condominium conversions. 
His campaign fragmented the left. Some progressive groups suggested at the time that there was not enough support for the local-option question to pass or that the movement was not yet unified enough to mount a robust campaign. 
The Homes for All coalition publicly called on Connolly to drop his effort, saying it would “detract from the effort to win the policies our communities need and is not supported by the vast majority of rent control advocates,” the Boston Globe reported in 2023. 
Just two years later, Homes for All is now leading the charge for a rent control ballot question much more dramatic than what Connolly sought. So what changed? 
 “The crisis has continued to intensify,” Chou said. 
“From Springfield to Boston to Worcester to Brockton to Lynn, we are seeing tenants continue to be priced out [and] face huge rent increases. Our communities can’t wait any longer,” she said. “Two years ago, we were really committed to building the infrastructure and building the grassroots people power it would need to take on this campaign, and making sure the question language was as simple, clear, and impactful as possible. We feel like we’re set up now to meet the moment.” 
The coalition has backed local option rent control legislation on Beacon Hill, but for the ballot question, organizers decided to pursue a policy that would immediately affect most renters across the state, not just those in the handful of communities already interested. 
A statewide measure, supporters say, presents voters with a simpler choice: “Do I want rent control in my hometown?” rather than “Do I want a city an hour away to be able to implement rent control after a subsequent vote at the local level?” 
And after witnessing the fierce blowback to the MBTA Communities housing law, which requires cities and towns served by the MBTA system to zone for more multifamily housing, some advocates worried that most communities would remain unwilling to cap rents even if a change to state law cleared the way.

“We will continue to work with the Legislature, but we can’t wait while corporate landlords continue to buy up buildings across our communities,” Chou said. “We felt we needed to pursue every tool in the toolbox to make sure our folks do not have exorbitant rent increases.” 
Some nervous progressives said Homes for All assured them that internal polling — which the campaign declined to share with CommonWealth Beacon — showed that a statewide mandate could garner significant support among voters. If that’s the case, they say, it makes the political gamble of backing such a measure feel less risky. 
Several insiders said they think faulty logic is at play.  
Dan Cohen, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on Connolly’s short-lived ballot question two years ago, said his own polling has found that the idea of statewide mandatory rent control does “not test as well as the local option” alternative. His survey two years ago found that the idea of a local rent control option was more popular than a statewide system by eight percentage points. 
And he worries that putting forward a statewide mandate will make the opposition campaign easier, allowing influential real estate groups to savage the ballot measure without coming across as making bad-faith claims. 
“They’re putting forward an instrument that is so blunt that suddenly the real estate industry arguments are not going to be entirely wrong,” Cohen said. 
Connolly recently signed the Homes for All petition and said he will “wholeheartedly” support the question if it makes it to the ballot because he thinks the state’s housing crunch is serious enough to embrace “any way possible to win rent control.” 
But he voiced similar concerns that a statewide mandate would “give the real estate industry the best chance it will have to use the proverbial fear-mongering and scare tactics to try to talk voters out of this.” 
Sen. Jamie Eldridge of Marlborough, another progressive who worked with Connolly on the earlier proposal, also said he’ll support the new campaign even as he worries it will be a “tougher sell.” 
“I will certainly be helpful, but yeah, I will say I do feel that the local option approach is easier to message,” he said.

Beacon Hill has been decidedly chilly toward efforts to allow rent control to return — even in just a handful of cities. 
The House overwhelmingly rejected reinstating rent control as part of a 2020 economic development bill, and lawmakers had little interest in considering the subject again by the time Wu’s rent stabilization plan took the spotlight. 
Rent control is usually soft-pitched as part of a “toolkit” along with other stabilization measures like housing production plans, eviction and tenant protections, permitting and zoning reforms, and incentives for good landlords.  
“Municipalities often have the most success when they are able to implement the solutions that work best for them,” said Adam Ploetz, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council’s manager of housing and neighborhood development. He noted two locally tailored proposals before lawmakers this session – one that would allow municipalities to impose a fee on high value real estate sales to fund affordable housing, and another that would give a renter the first chance to purchase their current unit if it goes on the market.  
Those sorts of measures, Ploetz said, “”would allow communities to implement common sense solutions where appropriate.”  
When the statewide rent control ban was headed to the ballot in 1994, only Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville had some form of municipal rent control policy in place. A majority of voters in those three cities voted to keep rent control on the books, but the measure prevailed 51 percent to 49 percent and, as a result, every community had to prohibit the practice. Any local attempt since then to carve a municipality out from the ban needs Beacon Hill approval, which lawmakers have declined to give to Boston, Somerville, and Brookline.  
The outcome left cities and towns in a common holding pattern when it comes to local rent control efforts: A measure is proposed, refined to meet community characteristics, okayed by municipal leaders, and sent up Beacon Hill for consideration from lawmakers. 
The measures from Boston, Brookline, and Somerville, each of which sought to cap rent increases while carving out new construction and smaller buildings, were met with shrugs on Beacon Hill. 
It’s not that rent control has no supporters in the Legislature. A version of the Rogers- Montaño local-option bill filed in the 2023-2024 legislative term notched more than 50 lawmakers as cosponsors. Without buy-in from the top, though, the bill died without clearing a single committee. 
That’s where the ballot question — a tactic activists increasingly use to circumvent an unwilling Legislature — comes into play.  
“If there’s the threat of the voters doing something, sometimes it can spur Beacon Hill to action,” Wilson said. “And maybe the best case scenario here is that Beacon Hill looks at this message of confidence coming out of the folks behind this about the prospects of passage and goes and does something on their own to re-legalize rent stabilization here in Massachusetts.” 
But going directly to voters carries risks. If a campaign fails, it can’t be brought back to the ballot box for at least six years. Lawmakers are also far less likely to approve a policy reform that has been recently rejected by voters. 
“Even if the loss is because of a particular nuance,” said Cohen, the strategist, “traditionally, a loss on the ballot will set something back by decades.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/maurarussel-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 09:56:45.301552

(photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Supreme Court has upheld state regulators’ decision to grant permits for a large gold mine planned for Southwest Alaska, bringing the proposed Donlin project a step closer to construction.
In a unanimous ruling published Friday, the court’s five justices said the Alaska Department of Natural Resources did not need to consider the environmental impact of the entire proposed Donlin Mine when it approved water use permits and a right-of-way permit needed for a natural gas pipeline intended to power the mine.
Their ruling has implications for many major development projects on private land and likely applies to projects on federal land as well, such as the large oil projects on Alaska’s North Slope.
“This decision is a major win for Alaska,” said Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox in a written statement. “The Court rightly recognized that the State’s permitting process met constitutional standards and that Article VIII (of the Alaska Constitution) does not extend to lands owned by Alaska Native Corporations or other private entities. This ruling not only affirms the integrity of DNR’s work but also protects the rights of Alaska Native Corporations and provides certainty for future development.”
The natural gas pipeline will stretch across state land, but the mine itself will be dug on land whose subsurface rights are owned by Calista Corporation, a regional Alaska Native corporation. 
Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Dario Borghesan said the distinction is important.
“Because these are private resources, rather than state resources, the Department was not required to consider the cumulative impacts of their development when deciding whether to allow the use of state waters and access over state lands to develop the mine,” he wrote.
The ruling says that to approve the gas pipeline, regulators needed to consider only the impact of the pipeline, not of the mine it allows. 
Until Friday, a 2013 decision by the Alaska Supreme Court known as REDOIL had required regulators to “take into account all aspects of a project” and consider the “cumulative impacts” when issuing permits for work on state land.
Friday’s decision somewhat limits that precedent, particularly for Alaska’s North Slope oil and gas industry, where most new drilling is taking place on federal land, not state land.
“This decision, I believe, makes clear that the REDOIL requirement to assess cumulative impacts only applies to projects that are on state lands,” said Jon Katchen, an attorney familiar with the new decision and author of a friend-of-the-court brief to the Supreme Court.
Friday’s decision covered two lawsuits filed by the Orutsararmiut Native Council and other Alaska Native tribes opposed to the mine’s development.
They appealed the case to the Alaska Supreme Court after an Anchorage Superior Court judge also ruled in favor of the defendants. The high court heard arguments one year ago.
“While this ruling is unfortunate, our work challenging the Donlin gold mine continues,” said Gage Hoffman, Orutsararmiut Traditional Native Council President, in an emailed statement. 
ONC, as the tribe is also known, is fighting the mine in federal court, and in June, a federal judge found problems with a federal assessment of part of the project.
ONC and other plaintiffs are being represented by Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, and a spokeswoman for that organization said it has another case on appeal at the Alaska Supreme Court as well as federal litigation.
“We will be pushing to ensure that the supplemental environmental study that the court ordered from our federal victory adequately analyses the risks posed by the mine,” Hoffman said. “Our people deserve to know about these dangers; our ways of life are dependent on healthy lands and waters, and it is our responsibility to ensure they are protected for future generations.”
Friday’s ruling covered separate lawsuits filed over different sets of permits. 
One lawsuit involved a permit challenged repeatedly since a preliminary decision in 2019, granting the use of state land needed to build a gas pipeline from Cook Inlet to the mine site.
Referring to legislative history and the text of the state’s Right of Way Leasing Act, Borghesan concluded, “none (of this) can be reasonably read to require the Department to consider the downstream effects of industrial activities by users of gas transported by the pipeline.”
The other suit addressed 12 water use permits issued in 2013 and 2016 by DNR to Donlin.
Plaintiffs argued that the Alaska Constitution, as interpreted by REDOIL, required DNR to consider the impact of the whole project.
Not so, Borgesan wrote.
“In our view, such a rule would extend article VIII (of the Alaska Constitution) far beyond its command to ascertain whether the development of state-owned resources is in the public’s interest.”
He also added that imposing such a restriction would be particularly problematic in the case of Donlin, because it involves land “chosen by ANCSA corporations as compensation for the loss of Alaska Natives’ aboriginal title to their ancestral territories. … These lands and minerals are reserved for their benefit, not for the benefit of Alaskans generally.”
Plaintiffs had argued that DNR failed to consider what will happen after the mine closes, when the mining pit will be filled by rainwater and seepage.
“Pumping will be required in perpetuity to ensure the lake’s water levels do not overtop its banks,” Borghesan wrote, adding that water treatment will also be required forever. 
“This is because the water will have high levels of heavy metals due to contact with mining waste, and will have to be treated in perpetuity to protect downstream lands, waters, fish and wildlife, and people.”
Despite that conclusion, he said the justices “are persuaded that the Department was not required to consider the environmental impacts of the pit lake” because that lake will be regulated by state and federal pollution permits and rules, not just the water-use permits. 
Friday’s decision emphasized that the justices are not intending to give an open hand to development.
“We hold only that the Department was not required, when deciding whether to issue water appropriation and pipeline right-of-way permits for use in mining privately owned minerals on private lands, to condition those permits on an analysis of the cumulative impacts of the mining itself,” the decision states.

A San Francisco state senator unveiled legislation Tuesday that aims to give Californians the right to seek damages from federal agents, as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement across the U.S.
The bill authored by Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat and congressional hopeful, would enable people to file a lawsuit or seek redress against local, state and federal officers for violating their constitutional rights.

Wiener, at a press conference: “This (federal) administration is attempting to wield unchecked power to illegally kidnap and deport people, to punish the administration’s political opponents using government resources, to freeze university funding and to fire thousands of federal workers en masse.”

The measure works to promote what’re known as Bivens lawsuits, a precedent established by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1971, which permits individuals to sue federal officers for violating their constitutional rights. But in the years since, the high court has curtailed Bivens actions, making it difficult for people to bring forth claims and recover damages.
In October ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained during immigration sweeps — some of whom were reportedly beaten and shot. Little recourse is available for victims, though in a rare case, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department arrested a federal immigration enforcement officer last week after he held a teenage boy at gunpoint and detained him.
Wiener’s proposal comes a day after the Trump administration filed a lawsuit to block a new California law written by Wiener that bans law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing face coverings. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned other agencies that criminals have posed as immigration agents to carry out crimes, but the U.S. Department of Justice said California’s law threatens the safety of federal officers.

Cal State, facing layoffs, will vote on boosting exec pay

The California State University’s board of trustees plans to vote today on whether to change the university system’s executive pay structure in a way that would boost their wages — a potential overhaul that has drawn blowback from Cal State’s unionized staff and faculty, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
Currently, Cal State caps the base pay of its 22 campus presidents at a salary that’s no more than 10% above what their predecessors made. Raises for sitting presidents are also no higher than 10%. The average base pay for presidents ranges from $370,000 to more than $500,000. 
But Cal State says the policy leads to uncompetitive compensation. Trustees are deciding on a plan that would raise the executive base pay (along with overall wage increases for other Cal State workers), and add a 15% incentive-based pay bump that executives would be eligible for.
The proposal comes during a time when Cal State is facing limited budgets, layoffs and program cuts.

Erin Foote, a union board member for California State Employees Union: “I am mad. … We are going to knock the doors of our legislators so hard there will be holes in them until they stand with us in their budget negotiations.”

Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist and former hedge fund manager, said today that he is running to be California’s next governor, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Steyer kicked off his campaign with a video where he pledges to preserve the state as a place for business and innovation, while also lowering California’s cost of living by making corporations pay “their fair share.”

Steyer: “The Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. Californians deserve a life they can afford.”

The mega-donor for California Democrats spent more than $12.8 million in support of Proposition 50, making him the second-largest independent ad buyer in state history. As an outspoken critic of Trump, Steyer poured millions in a national ad campaign that advocated for the president’s impeachment during his first term. Steyer also ran for president in 2020 before ultimately dropping out of the race.

Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist and businessman who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2020, is the latest Democrat to jump into California’s crowded gubernatorial field.
His two core promises — which could appear at odds — are to preserve the state’s status as a hub for business and innovation while also lowering California’s cost of living by making corporations pay “their fair share,” he said in a video message.
The nearly two-minute campaign launch film, which intersperses sleek graphics with footage of line cooks, ranchers and manufacturing workers on the job, encapsulates those dueling themes. 
“There’s a reason everybody comes here to start businesses — because this is the place that invents the future,” Steyer says near the start of the video. “I never want to lose that spark.” 
Steyer made his fortune as the founder of Farallon Capital, a hedge fund headquartered in San Francisco that currently manages about $42 billion in assets. After selling his stake in the company in 2012, Steyer started NextGen America, a liberal nonprofit that supports progressive positions on issues such as climate change, immigration, health care and education. The group also launched a labor-aligned super PAC to fund races nationwide.
His activism through NextGen America has elevated Steyer’s profile in recent years from little-known hedge fund manager to global climate activist and Republican antagonizer. He has spent millions to pass progressive ballot measures to uphold California environmental laws, raise taxes on tobacco to fund health care and push states to invest in more renewable energy.
Gov. Gavin Newsom terms out next year. At least six other Democrats are running to replace him, including former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 
While a billionaire former financial executive might be at odds with a party base hungry for a more relatable fighter, he’s attempting to appeal to everyday Californians by spotlighting the issue that most people say is their top priority — affordability. 
“The Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living,” Steyer says later in the video. “Californians deserve a life they can afford.”
Steyer also promises to “launch the largest drive to build homes that you can afford” in state history, rein in monopolistic utilities that have driven up costs and “drop our sky-high energy prices.”
Steyer’s nearly $13 million advertising blitz in support of Proposition 50, the congressional redistricting plan that voters approved earlier this month via special election, led many California political insiders to speculate that he would launch another bid for governor. 
He alluded to his gubernatorial ambitions when he launched a controversial advertisement that, rather than amplify the Yes on Prop. 50 campaign’s message of checking the Trump administration’s power, touted his own calls to impeach and resist President Donald Trump.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111825-Tom-Steyer-RS-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 09:56:45.301552

While the Massachusetts House considers the pros and cons of the legislation passed by the state Senate, the negative mental health effects of cellphones in schools continue to plague students’ ability to learn and socialize in classrooms across the state.  The issue holding back this critical protection for students? A new generation of parents are demanding a constant lifeline to their children, unaware of the detrimental social impacts of cellphone addiction that teachers are witnessing firsthand.   The anxiety of parents is impacting the tranquility of schools. The political balance of limiting digital distractions and cyberbullying in K-12 schools with parents’ demands to contact their children during the school day has resulted in a patchwork of district-level decisions by school leaders. Districts that have implemented cellphone bans have witnessed immediate improvements in students’ communication, socialization, and academics. They have also experienced pushback and outrage from parents.  We do not know the long-term impacts of online activity on children’s brain development. And we may never have absolute, conclusive data on the brain impacts of screen use. But there is a continuum of research outlining two increasingly unnerving data points: Greater smartphone usage by students results in higher rates of depression and poor academic performance, and students are increasingly using their cellphones more during the school day.  The desire for constant digital contact with a child is a modern extension of “helicopter parenting.” The excessive supervision of parents has already shrunk the boundaries of neighborhood play, redefined sleepovers, and cast aspersions on vaccines. Now, the need to constantly contact a child has become a flashpoint in school board meetings and parent-teacher conferences across the country.  
Parents need to ask themselves whether this truly serves their child’s best interest. And the Legislature needs to empower school administrators to turn off the phones in favor of engaged, safe, and independent learning.  The job of educators to implement health-conscious environments is not a new responsibility. For decades, parents have relied on schools to educate their children in nonacademic areas where they lack expertise. Sexual education, nutritional health, and digital literacy are examples of school-based education provided at the local level over the previous decades, which were put into place to counter growing societal trends in sexually transmitted diseases, obesity, and internet privacy issues impacting a vulnerable population. Many of these educational programs have state-sponsored support. Cellphone usage is the next frontier of this designation and should be incorporated into state law to save a generation of students biologically addicted to their screens.  We cannot wait 10 years for conclusive data on the impacts of screen use on dopamine receptors to tell us what educators already know. We are at an inflection point in how Generation Alpha develops focus, resilience, and social skills. Time is wasting to protect our students from the generational disease of cellphone addiction.  
There are too many mental health problems, plummeting grades, and increasing cyberbullying trends to allow further delay. To save the next generation of students, Massachusetts must enact a bell-to-bell cellphone ban.

The protest was part of the national ""50501 Movement,"" which aimed to host 50 protests in 50 states on one day. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)A Michigan woman who says she unwittingly walked into a meeting of the Manistee County Republican Party is speaking out after attendees were handed a flyer suggesting motorists were justified in using force – including driving through crowds of people  – to clear blocked roads blocked by protests.
Janet Stancliff, of Manistee County, told Michigan Advance on Tuesday she mistakenly entered the wrong meeting room Oct. 9 at West Shore Community College in Manistee. She had intended to attend a meeting of the local League of Women Voters chapter, with both groups scheduled to meet in adjacent spaces.
Stancliff said she and her boyfriend sat in the front row, unaware they were in the wrong gathering, and were given a sheet of paper titled “Manistee GOP Internal Memo.” The document, dated Aug. 14, 2025, outlines suggested positions for Manistee County Republicans regarding protesters who block roads.
The Advance was able to review the document, which states that protestors have “shown disdain and contempt for motorists and their passengers” in recent years “by preventing them from proceeding to their destinations, which could include medical emergencies.” 
It goes on to say that obstructed motorists “do not appear to have certain knowledge about what to do when the road is blocked by protesters” and urges Manistee County Republicans to adopt several recommendations, including that motorists “are justified in driving their vehicles through the protesters to escape,” that they are “authorized to use personal force, including weapons,” and that drivers “as militia or otherwise” would be justified in arresting and detaining protesters. The memo further asserts motorists may sue protesters for damages.










I’m pretty sure it’s illegal to run someone over with your car.


– Manistee resident Janet Stancliff


While the flyer handed to Stancliff contains no letterhead or official markings, Duane Jones, the chair of the Manistee County Republican Party, confirmed her story for the Advance.
“The document was presented by a member at our October meeting. It is authentic, but is not an ‘Official Internal Memo’ as titled,” Jones said in an email to Michigan Advance. “No action was requested or taken on the content of the document, nor is it official policy of the Manistee County Republican Party.”
When the Advance asked Jones if he agreed with what was being advocated in the flyer, he said: “That’s not relevant.”
Stancliff said she was initially confused about the nature of the meeting. 
“I started reading it, and I said to my boyfriend, ‘Is this a joke?’” she recalled. 
She said the pair realized they were in the wrong room only after the meeting began with what she described as a lengthy prayer invoking political themes.
“We got up and left,” Stancliff said. “Afterward I showed the memo to my friend, who couldn’t believe it. I said, ‘I can’t believe it either, because I’m pretty sure it’s illegal to run someone over with your car.’”
Under current Michigan law, blocking traffic is a civil infraction, as reinforced by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, in a December 2024 executive summary in which she noted that protesting and picketing “are generally protected speech under the First Amendment,” and that local criminal ordinances that address traffic safety “should be applied reasonably and judiciously.”
However, legislation has been proposed to change that status, including House Bill 4664, which seeks to update traffic obstruction to a misdemeanor, carrying penalties of up to 93 days in jail or a $5,000 fine when the blockage occurs during assemblies of ten or more people. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Alicia St. Germaine (R-Harrison Township), passed the House in September, but remains in committee in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 500, introduced in August by state Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake), who is also chair of the Michigan Republican Party, would shield drivers from civil liability if they kill or injure protestors while acting in self-defense and their actions “arose from another individual’s conduct in furtherance of a riot.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If approved, those bills would put Michigan in the ranks of other states that passed laws to punish protests after Americans took to the streets following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.
But as the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law notes, neither the bill nor existing Michigan law defines what constitutes “conduct in furtherance of a riot,” which it calls “a vague phrase” that could include ordinary, nonviolent protest activities, including handing out water or chanting. 
The center added that if enacted, it believes the bill “could encourage violence by drivers and others against people who are participating in or supporting a protest.” 
Runestad’s bill was assigned to the Senate’s Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety, where it remains.
Regardless, Stancliff said the document concerned her because it circulated shortly before planned No Kings protests across the country, including in Manistee. 
“It was a little scary,” she said. “People are pretty nutty right now.”
Despite the confusion of the night, Stancliff emphasized her motivation for speaking about the experience. 
“I’m an aging hippie and a liberal,” Stancliff said. “I am, like most other people like me, absolutely outraged, horrified, and terrified right now at what is going on in Washington, D.C., and the world.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0454-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721
,California,2025-11-19 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s rural youth struggle alone with mental health. Their peers could learn to help them,Alonzia Quinn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/california-rural-youth-mental-health/,Suicide is 50% higher among rural young people than among others in urban or suburban environments. Many also live too far to get counseling.,"Guest Commentary written by

Alonzia Quinn
Alonzia Quinn is a senior at Stanford University studying political science.


Imagine a high school student in rural California, struggling with a mental issue for weeks with no one to talk to. The nearest therapist is hours away, the youth’s family can’t spare the time or gas and even if they could get there, the next available appointment isn’t for months. 
It’s likely the student will keep showing up to school, pretending everything’s fine. 
Now imagine a trained classmate they could talk to after class — someone who could listen, really understand and help them find support.
In rural America, young people face some of the most alarming mental health challenges in the nation, with rates of depression, anxiety and suicide far outpacing those of their urban peers. Suicide rates among rural adolescents and young adults are nearly 50% higher than those in suburban or urban areas. California is not an exception to this trend.
Limited insurance coverage and severe shortages of mental health professionals only deepen the crisis. About two-thirds of rural counties lack a psychiatrist, 8 in 10 lack a psychiatric nurse practitioner and nearly half lack a psychologist, experts say. 
States have tried bridging the gap through telehealth, but systems connecting patients with caregivers online fall short when about 30% of rural households lack reliable internet. 
And while artificial intelligence has been proposed to promote access to help, its impact remains limited in rural areas where technological barriers persist. Besides, no algorithm can replace the empathy and trust that come from a human connection.
For rural students, getting help can feel nearly impossible. A “quick trip” to the doctor might mean driving 50 to 100 miles — if a provider is available. Distance and other barriers lead to missed appointments, inconsistent treatment and worsening symptoms.
Gov. Gavin Newsom should support legislation ensuring every rural high school offers access to mental health peer support programs. State Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina who this year introduced mental health education legislation, is well positioned to lead the effort.
My own journey into youth mental health advocacy began with a similar goal: helping students feel supported and comfortable reaching out.
I grew up in Iowa, where care was limited and stigma ran deeper than our corn fields. 
On the Waterloo Youth City Council, I spent two years working to change that. Our biggest win came with a bill requiring schools to print crisis hotline information on student ID cards. When the bill passed the Iowa House, it felt like a victory not just for policy, but for every student who might see that number in a moment of crisis and decide to reach out.
California recently took a similar step, requiring that schools add the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to student IDs. It’s meaningful, but awareness alone isn’t enough. Knowing where to turn doesn’t always make it easier to ask for help. 
Sometimes what students need most is a face-to-face connection — a peer who understands.
Leave no student behind
Peer support programs train students to bolster one another, offering empathy, connection and a first point of contact for those who might otherwise struggle in silence. In structured elective classes with teacher oversight and clinical guidance, peer supporters learn to listen, document responsibly and know when to refer someone to a professional. 
Several California high schools have piloted this model, but many rural schools have been left out. With funding available through the Behavioral Health Services Act — a 1% tax on incomes over $1 million — California has the opportunity to expand these programs and ensure rural students aren’t left behind.
Some may worry that focusing on rural schools leaves urban students behind, but rural students face the steepest barriers, often attending school without a single counselor or psychologist. This legislation isn’t about playing favorites; it’s about closing an equity gap. 
Now imagine that student in rural California — the one silently struggling — finally having someone to turn to right down the hall. That single connection can turn isolation into hope. 
Young people want support that feels genuine, relatable and free of stigma. Peer programs can make reaching out less intimidating and more human. If California truly wants to meet the mental health needs of its youth, it must ensure no student faces the silence alone.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092624_Santa-Rosa-Junior-College-Adjunct_AC_CM-18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

The commission voted 5-1 to continue the contract after a presentation from APT staff and in front of 50 people, many of whom spoke about the importance of public broadcasting in their lives. Commissioner Tijuanna Adetunji was not present for the vote.
Diana Isom, who attended the meeting, told the commission that PBS Kids programming had been invaluable for her son.

“PBS is the reason my son is at a kindergarten level at three years old,” Isom told the commission. “My son goes to an autism clinic, all of those kids watch PBS. A lot of children benefit from it so much, especially autistic kids.” 
Two commissioners at October’s meeting suggested dropping PBS programming, citing the Trump administration’s slashing the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) this summer and what one member of the commission characterized as ideological objections. 
But the proposal drew sharp criticism from around the state, including over 1,400 emails to APT. Before the meeting began on Tuesday, a group of over 30 protesters gathered outside of the APT building to advocate for the AETC to vote in favor of keeping PBS programs going.
“I think it’s important to stand up for quality education, quality programs for our children, especially in economic times such as these, not everyone can afford cable. It’s nice to have free educational programs available to all Alabama’s children,” Julie Reese, one of the protesters, said.

In a letter sent Monday, Gov. Kay Ivey asked the commission to survey the public to see if disaffiliation with PBS had support, and then develop a plan to do so. Pete Conroy, a member of the AETC, passed a motion at the meeting to create a commission to study the issue, consisting of journalists and broadcasters.
“This is Alabama Public Television. It’s not Alabama Commissioner Television. So that motion will establish a group to help us make some of these decisions,” Conroy said.
APT Executive Director Wayne Reid said during the meeting if the station dropped programming it would be replaced by American Public Television, a non-profit syndicator that he said produces “complementary programming” to PBS.
But Reid told commissioners that if PBS programming stopped altogether, it could result in a drop in annual membership contributions of $2.4 to $2.7 million, hurting APT operations. making it hard for APT to continue.
“There was a station in Los Angeles, the only station I know of, but the last station that tried to,” Reid said. “They were mad about PBS dues. They thought they were too high, so they said they were going to break off. They were going to go independent. And they lasted 18 months.
Reid said Tuesday the station received emails and phone calls and tags on social media expressing concerns about stopping PBS programs.
“I’ve been a fan of PBS since my children were little, and they’re now in their 50s. Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers, you read it and as a senior citizen,” Carol Binder, a Hoover resident who attended the meeting, said. “Now, I love everything on PBS. I have [PBS] Passport, and there’s hundreds and hundreds of programs, and it’s just not right for one, two or three people who don’t like the program to cut it off for everybody in the state. It’s outrageous.”
Reese said she heard from other protesters that they wouldn’t continue to donate if programming was cut.
“I just spoke to a gentleman down the corner, he donates to apt, he will not continue donating to apt if PBS folds, which is going to severely impact Alabama public television,” she said.

Following Reid’s presentation, Commissioner Bebe Williams made a motion to continue to pay the PBS contract and maintain programming which passed with only one commissioner, Les Barnett, voting no.
Sens. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, and Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, also spoke to the commission, sharing their own experiences with public broadcasting.  
“You may not be able to travel around the world. I have the opportunity now, but I’ve already been there with public television,” Coleman-Madison said. “And the good thing about it, when I do go, I know where they’re telling me the truth or they’re giving me a snow job. It is trust. We trust public television because we know that the information we get in particular on PBS is going to be true, is going to be factual.”
Conroy praised the decision to continue the contract after the meeting.
“I think today really was a huge victory for the state of Alabama, victory for PBS and APT, although it needs constant attention and this is the beginning of a campaign and not the end,” Conroy said after the meeting. 
Reid said continuing the contract, which expires next June, gives APT a clear picture of what direction to go next.
“I’m a business guy [and] I don’t like to go back on contracts that we’ve signed. To some degree it was a little bit of a relief.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Two new legislative audits paint a picture of inadequate and flawed mental health care in Utah’s state prison in Salt Lake City.
The reviews released Tuesday found employees failed to properly monitor those at risk of suicide, and the impact is illustrated in several examples of self harm, with one person taking their own life. 
Auditors said a psychiatrist who assisted in the audit process concluded “inmates are often abandoned” because of a lack of consistent follow-up in care. They also recorded examples of some getting the wrong psychiatric medications and others missing doses. 
Together, the two wide-ranging reviews totaled more than 160 pages, with one warning of “significant deficiencies and critical issues in need of immediate action.”

One review focused on the Division of Correctional Health Services under Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services, and the other on the Utah Department of Corrections.
The reports come three years after the prison relocated from Draper to Salt Lake City, with a new design that state leaders and prison officials described as “humane,” with a focus on rehabilitation and therapy.
Auditors recommended that the division design a suicide prevention program and a process to review prescriptions, that the agencies collaborate and revise their policies and procedures, and that the prison ensures officers are adequately supervising inmates.
Stacey Bank, executive medical director for the Department of Health and Human Services, told legislative leaders on an audit review panel Tuesday that the agency has already developed new procedures on suicide. It has brought on two psychiatry fellows from the University of Utah who have helped provide more clinical oversight, she said.
Bank said there hasn’t been a suicide at the prison in over a year, “an outcome that reflects focused prevention, better integration and a patient-centered approach.”  
The Utah Department of Corrections is also already at work on many of the recommendations, added deputy executive director Rebecca Brown. 
“Our plan of action really centers on policy revision, enhanced supervision, improved coordination, and formalizing best practices between security and safety,” Brown told the panel.
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said some of the audit’s findings were red flags and brought up questions about the staffing the prison needs to make sure it’s getting prescriptions and other issues right when it comes to mental health. 
“I want to make sure you have what you need,” Escamilla said. “Some of these mistakes that are in this audit are alarming.”
Monitoring and suicide
Among other findings in the audits, reviewers found the correctional health services agency violated its own policy by failing to constantly monitor 26 inmates in the prison’s psychiatric infirmary who had attempted suicide or were deemed “acutely suicidal” from October 2024 to March 2025, the audit said. 
They received the lowest level of observation in the prison’s psychiatric infirmary, which is monitoring in 15-minute intervals. In the time between checks, multiple patients attempted to harm themselves.
When it comes to checks by corrections officers, “we noted that some officers were filling out the logs without looking in the inmate cell and verifying their safety in the report,” auditor Brendon Ressler told the legislative panel.
One person’s suicide was not discovered for over an hour, Ressler said. 
No tracking of suicide attempts 
The audit found the Division of Correctional Health Services doesn’t collect or analyze data on suicide attempts, limiting its ability to evaluate risks, spot trends and make improvements.
“Identifying risk patterns can uncover trends,” auditors wrote. They did their own analysis and found 21 people attempted suicide, some multiple times, from October 2024 to March 2025. 
By comparison, the Arizona Department of Corrections tracks its data, the audit says, and the Utah State Hospital does a similar analysis, with the added step of reviewing what happened to find a root cause. 
Understaffing and its fallout
Auditors documented “the negative effect of not having a staff psychiatrist” at the prison. 
After a full-time psychiatrist left the job in July 2024, it took more than a year for the state to hire a part-time replacement, a delay the division attributed to “the challenges associated with offering a competitive salary,” one audit says. 
The prison has relied on advanced practice registered nurses who have more limited training, with only one of those nurses for every 609 people in the prison with moderate to severe mental health needs, the audit said. 
They may be experiencing excessive workloads, the audit mentioned, leading them to feel overwhelmed or burned out. 
“Consequently, inmates with severe mental health needs did not receive the level of attention and treatment that their condition required,” the report states. “The lack of consistent follow-up has led the consultant to conclude that ‘inmates are often abandoned,’ which is deeply concerning.”
Those housed in the psychiatric infirmary receive brief provider assessments daily, but do not have access to other services such as psychotherapy or group therapy, auditors noted. 
They wrote that “many inmates in the psychiatric infirmary were suicidal due to identifiable life stressors such as divorce or bereavement — conditions that respond well to therapeutic intervention. Instead, these inmates were met with prolonged isolation.”

That’s why, as California’s population soared in the post-World War II era, those who aspired to govern the state typically declared their ambitions at least two years out, even if they were already occupying other offices.
That bit of political history is offered because California voters will elect a new governor in less than a year, and filing candidacy paperwork will open in just a few weeks, but the field of candidates seems to change almost daily.
Some who were in have dropped out, such as Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former state Senate leader Toni Atkins. Meanwhile, some who considered a run — such as former Vice President Kamala Harris — backed away, and at least one who had opted out may jump back in. And names of other potential candidates continue to pop up.
The cloud of uncertainty underscores not only the daunting logistics of a California campaign, but perhaps some hesitancy about trying to govern a state that in many ways may be ungovernable.
Gavin Newsom will cede the office, probably to mount a campaign for president, with the major issues that plagued California when he became governor in 2019 still unresolved, and in some cases even worse.
Uncertain water supply, sub-par public education outcomes, an acute housing shortage, rampant homelessness, high levels of unemployment and poverty,  crushing costs of living and a chronically unbalanced state budget are just a few of the critical issues awaiting whoever survives the forthcoming campaign.
There are a few would-be governors who announced early, such as former Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Congressman Xavier Becerra.
However, their ability to raise the immense amounts of money needed to finance a campaign is hindered by uncertainty over who else might jump in. The lesser known candidates, such as state schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond, former Controller Betty Yee and former Assemblyman Ian Calderon, are even more disadvantaged.

The cloudy picture on the Democratic side doesn’t affect the two most prominent Republicans running, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former television personality Steve Hilton, but their roles hinge on whether one will place second in the top-two primary election in June or if two Democrats emerge as finalists in the November election.
A very wealthy businessman, Republican-turned-Democrat Rick Caruso, is among those still dithering. Another billionaire, Tom Steyer, dumped a bunch of money into a personal campaign for Proposition 50, Newsom’s partisan congressional gerrymander, implying he’s thinking about it.
Congressman Eric Swalwell, who has become one of President Donald Trump’s most persistent critics, is reportedly weighing a run. Pestering Trump worked for Adam Schiff, who rode it into a U.S. Senate seat, so it might help Swalwell, given voters’ rampant dislike of Trump.
And then there’s Attorney General Rob Bonta, who — somewhat surprisingly — took himself out of contention early and said he would seek re-election. It was surprising because Bonta is a notorious publicity hound who issues some sort of announcement virtually every working day. Tuesday’s version was intervening in a lawsuit over legislation dealing with art theft.
The buzz this week is that Bonta is reconsidering a run for governor due to the lack of an obvious frontrunner.
So who is ahead?
A recent poll by UC-Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies found that among the declared Democrats, Porter was leading at 11% of registered voters, but Sheriff Bianco was the overall leader at 13%.

The council voted to approve rezoning for a data center that drew criticism from residents and environmental groups. (Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)BESSEMER — The Bessemer City Council Tuesday allowed a $14 billion data center to move forward over objections from residents and environmental groups who expressed concerns about water usage and pollution.
The council voted 5-2 to change a zoning designation from residential to light industrial, effectively clearing the final hurdle with Bessemer before construction can begin.
“We have all been listening,” said Carla Jackson, a member of the city council prior to voting to approve the zoning change. “We heard your concerns, and we have waited. Unbeknownst to you, we have done the research.”

The zoning change applies to 670 acres of land within the Bessemer city limits. The construction site is more than one square mile, according to Brad Kaaber, a representative from Logistics Land Investment LLC based out of Atlanta that is developing the site for the data center. He told the council during the meeting that each of the buildings is set back at least 100 feet from the property line. The property also has ridges that conceal the visibility of the buildings.
“In order to get to this point, we had to go through vast amounts of due diligence,” Kaaber said during this presentation to the council. “We have had multiple studies done on this site, including an environmental site assessment, endangered species, traffic studies, wetland delineation reports, all of which show there are no endangered species on the site. There are no archeological findings on this site.”
Kaaber said the project will not affect any of the streams or waterways. However, the data center is expected to consume about two million gallons of water daily, according to a memo that the developer sent to the Warrior River Water Authority that serves residents and businesses in the area. That water, used to cool equipment, will not be available to others to use in an area.
“They requested two million gallons a day from a fairly rural, under-resourced, drinking water utility, and we have questions about whether that utility can upgrade its system without any cost to its customers in order to serve the data center,” said Ryan Anderson, a staff attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a legal advocacy organization for environmental protections. “And there is another really basic question of whether they are going to use surface water or ground water.”
“I am very concerned about the aquifer because they will dewater the site,” said Mary Rosenboom, a resident who lives one mile from the proposed data center site.
The city’s planning and zoning commission voted to approve the project twice after the city council sent the project back to the commission as residents, along with environmental groups, continued to express concerns about the proposed data center.
The public is becoming increasingly aware of the impact that data centers have on the communities as more are being built to accommodate the increasing demand for technology, particularly with the growth of artificial intelligence.
Many have expressed concerns about the noise that the data center generates, for example.
Residents at Tuesday’s meetings also objected to electricity consumption by the data center and its potential impact on utility rates. Others
Expressed concerns with pollution, particularly the use of fossil fuel plants to power the center.  “It will cause carbon dioxide and methane emissions, which we already know are warming the atmosphere and aggravating different illnesses,” said Julianne Tharp, a field and advocacy fellow with the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution.
Tharp said she is worried that the data center will increase cases of asthma and other respiratory problems.
Others told the council that they supported the construction of the data center because of the jobs it will bring and the positive impact it will have on the school system.
“We have a wonderful opportunity here today, you do, to make something happen, in this state,” said Michael Turner, superintendent of the city’s school system.
The data center is expected to generate almost $132 million in benefits to the city from sales and property taxes, as well as franchise fees and building permit fees, according to an estimate from the Birmingham Business Alliance. It is also expected to garner another $538 million in benefits to the schools in the city.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bessemer-data-center-hearing-Nov-18-2025-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

(Photo by Sergio Flores/Bloomberg, Getty Images)A proposal that would lower the minimum age requirement to purchase a long gun in Florida from 21 to 18 won approval in its first committee stop in the Florida House on Tuesday.
The measure (HB 133), sponsored by Rep. Tyler Sirois, R-Merritt Island, is likely to advance through the House in the coming session, as a similar proposal has passed the entire chamber in each of the past three years. However, it’s stalled in the Legislature because there hasn’t been a Senate companion.
The measure passed in the Criminal Justice Subcommittee along party lines, 11-5. It now has just one more committee stop before it would go before the entire chamber for a vote.
The Florida Legislature raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21 after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.
The National Rifle Association immediately challenged the law in court, but earlier this year, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied that challenge, two years after a three-judge panel similarly ruled against the organization. The NRA has since appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said after that ruling that his office would not defend the law if in fact the NRA filed an appeal with the high court.
Speaking for the legislation, Rep. Jessica Baker, R-Duval County, noted that now in Florida a 19-year-old can own a long gun if someone gives it to him or her, but cannot purchase one. “If we believe in equality, how is it fair that a young adult from a well-off family can get a gun as a gift, and protect their homes and their families, but a young adult with no family support cannot?” she asked.
Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, D-Broward, said that the mother of the teen who killed the 17 people in Parkland in 2018 had said that she never would have given him a gun. “He was able to get his hands on that gun because he was allowed to purchase it. And that’s why the law is written the way it is,” she said.
There is not yet a Senate companion, and it’s not certain that there will be. Rep. Sirois said that the Senate’s deadline to file legislation passes when the 2026 regular legislative session begins.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)Two Air Force veterans will face off in January to fill a Statehouse seat representing Dorchester County.
Greg Ford, a retired combat veteran, won Tuesday’s Republican primary runoff with 56% of the vote against Brian Hill, according to unofficial results from the South Carolina Election Commission.
The runoff set the ballot for the Jan. 6 special election for the state House seat being vacated by former House Judiciary Chairman Chris Murphy, R-Summerville.
Voters in House District 98 will choose between Ford and Democrat Sonja Ogletree-Satani, who easily won a three-way Democratic primary outright two weeks ago to avoid a runoff.
Hill, who owns a trucking company and worked 40 years in the maritime industry, was the top vote-getter in the three-way GOP primary Nov. 4, with 43% of the vote. But in South Carolina, a runoff is required if no candidate receives at least 50% plus one vote.
Murphy, a 57-year-old attorney, submitted his resignation Aug. 20 for the seat he first won in 2010. The effective date of his resignation is Jan. 5.
The special election the next day will bring the House back to full membership one week before the 2026 legislative session starts.
Two other special elections for House seats are set for Dec. 23.
In Lexington County, Republican John Lastinger will face Democrat Chuck Hightower to fill the vacancy created when ex-Rep. RJ May resigned ahead of pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
Next month’s election for a Greenville County seat is largely a formality, since no Democrat is on the ballot. Republican Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher, is set to replace Rep. Bobby Cox after winning a GOP runoff Nov. 4. Cox submitted his resignation in August with the intention of running for a Senate seat, then dropped out altogether.
The special elections will not change Republicans’ supermajority advantage in the House. Membership consists of 87 Republicans and 36 Democrats, with one open seat.

Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen and Assemblymember Alexis Hansen, who are married, negotiated with Democrats to force one of their own priorities to be considered alongside Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s.
In Nevada, when a governor calls a special session, lawmakers are limited to the topics included within the official proclamation. But legislators also have the ability to call themselves into a special session, if two-thirds of the members in both houses agree to it.
Democrats are one lawmakers shy of supermajorities in each house, so they cannot do that on their own.
The Hansens agreed to join with Democrats and sign a petition to resurrect a bill originally sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal that seeks to limit cash-rich corporate investors from purchasing large swaths of housing.
In 2023, the bill passed the Legislature but was vetoed by Lombardo. Ira Hansen voted for the bill; Alexis Hansen did not.
In 2025, the bill died in the Senate because it needed to pass with a two-thirds majority and fell one vote shy. Before the floor vote, Ira Hansen, whose support would have pushed it over the two-thirds threshold, announced he would reluctantly vote against the bill because the governor asked him to.
He has since called that his biggest regret of that legislative session, according to The Nevada Independent.
The amended proclamation reflecting the petition from the Hansens and Democrats is expected to be officially received Wednesday. The new bill is expected to mostly mirror Neal’s earlier version, though it has not yet been made publicly available.
Here are the bills still in play and where they are as the Legislature goes into the seventh day of the special session:

AB4, the governor’s crime bill, received a major amendment Tuesday and is headed to the Assembly, which will need to vote to accept or reject the amendment. If the chamber concurs, the bill will head to the governor’s office for final approval.
SB9, a newly introduced bill that includes select provisions of the crime bill, is on the “secretary’s desk.” That location is a purgatory of sorts where bills wait for myriad reasons.
AB5, the Summerlin Studios film bill, is sitting on the Senate’s agenda, ready for a vote.
SB4, which appropriates money to myriad projects or state agencies (including the University of Nevada Reno for a life sciences building), is sitting on the Assembly’s agenda, ready for a vote.
SB5, which establishes a health care grant program designed to address provider shortages across the state, is sitting on the Assembly’s agenda, ready for a vote.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08183-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 07:57:14.385249

More specifically, the question was about what made him different compared to Michigan Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak. In the basement of Wilson Hall at Michigan State University, he keyed in one issue: Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.
For some candidates across the nation running for public office big and small, the question could have been debasing, but El-Sayed has been talking about the strife of the Palestinian people since he started his bid for the 2026 contest. McMorrow has only recently said that she believed what was happening in Gaza was a genocide, and some have questioned whether that stance was genuine.

Either way, from the halls of power in Washington, D.C. to the state Legislature and the campaign trail, some Michigan Democrats have made the Palestinian people and their current plight in Gaza cornerstones of their current political work, and other Democrats appear to be taking notes.
“I think there’s a particular kind of shock and horror that folks should have about the idea that our political system can’t countenance the murder of 20,000 kids by our own tax dollars, and call it what it is,” Abdul told the Michigan Advance after the event. “And at the same time, I’m grateful that we seem to be at least headed in the direction where we can turn the page. I’m not running for Senate to obfuscate things. I’m not running for Senate to lie to myself or the people that I represent about what’s happening in the world and what’s being done with their tax dollars. I’m running for U.S. Senate to clarify what’s happening and to try to do something about it.”
Last week, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) introduced a House resolution officially recognizing the the situation in Gaza and the actions of the Israeli government as a genocide. Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, was joined by 20 other members of Congress in introducing House Resolution 876 of 2025.



The resolution was co-sponsored by:

Reps. Becca Balint of Vermont, André Carson of Indiana, Greg Casar of Texas, Maxine Dexter Oregon, Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida, Jesús G. “Chuy” García of Illinois, Al Green of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Henry “Hank” Johnson, Jr. of Georgia, Ro Khanna of California, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Delia C. Ramirez of Illinois, Lateefah Simon of California, Nydia Velázquez of New York, and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey. 


The resolution, if passed, would put on record that the U.S. House of Representatives believes that the Israeli government committed genocidal acts, but would also call on the government of the United States to take immediate, concrete actions to fulfill its binding legal obligations to the United Nations’ Genocide Convention. Effectively doing so could push the nation and its allies to prevent further atrocities and punish Israel for the crime of genocide.
That is a tall order for the Republican-controlled lower chamber of Congress, in which many of its rank and file members have issued unequivocal support for Israel.
Still, Tlaib remained undeterred and said that the genocide has not ended despite the promises of multiple cease fire deals over the last two years, and that the war and genocidal actions of Israel will not end until the U.S. acts accordingly.
“Since the so-called ‘ceasefire’ was announced, Israeli forces haven’t stopped killing Palestinians,” said Congresswoman Tlaib. “Impunity only enables more atrocity. As our government continues to send a blank check for war crimes and ethnic cleansing, Palestinian children’s smiles are extinguished by bombs and bullets that say ‘Made in the U.S.A’.”
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) joining the 2024 pro-Palestinian encampment at Wayne State University in Detroit. Screenshot from Tlaib’s Instagram account.
Tlaib said that to end this horror, “we must reject genocide denial and follow our binding legal obligations under the Genocide Convention to take immediate action to pursue justice and accountability to prevent and punish the crime of genocide.”
Michigan legislators push Congressional colleagues to end Israeli arms sales
In Lansing last week, Tlaib’s colleagues in the state Legislature also introduced a similar resolution, calling on Michigan’s congressional delegation to specifically block arms sales to Israel, immediately rush aid to Gaza and restore the revoked visas of Palestinians.
Michigan House Resolution 223 of 2025 faces a steep, near insurmountable climb to reach a vote on the Republican-controlled House floor. After being introduced on Nov. 13, the resolution was immediately scuttled to the House Government Operations Committee, the place in Lansing where bills and measures go to die.

Either way, the legislative Democrats behind the move – state Reps. Erin Byrnes of Dearborn, Alabas Farhat of Dearborn and Dylan Wegela of Garden City – said that for more than two years, the world has watched the horrors unfold in real time, which Byrnes called a “livestreamed genocide.”
“Even after repeated ceasefire deals, Israel continues their escalation of their campaign to eliminate the Palestinian people,” Byrnes added. “What makes that possible is American-supplied weapons.”
Farhat said that polling shows that most Americans want their government to stop fueling the suffering in Gaza and take actionable steps to end the war, steps that the U.S. government has been unable or unwilling to take.
“Polling has clearly shown that most Americans want our government to stop fueling the suffering in Gaza and to take real steps toward ending this war,” Farhat said. “For many families in my district, this is not abstract, people are losing loved ones in Gaza and in South Lebanon, and they’re watching it happen with their own taxpayer dollars. Imagine knowing that your hard earned money is being used to kill your relatives.”
Farhat said the new resolution reflects his community’s moral and democratic mandate to stop funding weapons that are killing civilians, adding that it rang true of all communities in Michigan, as well.
“Our communities want peace, accountability, and policy that values human life and this resolution moves us in that direction,” he said. 
Wegela said that instead of using taxpayer dollars to improve the lives of their constituents, the federal government was funding a genocide on the other part of the world.
“It is our moral obligation to oppose funding the mass murder of civilians,” Wegela said. “This resolution follows growing evidence collected by humanitarian groups, scholars, and international agencies that Israel’s blockade, bombing campaigns, and deliberate targeting of civilians meet the legal definition of genocide. It outlines that it is against U.S. law to supply weapons to Israel, and demands our so-called leaders in Washington assert their power to stop the killing.”
Michigan candidates moving closer to acknowledgement of Gaza genocide
Meanwhile, both McMorrow and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who is a candidate for governor in 2026, have both come out in support of labeling the actions of the Israeli government as a genocide.
Gilchrist made the pronouncement in Dearborn, the heart of the Arab community in Michigan, at a national conference for Muslim and Arab Americans.
Gilchrist calls Gaza, Palestine crisis a genocide at Arab convention, fundraising communications

McMorrow made her comments at a campaign stop on one of her town hall-style brewery tours, where she was confronted with a question on Gaza. McMorrow said, by its definition, that a genocide had unfolded against the Palestinians living in Isreal. She also said she would not be accepting money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States.
The state senator, however, tempered those comments with an acknowledgment of the disturbing loss of life on both sides of the conflict, including the inciting Oct. 7, 2023 inflection point when Hamas terrorists attacked multiple settlements in southern Israel, including a music festival, murdering more than 1,000 civilians and taking hundreds of hostages. Still she called for the war to end immediately.
McMorrow’s stance took some heat when it was reported that she had  privately produced an AIPAC position paper that at least one pro-Israel donor said was “outstanding,” a claim that she has denied.
The shift in McMorrow and Gilchrist joining the long-held positions of Tlaib and El-Sayed shows that more Democrats were waking up to the changing winds of opinion on the war, arming Israel and Palestinian self-determination.
McMorrow clarifies stance on Gaza, joins Michigan Democrats calling situation a genocide

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, who is also in the race, is notably a strong supporter of Israel and has taken approximately $5 million from AIPAC during the course of her career in politics.
At the event on Tuesday, as he answered the question from MSU students, El-Sayed said what made him different from McMorrow was the fact that he has long held the position, whereas McMorrow, he said, appeared to be shaky in her stance.
Following the event, El-Sayed told the Advance that he was happy to hear more people were joining him and Tlaib and that he supports her resolution. On McMorrow and other candidates arriving at the issue now, El-Sayed said Gaza has become a “moral Rorschach test on values.”
“I’d rather live in a world where this never happened, and I’m trying to build a world where this never happens again,” El-Sayed said. “I’ll be gratified if we can get there.”

The Act 73 redistricting task force recognizes that closing small schools and creating mega-school districts will not solve Vermont’s rising education costs.

She chairs the Westminster Town School District Board, the Windham Northeast Supervisory Union Board and the Steering Committee for the Rural School Community Alliance.


The Rural School Community Alliance commends the leadership and members of the Act 73 redistricting task force for their principled, evidence-driven approach to the work assigned by the Vermont Legislature. 
On Monday, November 10, the Task Force voted to send a proposal forward to the Legislature that calls for voluntary, cooperative agreements that create real cost savings, protect rural schools, maintain Vermont’s quality of life and preserve democracy at the community level.

Notably, the task force has committed to a democratic, community-driven approach to redistricting Vermont’s schools, one that trusts local decision-making at the community level rather than imposing top-down mandates. They took a strong stand against forced mergers of existing school districts and supervisory unions and an equally strong stand in support of protecting rural elementary schools and keeping them close to the children they serve. 
The task force also proposed a thoughtful, cost-effective framework for communities to explore larger regional and comprehensive high schools, paired where feasible with community and technical education centers. This approach is grounded in the evidence and will reduce costs while increasing opportunities for older students. Their recommendations reflect hours of deliberation, review of research and careful listening to the public. 
With more than 5,000 responses from Vermonters showing up and engaging through surveys, meetings and public comment, the overwhelming conclusion was clear: forced mergers will not reduce costs or property taxes and would have negative impacts on our communities and children. Vermonters want solutions that protect local schools and make education more affordable.
The task force listened. Their proposal affirms that communities, working collaboratively with local school boards, are best positioned to lower costs while maintaining the quality and character of Vermont’s public education system.
Task force members openly questioned the assumption that simply consolidating would save the state money – a concern strongly supported by the research. And much would be lost in the process.
The Rural School Community Alliance supports that view. In a July 2025 position statement sent to the task force, the RSCA stated, “there are no clear and consistent economic benefits from creating mega-districts that dissolve local ties.” Neither per-pupil spending data nor qualitative evidence shows that school closures or consolidations reduce costs.
When increased transportation costs, maintenance of empty buildings, costs for expanding infrastructure, and reduced property values are accounted for, the evidence is even clearer: consolidation does not deliver savings and therefore does not reduce property taxes. Voluntary collaboration, however, consistently does.  
After reviewing this and other evidence, the Task Force concluded that the most effective path for reducing costs now and in the future is the creation of cooperative educational services districts. This shared-services model, used successfully across the United States, especially in rural states, has already begun to show results in Vermont.
Seven supervisory unions and one large school district in southern Vermont have signed agreements to form such a system. As chair of the Windham Northeast Supervisory Union Board, one of the cooperating districts, I can report that we are already seeing savings that will ultimately help relieve pressure on local property tax rates. 
The Act 73 redistricting task force recognizes that closing small schools and creating mega-school districts will not solve Vermont’s rising education costs. Instead, they are poised to ask the legislature to support strategies that actually reduce spending, and therefore cut property taxes, without destroying the character and quality of Vermont’s entire education system in the process. 
On behalf of the members of the Rural School Community Alliance, representing more than 100 towns and villages, we urge the public to contact your senators and representatives and support the task force’s recommendation for voluntary, cooperative agreements that will deliver cost savings, protect rural schools, and preserve local control.
And while you are reaching out, please thank the task force members for their courage, clarity, and commitment to Vermont’s shared values.

Now he's asking a judge to decide.,"Carmella Bowers and her son Johnnie Boykins are fighting to exonerate Boyers' son Darren Boykins, who was convicted for the 1981 murder of Milton Laufer in Newark. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A retired attorney fighting to exonerate a Newark man imprisoned for 44 years for a 1981 murder he’s always claimed he did not commit has taken his fight to state court, accusing police, prosecutors, judges, and others of misconduct.
Authorities failed to divulge exculpatory evidence that could have cleared Darren Boykins from suspicion in the May 22, 1981, slaying of carpet salesman Milton Laufer and covered up or dismissed evidence that could have freed Boykins from jail in his post-conviction appeals and parole bids, attorney John Crayton argued in a petition filed in Essex County Superior Court last week. Crayton wants a judge to vacate the conviction.
Boykins, who was 19 at the time of his arrest, has always claimed he did not kill Laufer. He’s now 64 and incarcerated at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, where he is under psychiatric care.
He had an alibi the day of the murder, investigators never found a murder weapon, and two witnesses repeatedly could not identify him as the killer. But jurors convicted him largely on the word of a jailhouse informant, who later recanted, and a photo lineup 39 days after the homicide that Crayton contends was improper.
Crayton spent six months reinvestigating the case and sent a lengthy report last winter to various authorities laying out evidence he says shows Boykins was wrongly convicted. He has pushed unsuccessfully for Gov. Phil Murphy to grant Boykins clemency and the Essex County Prosecutor’s Conviction Integrity Unit to review his conviction.
“I still am hoping that someone will read what I’ve sent them before and look at what I just filed — and take a hard look at the case and come to the difficult but courageous decision that what happened to Darren 44 years ago was terribly wrong,” Crayton said.
Carmen Martin, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, declined to comment Tuesday.

Boykins has been eligible for parole since 2006 but twice has been denied release by a board critics have complained routinely rejects parole-eligible prisoners’ bids for freedom. He’ll be eligible again in March. Crayton has petitioned the court for limited guardianship so that he can argue before the state parole board for Boykins’ release.
He’s also working to line up a psychiatric placement in the community for Boykins, in hopes that he prevails in his fight. He regards Boykins’ continued incarceration as a failure of both the criminal justice system that condemned him to life behind bars as well as reformers whose inaction keeps him there despite proof of injustice.
“Why in the world is a soon-to-be 74-year-old, semi-retired attorney sitting in his garage office bringing forward a potential exoneration case in New Jersey?” Crayton said. “Somebody else ought to be doing that.”

Mike Braun speaks at a 25th anniversary celebration of the safe haven newborn surrender law at the Indiana Statehouse on Nov. 18, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hoosier leaders gathered Tuesday at the Statehouse to hail the 25th anniversary of a safe haven law that encourages parents to surrender infants rather than abandon them.
It “has protected the most vulnerable among us and given hope to others in crisis for a quarter of a century,” said Linda Znachko, founder of He Knows Your Name. The ministry buries “unclaimed” children — including aborted and miscarried infants — and adults.
The law was approved in 2000, after an infant was found dead outside a hospital emergency room.

Imagine “a mother gently laying her baby down, scared to go in the hospital,” Znachko said. She “left her baby, I’m sure, hoping that someone would find that child. And unfortunately, no one did until it was too late.”
The law allows the surrender of unharmed infants, without legal consequences, to emergency medical services providers like hospitals and volunteer fire departments. The handoffs can be in person, or through newborn safety devices better known as baby boxes.
Thirty-one have been surrendered in Indiana since 2017, a He Knows Your Name spokesperson said.
“These boxes are more than plastic and technology. They are mercy made tangible,” said Safe Haven Baby Box Founder Monica Kelsey.
Indiana went 11 years without finding lifeless, abandoned infants, according to Znachko.
“I actually thought that’s what we were going to be celebrating here today,” she said. But “everything changed” when a deceased newborn was discovered at an Indianapolis park in September.
“On this 25th anniversary celebration, I would like us all to recommit ourselves to … taking up this cause all over again,” Znachko said. “… We cannot allow women in crisis to remain under-resourced, under-educated in their most desperate hour.”
She welcomed Indiana’s top leaders to the stage, set up feet away from a pro-redistricting gathering.
“We are setting the trend in this nation, across the gamut, that we honor the sanctity of life,” Gov. Mike Braun said. “And I think you can count on all of us, as legislators and as your governor: we won’t let you down on that very important issue.”
He, like Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, took the opportunity to shore up his “pro-life” credentials. Both lauded the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of the right to an abortion in 2022, noting Indiana was the first state to respond with a near-total ban on abortions.
“This is a good law and a good tool to protect newborns and make sure women have a pro-life option available to them at all times,” said Bray, who leads the Senate’s GOP supermajority.

He said the state should educate Hoosiers about the law and add more surrender locations.
“We’re creating a culture in Indiana that puts innocent lives first,” said House Speaker Todd Huston, leader of that chamber’s Republican supermajority. “… Indiana has installed more baby boxes than any other state in the nation.”
Brandi Koie, one of the first to adopt a baby under the law, said it’s a “win for all of us.”
“When it’s properly utilized, birth mothers who aren’t yet ready or equipped to parent, they get second chances at life. That’s a win,” Koie said. “Babies who are born into a crisis situation, they’re saved … That’s a win. Waiting arms become filled at long last.”
She spoke directly to those birth mothers.
“I want to say: thank you. You are so brave. You are so loved. You are so appreciated,” Koie said. “I want you to know that my daughter has grown up knowing that her birth mother loved her first, and that she did so sacrificially.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)When Marco Azogue climbed the stairs onto a plane parked on the tarmac of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, shackled at the wrists and ankles, he assumed the plane was taking him to his home country of Ecuador. 
None of the agents or plane staff spoke Spanish. They didn’t answer him when he asked where they were going, or whether they would give him his belongings — his wallet and phone, which he hadn’t seen in days. 
“We had no idea where we were going — they didn’t give us an explanation for where they were taking us,” Azogue said in Spanish in an interview with the Reformer. 
The plane, it turned out, was headed for Louisiana. Agents loaded Azogue and other immigrants into a van, which drove for several hours into the countryside. Azojue would spend several days in an immigrant detention center in Little Pines, Louisiana, before being ushered onto another plane, this time bound for Ecuador.
Azogue was swept up in the mass deportation effort ushered in by the election of Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress, which has poured money into efforts to beef up the infrastructure needed to expel immigrants by the hundreds of thousands.

The activity is everywhere, if you know where to look: Minnesota will soon be home to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility at the St. Paul Downtown Airport, MPR reported recently. The Trump administration is considering reopening a closed private prison in Appleton as an immigrant detention center. The sheriff’s offices in eight Minnesota counties have agreed to assist ICE in deportation activities.
Travelers passing through MSP walk and drive by immigrants like Azogue weekly as aviation companies hired by the Department of Homeland Security carry out deportations from the state’s largest airport. Deportation flights were traceable for years using popular tracking websites, but the federal government has recently taken steps to obscure the flight information from the public. 
Most deportation flights are carried out by private charter planes, according to ProPublica. Flight attendants working them told ProPublica they were not allowed to speak to detainees or provide them with food or water. 
On the morning of Nov. 12, three unmarked white vans pulled into a back entrance to the airport. They drove across the tarmac, where a plane operated by Key Lime Air was waiting. 
The vans pulled into a semicircle surrounding the stairs leading to the plane door. Then agents patted down around 20 immigrants before they climbed one-by-one — slowly, shackled — up the steps and into the plane.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, which oversees MSP, said federal law prevents MSP from restricting access to public or private aircraft operators. 
“The Metropolitan Airports Commission does not coordinate or get any advance notification of general aviation or non-commercial flight operations at MSP Airport, which would include government owned or operated aircraft,” the spokesperson said.

Nick Benson, a photographer and longtime planespotter, has observed deportation flights since before President Donald Trump’s second term. But the frequency of deportation flights seems to be increasing, he said, and he’s concerned by efforts to obscure the movement of the flights from the public. 
Benson uses open source information to locate incoming and outgoing deportation flights, and shares his photos and observations online.
“I think it’s important for people in the Twin Cities to realize that all of this stuff isn’t just something that happens in Chicago or Portland or somewhere else — that it’s happening here too…. I think it’s historic, and it’s worth knowing and documenting that it happens,” Benson said. 
Judges have found that Trump’s immigration authorities have violated the due process rights of detainees. Civil rights lawyers charge that the administration has turned to formerly off-limits methods for arresting people: using tax data, targeting school grounds and churches and arresting people as they exit court appointments. 
Benson said he’s observed deportation flights out of MSP on planes owned by Key Lime Air, also known as Denver Air Connection; Eastern Air Express; and, up until a few months ago, GlobalX. The airlines use space and services from Signature Aviation, which runs a private aircraft terminal at MSP. None of the companies responded to Reformer requests for comment.
“The airline companies, they are not only complicit, but they are responsible. They are making an active choice to pick profits from the federal government over human lives,” said Drew Harmon, chair of Minnesota 50501, a progressive grassroots group organized in response to the second Trump term.

Azogue, one of the deportees who passed through MSP, was arrested at the federal courthouse at Fort Snelling after a hearing in his asylum case, he said.
He was under the impression that he would have a chance to appeal his case in a future hearing. He has no criminal record. When he exited the courtroom, agents arrested him. 
“We show up for court trustingly, thinking we’re doing everything right, but what we don’t know is that when we get there, it’s like a trick,” Azogue said in Spanish. 
He landed in Guayaquíl, Ecuador, hours from the mountain town where his family lives. When he landed, he had $40, no way to contact his family, and no access to the small savings he’d built while cleaning commercial buildings overnight in Minneapolis. He bought a bus ticket with the cash and borrowed a phone from the woman sitting next to him so he could let his family know he was on his way.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NN251112_0220-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 07:57:14.385249

In 2015, a trial court in Choctaw County sentenced Marcus Taylor to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to conspiring to sell opioid painkillers. But the plea petition was erroneous; it incorrectly cited the maximum sentence for conspiracy to sell schedule III controlled substances as being 20 years. In fact, the maximum sentence was only five years, and should have ended in 2020. 
At the time of his sentence, nobody in court, including Taylor’s then attorney, realized the error, which only came to light when Taylor claimed eligibility for parole in 2023. In May this year, five years after he ought to have been released, the Mississippi Court of Appeals acknowledged that he was serving a sentence 10 years longer than the maximum. But it refused to rectify the error because Taylor, now 43, had applied for post-conviction relief after the three-year deadline to file had already passed. 
Now, the Mississippi Court of Appeals has withdrawn its own opinion and ordered Taylor’s release. 
“When a trial court acts outside the scope of its authority, its actions are void,” the Tuesday order says. “As over a century of precedent firmly establishes, our Judiciary has the inherent power to correct this error.”
Joe Hemleben, Taylor’s attorney, said, “The court made the  right decision to correct, rather than condone this injustice.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10095411/RenderedImage.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 07:57:14.385249

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)During its last floor session of the year, the Wisconsin Senate passed bills Tuesday that would eliminate the annual $325 revenue increase for school districts, define abortion to not include treatment for ectopic pregnancies and other emergency medical conditions and block state and local dollars from being used on health care for people not legally in the country.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said she is “dismayed” and “disgusted” that lawmakers were not taking up bills that focused on affordability. She said she is open to working across the aisle on the issue.
“Republicans do not care about affordability, and they have no plan about affordability either,” Hesselbein said. “There are no bills on this calendar that will lower prescription drug costs, increase access to health care, lower housing costs or make child care more affordable.”
Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) noted a few of the more than 60 bills lawmakers were scheduled to take up and questioned whether they addressed pressing matters. 
“Republicans, who determine the issues and bills we focus on, today are addressing things like exempting tobacco bars from the public smoking ban, delaying the implementation of commercial building code rules,” Keyeski said. “While these may be worthy issues to discuss, I would suggest that it does not meet the threshold of emergent need when families are facing dire economic circumstances. GOP legislators are essentially forcing us to sit idly by and watch Wisconsinites suffer.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said at a press conference that Democratic lawmakers were just “filibustering” and rejected the claim that Republicans weren’t working to help with affordability in the state.
“We passed a budget which had the second largest tax cut in state history to get money back into people’s pockets for utility bills, for retirees on fixed incomes, for middle class tax cuts. We’re doing everything we can to try to keep things affordable, ending the 400-year veto so taxes don’t go up in the next budget process,” LeMahieu said. “We are very concerned. It seems like Democrats can make these statements, but yet they’re introducing bills that let local governments increase their levies to tax, raise property taxes, and everything else, so it seems a little disingenuous.”
Republicans advance bill to eliminate 400-year veto
The Senate voted to pass a bill that would reverse Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto that extended school revenue limit increases for 400 years. 
Lawmakers during the 2023-25 state budget gave school districts a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years. When the bill reached Evers’ desk, he exercised his partial veto power, striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425, to lawmakers’ dismay. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in April that the partial veto was within Evers’ powers.
In response, lawmakers introduced SB 389 to eliminate the $325 per pupil school revenue limit increase beginning in the 2027-28 school year. It passed along party lines. 
“We’re very concerned with the ruling of the state Supreme Court, but what we want to do is to clarify that the original intent of the Legislature in the budget was to increase school funding for the next budget period,” Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), a coauthor of the bill, said. “He changed the bill in a way that no governor in the history of the state of Wisconsin has changed [a bill], and that’s very concerning for us because the Legislature is where the voice of a people is supposed to take place, and the governor is supposed to look at that and use his veto authority to determine where he stands on that, but he went far beyond what’s ever been done before.”
Democratic lawmakers defended the revenue limit increases, saying it is helping school districts that have struggled without inflationary increases in state funding.
“As fists clench over the 400-year veto, know this, it doesn’t even make up for inflation. What it does is, it provides a minimum increase for what people can expect,” Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said. “Unfortunately, with this vote, it is trying to go back and trying to actually make a horrible budget even worse by saying not only are we giving you zero dollars in general aid increase…, but more than that, we’re also going to bar the local school district from making up for that gap by being able to allow them to vote for an increased property tax.”
Larson said that the law could have been changed during the 2025-27 state budget process and that it is the state’s fault that property taxes are bearing the brunt of the increases.
“Everybody who voted for the budget, in essence, voted for the continuation of the $325 dollars per pupil increase to be passed on to local taxpayers to make up the difference,” Larson said. “If you had wanted to change it, there were two things that you could have done. One, you could have voted to have that ended and substituted with a different per-pupil increase. Second thing is, you could have had the state actually fund those increases using funds from the increasing general aid or using the vast surplus that we have, taking money from the agriculture manufacturing tax credit [or] anywhere else, and you could have actually funded our kids.”
Redefining abortion
The Senate also passed SB 553, which seeks to redefine abortion to exempt treatments for certain medical conditions including the removal of a dead embryo or fetus, an ectopic, anembryonic or molar pregnancy.
Bill coauthor Sen. Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood) said during a press conference that he wanted to remove confusion from state statute, saying he is “pro-life” and hasn’t wanted to stop women from being able to receive the medical care that they need. 
“Women who need medical attention due to situations of stillbirths, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies or other related issues, can and should receive the care that they need. That has always been the pro-life position,” Quinn said. “This bill before us today does not ban abortions. It does not restrict abortions, it simply clarifies our laws so that both women and medical providers can do what is necessary in those situations.”
Wisconsin has a web of abortion restrictions in place, including a 20-week ban, but confusion soared in the state after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. An 1849 law interpreted as a near-total abortion ban led health care providers afraid of felony charges to deny care to women who faced miscarriage and life-threatening pregnancy complications.
Recently, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the state’s largest abortion provider, stopped providing abortion care in part due to federal changes.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said the lawmakers were trying to distance themselves from “the horrors that we are seeing in states that have banned and restricted abortion.” The Assembly coauthor, Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) said in September that she introduced it in part because Republicans are getting “killed” on the abortion issue during elections, although she said she favors a total abortion ban.
“Women being turned away from hospital emergency rooms repeatedly, being left to bleed out in Walmart parking lots. In fact, women are dying because they are denied timely abortion care that could easily have saved their lives, and their children left orphaned,” Roys said. “That’s the reality of what it looks like when you ban and restrict access to abortion in this country.”
Recent polling done by Marquette Law School found that abortion policy has declined as a “most important” issue among voters across all partisan groups in 2025 as compared to 2022, although 50% of respondents still said they were “very concerned” and 23% said they were “somewhat concerned” about the issue. 
Another recent poll found that 78% of voters support protecting health care professionals from criminal charges related to providing abortion care and 72% of voters favor allowing advanced health care providers like nurse practitioners and midwives to provide abortion care.

Roys said she was also concerned that the bill could push physicians to do emergency C-sections rather than terminate pregnancies as a way of addressing health issues. 
“Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that sometimes pregnant people need to save their lives, to preserve their health, to preserve their future fertility, and nothing in this bill is going to change that,” Roys said. “This bill will instead push physicians to force women to have unnecessary C-sections or to induce delivery rather than providing them with abortion. A C-section is much more dangerous. It is much more invasive. It’s major abdominal surgery that takes weeks or months to recover from, and it also impairs a woman’s future ability to be pregnant to have the labor and delivery that she wishes.”
The bill will now go to the Assembly for consideration. 
Restricting health care for immigrants
The Senate concurred 21-12 in AB 308, which would prohibit state, county, village, long-term care district and federal funds from being used to subsidize, reimburse or provide compensation for any health care services for a person not lawfully in the United States. Sens. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi), Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) and Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) joined Republicans in favor. 
Bill coauthor Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said the bill would ensure that Wisconsin doesn’t begin spending large amounts of money on people who aren’t legally in the country. He noted that other states, including Minnesota and California, have rescinded or paused providing coverage for people not legally in the U.S. 
“[Illinois] did an audit and found that they had spent nearly $900 million on health care benefits for illegal aliens, about a 200% increase, and then in Minnesota, the Legislature, by bipartisan vote, they voted to end the eligibility for illegal immigrants due to questions about their state’s financial well-being, and then, lastly, wonderful, California. Gov. [Gavin] Newsom recently froze enrollment of illegal immigrants into the state’s medical programs, citing California’s $12 billion budget deficit,” Wanggaard said at a press conference. “We’re looking at something that is really a no-brainer.”
Wisconsin already doesn’t allow immigrants without legal authorization to apply for the state’s Medicaid program, BadgerCare.
There are two programs available to those without legal status outlined on the Department of Health Services website: Medicaid Emergency Services, which provides short-term medical coverage for people who have a medical emergency and aren’t eligible for BadgerCare Plus or Wisconsin Medicaid, and BadgerCare Plus Prenatal Plan, which provides health care coverage for pregnant mothers who are not eligible for BadgerCare Plus due to immigration status or being in prison or jail.
Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of seeking to make a political point and neglecting to address health care costs and accessibility.
“We are not in an affordability crisis because of less than 1% of BadgerCare funds that are used to save lives,” Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) said. “This is cruel, it is a mean-spirited bill that is attempting to score cheap political points off of a group that’s already marginalized enough.” 
Advocates have warned that the bill could have a “chilling effect,” discouraging people from seeking care when they need it.
“Why is this sort of thing even coming up for discussion? Are we that heartless? Have we really lost our vision for this country?” Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) asked. “These are all messaging to somebody’s base. Terrible people who are coming here to work in our factories, in our fields without the proper papers need to be punished… How heartless are we to make political points? Go ahead and make your god dang political points.”
The Assembly passed the bill in September, so it will now go to Evers for consideration. 
Other bills passed by the Senate Tuesday include:  

AB 165, which would ban local governments from using tax money to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement. The Assembly passed the bill along party lines in April and the Senate concurred in it 18-15 so it will now go to Evers for consideration. 
AB 265, which would require judges to sentence people convicted of human trafficking to at least 10 years in prison, or at least 15 years for trafficking a child, was concurred in in an 18-15 party line vote. Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns about young victims of sex trafficking potentially facing mandatory minimums if they are forced to participate in trafficking, while Republicans brushed away those concerns. 
SB 498 passed 17-16 with Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) joining Democrats against it. The bill would place specific freedom of speech requirements into state statute, including barring campuses from restricting speakers on campus, and implement new penalties, including a tuition freeze, if a campus violates any parts of the bill.
SB 394 would make it a Class I felony to damage or graffiti structures, plaques, statues, paintings or other monuments on public property or that is maintained by the state or any county or municipality. It passed 18-15 along party lines.
SB 11, which would require school districts to provide an opportunity for certain federally chartered youth membership organizations, including the Girl Scouts, to give students information about their organizations. It passed by a voice vote. The Assembly is scheduled to vote on the bill on Wednesday.
SB 16, which would make the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association subject to open records and open meeting laws, passed 22-11.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Tuesday — and the wee hours of Wednesday — brought a plot twist to the Nevada State Legislature and Gov. Joe Lombardo’s sweeping crime bill, with the introduction of an amendment adding provisions that would protect students from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a brand new bill whose language mirrors two key components of the crime bill.
In a late-night meeting, lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 9, which contains the crime bill’s “opt out” resorts corridor language and provisions that would make punishments stricter for people who attack hotel workers.
The Senate also passed Assembly Bill 4, known as the governor’s crime bill, but with an amendment. The amendment would require detention centers to maintain real-time, publicly available lists of all the people they are detaining. The amendment would also prohibit school districts from allowing access to law enforcement — like ICE — from accessing school grounds or records without a lawful order or warrant.
AB4 passed 16-2 with bipartisan support. Democratic state Sens. Dina Neal and James Ohrenshall cast the two votes against. Republican state Sens. Robin Titus, Jeff Stone and John Ellison were not present at the meeting.
The bill now heads to the Assembly, which will have to vote on adopting the amendment.
The curious case of the immigration resolution that immigrant advocates don’t want

The amended bill reflects some of the asks of immigration advocates and the Latino Legislative Caucus, who have publicly criticized the Republican governor and Democratic legislative leadership for not taking action on immigration.
Together, the introduction of the immigration-focused amendment, paired with a stripped-down parallel crime bill, set up a scenario where the Republican governor might veto his own marquee crime bill and instead pass a less comprehensive bill that would still get across the finish line priorities for the resort industry and Culinary union.
What’s in the crime bill
The amended crime bill covers several areas of criminal law — from increasing penalties for DUI-related offenses to expanding the definition of stalking to banning criminal offenders from the resort corridor — and more. 
During the regular session earlier this year both the Assembly and Senate passed different versions of the bill. The Senate was forced to adjourn before they were able to vote on adopting the Assembly’s amendment.
The bill has received criticism from civil liberty groups who say it is an attempt to rollback modest criminal justice reforms passed by lawmakers in 2019.
Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks, who helped present the bill to lawmakers, called the bill “common sense criminal justice reform” and said it would not roll back those 2019 provisions, which were aimed at reducing Nevada’s growing prison population and recidivism rates.
“We are not talking about a rollback of AB236,” Hicks told lawmakers during an Assembly committee hearing, referring to the 2019 measure. “Nothing in this proposed bill rolls back AB236. What we are talking about is what will help all Nevadans.” 
The legislation attracted a slew of testimony opposing key provision in the bill, with some provisions drawing more ire than others.

One of the more controversial provisions would allow courts to ban certain criminal offenders from the resort corridor for up to a year. The bill includes language giving the Justice Court the authority to reestablish a Resort Corridor Court – a short-lived specialty court created to deal with low-level crimes on the Strip that was disbanded amid questions about its legality.
The bill, however, had the backing of the politically-hefty gaming industry and was co-presented by the Nevada Resort Association. Several gaming companies spoke in support of the crime bill, including Red Rock Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, Boyd Gaming Corporation, MGM Resorts International, and Wynn Resorts.
Provisions in the crime bill mirror the functions of the Resort Corridor Court, which gaming industry leaders argued was effective at deterring low-level crimes on the Strip, often by barring offenders from entering the tourist district for months at a time. 
The bill would require Nevada’s two most populous countries — Clark and Washoe County — to adopt ordinances creating one or more high-traffic corridors where harsher penalties could be imposed because of  higher risk to public safety.
“Recidivism continues to be a significant issue in our tourism areas,” Virginia Valentine, the president and CEO of the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers during an Assembly committee hearing. “During the resort court operation, resort security reported a decrease in crime.”
Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, argued the bill would privatize part of the judicial system for the purpose of banning homeless people from the resort corridor. 
“This was a court used to target the unhoused. If it was only about gaming properties, it would have been limited to what occurs inside of the casinos, but it’s not. It was used to target people on the street beyond this,” Haseebullah said during an Assembly hearing. 
One portion of the crime bill expands the definition of stalking to include dating relationships and cyberstalking via social media.
Marc Randazza, one of the top First Amendment lawyers in the state, said those provisions are well-intended but “wildly unconstitutional.”  
“I would be happy to work with you on a solution, but this legislation is wildly unconstitutional, please do not sign it. I will be challenging it if you do,” Randazza said Tuesday in a social media post tagging Lombardo.
The bill would list defamation, threats, and inciting violence on social media as unprotected by the First Amendment and punishable under the bill. It would also define continued social media communication towards someone without their consent within those categories as unlawful.
During committee hearings in the Assembly, the Clark County Public Defender’s Office also raised concerns that language around social media in the bill was “overly broad.”
Don Southworth, the offender management administrator for NDOC, said a community transition program included in the bill could potentially reduce the overall population in custody, offsetting some costs.
“We do expect a population reduction of as many as 500 offenders that would be eliminated from our in-house custody,” Southworth told lawmakers during an Assembly hearing. 
The alternative correctional program established in the crime bill would focus on offenders within 18 months of discharge, who are non-violent offenders that fit specific criteria, said NDOC Director James Dzurenda. The program would include home visits, release plans, and monitoring through a contract with a company, including video visiting and drug testing.
Several other measures were included in the crime bill. The bill adds kidnapping and attempted kidnapping to the list of felony domestic violence offenses. Under the bill, child pornography possession would be charged per image. The bill eliminates automatic sealing of records for offenses against children or the elderly. It also increases penalties for DUI-related offenses and establishes an alternative correctional program.
Other provisions in the bill include defining “smash and grab theft” as a felony if property damage and theft value exceeds $750. The bill would also require a mental health evaluation for children who have committed multiple attacks on school employees or child welfare professionals before they can return to school. 
Other crime and safety bills
Assembly Bill 6 would enhance penalties for certain traffic violations in active school zones and school crossing zones. It would also give school districts the ability to extend the time for school zone enforcement. The bill comes amid a sharp increase in the number of students hit by vehicles in school zones this year. The Senate unanimously passed AB4 on Tuesday. The bill heads back to the Assembly, which will need to approve an amendment made by the Senate. After that, it will head to the governor’s desk.
Assembly Bill 1 would bolster cybersecurity initiatives in the wake of a major cyberattack that paralyzed multiple state offices and services for weeks. AB1 has been delivered to the governor for final approval.
Assembly Bill 3 would boost privacy protections for public officers who wish to keep personal information confidential.  The Nevada Press Association opposed the bill arguing it goes far beyond existing exemptions and would error transparency. AB3 has been delivered to the governor for final approval.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/metro-cops-cars-e1763551217559-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-11-19 06:56:28.528288

Micah Beckwith and Secretary of State Diego Morales give remarks during a pro-redistricting rally on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025, at the Indiana Statehouse. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A few dozen Hoosiers gathered under the Indiana Statehouse rotunda Tuesday morning to call on lawmakers to approve new congressional district maps that could give Republicans a 9-0 advantage in the U.S. House delegation.
The event coincided with Organization Day, the ceremonial start of the 2026 legislative session, when lawmakers return to Indianapolis to set priorities for the months ahead.
Many attendees wore stickers and held signs reading “9-0” and “Let’s get this done!” Organizers also asked participants to fill out postcards urging their state senators to “PLEASE SUPPORT REDISTRICTING.”
The calls are part of a national movement among Republican activists and political leaders to demand that Indiana’s GOP-controlled General Assembly redraw the state’s congressional map so that all nine districts are represented by Republicans, instead of the current 7-2 split.
Supporters argue that Democrat-led states have drawn maps favorable to their own party and that Indiana should respond in kind. 
But key Statehouse Republicans have rebutted. 
Senate GOP leadership announced last week that the caucus lacks the necessary votes to pass redistricting legislation and — despite an official special session order from the governor — will not convene in December to consider new maps.
The Senate chamber additionally voted on Tuesday to adjourn until Jan. 5 —  further refusing redistricting efforts.
Beckwith, Morales drop in
Gov. Mike Braun, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray and House Speaker Todd Huston were just steps away at a separate Statehouse event on Tuesday. None appeared at the pro-redistricting gathering.
But Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith and Secretary of State Diego Morales both made remarks, prompting short bursts of “9-0” chants from the crowd.

“Redistricting is not a political stunt,” Beckwith said. “This is the most bipartisan issue on the face of the earth when you have Akeem Jeffries, (U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), Gavin Newsom, Donald Trump, Mike Braun, Micah Beckwith and Diego Morales all saying the same thing. This is the most bipartisan issue in America right now.”
“We are standing up for a fair voice in Washington, D.C., and so we want the fair maps,” he continued. “We want the maps to be redrawn because places like Illinois, California and New England states are stealing our voice in D.C. Redistricting is the right thing to do. We should stand with the president, stand with the governor, and I’m proud to do so.”
Shortly after, Morales addressed the crowd, too, calling redistricting an urgent priority.
“Republicans need to start acting like Republicans,” Morales said. “We didn’t start this fight, but if we don’t stand up now, we risk letting Washington drown Indiana’s voice.”
The secretary of state emphasized that Indiana “needs a nine-zero, America first delegation representing us in Congress.” 
“Zero hesitation, zero backing down — because the stakes are too high,” Morales said. “Show up. Stand up for fair maps. Stand up for President Trump and our Hoosier State.”
‘We deserve to know where everyone stands’
John and LeAnne Kendall of Hancock County said they attended the rally because they believe the issue affects both state and national representation. Their state senator, Mike Crider, has not publicly stated where he stands on redistricting, but he was among the senators who voted Tuesday to adjourn until January.
“This is one of the most critical issues in our country right now, and we have a great opportunity in Indiana to make a difference — an impact in Congress — that will make sure everyone from this state is represented as they should be,” John said. “Indiana is an overwhelmingly Republican state.”
LeAnne added that “states have been badly gerrymandered by Democrats for too long,” and said state senators “need to get their act together” and “answer the call.”
“They need to show up, and they need to vote,” she continued. “I think the votes are there. … And there would be a lot more ‘yeses’ if they had to vote live, in front of all of us. We deserve to know where everyone stands, because this is what Hoosiers want.”
Three statewide polls have found Hoosiers against redistricting. 
Still, John pointed to Indiana’s most recent election results from November 2024, which he said was evidence that “a majority” of Hoosiers want “solid Republican representation” at both the state and federal levels.
“We can’t afford to have uncommitted, RINOs in office,” John said, referring to an acronym that most commonly means “Republican in name only.”
“Republicans (in Indiana) deserve and demand a 9-0 map,” he continued. “It’s anti-Republican and anti-American, in my view, for the people we put into office — in the Statehouse — to deny us that.”

,WyoFile,2025-11-19 11:30:00+00:00,WyoFile,"Politics, press and philanthropy: How a Jackson Hole billionaire couple is shaping Wyoming","By Andrew Graham,WyoFile; Sophia Boyd-Fliegel, KHOL 89.1 FM; Jasmine Hall, Jackson Hole News&Guide",,,,,https://wyofile.com/politics-press-and-philanthropy-how-a-jackson-hole-billionaire-couple-is-shaping-wyoming/,"

In the eight years since B. Wayne Jr. and Molly Hughes moved to Jackson, the billionaire couple has quickly made a mark on Wyoming. Whether Wyomingites know the Hugheses’ names or not, they've likely been impacted by the couple’s philanthropy, political donations or ownership of the Cowboy State Daily.
The post Politics, press and philanthropy: How a Jacks[...]","At the entrance to the Old Bill’s award party last month — Jackson Hole’s signature charity celebration — people rushing into a music- and balloon-filled arts center stopped to talk about B. Wayne Jr. and Molly Hughes. A few newcomers to town said they’d never heard of them, but most people on their way to pick up checks raved about the billionaire couple. 
One woman told a reporter how much money they’ve given to youth services. Another fondly recalled them as the family who made a Jackson farmstand affordable. 
“Are there people who haven’t heard of them?” one attendee said in passing.
Yet, outside Teton County, Wyomingites may not know much about the transplants who moved to Jackson Hole eight years ago from California. That appears fine with the couple, who tend to avoid the spotlight. The Hugheses, who have stated a desire to let their work speak for itself, declined to be interviewed for this story. 
Regardless of whether Wyomingites immediately recognize the Hugheses’ name, they are nevertheless likely to feel their increasing influence on the state’s civic life. If an Equality State resident receives services from a food bank, has a loved one getting charitable treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, tunes into Wyoming PBS or reads the digital news outlet Cowboy State Daily, there’s a good chance they’re touched by the couple’s largesse.  
Hughes Jr. has owned Cowboy State Daily, which describes itself as the state’s most read news organization, since 2022. The Hughes Charitable Foundation has distributed or pledged about $75 million to a wide variety of Wyoming nonprofits since entering the state in 2017.
In the political arena, Hughes Jr. has donated more than $637,000 to Wyoming statehouse candidates and political action committees — a substantive sum for Wyoming, where legislative campaigns are increasingly expensive, but remain low-budget affairs compared to other states. 
To be sure, there are other wealthy Equality State families known for their giving with names such as Friess, Kemmerer, Ellbogan, Storer and McMurry. But the details of the Hugheses’ charitable and political contributions, coupled with Hughes Jr.’s ownership of one of the state’s most visible media ventures, outline a remarkable impact on Wyoming from a single family.

Worth approximately $2 billion by press time Tuesday, according to Forbes, Hughes Jr. and his wife have donated to organizations that help children and the elderly, combat poverty and domestic violence, counter addiction and ease Jackson Hole’s affordable housing crisis. Their checks can change the trajectory of cash-strapped Wyoming nonprofits, people in that world say.
The Hugheses’ investments in Wyoming come at a time when elected officials in both Cheyenne and Washington, D.C., are paring back government services and shrinking tax revenues that fund public schools, public health programs and public amenities. In Wyoming, where charitable dollars are often hard to find outside of Jackson Hole, philanthropists like the Hugheses are increasingly essential to the state’s social safety net. 
Hughes Jr. has also financially supported President Donald Trump — to the tune of at least $2 million for his two inaugurations, according to federal campaign finance filings — and congressional Republicans in Washington, who have cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations while downsizing public services. 
It’s unclear which parts of the president’s agenda Hughes Jr. specifically supports. But it is clear he believes the wealthy should do more through philanthropy to raise up the places where they live. 
In a 2021 op-ed in Cowboy State Daily, the publication he would later buy, Hughes Jr. called on other wealthy people moving to Jackson Hole to treat Teton County as more than just a picturesque tax shelter.
“Teton County is not for everyone,” he wrote, “but for those of us who call it home it’s time to start caring, time to start speaking out, and it’s time to start giving. Many of us have seen the problem and it is us.”
Hughes Jr. did not shy away from acknowledging his own good fortune. 
“And to those that say ‘the problem cannot be solved so why try?’ — they need to look into their hearts and realize that ‘There, but for the grace of God, go I,’” he wrote. 
Quiet benefactors
B. Wayne Hughes Jr., who is in his mid-60s, shares the name of his father, Bradley Wayne Hughes, who died in August 2021. The senior Hughes was a self-made man, the son of a sharecropper who moved from Oklahoma to Southern California’s San Gabriel Valley during the Dust Bowl, according to news reports and obituaries at the time of his death. 
Hughes Sr. worked in several industries but made his fortune after founding Public Storage in the 1970s. The self-storage company — recognizable by its bright orange logo — was revolutionary, and Hughes Sr. “built a fortune storing Americans’ excess stuff,” as Forbes put it. 
To the extent that Hughes Jr. avoids the limelight connected to his philanthropy, it’s a habit he may have learned from the family’s patriarch. In 2019, the Los Angeles Times identified Hughes Sr. as the anonymous donor behind nearly $400 million in giving to his alma mater, the University of Southern California. Most people who donate to universities at that scale have buildings named after them. Not Hughes Sr. 


Editor’s note: 
While reporting this story, reporters first reached out to Molly Hughes, who declined several times to be interviewed. After reporters sent a written interview request to the couple, they received a response in the form of a cautioning letter from former Wyoming governor and attorney Mike Sullivan.
The former Democratic governor referenced the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and said the Hugheses had concerns that too much attention on their personal lives could expose them to risk. 
“The confluence of events and timing of your profile places a particular burden on you as responsible journalists not to put any members of the Hughes family at risk of danger or harm by reason of their political beliefs, which are admittedly conservative, or by their generosity of spirit,” Sullivan wrote. The Hugheses asked WyoFile, KHOL and the News&Guide to refrain from sharing certain personal details, which the reporters had already planned to avoid. 
Hughes Jr. also declined an interview, saying an interview with a Hughes Charitable Foundation board member should suffice. 
“From my perspective you’ve got enough information. I’m going to pass,” he wrote in an email. 


In a 2014 Forbes article, Hughes Jr. told a reporter he became more serious about philanthropy in the late 2000s and early 2010s after finding his Christian faith in his late 30s and becoming jaded after a stint of seeking change through Washington politics. 
An avid cowboy and outdoorsman, he at the time hosted struggling veterans at his California ranch, helping them confront their problems in a luxurious outdoor setting. He joined liberal billionaires like George Soros in backing, both through significant donations and personal advocacy in Sacramento, a successful 2014 state ballot measure to reduce prison sentences for minor crimes and drug offenses, Proposition 47. 
In 2024, California voters reversed that law amid growing crime and public safety concerns. Hughes Jr. donated $1.27 million to back the ballot measure in 2014, but does not appear to have financially supported the more recent campaign to defend the measure, per California Secretary of State campaign finance records.
The Hugheses also have a home in Hawaii, where Hughes Jr. started a media organization, Aloha State Daily, inspired by Cowboy State Daily. He is reportedly a skilled and passionate surfer.

Hughes Jr. has described his philanthropic giving as focused on people in the “impact zone.” In surfing, that’s a dreaded place to be — trapped where the waves are breaking, unable to reach safety farther out to sea, or to make it back to shore. In the impact zone, wave after wave breaks overhead as a surfer battles for survival. It’s disorienting and dangerous. Hughes Jr. compares that battle with the ocean to the struggles of people trapped in a cycle of addiction and poverty.
“Our philanthropy is focused on supporting the poor, hungry, oppressed, imprisoned, housing insecure, veterans, women and children, and Indigenous communities,” the Hughes Charitable Foundation website states. 
Molly Hughes, a professional fundraiser for over 30 years, has spoken less publicly. She is also known to be deeply guided by her religious faith. People who have worked with her describe her as the brains behind the foundation’s operations, thoughtful and dedicated. Sources said that Molly, the foundation’s executive director since 2018, avoids the limelight but is committed to the belief that the nation’s donor class should give away more to those in need.
Indeed, even in a place as thick with billionaires as Teton County, the Hugheses’ giving stands out. 
Unique and diverse giving strategy
In 2021, far from the Tetons and Jackson Hole’s luxury homes, Ryan Anderson found himself staring at double-digit inflation and a budget that didn’t balance. The leader of Gillette’s Youth Emergency Services House needed about $1 million — roughly 18% of his budget at the time — to retain staff specially trained to provide court-ordered residential care to youth. 
Because the YES House offers, in part, court-mandated care, Anderson’s budget comes largely from federal and state agencies and grants. Not only were reimbursement rates flagging, he said, but many government grants are restricted in ways that make it difficult to pay for basic organizational needs. 


In stepped the Hughes Charitable Foundation. 
After just a few months of discussion, Anderson secured a $1 million grant from the foundation to give staff a pay raise with retention incentives. His employees could continue their work providing housing, outpatient treatment and therapeutic services to Campbell County’s most vulnerable young people. 
“It was incredibly valuable to us in a time when we really needed it,” Anderson said.
Beginning in 2017, when the Hughes Charitable Foundation entered Wyoming, it has distributed or pledged an estimated $75 million to more than 300 Wyoming nonprofits, according to public filings and interviews. The foundation did not respond to requests for an exact number. 
Its annual giving has grown rapidly in recent years. From 2017 to 2021, the foundation donated about $4 million in total, according to public records. In contrast, in the past four years, it has donated about $12 million a year.
(While never a direct recipient of a Hughes Charitable Foundation grant, WyoFile has benefited financially from the foundation’s support of WyoGives Day, a program of the Wyoming Nonprofit Network. Specifically, WyoFile has received a little over $66,000 in WyoGives matching and incentive-pool funds since 2021. Like all Teton County nonprofits, KHOL does not qualify for the match and has not received a foundation grant.)
There are a handful of foundations that operate around the state, and very few of them are generalists and give statewide likes the Hugheses’ foundation does, said Samin Dadelahi, president and CEO of the Wyoming Community Foundation. A veteran of the state’s philanthropy scene, Dadelahi considers her organization and two others, the John P. Ellbogen Foundation and Newell B. Sargent Foundation, the only grant-making nonprofits with as broad and deep a reach in Wyoming as the Hughes Charitable Foundation. That’s because many of Wyoming’s other prominent family foundations either restrict the use of their donations more tightly — focusing on specific geographic regions or causes — or give broadly outside the state. The Hughes Charitable Foundation does give elsewhere, but is focused on Wyoming.
“They have a really traditional lens when it comes to charity, in that they are focusing on those bottom-line safety net services.” Samin Dadelahi, president and CEO of the Wyoming Community Foundation
Direct comparisons between private foundations can be challenging to make, but Dadelahi estimated that the foundation’s giving since 2021 has amounted to 10% of all institutional philanthropy statewide each year. 
“In some ways, they have a really traditional lens when it comes to charity, in that they are focusing on those bottom-line safety net services like food, like housing, youth homes, mental health and wellness,” Dadelahi said. 
The Hughes Charitable Foundation’s board is staffed by Wyoming luminaries, including Marilyn Kite, a retired Wyoming Supreme Court justice, the first female on the state’s high-court bench and first to serve as chief justice. Rather than trying to shape Wyoming according to its vision, the foundation is “focused on where the human needs are, and so that’s why it looks so broad,” Kite said. 
By dollar figure, the foundation’s top areas of giving are affordable housing, Indigenous affairs and youth services. 
In Teton County alone, the foundation has donated or pledged more than $25 million to housing, which town and county leaders cite as the most critical need in one of the nation’s tightest housing markets. Bolstering first lady of Wyoming Jennie Gordon’s hunger initiative, the Hugheses have helped support the state’s food insecurity efforts. 
“The [hunger] needs are so significant in virtually every county in this state,” Kite said.

The Hughes Charitable Foundation — and Wyoming’s philanthropic sector in general — still doesn’t match the state government’s spending and reach on public services, nonprofit experts note. But the foundation stands out through giving that carries a certain “democratic” flair, said Gabel Taggart, an assistant professor at the University of Wyoming who studies nonprofits and giving motivations and serves on the board of the Wyoming Nonprofit Network.
In 2021, the Hugheses’ foundation gave $1 million to the Wyoming Nonprofit Network to establish an innovative match program for established nonprofits as part of the WyoGives fundraising drive, which already existed. Each year since, WyoGives has distributed $1 million from the foundation as part of that match program. 
The Hugheses’ WyoGives incentive excludes nonprofits in Teton County’s already robust philanthropic scene. This was intended to target areas that Wyoming Nonprofit Network Director Jody Shields calls “philanthropy deserts.” If a county’s poverty rate is relatively high, the foundation offers nonprofits there a larger match. 
A new media mogul
A wealthy, religious and politically conservative Jacksonite donated the money to start Cowboy State Daily, an online-only Wyoming media outlet, but his last name wasn’t Hughes. 
Coming off his unsuccessful 2018 run for governor, the financier and conservative megadonor Foster Friess provided seed money for the fledgling nonprofit newsroom, according to past reporting and the news organization’s founding members. 
The new organization was helmed by two people: media veteran Jimmy Orr, who served as an internet strategist for President George W. Bush and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and as a digital editor at the Los Angeles Times; and Anneliese Wiederspahn, the daughter of U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis.
Bill Sniffin, a longtime Wyoming journalist and publisher from Lander who had worked for Friess on his gubernatorial campaign, joined Cowboy State in January 2020.

By then, Sniffin told a reporter for this story, Friess’ startup money had dwindled, and the financier had indicated he would not provide more. 
Cowboy State Daily occasionally found other donors, Sniffin recalled, and another lifeline came through a $150,000 grant in federal COVID-19 funds administered by the Wyoming Business Council. 
By the end of 2021, Cowboy State Daily “was hanging on for dear life,” Orr said in an October interview. The outlet “didn’t have much time left at all,” he said. 
Two years later, Cowboy State Daily was rapidly acquiring the broadest reach of any news organization in Wyoming, according to Orr. Its roster of staff reporters was growing, and it had become prolific in the Wyoming digital news landscape and even the state’s physical landscape. New billboards along Interstate 80 pitched Cowboy State Daily as a media outlet for those who “drink upstream from the herd.” 
Cowboy State Daily was no longer in financial trouble. It was also no longer a nonprofit. 
The difference was Hughes Jr. 
In 2021, the Hughes Charitable Foundation donated $50,000 to Cowboy State Daily, according to tax records compiled for WyoFile by the Sunlight Research Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization. Sniffin had reached out to Hughes Jr. while “desperate for donations,” he said. 
The donation was listed in the foundation’s tax filing as “contingent on the completion of two strategy discussions” with the outlet’s senior staff.
Orr, the editor, and Hughes Jr., the billionaire, connected over the media outlet’s newsletter, which Hughes Jr. subscribed to and enjoyed, Orr said. And Orr, whose career in national media largely focused on developing the digital side of publications like the Los Angeles Times, said Hughes Jr. was impressed by his grasp of metrics and readers’ online behavior.
In February 2022, Cowboy State Daily announced its new proprietor. 
“A Wyoming businessman and philanthropist has purchased the assets of Cowboy State Daily,” read the subtitle of a Feb. 11, 2022 article written by Orr.
The story did not share the details of the outlet’s transition, in which the nonprofit was disbanded and a new LLC was formed with Hughes Jr. as owner. Nor did it note Hughes Jr.’s reputation as a “conservative mega-donor,” as the Los Angeles Times described him in 2016.
Hughes Jr.’s motivation in buying the outlet, as opposed to funding it as a nonprofit, isn’t clear. Orr framed the switch from nonprofit to business as the billionaire philanthropist’s decision.
“He’s a very successful businessman, and so he structured it the way that he did,” Orr said.

The newsletter today has more than 100,000 subscribers, according to Orr, and is paired with an online video broadcast and radio show that is syndicated by some stations around the state.
“Wayne Hughes invested in people, invested in resources,” Orr said.
Nationally, it’s not unusual for wealthy individuals to purchase media organizations, which are often in financial distress and relatively cheap acquisitions. Buyers’ motivations vary, said David Coppini, an associate professor in the University of Denver’s journalism program.
“It could be a prestige thing, it could be something that adds to their political clout if they have political aspirations. They could have other financial interests it’s connected to,” Coppini said, and “there could also be the possibility that the person is really interested in journalism.” 
A wealthy person’s ownership raises the question of whether they seek to control the news, Coppini said, a charge Hughes Jr. has faced, particularly from far-right figures in Wyoming politics. It’s up to the news outlets to dispel that notion for readers, Coppini said. 
Hughes Jr. has not involved himself in newsroom decision-making, according to Orr and Sniffin. Other former employees of Cowboy State Daily supported that account.
“He lets us run it,” Orr said. “He’s hands off.” 
Nationally, news organizations purchased by the ultra wealthy have seen initial increases in newsroom resources. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, bought the Washington Post and billionaire doctor Patrick Shoon-Shiong acquired the Los Angeles Times. With time, both newspapers saw layoffs, and in the case of the Washington Post, meddling in editorial direction that some staff journalists found deeply unsettling. 
Orr declined to discuss the financial specifics of Hughes Jr.’s investment in Cowboy State Daily, but said the organization had received “a pretty good runway” while it grows its advertising business. Hughes Jr. wants to see the company eventually pay for itself. 
Speaking on a panel at the 2024 Wyoming Governor’s Business Forum, Orr said Hughes Jr. had given Cowboy State Daily “a mandate to be self-sustaining.” 
Orr is optimistic that it can be, he said. 
“It’s like anything, you find your footing, and you get better,” he said. Describing the business’s growth, he said that “sometimes you overreach, then you have to dial it back.”
So far, the Hugheses’ investment in Wyoming journalism, if anything, has only broadened. In August, Wyoming PBS announced that the Hughes Foundation had awarded it a $500,000 grant to help fill a hole left by Trump administration funding cuts.
The donation came roughly a month after Wyoming PBS CEO Joanna Kail penned a column for Cowboy State Daily, in which she laid some of the blame for Trump and congressional Republicans’ cuts to public media at the foot of the organization itself. 
“PBS’s unwillingness to confront growing concerns about ideological bias created a perception that it no longer served the public equally,” she wrote. 
Cowboy State Daily, on the other hand, has rarely wavered from support for Trump’s policies in its opinion pages. Orr attended the presidential inauguration this year, posting a photograph to social media of himself standing with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson. In another photo, Orr stands with Wyoming’s Republican U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman and Hughes Jr.

Hughes Jr. likely would have had broad access at the event, as federal filings show he donated $1 million to Trump’s 2025 inauguration committee. He’s a repeat supporter, having given the same amount to Trump’s 2017 inauguration and donated at least $505,600 to his 2020 campaign, according to Federal Election Commission reports. He has also earmarked part of his federal donations to state political parties for Trump’s Victory PAC.
“This election was clearly a middle-class repudiation of Beltway establishment politics, Americans fed up with a dysfunctional government that has taken us down the same wrong road for too long,” Hughes Jr. wrote in a 2016 statement when Trump won his first election. “Both institutions have failed us, and Donald Trump has tapped into a discontentment and mood that I have long felt and expressed — it’s time for us to abandon the antiquated, precepts of the left and right.” 
Campaign finance heavyweight
Hughes Jr. has long been politically active. And he’s brought that activity to Wyoming, where his wealth could have a significant impact.
Campaign finance records indicate that Molly Hughes has contributed substantially less than her husband.
Hughes Jr. did not respond to questions about his political philosophy, what motivates his spending or what future he wants for Wyoming and the nation. But public records of his spending do tell a story. 

While Hughes Jr. has backed Trump financially, and given to many Trump-endorsed candidates at the federal level, his Wyoming political contributions have been more targeted and moderate, campaign finance records show. He’s even given money to some Democrats nationally and in Teton County.
Former Councilor Jim Rooks received money for his campaign when he ran for Jackson Town Council and, most recently, the Teton County Board of County Commissioners. He lost in the 2024 Democratic primary. 
Although Rooks said he and the Hugheses don’t agree on every issue — they are, after all, longstanding conservatives — he said they knew he was a “moderate, practical sense candidate.”
“I accepted donations proudly from my friends,” Rooks said. “They believed in me.”
The first national political contribution recorded under the name B. Wayne Hughes Jr. by the Federal Election Commission came in 1990, when he would have been 31. He put $1,000 toward a California Republican candidate for U.S. Congress running in a strongly Democratic district. Hughes Jr.’s candidate lost. 
Over the course of the next 35 years, Hughes Jr. would pour millions into political races — including in states where he didn’t live. Aside from supporting Trump’s inaugurations, he has made at least 180 federal campaign contributions totaling $2.3 million since 1990, according to reporters’ analysis of Hughes Jr.’s political spending. 
Reporters did not find federal political action committees connected to his name, though Hughes Jr. could have spent more through other avenues, like inaugural committees. 


Before 2010, Hughes Jr. made 10 federal contributions, including to President George W. Bush’s campaign in 2000 and the California State Republican Party. FEC records show he also gave to two Democratic PACs before the 2008 election, when Barack Obama became president. 
The frequency of Hughes Jr.’s political spending at the federal and state levels increased after 2010, around the same time he started donating to California state races. He spent at least $1.5 million in state elections between 2008 and 2016, according to California Secretary of State campaign finance records. 
The height of Hughes Jr.’s federal political giving has come in the last five years. In that time, he has spent $1.9 million supporting congressional and presidential campaigns and political groups, according to FEC reports. 
Hughes Jr.’s largest individual donations included $500,000 to President Donald Trump’s Victory PAC in 2020, $396,300 to NRSC Victory and $100,000 to Protect the House 2024. The latter two are PACs aimed at keeping Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress.
Since 2020, he has also contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively to candidates closely aligned with Trump, including Rep. Hageman, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and Trump ally who is now the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. 
Hughes Jr. had backed former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., contributing $30,600 to her campaign in 2020, before she condemned Trump following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Hughes Jr. then gave to Hageman in the 2022 election cycle when she ousted Cheney.

In Wyoming, Hughes Jr. has given more than $637,000 to state legislative candidates since 2020, Wyoming Secretary of State campaign finance records show. His name wasn’t connected to any PACs on the state PAC roster list. Much of that giving came amid a schism between two Republican factions: the hard-right Wyoming Freedom Caucus and the more traditional Wyoming Caucus.
Hughes Jr. had lived in Jackson a few years before he started spending on state politics. His first donation was to Sen. Affie Ellis in Cheyenne in 2020, who was a more moderate candidate. She didn’t respond to requests for comment about her relationship with Hughes Jr. He made two other contributions in 2020: to the Teton County Republican Party and Wyoming Hope. 
In 2022, he largely donated to Wyoming Caucus candidates, notably Reps. Barry Crago, Shelly Duncan, Ember Oakley and Jon Conrad as well as Sens. Ogden Driskill, Stacy Jones, Drew Perkins and Wendy Schuler. 
Hughes Jr.’s giving to state candidates dropped off in 2024 in comparison to the 2022 election cycle. He made political donations to five Republican candidates not affiliated with the Freedom Caucus. Landon Greer and Kim Withers ran for seats in the Wyoming Senate and lost. David Hill and Robert Hendry ran for seats in the Wyoming House of Representatives and lost. Rob Geringer, meanwhile, won a seat in the Wyoming House.
Over the years, Wyoming Hope has been the largest recipient of Hughes Jr.’s state-level political donations. The PAC supported the continued funding of House Bill 65, which established Wyoming’s suicide prevention hotline. Since 2020, he’s donated $516,000 to the group, accounting for three of the 17 donations made to the PAC since 2020, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.
Wyoming Freedom Caucus members have questioned public financial support for the hotline. Many members have said it’s the responsibility of churches and nonprofits to step in to provide mental health support, which the Hugheses have done with their philanthropic arm. 
Praise and scorn
Former Senate President Driskill met Hughes Jr. when he was looking for a ranch in the eastern Wyoming Black Hills, before the Californian settled on buying a home near Jackson. Driskill said he became friends with both Hugheses and admires their political contributions and philanthropic efforts. 
Driskill didn’t ask for the $1,500 that Hughes Jr. donated to his campaign in 2022, but said the Hugheses knew he was being challenged by the far right.
“They made a real effort trying to work with Wyoming politics, and they found out how tough it really is,” Driskill said. 
Although Californians draw criticism for moving to Mountain West states and affecting politics, Driskill said the vast majority of people who come to Wyoming seek to fit in.

“I’ve got to be honest,” Driskill said. “I don’t think Wayne and Molly tried to change Wyoming’s culture or community. They tried to support what had been there in the past.” 
While Driskill said the Hugheses had “incredible influence on keeping Wyoming stable,” he noted that other powerful actors with money in Teton County are funding the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and the state’s move further right. 
“For all the liberal beatings that you folks take,” Driskill said, referring to Jackson, “you’ve got a group of people that’s not investing thousands, they’re investing millions into the hard right.” 
Even with Hughes Jr.’s history of donating to Republican candidates and organizations, he’s faced criticism from some further to the right, including Honor Wyoming, a political group founded in 2023 that has supported staunchly conservative politicians aligned with the Wyoming Freedom Caucus. Jackson residents Rebecca Bextel and Blair Maus and other notable Teton County Republicans are involved with the group. Cheyenne attorney and former Wyoming Republican Party Chairman Drake Hill has represented the group at legislative hearings. 
In October 2024, Honor Wyoming accused Cowboy State Daily of “providing biased political coverage, favoring politicians who receive donations from its owner, Wayne Hughes.” The group said he “quickly became the largest spender on Wyoming state politics” after moving to Wyoming in 2017.
The solution the group calls for: “Cowboy State Daily could add a simple disclaimer to every article written by or about any political figures who receive funding from Wayne Hughes or his PAC to add transparency for readers.”
But Orr has rejected the suggestion that Hughes Jr.’s personal support for candidates plays any role in news coverage.
“He’s not involved,” Orr said. “Totally separate.”
Mary Martin, the former chair of the Teton County GOP, first met the Hugheses at the Patriots Dinner in 2022. That year Hughes Jr. gave $51,265 to the Teton County Republican Party. She called them “common sense conservatives.
“I think they were just interested in a good Republican candidate,” she said. “I didn’t see them in any camp. They do their homework on who they’re going to support.”

It remains to be seen to what extent the Hugheses will participate in state politics going forward. The state is approaching a pivotal 2026 election. Gov. Mark Gordon’s time in office will end after eight years, and the race for the governor’s mansion appears wide open. Meanwhile, the policies of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus will face a referendum from voters after the group spent two years leading the Wyoming House of Representatives.
Regardless of who becomes governor and what faction of the right holds sway in the statehouse, the Hugheses are positioned — through their news organization, their philanthropy and their political donations — to continue playing a significant role in the state. And that influence, at least according to those who know them, will be wielded without the fanfare or bombast that’s come to define modern politics.  
Martin never would have known the Hugheses were billionaires, she said. Hughes Jr. was unassuming and friendly, causing her to do a double take when she learned more about him.
“They were just like your friend next door,” she said of the couple. “They were very amenable, affable, pleasant. Just like a neighbor.”

A run-in with the dogcatcher spirals columnist Rod Miller into a fabulist nightmare in which even when he's right, he ends up in the wrong.
The post Good Dog Henry’s tangle with tyranny appeared first on WyoFile .","My service dog, Good Dog Henry, almost got rounded up in a K9 ICE raid the other day. GDH is my intellectual support beast, and he was nearly sent to a canine detention camp in El Salvador or Equatorial Guinea. They eat dogs in those countries, if I’m to believe the president, and the holiday feasting season is approaching, so a bust would have had dire consequences for my potlicker.

Opinion

A word about my pooch: Good Dog Henry is prominently mentioned in veterinary manuals as the only dog ever born without a brain. His noggin is solid bone. Consequently, he operates on muscular instinct alone, and his instincts are particularly aroused by Milk Bone Extra-Meaty flavored medium-sized dog cookies and peyote.
A word about my porch, where GDH and I often sun ourselves on nice days, is also in order. The “porch” is a concrete slab about 10 feet square next to the sidewalk on Central Avenue. It’s a nice spot to drink beer, watch traffic and bark our heads off.
What follows here is crackerjack crime reporting, so pay close attention.
It was a lovely Veterans Day, and Henry and I were sunning ourselves on the porch. I nursed a PBR tallboy and waved at passing cars, while GDH lounged beside me, licking where his testicles used to be, fantasizing about lame bunnies and conjugating Latin verbs. Cheyenne’s dogcatcher parked across the street and closely observed us.
Henry and I have followed this same routine for eight years, and we have never felt this oppressive police presence before. It occurred to me that one of Good Dog Henry’s political enemies must have placed an anonymous call to the deep state to have us checked out.
When the dogcatcher disembarked her vehicle, she strode downwind across Central to our porch. On her belt, she had the customary handcuffs, flashlight and stun gun alongside a pouch of dog biscuits to placate nervous curs.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Henry caught a whiff of treats on the westerly breeze, and followed his nose to the sidewalk to investigate. Whereupon the dogcatcher proceeded to warn us that dogs cannot be on the sidewalk, city property and all, without being leashed. Since I refuse to wear a leash, I don’t put them on my critters. So Henry greeted her buck naked.
No ticket was issued, and no dog was hauled off to the camps. We got off with a stern warning, but I got to thinking how my old Rawlins Outlaw football coach, John Maffoni, always told me, “Miller, every time you think, you weaken the team,” but sometimes I can’t help myself.
I had the tantalizing thought that, if Good Dog Henry had been busted and perp-walked into court for prancing on the city’s sidewalk unleashed, I would be his defense attorney. I would establish that Henry was enticed onto the sidewalk by the irresistible aroma of cookies on the dogcatcher’s person, and that this was a clear-cut case of police entrapment.
Henry would walk out of the courthouse a free dog.
My mind conjectured further that, if this same police harassment occurred this winter when the sidewalk was covered in snow, I would again represent Henry before the bar of justice, and he would beat the rap once again.
I ran my defense counsel’s strategy through my mind. I would get the dogcatcher on the witness stand and have her closely examine the 8-by-10 glossies of the crime scene. I’d ask her to tell the court where Good Dog Henry was standing. When she said “on the city’s sidewalk,” I’d have her look closer and admit that Henry was standing on a snow-covered sidewalk.
I’d then establish that, since snow is just frozen water, and the state of Wyoming owns all the water, Henry was actually standing on state property, not city property. And the state of Wyoming doesn’t give a rat’s ass if dogs stand on their snow. Case dismissed!
My revelry would be broken when a badge-carrying member of Sidewalk ICE handed me a ticket for not shoveling my sidewalk in another ploy by the Clinton/Trump, Soros-funded conspiracy against our individual rights.
I, for one, and Good Dog Henry for another, have had just about a bellyful of this tyranny!

John Cavanaugh defends U.S. House bid against risks to state filibuster,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/11/19/state-sen-john-cavanaugh-defends-u-s-house-bid-against-risks-to-state-filibuster/,"The Omaha lawmaker called the criticisms a “loser mentality” and said he plans to run a campaign that raises “all boats.""","State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha is a candidate for U.S. House in Nebraska's Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — In the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Unicameral, the Democratic-leaning minority bloc currently has 16 seats, including progressive Omaha nonpartisan State Sen. Megan Hunt. 
That means the Legislature’s partisan minority, when united, needs Hunt and at least one GOP defector to stop legislation the group opposes. Republicans, when united, hold a narrow supermajority of 33 seats that can overcome them.
Still, filibusters have stopped some controversial majority-sought bills, including a six-week abortion ban, moving the state to winner-take-all in presidential elections and reducing a voter-approved increase in the minimum wage.
But in an off-year election when Democrats might win the Omaha-area race for Congress, some worry about the risks of even temporarily narrowing the party’s thin margin for those filibusters if State Sen. John Cavanaugh wins.
Cavanaugh, who represents one of the state’s most Democratic-leaning legislative districts, would have to resign if elected and be replaced by the governor, a seat of power in Nebraska that Republicans have occupied since 1999. 
Some local Democrats say Cavanaugh winning would allow a Republican majority to pass more controversial legislation that Democratic-aligned lawmakers and some Republican moderates have helped them stop.

A handful argue his departure from the Legislature could spur the state to redraw the 2nd Congressional District mid-decade, putting a potential Democrat in Congress out of a job and cementing GOP power in Nebraska for another generation. Others have questioned whether the current governor, Jim Pillen, or a successor might push for a special session to further restrict abortion.
Many of those concerns come from backers of two of Cavanaugh’s top opponents in the May 12 primary, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades and local business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell. People expressed similar concerns about the risks of State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha running for Congress.
The Democratic primary is a six-person race with Cavanaugh, Rhoades, Powell, Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and former immigration attorney Evangelos Argyrakis. 
Cavanaugh, in an interview with the Examiner, called the criticisms a “loser mentality” and said he plans to run a campaign that raises “all boats.” 
“I am confident that I’m going to win this house seat, and I’m confident that I’m going to do it in a way as a leader that will help Democrats win more seats at the state level,” Cavanaugh said.

Cavanaugh said Democrats elsewhere have shown in recent congressional elections that “we have a message that resonates with voters” and questioned whether the people who are concerned “think that Democrats can’t win.”
He said he thinks Nebraska Democrats will run strong candidates “up and down the ballot” in 2026, including for governor. No Democratic candidate for governor has yet announced 
Democrats won most of high-profile contests nationally this month, including the Governor’s Office in Virginia and the mayor’s race in New York, which some political observers have said could hint at a positive political environment for them in the midterms. Political experts view the open 2nd District U.S. House seat as a possible pickup for Democrats, following the retirement of Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon.

The 2nd District Democratic primary is a six-person race with Cavanaugh, Powell, Rhoades, Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis. 
Rhoades, in particular, has criticized Cavanaugh in public and private about the risks to Democrats, saying she chose to run partly out of concern about Cavanaugh vacating the seat when one or two votes are all that stand between Nebraska and what she describes as bad legislation. 
Rhoades said she wants to make sure “we aren’t sacrificing some of the things that the Democrats have been able to hold off in the Legislature.”  
“We’re hanging on by a thread — our representation, our Electoral College vote, and abortion rights are all dependent on maintaining the filibuster in the Legislature,” Rhoades said, “Throwing all of that away and putting the state and the country at risk is unacceptable. The stakes are too high.”
During the last legislative session, Republican efforts to change how the state awards Electoral College votes for president failed in part because Republican State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston and State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont sided with Democrats against the timing of the change. A similar effort to make the change in 2024 fell a single vote short when then-State Sen. Mike McDonnell, a new Republican, chose not to back the effort.
Riepe also was the sole Republican to vote against a push for a six-week abortion ban during the 2023 legislative session.
Ryan Longenecker, Powell’s campaign manager, said, “Voters are tired of career politicians looking for their next opportunity.” He said she is focused on the fact that “people back home are really struggling to make ends meet.” 
Cavanaugh told the Examiner he would resign from the Legislature in January 2027 if he won the primary and general elections. The governor would then appoint Cavanaugh’s replacement for all of 2027 and 2028, due to the timing of the potential vacancy.
His appointed replacement would serve until January 2029, according to state law. He has the option of resigning before May 1, which would trigger a special election in November 2026. However, his seat would be filled by a Pillen appointee in the interim.  
Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb previously said there is a path for the party to make gains in the statehouse after losing seats in recent years, but it would be “difficult.” One reason: a more favorable environment in 2026. Democratic officials hope to gain two seats. The party could also lose ground.
A look at registration numbers in many of the districts where Democrats hope to win seats still shows them at a disadvantage against Republicans.
Hunt has said that is part of why she is watching the Democratic primary closely. Losing any more seats could widen the door for “extremist policies that hurt working people” and “target vulnerable communities,” she said.
“My hope is that we don’t lose that last line of defense,” Hunt added. 
Cavanaugh argues the national stakes are even higher, “because of the current chaos created by [President Donald] Trump.” 
“Congress has the ultimate authority over a lot of the things that people are concerned about,” Cavanaugh said, “So we need strong representation in Congress who’s going to stand up … and fight for the people of this district.”
The winner of the Democratic primary will face the winner of a GOP primary featuring Omaha City Council Member Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha.

Idaho’s expenses for the 2025 wildfire season netted about $40.6 million, Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller said during Tuesday’s meeting of the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners, which is frequently referred to as simply the Land Board.
Miller told the Land Board that Idaho incurred about $59.3 million in expenses as of Nov. 3, but the state expects to recoup about $18.6 million through reimbursement agreements and partnerships – resulting in a net total of about $40.6 million. 
Miller estimated that leaves the state’s wildfire suppression fund with a balance of about $15 million heading into the 2026 wildfire season.
That amount of money is likely not enough to pay wildfire bills in 2026. Miller estimated that the state will be on the hook for almost $5 million next year in fixed costs at the beginning of the season before the first fire even starts. 
Idaho’s projected state budget deficit increases to $58.3 million

Idaho Gov. Brad Little said costs could be well over $10 million when the cost of contracting for helicopters, crews and other equipment are added – all before fighting a single wildfire.
That means state officials could have to find additional money to fight wildfires at a time when all state agencies – other than the K-12 public school system – are navigating mandatory budget holdbacks of 3% and the state budget is projected to end the current fiscal year with a budget deficit estimated at $58.3 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
As state revenues come in below projections, the Idaho Legislature’s powerful budget-setting committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, has signaled that next year’s budgets will be tight, and legislators will generally focus more on trimming budgets rather than approving new budget expenses to avoid running a budget deficit, the Sun previously reported. 
 Idaho governor said he doesn’t want state going into debt fighting wildfires

Little has favored pre-funding the state’s wildfire suppression fund to make sure money is available upfront, ensure firefighting operations are not shortchanged or interrupted and to avoid going into debt fighting wildfires. 
“Backing the Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund means Idaho’s wildland firefighters can focus on aggressively protecting timber, lands, property and people without funding delays, and lawmakers can enter next year’s budgeting cycle without a deficit due to wildfire suppression,” Little and the Land Board members wrote in a Feb. 18 letter to JFAC.

At the beginning of the 2025 legislative session, Little requested $60 million to build up the wildfire suppression fund, but the Idaho Legislature agreed to provide $40 million.
With the balance of the wildfire fund now dropping to $15 million, Little said Tuesday he is trying to decide how much funding he needs to request to be prepared to fight wildfires in 2026 so the state does not have to use deficiency warrants to pay the bills. Little and other state officials have compared the deficiency warrant process to running up credit card debit to pay for essential state services.
“By the time you contract for helicopters and the airplanes and the crews and everything, it’s well over $10 million,” Little said Tuesday. “I’m just trying to figure out what the budget request needs to be so we don’t have to do deficiency warrants.”
Compared to the more severe 2024 wildfire season, Idaho’s wildfire costs were lower this year at an estimated $40.6 million. In 2024, Idaho’s wildfire costs were about $58 million, the Sun previously reported. 
The Land Board is made up of Little, Secretary of State Phil McGrane, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf and Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield.
The Land Board provides direction to the Idaho Department of Lands, which is responsible for fighting wildfires on state land.
The Idaho Legislature will set the fiscal year 2027 budget for the Idaho Department of Lands during the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 12  at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

Bill Lee over his decision to send the National Guard to Memphis praised a judge’s order to temporarily block the deployment, but warned there was “a mighty ways to go” before the city may see an end to the military presence. 
Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal ruled Monday that the governor had exceeded his authority in unilaterally deploying the Guard to Memphis as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force established by President Donald Trump.
On Tuesday, the governor’s office said it planned to appeal Moskal’s ruling. 
In a statement,Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti framed the legal battle to keep the Guard in Memphis in historic terms, one with “ramifications for not just the safety of Memphians now but for all Tennesseans for centuries to come.”
Judge temporarily blocks National Guard deployment in Memphis

Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, a plaintiff in the suit, told reporters Tuesday he was prepared for the lengthy legal battle ahead. 
“Now we realize we have a very long way to go and we are up against the mightiest of adversaries, the White House and Donald Trump, Gov. Lee and federal officials, some of whom are willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy their whimsy of the day,” said Harris, who called Lee’s decision to deploy the Guard “dumbfounding and disappointing.”
“The military should not be used against Tennesseans,” Harris said.
Tennessee State Sen. Brent Taylor, who represents a portion of Memphis, was among state Republicans who condemned the ruling by Moskal, whom he called “clueless.” 
“As is usually the case with decisions from activist low-level chancellors, I expect this ruling to be overturned on appeal,” Taylor said.
Guard plays ‘supportive’ role
The Tennessee National Guard has been deployed to Memphis since Oct. 10 as one component of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by Trump to fight crime in one of the nation’s largest majority-Black cities. 
The Guard remains under the command of Lee, a Republican, who has neither authorized them to make arrests nor carry weapons. 
Thus far the Guard has taken on a supportive role to aid hundreds of federal and state law enforcement officers who have also been dispatched to the city. 
They are a regular presence at Memphis tourist destinations such as Beale Street, and Facebook photos posted by the Tennessee National Guard show men and women in fatigues walking along streets, fist-bumping passers by and smiling at children.
Feds ink millions of dollars in contracts to feed, house National Guard in Memphis

Just how many Guard personnel are in Memphis remains in question. 
Last week, a spokesperson for the Memphis Police Department said there were 140-180 National Guard members in Memphis, noting their presence would soon double.
In a declaration submitted in court last week, Lieut. Col. Dallas Clements, deputy director of military support for the Tennessee National Guard, said there were 719 Guard members in Memphis.
In total, the federal government has estimated the cost for pay, benefits, meals and hotels for up to 1,000 Guard personnel deployed for a year in Memphis would exceed $33 million annually.
The cost of the Guard presence has drawn criticism from some Memphis leaders, who were contending with budget shortfalls even before Task Force arrests strained the city’s already-overcrowded jail and justice system.
“They’re not doing anything,” said JB Smiley, Jr., a Memphis City Councilman who is among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “We’re spending millions of dollars to afford the National Guard to simply walk our streets, to laugh and play, when we have some pressing issues in this community.”
‘Removing the National Guard does not remove the fear’
The presence of hundreds more federal and state law enforcement officers from more than 30 agencies, including Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Tennessee Highway Patrol, remains unaffected by Monday’s injunction. 
Thus far, the Task Force members have made 2,800 arrests, confiscated more than 450 illegal firearms and located 114 missing children, a spokesperson for Lee said Tuesday. The Lookout has been unable to independently verify arrest data released by state and federal officials.

Task force members have also issued thousands of traffic tickets, served warrants and made immigration arrests. Some of the arrests have involved multiple officers tackling individuals to the ground and separating young children from parents in scenes captured on widely circulated videos taken by local activists that have generated fear and outrage in local communities. 
“People were taken without warning, without explanation and without time even to say goodbye,” said Jessica Miller, a spokesperson for The Collective Good Immigrant Food Pantry, an all-volunteer effort to deliver food to immigrant families too afraid to leave their homes or left without resources after a breadwinner was arrested by the task force.
“Last night’s ruling matters and affirmed what many already knew,” Miller said. “But removing the National Guard does not remove the fear. It does not unbreak the families. It does not undo the trauma. And it does not stop the ongoing actions of the Task Force that created the crisis we are in in the first place.”

During a meeting Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners – or Land Board – voted 4-1 to move forward with auctioning off a 160-acre parcel of state land, which is located in eastern Idaho near the town of Driggs. 
The Land Board previously voted 5-0 on July 15 to auction off the same plot of land, which is being leased for grazing by fifth-generation rancher Nick Beard and his family, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The sale of the land would result in breaking the grazing lease, which would be legal under the fine print terms of the contract, the Sun previously reported.

The Land Board took the issue up again Tuesday after two-thirds of Idaho’sTeton County commissioners and several members of the public voiced opposition to selling the state land and breaking the grazing lease with the local ranching family.
State officials said they want to auction the land off to the highest bidder because the Idaho Constitution requires the state to manage state endowment lands in such a way as to maximize the highest long-term financial return to endowment beneficiaries. The state currently generates about $960 a year off the land through the grazing lease. But by selling the land in Driggs, where property values have been increasing for decades and millionaires have been buying up land that had historically been used by local ranchers and farmers, officials believe they could make millions of dollars for the state.

On Sept. 12, two of Idaho’s Teton County commissioners wrote a letter to Little and the Land Board asking them to not sell the land. They said hundreds of local people spoke out against the sale, sticking up for the Beard family and calling on the state to preserve agricultural land that is accessible to the public in a community that was built on agriculture. 
“Our Comprehensive Plan (p1-8) states … ‘We will strive to … maintain, nurture and enhance the rural character and nature of Teton Valley,’” Commissioners Brad Wolfe and Dan Powers wrote. “It is hard to picture a more striking depiction of this mandate than the Beard family ranching on this property.”
“With the overwhelmingly strong opposition we have received from the public, we as the commissioners of Teton County and representing our constituents, have unitedly come to the decision that we respectfully request that the ‘Driggs 160’ not be considered for sale at this time,” Wolfe and Powers added.
However, Teton County Commissioner Ron James did not sign the letter and sent his own letter to Little and the Land Board urging them to complete the sale.
“I understand the passion surrounding this issue, including the value of public lands for agriculture, wildlife and community heritage, as highlighted in the numerous public comments we have received,” James wrote. “However, I remain convinced that respecting the state’s authority in this instance is the proper course of action.”
 Rancher leasing state lands was not notified in advance of planned sale

One of the issues surrounding the planned sale of the property is that Beard and his family were not notified in advance before the Land Board considered approving the sale in July, the Sun previously reported. Instead, Beard’s wife found out about the sale through a post on Facebook, and it took until July 21, about a week after the first vote July 15, for someone from the Idaho Department of Lands to notify the Beards that they would be losing the land his family has leased from grazing since the 1990s.
Beard’s lease runs through 2032, but the language in the lease agreement allows the state to break the lease in the event the state decides to sell the property.

Several Land Board members, including Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, were highly critical of the Idaho Department of Lands staff for failing to notify Beard of the planned sale in a timely manner. McGrane made an unsuccessful attempt to put the land up for sale under the condition the new buyer honor the terms of Beard’s lease through its end date, but McGrane’s motion failed on a 2-3 vote. Just McGrane and Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf supported the move, while Little, Attorney General Raúl Labrador and Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield opposed the proposal. 
Moments later, the Land Board voted 4-1 to authorize the sale as planned, which will end the lease. McGrane cast the lone vote against moving forward with the sale as planned. 
Idaho Department of Lands officials previously told the Sun there is interest in the property from prospective buyers, who they declined to identify. State officials said they don’t know who will end up buying the land because it will be sold at auction that anyone can participate in. 
Earlier this year, Beard told the Sun that lawyers representing a neighboring land owner, Thomas Tull, have reached out to him with interest in acquiring the land.  
Tull is a billionaire businessman and movie producer. According to campaign finance records Tull contributed $25,000 to the Friends of Brad Little political committee in 2023. Tull also contributed $100,000 to the Idaho Victory Fund Political Action Committee in 2022, which supported a variety of Republican candidates including Little, McGrane and Critchfield.
Neither the Land Board nor the Idaho Department of Lands set a date for the auction during Tuesday’s meeting.

Aftyn Behn and Nashville Republican Matt Van Epps, former Tennessee General Services commissioner, face off in a special election to fill Tennessee’s 7th U.S. Congressional District.
But with Democratic success nationally in November’s off-cycle elections, the party’s on the rise for the first time since President Donald Trump was elected in 2024, the upcoming U.S. House race is drawing attention from national politicians and political action committees.
Last week, Trump held a “tele-rally” where he said Van Epps was a “true America First patriot who has dedicated his entire life to serving our country.” The President’s political action committee also started spending money to back Van Epps.
Over the weekend, a Democratic-affiliated group called Your Community PAC launched a nearly half-million-dollar independent expenditure campaign attacking Van Epps, and Tuesday former Vice President Kamala Harris was in Nashville at a rally hosted by the Tennessee Democratic Party to encourage people to vote in the upcoming election. Harris attended the rally ahead of her appearance at the Ryman Auditorium as part of her book tour.

Harris called the election a fight “for the future” and about giving political power back to “the people,” but didn’t endorse Behn, who left before the former vice president arrived.
Republicans have held Tennessee’s 7th Congressional seat for more than 50 years, but the seat was redrawn in 2022 as part of state GOP lawmakers’ successful attempt to gerrymander the state map. The new district maps divided Nashville-Davidson County, historically a Democratic stronghold, across three districts, including the 7th.
Former U.S. Rep. Mark Green won the 7th by a 20% in the 2022 and 2024 elections, but this year’s race is the first time the seat will have to hold up in a political environment that, on the surface, doesn’t favor Republicans. Republicans won the 2022 and 2024 U.S. House elections nationwide as a referendum on former Democratic President Joe Biden, but this year, with Trump in power the 2025 election serves as a referendum on his administration’s actions, like the continued increase in cost of living.
Green resigned from Congress in July, triggering the special election for the seat.
What are the candidates running on?
Behn narrowly bested a field of four candidates in the Democratic primary. In the state House, she sponsored measures to cut the state’s sales tax on groceries and to legalize and tax marijuana to pay for road construction.
Van Epps won a primary with nearly a dozen candidates, in part because of a last-minute endorsement from Trump and a significant boost from the pro-school-voucher Club for Growth, which ran advertisements attacking his main rival, state Rep. Jody Barrett. Van Epps has made his military experience as a former Army helicopter pilot a central theme of his campaign.

The 7th District is drawn to include all of the Clarksville area, where a high percentage of people are former military because of the proximity to Fort Campbell, a U.S. Army base.
Van Epps is running campaign advertisements saying he wants to “bring down prices, create good-paying jobs and lowering healthcare costs for working families.” During the primary, Van Epps ran advertisements calling himself a “MAGA warrior” who would take on “radical leftists.”
Behn emphasizes her view that corporate money shouldn’t be allowed in politics and ties Van Epps to rising health care costs.
During the most recent government shutdown, the Democratic Party tried to force the GOP to extend healthcare insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Nearly 650,000 Tennesseans are covered by government-subsidized health insurance plans, according to KFF.
Epstein files take center stage
Candidates launched attack ads the week after the primary, with Van Epps hitting Behn for her pro-choice abortion stance and protests of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sting operation in South Nashville this year.
Behn has attacked Van Epps over his initial lack of support to release the U.S. Department of Justice’s files about disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The release of the “Epstein files” has become a rallying cry for Democratic lawmakers across the country because of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s past ties to Trump. Van Epps backed the release of the files Tuesday, flipping from a previous stance and waiting until after it became clear that the U.S. House would vote to release them.

Behn is receiving independent support from a group called Your Community PAC, which Federal Election Commission disclosures show started spending over $500,000 in mid-November. The group ran TV advertisements over the weekend attacking Van Epps by tying him to his previous stance on the release of the Epstein files.
The group has also sent out dual mailers encouraging Democrats to go to the polls and comparing Van Epps unfavorably to John Thorp, an independent in the race.
Your Community PAC’s money doesn’t link back to an individual donor but to a dark money group called the North Fund. The North Fund, as of 2024, was run by a Washington D.C. consultant named Jim Gerstein, who has served as a pollster and independent expenditure campaign organizer in support of several Democratic Party candidates.
Van Epps has received over $150,000 in independent support from Trump’s MAGA Inc. PAC and the Special Operations for America, a PAC supporting military candidates. So far, Club for Growth’s PAC, the School Freedom Fund, hasn’t spent any money to boost Van Epps or attack Behn in the general election.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Even though the final curtain call has been issued, moving Goldenseal magazine’s print edition out and its digital format in, it is yet another example of the very real threat that faces not only West Virginians but everyone whose life is enriched by the arts. 
It goes without saying that mankind’s basic needs (food, shelter, clothing) are paramount to our survival, our quality of life (and let’s add affordable, accessible health care to the list) we cannot overlook the intrinsic value of the arts, which have always enriched people’s lives, from gazing at paintings to listening to music, to reading and writing stories. Each experience enlivens our senses, invites us to give it a whirl ourselves, and gifts hope, energizing us to keep going, no matter how difficult the journey. Can you imagine a world without the arts? I can’t, and I don’t want to even give it a moment’s thought.
The recent decision to eliminate the print edition of Goldenseal Magazine is troubling, not only because it was an exceptional and impressive publication that countless readers and writers enjoyed, but it effortlessly lured visitors to the state. In a way, it became an elixir, appealing to readers’s senses. 
When I think of West Virginia’s broadband challenges and the percentage of people, especially throughout rural America who face the same challenge, I wonder if those who made the decision to move Goldenseal to digital only gave any thought to the vast number of people who will not have access to the digital format. It can’t always be about dollars and cents. At times, it must be about making certain that the arts are easily accessible to everyone. Historically, it has been shown that it is the arts that keep people from despair, especially in times of unprecedented change. 
The arts have always been most important to those of us without vast fortunes, without easy access to museums and live performances. So many rely on printed material that highlights those experiences in words, in photos, on pages that we can hold in our hands, inhaling the ink from the printed paper, and sharing our experiences with others. I don’t think this has anything to do with adapting to changing times. I don’t think it has anything to do with embracing the digital world. And I don’t think it has much to do with cutting costs. I think that it has everything to do with a political climate that serves a master whose staying power is beginning to wane.
All of this is why I recently found myself in uncharted territory, as I withdrew two pieces I had written and that had been accepted for publication in the next issue of Goldenseal. And once I reached that decision, in an act of silent protest, I knew that I had taken the action I could, rather than simply writing another commentary disagreeing with the decision to no longer publish a print edition of Goldenseal. I would make the decision again. Doing what we can, no matter how seemingly insignificant, is all we can do. And if enough of us do that, the wrongs will be righted.

It’s the second stage of funding offered through the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
(Photo by iStock/Getty Images Plus)West Virginia farmers whose crops or commodities were affected by natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 will soon be able to access more federal funding to aid their individual recovery, according to a news release from the state Department of Agriculture.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is launching the second stage of the Farm Service Agency’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, making $16 billion total available for farmers nationwide who saw their crops or products impacted or destroyed by natural disasters.
Applications for stage two of the relief program will open on Nov. 24. Both stage one and stage two will accept applications until April 30, 2026. Depending on circumstances, farmers may be able to apply and receive funds from both stages of the program.
Per the USDA, the first stage of the program was mostly reserved for farmers with larger losses while stage two covers a broader range, including “shallow losses,” the loss of uninsured crops and drops in crop quality due to a natural disaster.
Natural disasters that would allow a farmer to qualify for either stage of the funding includes: wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat, tornadoes, winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure, excessive moisture, qualifying drought and related conditions in calendar years 2023 or 2024.
Per the USDA, two counties — Pendleton and Jefferson — met the standards to receive funds due to a qualifying drought in 2023. In 2024, that increased to 53 counties — all but Hancock and McDowell — being eligible.
To date, according to the USDA, 239 applications for losses in West Virginia have been approved through stage one of the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, totaling about $3.31 million. About $1.98 million of that went toward losses for “specialty and high value crops.”
“West Virginia farmers have faced repeated weather challenges, and many are still recovering,” said Commissioner of Agriculture Kent Leonhardt. “This federal support will help producers rebuild and prepare for the next growing season. We appreciate USDA’s commitment to getting these resources to our farmers when they need them most.”
About $1.87 million of all the funds distributed so far in West Virginia for stage one went to cover losses from apples. Another $980,000 went to corn. Money to cover losses from most other crops — including potatoes, honey, wheat, peaches and more — totaled less than $10,000 per a crop.
The funds for both stage one and two of the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program were made available in the American Relief Act passed by Congress under President Joe Biden in December 2024. 
 The newly available funds for farmers come in addition to those made available previously, including $9.3 billion from the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program that went online in May. That money was specifically meant to help farmers who produce certain commodities “mitigate the impacts of increased input costs and falling commodity prices,” per the USDA. 
Across the country, farmers have been lamenting the consequences of increased prices due to tariffs and trade complications. They’ve been asking Congress to help ease the burden of unprofitable harvests, which these funds are supposed to do. 
But, per the New York Times, the money that is needed and made available now may come too late to help farmers who are already preparing for next year’s crop cycles.

That’s not naivete; it’s a conviction that has guided my life’s work with children and families. Right now, Idaho faces a challenge that tests that belief. Our kids are in crisis. I’m confident we can turn this around, but only if we do it together. 
Treasure Valley youth deserve better. Our mental health coalition is taking action.

Founded as an orphanage in 1908, the Children’s Home became one of Idaho’s first youth mental health counseling centers in 1975. Our organization has been helping kids here for more than a century, but lately, it feels like we’re trapped in a loop. The current state of mental health looks alarmingly similar to what it was 10, even 20, years ago. In many ways, it’s worse. 
Since the isolation and daily stress of the pandemic, we’ve seen a 20 to 30 percent increase in demand for mental health care for children. Kids are struggling with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and the lingering weight of trauma. Parents and caregivers are doing everything they can to help, but they keep running into a wall. There are simply not enough providers to meet the need. 
When kids don’t have access to care, it doesn’t just hurt them. It harms the well-being of the family and the entire community. There are lifelong consequences to this that impact every single one of us. 
For too long, Idaho’s response has been scattered. Nonprofits and agencies have worked hard in their own corners, each addressing a piece of the problem. That approach isn’t enough anymore. The scale of this crisis demands a united front and collective purpose. 
That’s why Children’s Home, Idaho Youth Ranch, and Women’s & Children’s Alliance have joined forces in a first-of-its-kind collaboration. Our shared goal is simple but powerful: Every child in Idaho deserves access to the mental health care they need. And we won’t stop until that becomes our reality. 
It’s unusual for three nonprofits to come together, but we think it’s the future of how we solve problems in Idaho. We bring more than 200 years of combined service to this work. We’ve seen what makes an impact and where systems fall short. We share data and stories. And we’re using our collective voice to advocate for practical, lasting change — like expanding school-based counseling and offering paid internships for aspiring therapists. 
We’re already seeing what’s possible. When we brought therapy directly into a local school, a parent working three jobs sent our counselor a note that read, “You’ve given us our family back.” 
This is an Idaho problem, but it’s also an Idaho opportunity. When our community faces hard things, we roll up our sleeves and get to work. We support one another. We innovate. We find a way forward. 
That’s what this partnership is about — turning shared belief into shared action. And we’re not doing it alone. With support from community leaders, policymakers, and partners like the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation, we’re proving that when Idaho comes together, hope and change are possible. 
We’re not just responding to a crisis. We’re building a future where every child has the chance to grow up healthy, hopeful, and whole. Together, we’re turning the unsolvable into the solvable.

While Whitmer has spared three turkeys over the past three years – Mitch E. Gander in 2022, Dolly Pardon in 2023 and Aiden Cluckinson in 2024 – this year brought two turkeys to the Capitol seeking freedom from the dinner table on Thanksgiving. 
“Best of all, they are sisters,” Whitmer said. “These two Michigan icons are named after two other Michigan icons. I give you Faygo and Vernors. And remember, it’s pop, not soda.” 
The pairs’ names were selected from among 1,527 submissions, Whitmer said, with Michiganders voting on the top eight.

“Like a lot of sisters, Faygo and Vernors, spent all week squabbling over who got to wear the fluffier feathers for the big day,” Whitmer said. “And ladies, they both look beautiful.”
In the midst of a speech sprinkled with Thanksgiving-related puns, Whitmer also recounted her administration’s accomplishments over the past year, from securing a bipartisan state budget – after a monthslong budget battle that nearly resulted in a government shutdown – to negotiating with White House to secure a fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base and funding for the Brandon Road lock and dam project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes. 
“During the holidays, I encourage everyone to find ways to give back to their community, and I hope that everyone can spend Thanksgiving with the ones they love most,” Whitmer said. “This is the best time here to slow down, share a meal and remember what really matters. I’m thankful to the first responders, service members and health care workers who work through the holidays to keep us safe and healthy. And I’m thankful to all of you, my fellow Michiganders, who make our state the best place to live, work and yes, save turkeys.”

And the math isn’t adding up.,Mike Draper,,,,,https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/11/19/health-care-isnt-a-political-issue-its-a-math-issue-and-the-math-isnt-adding-up/,"In an ever-changing world, it’s nice to know that some things stay the same – my annual health insurance premium increase just came through for the 20th year in a row!

For 2026, my company’s small-group policy will rise roughly 10%. And believe it or not, in the world of American health care, that’s considered a modest increase.
For my own family — myself, my wife, and our four kids — our health insurance plan costs about $1,800 per month with a $12,000 annual deductible. That is about $34,000 per year. 
If your household earns around $110,000 a year, you’re actually doing extremely well: that puts you in the top 15% of earners in states like Wisconsin.
But even at that income, a $34,000 annual healthcare bill eats up 40% of your post-tax income.
Let’s put that in perspective:

That $34,000 is almost six times what that same family pays in Medicare taxes — taxes that help cover the oldest, sickest people in the country.
That $34,000 is more than my family spends on food, mortgage, property taxes, and utilities combined.
And the gap between what we pay and what we use has become downright comical: I’m at Hy-Vee four times a week, but I haven’t been to a doctor in over three years.

But here’s the bigger problem: When premiums go up 7% per year — again, considered “moderate” — the magic of compound interest turns that into a doubling of price in just a decade.
At only 7% increases, by 2037, a family earning $110,000 will be paying a $45,000 annual premium for a small-group plan. Add a $15,000 deductible, and private insurance would consume 80% of their after-tax take-home pay.
No household, no matter how responsible or hard-working, can withstand that. 
We’ve been promised reform for nearly a decade. Donald Trump began talking about fixing healthcare back in 2016. By 2024, the country still had nothing more than “concepts of a plan.” And temporary patches — tweaked subsidies, tinkering with tax credits, or tossing out $2,000 checks — are not even in the neighborhood of a real solution. 
At the very least, Congress should make sure those price spikes don’t devastate families on Jan. 1, but the fact that those tax credits are needed speaks to out of control costs within the health care system. 
We are out of time for small fixes. The system doesn’t need polishing — it needs structural change. 
What we need is bold leadership and big ideas. And in my view, the fastest, most practical path forward is a public option — Medicare-for-all-who-want-it. Let individuals and small businesses buy into Medicare. If my family could get coverage for anything less than $34,000 a year, that’s an immediate savings! And we’re far from alone. That’s why I’m advocating with other small business owners, including those at the Main Street Alliance, to get it done. 
You can’t solve an economic problem with partisan politics. That’s why Rep. Derrick Van Orden must come to the table to negotiate on health care. He said he would protect rural health care earlier this year, then turned his back on folks on Western Wisconsin and voted for the ‘Big Ugly Law’. The system is broken and we need serious people to address health care in a serious way. The math has already made the case. Now we need you to have the courage to follow it.

(Photo: Clark Couty Public Works Dept.)In an effort to stave off projected budget shortfalls that local transportation officials warned would have decimated funding needed to maintain and grow Southern Nevada roadways and transit projects, Clark County Commissioners voted 6-1 Tuesday to extend inflation-adjusted gas taxes.
The fuel revenue index (FRI) program, which allows the county to index gas taxes to the rate of inflation, was set to expire at the end of 2026. 
Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada officials told commissioners extending the index for another decade was needed to prevent any loss in funding and enable the county to continue to compete for federal dollars. 
Clark County Commissioner April Becker, the lone dissenting vote, bemoaned the fact the decision to extend the index was being made by the commission rather than “a vote of the people” as it was originally intended when it received a vote in 2016. 
“There is a lot of audacity that I’ve been assured that in 2036 it will go to the vote of the people,” she said. “That’s the only way to ensure it will be increased. Guess what, you fool me once, you will fool me again”
Her fellow commissioners disagreed, citing a need to act now to prevent any loss of revenue. 
“It would be irresponsible, in my estimation, to postpone a vote on this item,” said Commission Chair Jim Gibson. “We owe it to the people we represent to take a hard stand and do the right thing.”
For every gallon of gas sold in Clark County, roughly 78 cents is collected in taxes with about 26 cents going to the RTC.
In addition to funding Southern Nevada roadways and transit projects, the revenue generated puts the county in a better position when competing for federal grant dollars. In order to apply for federal grants, jurisdictions are often required to provide matching funds.
The FRI  has “generated $1 billion in additional funding we otherwise wouldn’t have had,” since being adopted, David Swallow, the deputy CEO of the RTC told commissioners Tuesday. The county has been able to turn that into $3 billion worth of projects with the addition of federal grants, he said. 
The money has supported 727 projects with 530 completed, 106 in construction, and 91 in the design phase, Swallow said.
The Clark County Commission originally approved adjusting the tax for inflation in 2014, and two years later nearly 60% of Clark County voters approved extending the fuel revenue index until 2026. 
M.J. Maynard-Carey, the CEO of the RTC, had sounded the alarm for several years about the pending shortfall if the tax wasn’t extended beyond 2026. 
Assembly Bill 530, passed by the Legislature during its regular session earlier this year, allows the Clark County Commission, by a two-thirds vote, to extend FRI an additional decade beyond its current sunset date. The FRI would then require voter approval if it went beyond 2036.
Similar legislation was introduced in 2023. Assembly Bill 359 passed with bipartisan support but was vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
The county’s effort to extend the FRI received broad support Tuesday from labor unions, environmental groups and Chambers of Commerce.
In his vote in favor, Commissioner Justin Jones said in numerous conversations with local and national transportation officials, they said “Absent the dedicated funding streams we have as a result of FRI, we would not get those federal grants.”
“Our federal tax dollars are going to go somewhere,” Jones said. “A vote today determines if those federal tax dollars through the Department of Transportation will stay here in Southern Nevada” or go other places.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettypylons-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-19 08:56:31.099721

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s campaign finance watchdog is ordering a former House staff member — recently pardoned after conviction in a corruption case — to testify about a political action committee he secretly formed in 2020 to sway the election.
The Tennessee Registry of Election Finance voted Tuesday to drop a subpoena against ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren and, instead, bring him in next year to explain his actions in forming the Faith Family Freedom Fund. 
Registry Chairman Tom Lawless said Cothren sent fraudulent documents, including a treasurer’s report and several emails, to the Registry when he formed the political action committee.
In 2022, the Registry board subpoenaed Cothren, who worked for former House Speaker Glen Casada, after a former girlfriend, Sydney Friedopfer, testified he asked her to form the political action committee so he could run it secretly. She also said in telephone testimony that Cothren told her she didn’t need to worry about responding to questions from the Registry.
Cothren refused to comply with the subpoena, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Registry board sent the matter to the Attorney General’s office, which took it to Chancery Court to be enforced. It languished there until Cothren’s federal corruption case wrapped up with a pardon by President Donald Trump following a conviction on multiple charges involving a bogus campaign vendor.
Registry sends Cothren subpoena to AG’s Office after he refuses to testify, claims the Fifth

Regardless of whether Cothren refuses to show up and talk to the board, it could levy a civil penalty against him. And if Cothren refuses to pay the penalty, he would be ineligible to run for a state office, according to Bill Young, executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance.
Cothren hinted recently that he would seek election following his pardon.
“And presidential pardons have absolutely no bearing on it,” Lawless said after Tuesday’s board meeting.
Cothren’s attorney, Cynthia Sherwood, told the Registry board three years ago he shouldn’t be compelled to testify in the civil matter at the same time the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office was investigating the matter. It is unclear whether that office is reviving the case.
The political action committee spent money donated in the 2020 campaign by a North Carolina restaurateur, whom the Registry was unable to locate, to pay for campaign ads attacking former Republican Rep. Rick Tillis of Lewisburg. Tillis, a political enemy of Casada’s, was defeated by Rep. Todd Warner in November 2020. Two months later, the FBI raided the offices and homes of Warner, a Chapel Hill Republican, Casada, Cothren, and former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson. 
Smith pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks from Cothren, along with Casada, for steering House Republicans toward a campaign vendor he ran called Phoenix Solutions, which was set up in New Mexico.
Cothren and Casada received presidential pardons in early November after being sentenced to prison for their roles in the political corruption case. Smith, who testified for federal prosecutors, is to serve a short prison stint but is seeking a pardon as well.
Jurors found Cothren used a phony name, “Matthew Phoenix,” to fill out a federal tax form required by the state. They also heard an audiotape of FBI agents questioning Casada and notifying him it is against federal law to lie to them.
Casada resigned the speaker’s seat in August 2019 amid a sexist and racist texting scandal involving Cothren, in addition to complaints about his management style after the House Republican Caucus cast a no-confidence vote. 
The Registry board initially audited the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC because of a complaint filed by Greg Hazelwood, the treasurer for Tillis, who claimed the political action committee illegally coordinated with Warner’s campaign. Auditors were stonewalled but finally found Friedopfer, who registered the PAC, in Utah.

Many rely on federal food assistance and government health insurance, but will lose access under federal budget cuts in 2026. (Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Beheshte Hemid, 25, smiles while singing the ABCs with fellow women refugees at a weekly class inside Calvary Baptist Church on Broad Street in Providence. 
She smiles stumbling her way through an explanation in English about the life that her family of three has set up since moving to Rhode Island from Afghanistan 11 months ago. 
But Hemid’s smile becomes forced as she takes in the news that the federal food assistance she and many other clients at the Refugee Dream Center rely on will be cut off in three months. She’s too stunned to say anything. So a friend and fellow Afghan refugee speaks for her.
“It’s unbelievable,” Sitara Sakhizada said.
Yet it’s the reality coming for hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants nationwide, whose access to critical and longstanding government safety net programs will be stripped away by the massive federal fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
The budget reconciliation package targets some of the most vulnerable noncitizen groups: refugees, asylum seekers, and domestic violence and human trafficking survivors, for whom Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, along with other federal tax credits and health discounts, will be yanked away.
In Rhode Island, an estimated 2,300 people will lose SNAP benefits due to their immigration status starting Feb. 1, according to an Oct. 30 report by the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Medicaid restrictions will cut off health care coverage for 9,000 adults starting Oct. 1, 2026 — children under 19 can still qualify regardless of their immigration status under state law.
Plus newly begun Medicaid work rules could preemptively kick off immigrants who are unable to find a job, or keep up with the extra paperwork, to comply.
“It’s going to be disastrous,” said Jane Rapanganwa, program coordinator for the Refugee Dream Center, which hosts the weekly women’s class that helps prepare refugees like Hemid for their new lives in America. 
“A lot of our clients come from non English-speaking countries,” Rapanganwa said. “In order to get a job here, you need to be able to speak a basic level of English.”

Statewide consequences 
A new report by The Economic Progress Institute details the widespread financial and economic fallout of benefits cuts for Rhode Island, where nearly 15% of the state’s population are immigrants, contributing $1.8 billion in federal, state and local taxes as of 2023, according to the U.S. Census data.
Cutting off refugees and asylum seekers from federal food assistance will cost the state $5.5 million in annual benefits funding, in turn diminishing the money spent at local grocery stores and circulating through the state’s economy. Separate federal policy changes taking effect in 2026 limit tax credits available for taxpayers with children to only include those with Social Security numbers — an identification code only available to citizens and green card holders. Lawful immigrants who pay taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number will no longer be able to claim the credit for up to $2,200 per child on their 2026 tax returns, even if their children are citizens. This will sap $30.5 million from Rhode Island residents, and in turn, the state economy in its first year, according to the report.
The report’s author, Divya Nair, senior policy analyst for children and families for The Economic Progress Institute, likened the ramifications of immigrant benefit cuts to a snowball — rolling downward as it grows.
“Basically what this bill does is deepen inequities,” Nair said in an interview. “It’s going to reduce economic participation. Resources that used to go directly to the state will be left on the table. And the state has to create administrative systems to implement all of these changes.”
Meanwhile, local food pantries and community organizations are bracing for increased demand, while health care providers, especially hospitals, will be flooded by patients who no longer have insurance coverage.
And, it will only become harder, and take longer, for refugees, asylum seekers and other immigrants to integrate into the state economy without the programs that help them to transition.
“They are still paving their way, depending mainly on government support to get going,” Rapanganwa said.

The American Dream
English classes are just one of the services the Refugee Dream Center offers. There are also classes for digital and financial literacy, help finding a job, navigating the public transit system, and other life skills. Just as important is the center’s emphasis on community building, creating a place for those fleeing persecution and trauma to seek comfort and build relationships. 
The weekly women’s group that Hemid and Sakhizada attended, for example, might be the only socialization they have outside of their homes and with their immediate families, Rapanganwa said.
As they filter into the church parking lot on an overcast Thursday, the women exchange greetings and hugs before traipsing up the metal stairs tucked around the back. The mood in the small, second-floor gathering space is light as volunteer teacher Tracy Ahmadian leads the group through a series of games designed to practice their English.
It’s a much needed respite from a daily reality that for many, remains a struggle.
Leontine Makanjr, 65, has been plagued by mysterious back and chest pain, prompting multiple visits to Rhode Island Hospital to try and find out what’s wrong. Majanjr, who is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, hopes her next appointment will yield a diagnosis, and more importantly, a treatment plan.
But she doesn’t know how she will afford doctor’s appointments or medication without Medicaid, she says.










They are still paving their way, depending mainly on government support to get going.

Ibado Mohamed similarly has no backup plan for losing SNAP benefits. The 43-year-old Somali refugee gets paid through Medicaid to care for her younger brother, who has a disability and uses a wheelchair, she said. Yet she struggles to stretch her government income, supplemented by $300 in monthly SNAP benefits, to cover groceries, rent and utilities for the three-bedroom apartment where she lives with her brother and uncle. 
For Parisa Qaderi, an Afghan refugee, the bottom has already dropped out. Her husband died three months ago of a heart attack, her case worker, Noorulhaq Sadeqi, said.
Since then, the 25-year-old mom of two toddlers got a job at a West Warwick day care, earning just enough to kick her off of federal food assistance already.
Qaderi still gets a smaller federal food stipend through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Unlike SNAP and Medicaid, immigration status will not affect eligibility for WIC.
But it’s hard to make sense of what’s still available and for whom amid evolving federal mandates. 
“For our community members, they are feeling panicked, worried,” Sadeqi said. 
The new restrictions on SNAP did not initially spell out when asylum seekers and refugees will lose benefits. State administrators are still waiting for federal guidance on new Medicaid eligibility restrictions. The federal rescission package also pulls back government health insurance for legal, permanent immigrants who have had green cards for less than five years, but it’s unclear whether that extends to existing beneficiaries, or only new applicants.
The state report on federal policy changes highlights the “substantial public concern and confusion” already around eligibility, noting that it will increase calls to state agencies that administer Medicaid and food assistance, along with appeals for benefits being denied or terminated.
Hemid’s smile has been replaced by a panicked look as she stands in a narrow hallway just outside the women’s group class. Her head bowed toward Sakhizada, she begins brainstorming aloud in search of a solution to her looming SNAP cutoff.
Could she reduce her grocery list? Maybe.
More free food from the food pantry? Perhaps.  
A job? That seems impossible.
Her husband already works at a medical manufacturing facility. She stays home with her baby, she said through her friend as an interpreter.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A special election to fill the state Senate seat being vacated by Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi is expected to take place before the General Assembly convenes for its 2026 session in January, setting up a rapid-fire Democratic contest in a deep-blue district that spans parts of Richmond and Chesterfield County.
Hashmi, a Democrat first elected in 2019, won the lieutenant governorship earlier this month, leaving her 15th District seat open just one year into her second term. 
Under Virginia law, the highest-ranking member of the Senate — currently Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth — is responsible for calling a special election while the chamber is still in session. If lawmakers have adjourned, the responsibility shifts to the governor. 
Lucas did not respond to a request for comment.
Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Democrats are preparing to move quickly once a date is announced.
“We’re waiting on Senator Lucas to set a special election and then have something done swiftly,” Bagby told The Mercury Tuesday. “I feel good about our chances of winning the district, but we still have to run through the tape and do the work and not take it for granted.”
Bagby cautioned that Democrats have seen districts with strong general-election advantages become unexpectedly competitive when turnout is low. 
“You can’t just assume that you put a Democrat on the ballot and folks are just going to come and you’re going to get the same result as that previous general election,” he said. “It requires doing the work.”
 A heavily Democratic district

Senate District 15, which was redrawn ahead of the 2023 cycle, is one of the bluest seats in the state. 
According to the Virginia Public Access Project, it consistently backed Democratic candidates running for state and federal offices by comfortable margins in recent elections. The district is home to more than 133,000 registered voters, and its demographics and voting patterns make it a safe Democratic hold — at least on paper.
Ernest McGowen, a political science professor at the University of Richmond, said the district’s shifting demographics make it even harder for Republicans to compete than in previous cycles.
“That is going to be a hard seat to flip,” he said, noting that since the most recent redistricting “the district is more fully moving Democrat.”
McGowen pointed to the rapid diversification of south Richmond and northern Chesterfield — including more affluent Black households moving into northwest Chesterfield and fast-growing Latino communities in south Richmond — as trends that “will likely make it a solid hold.”
A special election, he added, could give Democrats “another enthusiasm boost” heading into the next cycle.
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, agreed that the district has become  “a solid Democratic seat” in recent cycles. 
“Looking at the past few elections, the district has gone for Democrats by 30 points. I don’t think the Republicans have a chance to grab the seat.”
Still, Richards said Republicans may participate even if the odds are long, arguing that the party needs to be visible everywhere if it hopes to rebuild statewide after their devastating statewide losses in the 2025 election. 
“Maybe they would take note of the Democratic strategy in the recent election, where the Dems ran in all 100 House of Delegates districts,” he said. “If the GOP wants to get back into the ring in Virginia, they need to do the same, run candidates even in places where they will likely lose. They need to rebuild their brand in Virginia ahead of 2026.”
As of Tuesday afternoon, no Republican has formally filed to run. The district’s 2023 GOP nominee Hayden Fisher — who lost to Hashmi 62–37% — said in an email that he was not seeking a rematch this year.
Over the weekend, some voters received a phone survey mentioning former Sen. Joe Morrissey as a possible independent candidate. 
Morrissey, who represented the old Senate District 16 until losing a Democratic primary in 2023, has made headlines in September for breaking ranks with his party by endorsing Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid. 
But when asked by the Virginia Mercury if he was considering the race, Morrissey replied via text that he has “no plans” to run.
 Two Democrats already in

Two sitting House members — Del. Debra Gardner, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond — have already announced campaigns, positioning themselves for what could be a short and intense primary.
Gardner, first elected to the House two years ago, said she plans to continue the work Hashmi began. 
“I want to thank Lt. Gov-Elect Hashmi for her service as our state senator,” Gardner said in a statement. She emphasized her background in advocacy and social services, adding: “I’ve spent my career serving Virginia families — from protecting survivors of abuse to fighting for fair wages and affordable health care.”
Before her stint in the House, Gardner spent seven years as a social worker before holding senior roles at the Commission on Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program and the Virginia Department of Corrections. She later oversaw several Richmond agencies under former Mayor Dwight C. Jones before founding D2G-Coaching, a firm focused on executive training and social work. In 2019, she narrowly lost a bid for the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors.
Gardner linked her Senate bid to the incoming Democratic administration that swept all three statewide races this year: “I’m excited to work with Gov.-elect (Abigail) Spanberger to move Virginia forward and protect our narrow Senate majority.”
Jones, who has served in the House since early 2024, highlighted his progressive record and his support from local elected officials. 
“I am eager to continue to provide strong, progressive, compassionate, energetic leadership to Chesterfield County and Richmond in the state Senate,” he said in a statement announcing his candidacy.
Prior to his election to the House of Delegates, Jones served on Richmond City Council from 2016 to 2023, including a term as council president, and became known for pushing changes to public safety and monument policy. 
He championed efforts to remove Confederate statues, backed limits on police use of force during the 2020 protests, and supported an examination of the Richmond Police Department’s budget. He also backed the city’s SPEED plan to address disparities in education, housing and health care. 
In his statement, Jones framed the 2025 election as a continuation of statewide momentum. 
“Election Night, Virginians spoke overwhelmingly that they are tired and frustrated with President Trump and Republican policies,” he said. He promised to focus on affordable housing, public school funding, health care access, gun violence prevention and small business development.
Because the special election date will come quickly, Democrats are preparing for a firehouse primary — a party-run election that typically takes place at a limited number of polling locations over a short window of time. Firehouse primaries are often used when legal deadlines or logistical constraints make a state-run primary impractical.
Special elections in Virginia often draw low turnout even in competitive districts, and the timing — likely early 2026, depending on when Hashmi formally steps down as senator — could limit participation further.

(Photo by Jim Morrison for the Virginia Mercury) Lawmakers are setting their priorities ahead of the next General Assembly session in January, which will begin days before a new governor takes office. As a new legislative era begins, climate issues are expected to take a front seat during debate in the coming year.
A joint committee focused on recurring flooding in Virginia met Tuesday to recommend ideas for legislation they believe can better aid the commonwealth with addressing flooding and helping  funds flow to resiliency projects. 
“Flooding is no longer a future threat, it is a present day challenge that can present itself on any given day,” said Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, D-Norfolk.
The city of Norfolk is in the middle of a major undertaking with the Army Corps of Engineers to build flood walls, levees, tidal gates, pump stations and elevating buildings to prevent rising sea levels from devastating city streets with floodwaters. It is a $2.6 billion project that will be built in phases through 2038 – based on estimations. 
The city and state are expected to split the cost share of the project. Members of the recurring flooding board want to establish a flood mitigation local nonfederal match fund to better distribute the cash to localities that have match obligations for projects.
“Currently, there is no mechanism in the commonwealth to participate directly in localities’ non-federal cost shares for federally funded coastal storm risk management projects,” Williams Graves said. “This leaves each locality, regardless of their size, or their financial ability to pursue one time appropriations session after session, after session.”
Awarding those funds in larger tranches rather than the smaller appropriations from the legislature requires a study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission be completed. The study will determine how much money the state should be putting up for these matches. The board made a motion to ask JLARC to bump up the study in their schedule to get it finished by 2027. 
Other legislation the board recommended for consideration in the upcoming legislative session include creating precipitation standards when it comes to designs of stormwater management facilities, culverts, bridges and other transportation infrastructure. The standards would be set by the State Water Control Board.
Another proposed bill looks to use materials dredged out of waterways to be repurposed for habitats, living shorelines and other resources. Currently the state designates the sediment from dredging as a waste.

“In some instances, we are taking dredged material and dumping on sleeping blue crabs out in the open water,” said Jay Ford, the Virginia policy manager for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “In other instances, we’re staging it. We recently have heard that some of the staging areas for this material may not be available (in the future).”
The board also recommended that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission establish a habitat policy oversight committee that can  aid the commission in policy decisions around coastal resilience. The oversight committee will have weighted input into the commission’s decisions about mitigation strategies, regulation changes to wetlands and habitats.
Williams Graves also recommended multiple budget amendments, with the caveat that she understands that the budget process will be restrictive next year and all of her requests may not be awarded. 
She suggested $50 million be put into the proposed flood mitigation for local nonfederal match funds. She also suggested an additional $200 million be put towards the community flood preparedness fund and to continue to invest in the local assistance fund for infrastructure improvements.
The recommended bills and budget amendments will need to be officially filed for the 2026 General Assembly session by delegates and senators by the beginning of session on Jan. 14.

Tucker High School in Henrico County on June 16, 2025. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Two former state education secretaries and multiple education experts have been appointed to serve on Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s transition team, tasked with preparing the new gubernatorial administration for the next four years.
The team was announced on Friday after Spanberger rolled out her “Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan” in August.
Former secretaries of education Jim Dyke, who served under former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder’s administration, and Anne Holton, under former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s administration, highlighted the list of appointments. 
“I am excited that we will have new leadership in education in Virginia from Governor-Elect Spanberger and her team,” Holton told the Mercury. “It is sorely needed, and I am honored to help with the transition in any way I can.”
Holton recently completed her term on the Virginia Board of Education, during which she frequently challenged Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration on education policy issues including overhauling the state’s accountability system. 
Dyke, who has known Spanberger since she ran for Congress, said he looks forward to sharing his expertise.
“I know what it’s like to have to transition into office and actually to govern, and to the extent I can … I’m looking forward to helping in any way that she thinks is appropriate,” Dyke said.
The list of education experts also includes Douglas Garcia, a former assistant secretary of education; Monica Logothetis, a former senior advisor to the U.S. Department of Education; Baron Braswell, a former school board member of Spotsylvania County Public Schools; and Deborah Frazier, the chief academic officer of Spotsylvania County Public Schools.
Spanberger has pledged her commitment to maintaining public funding for Virginia’s schools, enhancing the affordability and accessibility of higher education, and expanding opportunities for high school students to take college coursework.
This summer, Spanberger’s campaign said she would “make it a priority to give public schools the resources to explore best and promising practices through innovative career and technical education programs and work-based learning.”
Spanberger also expressed her views on balancing parental rights and children’s privacy during her August interview with the Mercury and said she supports more proactive information-sharing between schools, students and families that enhances safety without compromising students’ rights. She said that Virginia has the potential to lead in addressing communication barriers related to issues such as school overdose incidents and teacher arrests involving children.
Spanberger appoints energy policy transition team

The transition team, more broadly, is expected to prepare the way for the administration’s focus on “lowering costs, expanding economic opportunity, increasing business investment in Virginia’s economy, and creating a safer commonwealth for all Virginia families.”
The team also includes two professors connected to the University of Virginia: Yohannes Abraham, former executive director for the Biden-Harris transition team, former U.S. ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a visiting professor at UVA; and Chris Lu, former executive director for the Obama-Biden transition team, former U.S. deputy secretary of labor and James R. Schlesinger Distinguished Professor at U.Va.’s Miller Center.
“These Virginians not only bring together deep ties from across every region of our commonwealth, but the experience, integrity, and know-how required to deliver the pragmatic and principled leadership that Virginians overwhelmingly voted for this November,” Spanberger said in a statement on Friday. 
Spanberger’s inauguration will take place in Richmond on Jan. 17, days after the start of the 2026 General Assembly Session.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.
In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.
“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.
Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.
They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.










Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity.


– David Michel, a Democratic former Connecticut state representative


The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.
In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.
States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.
Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.
“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.
But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.











 “We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.


– U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin



“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”
Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.
“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.
Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.
Knowing where a target will be
Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.
Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.
“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.
In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.
“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”
An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.
Trump’s National Guard deployments raise worries about state sovereignty

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.
Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.
Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.
Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.
Trump administration court actions
But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.
The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.
New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.
U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.
“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.
The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
ICE arrests fell in August despite show of force in DC, Los Angeles

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.
In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”
Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.
Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses
Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.
Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.
“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.
Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”
Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.
“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.
Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.
“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A bill touted as making South Carolina’s abortion ban the strictest nationwide proved to be too extreme even for a panel packed with anti-abortion Republican legislators.
The proposal that received national attention over the last few months ultimately failed Tuesday with a 2-3 vote. Four of the panel’s six Republicans declined to vote on the bill itself, enabling the three Democrats to sink it.
A vote to outright reject a GOP-led bill is rare in the South Carolina Legislature. Usually, legislators choose to let legislation that lacks support quietly die at the subcommittee level by indefinitely delaying a vote — if there’s a hearing at all. But after a day-long public hearing last month and an hours-long meeting Tuesday didn’t sway the sponsor — who also happened to be the panel’s chairman — in at least changing sections opposed by some of the state’s most fervent abortion foes, the panel proceeded to an up-or-down vote.
And it showed the bill doesn’t stand a chance even among Republicans, said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg.
“We just think the vast, vast, vast majority of South Carolinians are against this,” he said.
Supporters could still try to revive the legislation after the Legislature returns in January. But the bill’s failure to advance through a subcommittee led by the sponsor, Sen. Richard Cash of Anderson County, likely means that would be futile. Even a co-sponsor on the panel couldn’t vote for it.
Dubbed the Unborn Child Protection Act, the bill would have banned abortions from the moment a pregnancy was medically detectable. (The odd wording was meant to avoid prohibiting emergency birth control or fertility treatments.)
All Republicans on the panel were generally OK with a near-total ban on abortion. And separate legislation that goes further than the state’s six-week ban that took effect in August 2023 could get traction next year.
But what went too far in Cash’s bill for most Republicans were sections that criminalized women for getting an abortion, removed all exceptions for victims of rape or incest, and made it illegal to even advise someone on how to get an abortion elsewhere.
Anti-abortion groups split over proposal that could make SC’s ban the strictest nationwide

Attempted changes
The bill would allow women to be sent to prison for up to 30 years for an abortion. It also would allow her own relatives to sue her.
That was too much even for a co-sponsoring Sen. Billy Garrett, who tried to delete that section. When his amendment failed 4-5, the Greenwood Republican proposed capping the punishment at two years in prison or a $1,000 fine, unless the woman who received the abortion agreed to testify in court against the person who performed it.
But that failed 4-4, with Cash noting his bill already gave women immunity from prosecution if they agreed to testify.
Garrett ultimately was among the four who didn’t vote.
“This world needs more love than hate,” he said. “This world needs more forgiveness than hate. And we’ve got to work toward that.”
Sen. Tom Fernandez spoke through tears about the possibility that his wife or one of his six daughters could end up imprisoned under the law.
“I cannot see women be put in jail,” said the Summerville Republican. “I can’t. If we’re going to sit here and continue to talk about women as if they were the worst creatures on earth, I might as well say that to all six of my girls.”
And yet, he was among the two Republicans who backed the bill in the final vote.
Taking out the punishment would “gut the bill,” Cash said. He contends the possibility of severe prison time or a potential lawsuit is needed to prevent women from getting abortion medication through the mail for an at-home abortion. That’s already illegal in South Carolina, though ordering the two pills online from out-of-state providers remains possible.
“How can you have a law that criminalizes some action and then say if you break the law, there’s no penalty?” Cash said. “It’s not even logical.”
Sen. Tom Corbin, R-Greenville, tried to remove a section making it illegal to even direct someone to a website providing information on getting an abortion.
Telling people what they can and can’t say would violate First Amendment free speech rights, Corbin said.
“It would break my heart if somebody tells somebody where to go get an abortion,” he said. “But I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of this country and this state, and I have a hard time supporting a bill with a section in it that basically says what you can and can’t talk to somebody about.”
Cash likened that section to laws against hiring a hitman to kill someone.
“You don’t have the right to provide information to someone on how to kill an innocent person,” Cash said.
Democrats voted against every amendment offered.
“We already have one of the strictest bills in the country, but to go any further is just an outright attack on women and doctors,” Hutto said. “You can’t make something bad better by voting for things, so we just voted against everything.”
Doctors would face 30 years in prison and loss of their medical license under the bill. Opponents contend doctors’ fear of the existing six-week ban already delays emergency medical care for women. Making doctors face a 30-year prison sentence will endanger women further, they testified.
“There are so many things in this bill that are flawed,” said Ronnie Sabb, D-Greeleyville.
Only one amendment passed, and it was Cash’s. It allowed someone to take a juvenile to another state for an abortion with parental permission. It also allowed doctors to refer patients to specialists in states where abortion is legal. And it removed a section requiring the resuscitation of premature stillborn babies after a doctor testified last month that doing so would be pointless and torturous.
Beyond Hutto and Sabb, the other Democrat voting “no” was Deon Tedder of Charleston. Beyond Garrett and Corbin, the other Republicans not voting were Jeff Zell of Sumter and Matt Leber of Johns Island.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0233-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

“This bill is about transparency and fairness,” said Robb Blasdel in a release announcing the bill. “Ohio parents should never be denied their lawful rights or face confusion about the exemption process.”
The bill also takes a cue from a federal effort, seeking to remove the hepatitis B vaccine requirement from the preschool regulations.
Children in child care, Head Start programs, and preschool are required to be vaccinated against 14 diseases, unless exempt: chicken pox (also called varicella), diphtheria, haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, pertussis, pneumonia, polio, rotavirus, rubella, and tetanus.

Ohio currently requires vaccinations for 10 diseases to attend K-12 schools: diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, pertussis, polio, rubella, tetanus, and chicken pox.
The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices mentioned hepatitis B as one immunization for which eligibility requirements may change on the national level.
Hepatitis B has also seen rising case levels in states like Florida, where mandates for the vaccine are being lifted.
While vaccination rates remain high in Ohio, the vaccination rate overall has dropped in recent years below the national average, particularly for kindergarteners.
Melissa Wervey Gittelman, CEO for the Ohio chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said the group has “a lot of concerns” about the new bill.
She and leaders in the group plan to engage with legislators about those concerns as the bill goes along in the legislative process.
Children’s medical decisions should ultimately be up to the parent, in consultation with their trusted medical professional, Gittelman said.
“What we often find is people are against (vaccinations) because they read something online,” she told the Capital Journal.
“But when they are able to talk to a medical professional, they change their minds because they hear the science behind it.”
Hepatitis B has been in the spotlight due to the advisory committee’s consideration of changing vaccination practices, but also because of political leaders like President Donald Trump giving incorrect statements on the vaccine and others expressing skepticism as to the need for children to receive the vaccine.
The CDC has recommended a hepatitis B vaccine for infants since 1991.
Ohio is one of 14 states that have laws allowing vaccine exemptions due to religious or conscientious reasons. Medical exemptions exist nationwide.
Under the new Ohio bill, schools would not be allowed to require additional documentation for students to be considered exempt from vaccine requirements, and no “specific exemption form” could be used.
The legislation would also bar schools from “excluding healthy, uninfected children” from attending school based on their vaccination status if they have a legal exemption, even during disease outbreaks.
Gittelman said not having the proper documentation could lead to confusion as to vaccination status of children, even if they’re fully vaccinated.
“We’ve seen it where children have the exemption form, but they actually have been vaccinated,” said Gittelman.
“When there is an outbreak, we don’t really know who is or who isn’t, and this bill doesn’t address that.”
Not allowing schools to remove unvaccinated children from a facility during an outbreak puts public health at risk, she said.
She pointed to the recent measles outbreak in New Albany as evidence that public health protocols that remove students who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status help keep children and the public safe.
“Those who haven’t had a second dose (of the measles vaccine), they gave that to them so they could be protected,” Gittelman said.
“Unvaccinated kids stayed out of the school for 21 days. Taking away our ability to do that puts many kids at risk.”
As Gittelman and other medical professionals talk with legislators while the bill is considered, she said the importance of having and engaging with a trusted physician will be a top message, because the vaccine discussion continues to be a political talking point.
“Vaccines have become really political, and I think that’s very unfortunate, because health shouldn’t be political,” Gittelman said.
The bill was assigned to the Ohio House Health Committee last week, but has not yet been scheduled for hearings.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe stalled Georgia case against President Donald Trump and more than a dozen allies accused of  trying to invalidate the results of the 2020 election was given new life last week. Or was it?
Peter Skandalakis, who was tasked with assigning the case to a different prosecutor following Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ dismissal by a top court, has decided to appoint himself to oversee what remains of the sprawling case.
Skandalakis, the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, highlighted the unusual nature of the case in his statement announcing his self-appointment.
“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” he said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment. Out of respect for their privacy and professional discretion, I will not identify those prosecutors or disclose their reasons for declining.”
Willis herself alluded to this “culture of fear” last month, warning that the national ramifications of the case and its outcome could make it difficult to find another prosecutor. “I think you have prosecutors, citizens and even judges who are afraid right now, and for good reason,” she told WSB-TV Channel 2. “The reality is it’s going to be hard to find a prosecutor that’s not afraid to prosecute that case when one of the primary defendants is threatening anyone that would dare to prosecute them.” She went on to argue that other district attorney offices may lack the resources and the staff to take on such a huge case.
Skandalakis, for his part, says there are still some parts of the case he needs to review. But he already has some familiarity with the matter. Willis was previously barred from bringing charges against Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, now a top Republican gubernatorial contender. A state senator at the time, Jones called for a special legislative session in the aftermath of Trump’s 2020 defeat and was one of the Republicans who participated in the alleged “fake elector” scheme. But a separate political conflict of interest resulted in Jones being severed off from any case brought by the Fulton DA.
Skandalakis would name himself to oversee the investigation into Jones after the lieutenant governor was listed as an unnamed co-conspirator. But he ultimately concluded that the case warranted no further action, saying that Jones was acting as an elected representative and not a criminal conspirator.
“Considering the facts, applicable law and the circumstances surrounding the events occurring in November and December of 2020 and January of 2021, I find the conduct and involvement of Sen. Jones as an elected representative to be reasonable and not criminal in nature,” Skandalakis said of Jones in 2024.
The appointment leaves Georgia as the only jurisdiction with an active criminal case against the president. He was convicted in Manhattan last year for falsifying business records, and the two federal cases against him were dismissed upon his return to the presidency.
We don’t know how Skandalakis will handle the case going forward. But if his exoneration of Burt Jones is any indication, the case is still skating on thin ice: There is simply no precedent for a state-level prosecution against a sitting president, and he wouldn’t be able to serve any prison time until the end of his term in office.
As for the remaining defendants and conspirators? Trump recently pardoned many of them, including Jones, for trying to overturn the president’s 2020 loss. But given that presidential pardons don’t apply to state prosecutions, the order was largely symbolic.
Now it’s all up to Skandalakis to decide when – or if – the case makes it before a jury. However, finding 12 impartial Georgians with no knowledge of the case to judge a sitting president’s staunchest allies may prove to be the steepest hill to climb.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC0364-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

(Photo by Allegra Boverman/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire lawmakers took a step closer to approving a financial rescue mechanism for the Claremont School District Tuesday. But first, they added a string of conditions.
In a 3-2 vote, the Senate Education Committee approved new caveats to proposed legislation to allow struggling school districts access to a revolving loan fund. Among them: a minimum interest rate, a requirement to submit to a state audit, and a provision allowing all parents in the district to obtain education freedom accounts even if otherwise not eligible. 
The committee approved the changes via an amendment to House Bill 292, a dormant bill that lawmakers are using as a vehicle to pass the bill. That proposal still needs to win over majorities in the House and Senate in January. 
Democrats on the committee objected to some changes to the loan fund Tuesday, including the EFA provision and the minimum interest rate, and voted against the amendment.
Claremont has been reeling from a budget hole that emerged in August, when an audit revealed that the district had $5 million less than it had budgeted for in March, due to major accounting and reimbursement errors. Faced with the possibility of closing the doors for the 2025-26 school year, the school board obtained a short-term, $4 million loan from Claremont Savings Bank that will last until April. But representatives of the district say they need more funding to get them to the start of the 2026-27 school year and a new budget.
Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Rick Ladd of Haverhill and Sen. Ruth Ward of Stoddard, have proposed a revolving loan program that would allow Claremont to receive 75% of its anticipated state adequacy payments for the 2026-27 school year early. 
That proposal first emerged as a last-minute bill amendment last month. House and Senate leaders have since met to negotiate details, and many of the changes adopted by the Senate Education Committee Tuesday were recommendations of Rep Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican and lead negotiator.
The latest version of the bill makes the revolving loan fund open to any school district facing a financial crisis, not just Claremont. That determination would be made by the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, the commissioner of the Department of Education, and the state treasurer.
Tuesday’s amendment would peg the interest rate due back to the state to the effective federal funds rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which on Tuesday was 3.88%. That replaces previous language that allowed the state treasurer to determine the interest rate.
The amended proposal would prevent a school district from drawing from the loan fund if it already had an existing line of credit. It would cap access to the loan fund to three consecutive school years, in order to prevent a district becoming reliant. 
It would require the district to agree to a financial and performance audit by the state’s Legislative Budget Assistance, the legislative branch office that typically audits state departments.
And it would require the district receiving the funding to ask voters whether they would like to impose a tax cap on future district budgets at the next available annual meeting. 
Under the latest amendment, the entire revolving fund would sunset by 2030.
Senate Republicans said the proposal adequately balanced the need to help Claremont schools stay open with the need for accountability and school choice.
But Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, objected to the language allowing the education freedom account access. 
And Sen. Suzanne Prentiss said pegging the interest rate to the federal reserve rate might be overly expensive for the district. The interest on Claremont School District’s loan from Claremont Savings Bank is about 1.75%.
Senate Republicans countered that the interest rate was to make sure the state did not lose money itself on the loans, and said the EFA option is important for families who may have been surprised and frustrated by the fiscal mismanagement and might want alternate options.
The amended bill will appear next on the Senate floor in early January. If it passes that chamber, it will then need a vote from the House. That could be complicated, as some House Republicans have expressed uneasiness or even opposition to the idea of the state extending a financial lifeline to a school district, citing a worrying precedent.
Speaking to the committee on behalf of Kofalt, Grant Bosse, the Senate deputy chief of staff, said Tuesday that the latest bill is meant to be a compromise that can bring lawmakers in both parties together.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/claremont-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

Yet Connecticut’s 211 service, often called Infoline, steered her toward income-dependent housing and child care, as well as nutrition and energy assistance.
Despite not receiving help from her daughter’s father, Slater kept her job, and within a few years — with some help from family — moved off assistance and met her future husband.
But the United Way of Connecticut, which contracts with the state to run the 211 service, struggles to aid hundreds of thousands more residents now than it did when Slater sought help in the late 2000s.
Further complicating matters, the 211 service, at first glance, is operating with the same state funding it received 15 years ago.

But once those dollars are adjusted for inflation, a key part of Connecticut’s social safety net has lost nearly 30% of its resources.
And officials fear vanishing federal aid for food, housing, heating and health care programs will push demand to unprecedented levels.
“It’s important to me that if people find themselves in these situations, those solutions [still] exist,” said Slater, now 46 and a member of the United Way of Middlesex’s governing board for the past eight years and a regular donor to the nonprofit. “I don’t need them anymore, but I know there are literally thousands of people in our state struggling.”
Inflation shrinks state aid even as demand swells
The 211 service responded to more than 1.7 million requests for help sent via phone or internet last fiscal year, up about 70% from pre-pandemic levels, as well as from the 2010 caseload.
Annual state funding for the program, which covers more than nine out of 10 of these requests, is slightly less than $3.7 million. But that funding barely has changed in a decade and a half, having stood at slightly more than $3.5 million in 2010.
Once adjusted for inflation, annual state support is down more than $1.6 million.
That’s the wrong trend for a service that must track hundreds of federal, state, municipal and private-sector human service programs, said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way in Connecticut.
“We are the connector, providing for people the path to what they need … and we play that role for all of the resources that we represent in Connecticut,” she said. “We make sure that government investments and the investments of our friends in philanthropy actually hit their intended mark.”
Whether the most complex state or federal benefit program changes its eligibility rules, or the smallest local clothing bank adjusts its hours, Infoline must maintain an up-to-date database, and staff must always be ready to give out detailed, accurate guidance.
“Sometimes a food pantry has moved across town, and they just haven’t updated their address” on websites or fliers, Bates said. “The last thing you want to do for someone in need is send them to the wrong location, at hours that it’s not open.”

Ronette Daniels of Stratford, an Infoline staffer for more than 10 years, said the job has become increasingly complex as a general sense of anxiety has grown among the public since 2020. “Post-COVID, I  think there’s been a change in general,” she said, adding that staff have tried to respond with compassion.
Front line staff, who generally earn between $50,000 and $62,000 per year, also undergo counseling training, not just updates on the latest changes to human services. The United Way’s 211 phone banks and central operations, housed in its office suite in Rocky Hill, include not only call centers and training areas but also rooms for staffers to decompress after particularly stressful calls.
Though requests for help with household and shelter were the single-largest type of inquiry received last fiscal year — about 36% of the more than $1.7 million total — mental health and addiction-related requests ranked second, representing more than 20%.
Most callers require solutions that involve a combination of services, Bates said, adding that emotional strain or trauma often is a component.
“The first thing they do is to validate how hard that must be, and to provide empathy and respect for the dignity of that person,” she added.
When she approached 211 for help, Slater said, she was distraught at the prospect of moving to southeastern Georgia, where her daughter would have attended one of the lowest-rated public school systems in the nation.
“The person on the other end of the phone was trained to make me feel comfortable and try and help me understand that, a), I wasn’t alone, and b), there were solutions.”
Food-related inquiries, which approached 180,000 or 10% last year, neared 117,000 after only about four months this fiscal year, spurred on by the federal government shutdown that stalled Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.
Infoline staff also routinely coordinate aid involving employment, health care, utilities, legal issues, clothing, transportation, child care and education.
CT officials expect many service providers to seek more funds
The state has grown funding for some specialized programs under the 211 umbrella.
A 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which didn’t exist 15 years ago, receives about $6.8 million annually from the state. And youth and housing crisis response services that collectively received about $510,000 then now get more than $2.9 million.
But the volume of cases handled by those three programs represent roughly 7% of the inquiries — whether they come in through email, phone or the website — directed to the Infoline service, Bates said. And she added limitations set in contracts with the state bar United Way officials from shifting resources from one program to another.
The core information and referral program, which had 32 front-line staff in 2010, now has just 17 and handles the remaining 93% of the inquiries.
Starting in 2017, Infoline had to begin offering callers the ability to request a call back, rather than wait on the phone. About 7% of callers chose that option last fiscal year. The service also tries to prioritize calls from pregnant women and others with special needs.
These trends sparked several appeals for more state funding from the United Way. And the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee has endorsed funding increases in some recent years, but those hikes haven’t made it into the final budget adopted by the full legislature and Gov. Ned Lamont.
And the entire $3.7 million budget for the core 211 information and referral program represents a tiny fraction of state government’s finances — about 1/65th of 1% of this year’s $24 billion General Fund and 1/5th of 1% of this fiscal year’s projected $1.8 billion surplus.

But Connecticut since 2017 has been following a series of aggressive budget caps that force large surpluses, which then have been used to build reserves and whittle down the state’s hefty pension debt.
Still, Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, and Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwomen of the Appropriations Committee, both praised the operations of the 211 service.
But while they didn’t rule out again recommending more funding, they also said their panel likely will face unprecedented calls for increased state dollars from across the spectrum of state, municipal, and private nonprofit social service providers.
Those same cuts in federal funding on nutrition assistance, heating aid, health care and other programs that are straining Infoline are placing unprecedented pressure on other programs as well.
“People are panicking,” Walker said. “It’s their food, their housing, their health care that are being attacked. … I don’t know if we can cover 100%.”
“I think we’re going to hear from everybody,” Osten added.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that the administration is reviewing funding requests from many human service providers. When Lamont recommends his budget for the 2026-27 fiscal year on Feb. 4 to the legislature, Collibee added, the package “will safeguard essential safety nets and fulfill his commitment to increasing affordability for all residents.”
Slater, who began donating to support the 211 service even before she stopped needing public assistance programs, said state officials view the program as an economic investment, even if they don’t feel a moral obligation toward it.
“It was important to me to put it back,” she said of her donations, adding it was done partly from gratitude and partly to challenge negative perceptions.
“I think our society has really stigmatized being poor as bad choices that you make. You make bad choices, and that’s how you’re poor,” she said.
But Slater added her experience with 211 showed her life simply presents difficult challenges at times and that she could be successful.
“I just don’t think that people understand that life just happens. And you can try and make the best choices that are in front of you.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1112_SR_Infoline_037-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)An Ohio senator wants to place new limits on the scope and duration of post-employment noncompete contracts for certain health care workers.
The agreements are commonplace in several industries, but state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, says they can be particularly onerous in the health care field.
In January of 2023, the Federal Trade Commission introduced a proposed rule banning all noncompete contracts nationwide.
Commissioners issued the final rule in April last year and courts put it on hold that August.
Two months ago, the Trump administration Federal Trade Commission formally announced it was abandoning the rule.
In committee, Johnson explained he was working on a bill limiting noncompete contracts for physicians before the federal commission acted.
“It’s apparent to me that the only way to resolve the situation regarding our health care workers will not be from the federal government, but at the state level,” he said.
The FTC wants to ban noncompete contracts, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan wants to block that effort

The proposal, Ohio Senate Bill 301, limits noncompete contracts to six months and 15 miles.
Those protections apply to physicians, physician assistants, and advanced practice registered nurses working at nonprofit hospitals.
“Noncompete agreements are inherently anti free-enterprise and impede an individual’s ability to earn a living as he or she so chooses,” Johnson said.
“In fact, it’s not uncommon for some of these restrictive employment clauses to stipulate a radius of up to 50 miles. The most onerous I’ve seen in the state of Ohio is 70 miles.”
Johnson’s bill also specifies that the 15-mile radius only applies to the physical location where a worker is employed.
“If you have a large health care organization that has places all over Ohio, well, every place they have, that restricted covenant applies to,” Johnson said. “So, you can’t practice in Ohio anymore.”
Johnson stressed that his proposal “strikes a fine middle ground” — maintaining hospitals’ ability to impose some staffing restrictions but placing limits on their extent.
Thirty-four other states, he noted, have approved some kind of noncompete limitation in their state laws.
Three neighboring states, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Kentucky, have noncompete restrictions aimed specifically at the medical field.
With FTC rule blocked, Ohio senators propose state-level noncompete ban

State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, welcomed the idea, but asked why Johnson didn’t go further.
Why not include all nurses or for-profit hospitals, he asked.
“Because I do agree with you,” DeMora said, “that especially in these rural communities, you get a noncompete, and you’d have to move all the way out of move out of town, 60 miles away, or you’re stuck working a job you don’t want to work at.”
Johnson agreed that noncompete agreements can create “a terrible situation” for workers who have to uproot their life to change jobs but didn’t embrace a more broadly written bill.
He explained the current bill is already an expansion on an earlier version that only applied to physicians.
“You know, certainly someone could come up with a bill like that,” he told DeMora, “and and I might even support it, but I’m limiting this to professionals.”
Someone could write a more expansive bill — DeMora himself, for instance.
Ohio Senate Bill 11, a measure he’s co-sponsoring with state Sen. Louis Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., would prohibit all noncompete contracts going forward.
That measure is currently stuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee and hasn’t had a hearing since March of this year.

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)In an effort to provide speedy relief for children experiencing discrimination in schools, the Maine Human Rights Commission sued five districts that recently adopted policies that restrict transgender students’ access to athletics, bathrooms and locker rooms.
The quasi-independent state agency told Maine Morning Star in an interview on Tuesday that given the growing number of districts that have approved such policies, filing a lawsuit is the fastest, most transparent way to ensure that schools do not impose rules that discriminate against students based on gender identity. 
The lawsuit against the school districts, first reported on by the Bangor Daily News on Monday, is the first time in recent history that the commission has chosen this course of action. Typically, the commission addresses violations of the Maine Human Rights Act, which has barred discrimination based on gender identity for two decades, through investigations following complaints of alleged discrimination.
“Given how widespread and how fast moving this has been, and what seemed like an increase in the pace of of school boards adopting these policies or considering these policies, it seemed like initiating an investigation within the commission’s investigative process was just was not going to be an efficient way to to deal with this issue,” said Executive Director Kit Thompson Crossman.
The investigation process can take up to two years, and has to remain confidential, Thompson Crossman said. That lengthy process would not address the immediate rights and needs of trans and gender non-conforming students facing discrimination in schools, they said. By filing a lawsuit, the commission is asking the courts to promptly weigh in and require the five districts to repeal their anti-trans policies and implement rules compliant with Maine law.
The lawsuit names five small, rural districts: MSAD 70 in Hodgdon, RSU 24 in Sullivan, RSU 73 in Livermore Falls, and the Baileyville and Richmond school districts.

– Maine Human Rights Commission Executive Director Kit Thompson Crossman


The consequences of these districts’ actions extend beyond creating a hostile environment for their gender nonconforming or trans students, according to the legal filing. It argues that other districts “cannot be assured that they will be protected from unlawful discrimination when they participate in athletic competitions against school districts which have adopted policies requiring students to participate on teams corresponding with their biological sex.”
The commission has received reports of adults threatening students “who do not appear biologically female,” according to the lawsuit, filed by commission lawyers Barbara Archer Hirsch and Collin Hurd.
Trans students are also concerned for their safety and may not file complaints for fear of retaliation, according to the commission, which has testified before several school boards against the policies.
“The harm created by these policies begins as soon as they’re adopted by intimidating transgender students, making them feel unwelcome and unsafe in their public school, which they are required by law to attend,” the lawsuit states.
Given the far-reaching impacts of these policies, the commission is also arguing that “Piecemeal resolution would waste commission and court resources, while a single assessment of the requirements of the Maine Human Rights Act would allow immediate and statewide resolution of this issue.”
Advocates from Maine Women’s Lobby and Equality Maine applauded the commission’s decision Tuesday. There are currently at least eight Maine districts that have passed anti-trans policies with more weighing changes, following a national movement driven by the Trump administration to exclude trans people from athletics, school facilities and gender-affirming care.
As a result, parents are afraid to send their trans or gender nonconforming children to school because they’re worried about discrimination or bullying, said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine.
“The fact that these districts have gone their own way and gone rogue, I don’t know when this has ever happened before,” Drew said. “All kids should feel safe and welcoming and should be treated fairly in school, and that’s what our law says, and that’s what the courts say.”
Both Thompson Crossman and Maine Women’s Lobby Executive Director Destie Hohman Sprague said the fact that the lawsuit was initiated should come as a comfort to families that are worried about their children being unlawfully discriminated against. 
“I hope that they see this act by the commission as the protection that they deserve,” Hohman Sprague said. “Someone needs to have their back.

Some of the most heinous crimes have the most vulnerable victims.
“I’ve responded to child sexual abuse victims at 2 a.m. in the hospital,” said Emily Gemar, with the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence. “I’ve held their hand throughout the night.”
Thousands of kids in Ohio are sexually abused per year, she said. State data shows the majority of all reported sexual assaults happened to children under 18.
But many cases go unreported, Gemar said.
“It takes some time to build trust with that counselor, that mental health provider, to allow for a setting where somebody feels like they can disclose what’s happened to them,” she said.
And she was thrilled when Gov. Mike DeWine expanded his crisis mental health program. When a child calls the 9-8-8 hotline, they get emergency access to support — free of charge.
The program also lets teens 14 and older get temporary help, including six weeks of counseling, without consent from a parent or guardian.
Gemar said that’s important in sex abuse cases.
“We know that anywhere from 35% to 93% of child victims, one, knew their perpetrator, and, two, that perpetrator was a parent or caregiver,” she said.
But grandfather and conservative activist John Stover said the program keeps families in the dark.
“There is no situation whereby a parent should not be notified that their 14-year-old is dealing with mental health issues,” Stover, who runs the organization Ohio Value Voters, said.
Some Republican state lawmakers agree with him.
Ohio House Bill 172, sponsored by state Rep. Johnathan Newman, R-Troy, would require parental approval for minors to get the temporary support. It repeals the current state law allowing for this care.
“We should all want to see students who suffer with mental health struggles receive the help they need,” Newman wrote in his testimony for the bill’s first hearing.
“This bill seeks to do that, maintaining that the students’ parents cannot be left out of the picture because the parents are the child’s authority and most important and essential part of the student’s recovery.”
His bill is meant to mirror language from the last General Assembly’s H.B. 8, legislation requiring schools to notify parents if the child identifies as LGBTQ+ or has a mental health issue.
“You cannot have two unique programs where parents are notified under one circumstance if it’s in the school, and they’re not notified if it’s another circumstance outside the school,” Stover said.
Stover said the bill wouldn’t stop abusers from being caught. He said mandatory reporting requirements would go into effect — mental health professionals would have to tell police, who would then investigate the parents.
“There is no argument there,” Stover said.
But Gemar warns cases don’t always work like that.
“If a 14-year-old is being raped by a parent, they would have to ask the parent who is raping them for consent to go see a clinician,” Gemar said.
“There could be punishment, there could be threats or more physical or sexual abuse that occurs because of that.”
If the bill becomes law, she said, that is a door closed for teens to be able to safely seek help.
The Ohio Domestic Violence Network is expected to testify against the legislation, along with Gemar, this week.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)When the words “the government says no” come out of the mouth of your child’s health care provider, it feels surreal.
Even though I have watched society devolve in real time, it is still a mystery to me as to why some humans feel such authority over others.
“The government no longer allows your child’s right to hormone therapy. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do.”
Watching the light drain from my child’s eyes, the fear washing over her face and then mine as her doctor broke the news. She followed that with the fact she was leaving Kansas to practice in a more welcoming state come August. Tyranny affects everyone in the end.
This is the consequence of actions taken by our elected officials. This past session, the Kansas Legislature passed Senate Bill 63, a gender-affirming care ban for LGBTQ+ minors. This bill, pushed by the Kansas Republican Party, effectively banned puberty blockers and hormones for minors, implicated the social transitioning of minors and threatens the licenses of medical providers.
An ER doctor in a rural Kansas community recently asked me: “How did everything work with her transition? How did the surgeries go?”
I thought, “Surgeries? How can a medical doctor be so ignorant of the process of transitioning?”
I had to explain that children do not have surgeries. You have to be grown and pass a psych evaluation for that type of surgery. The misinformation has crept into the most sensitive places when medical professionals become disillusioned by political gab. Misinformation and disinformation play a huge role in anti-trans legislation and policy we see popping up across the country.
In our state, flawed and disproven studies around efficacy and standards were used to justify SB 63. While this rhetoric plays a clear role in partisan politics, to see it seep into the perceptions of everyday Kansans is a travesty.
The ER doctor followed up, “What step is your teen on?”
None. Because Kansas has made it a crime to treat her.
What does treatment for my child mean? Hormone blockers. A delay in puberty that can be reversed. As she ages, and if she is physically and emotionally ready for more of a transition, she can start doing hormone therapy. Or she could have. That decision was taken from her, her endocrinologist and her parents when the Kansas Legislature overrode Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto.
The Legislature singled out a marginalized minority in this state and put a target on their foreheads.
The majority of Americans do not hate trans humans. The majority do not appreciate them being dehumanized. The majority of Americans do not find it necessary to erase the trans population. According to a 2017 poll by the Williams Institute, 67% of respondents from Kansas said they supported laws that would protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, housing and public accommodations.
Taking the “T” out of LGBTQ+ and making trans people hide in the shadows does not erase these beautiful humans, young or old. Those who harm will be remembered for their cruelty and their opposition to inclusion and freedom.
You see, the goal has never been “small government.” The goal has been control, sound bites, false outrage, lies, misinformation, half-truths and malicious intent. This is in step with many Republicans’ patriarchal approach to women’s rights, trans rights, LGBTQ+ rights in general and the rights of every dark-complected human in the states and abroad.
What’s the fight now? Freedom. Freedom for the largest number of human beings. That’s why we hit the streets and share the message of liberty and equality. That is why we hold town halls, why we meet to resist oppression wherever it rears its head. It’s why we speak up and hold the politicians who vote against our freedoms accountable for their votes, words and tone.
According to the UCLA Williams Institute, the LGBTQ+ community makes up 3.3% of the Kansas population, and 33% of that 3.3% are children.
That accounts for 1% of our entire population. That is the whole pie, not just the “T.”
Our government has attacked a marginalized population, taken their voices away by threat. It is our job as community organizers to provide sanctuary to those most affected and stand together to tell our government we will not tolerate the hate campaigns, and we will not exclude these instrumental Kansans from the rights we all hold dear as Americans.

Are you pleased with the way your politicians are “serving” you?
Are you happy you kept politicians in charge of redistricting?
Do you like them mocking you and spitting on your intelligence with more, flagrant gerrymandering?
Do you appreciate political hacks looking down on you as gullible rubes, easily confused and manipulated?
Are you thrilled to be forced, once again, to go to the polls next year and solemnly cast ballots in state and federal legislative races where nearly every outcome is predetermined?
After politicians yoked Ohio voters with partisan gerrymandering for the first half of the decade, they’ve now graciously shackled us with bipartisan gerrymandering for the second half.
In 2026, voters will decide elections in 99 Ohio House districts. Four or five might be competitive. The others will not.
In 2026, voters will decide elections in 17 Ohio Senate districts. One or two might be competitive. The others will not.
In 2026, Ohio voters will decide elections in 15 U.S. House districts. Two might be competitive. The others will not.
That’s 131 races. Seven to 10 might be competitive, being very generous.
The others will not.
That’s pathetic.
It’s a disgrace.
So, tell me.
Are you happy that your vote has been rendered a joke by bad faith politicians only looking out for themselves?
Are you pleased to see all the lip service we pay in America to liberty, to freedom, to free and fair elections, stomped out under the dirty boot of power-mad politicians?
Are these your heroes, these politicians?
Plying you with condescending platitudes?
So enveloped in the putrid miasma of their own flatulent self-importance and lust for power that they’ve abdicated all public responsibility?
So debased that they’ve untethered from basic ethics, honor, logic, and often reality itself?
So lost, they can’t recognize their own debasement?
So sociopathic, so indignant in their own boiling arrogance, they forever play like they’re the victims?
Or wait, I’m sorry, I must not understand…
Are we all supposed to pretend this is normal?
Are we supposed to believe that these people exhibiting this appalling display are our great and noble leaders, the standard-bearers of our society, foisting openly cheated maps on voters?
Are we supposed to pretend this is acceptable?
That these are not frauds and charlatans peddling poisonous political gamesmanship staked on the lives and well-being of American families?
Are we supposed to provide them political cover to be their worst selves?
Are we supposed to pretend we are not not degrading ourselves by continually allowing and excusing their abominable conduct?
Is this what nearly 75% of Ohio voters wanted in 2018 when they told politicians to stop gerrymandering?
Making a joke of public transparency and feedback?
Making a precedent of political extortion?
Making backroom deals that boon political machines and boondoggle the people?
Politicians dripping deceit, proclaiming the process worked?
Because by hook, all the politicians played in the mud together?
Rubbed dirt in their own faces and in the faces of Ohio voters?
Partisan judges poised if necessary to do the same.
Shall we give them all a pass?
Shall we excuse their atrocious acts?
As though the fate of any republic does not precariously balance at tipping point on its embrace or rejection of public virtue?
Shall we weakly, meekly call it “politics as usual” and abdicate our own responsibility? Our responsibility to ourselves? Our responsibility to the future?
Shall we fail to hold any of these politicians accountable for anything, ever?
Shall we just let them continue to run us over?
As long as they slap on that party label, to do whatever they want, no matter what they do?
Do we think that will turn out well for us?
Do we think that it has?

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Every November 19th is a big day here in Gettysburg as we observe Dedication Day. 
This is a series of events preceded by the Remembrance Day Parade the Saturday before, and including Wednesday’s wreath-laying ritual, Naturalization ceremony, keynote speaker, recitation of the Gettysburg Address, and lighting of luminaria, culminating with the Gettysburg College Fortenbaugh Lecture at the Majestic Theater in the evening.  
All of this is a much-anticipated and beloved annual slate of events commemorating the consecration of the Gettysburg National Cemetery here and especially celebrating Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, in which he challenged his listeners to honor the courageous dead of that battle by completing their “unfinished work.”

I hope that readers finish that work by honoring the courageous living veterans who find themselves embattled by hunger, homelessness, and other pressing needs.
 Unfortunately, that battle has gotten a whole lot harder in recent weeks, as veterans were hit particularly hard by the recent federal government shutdown. 
Moreover, it is vital to note that the stalemate in Congress concerning extensions of the tax credits associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly called Obamacare, has direct ramifications for veterans. Non-senior veterans who rely on the enhanced premium tax credits held hostage by the shutdown may find themselves without health care if these credits are not extended. 
Indeed, more than a quarter million might lose their healthcare coverage. Of course, some vets receive their healthcare through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Readers should know, though, that VA benefit “eligibility is limited to certain priority groups, including veterans with low incomes or who have service-connected disabilities, and VA services can be inaccessible for those who do not live near VA facilities. 
As a result, subsidized coverage through Medicaid and Marketplaces plays an important role in coverage for nonelderly veterans.”
It is clear, then, that issues concerning veteran healthcare were actually at the very core of the recent government closure, and this is the major sticking point not directly addressed by the deal to end the shutdown. A vote on this issue is supposed to come in December, and the results of that vote will have an outsized impact upon veterans.
In addition, with Thanksgiving right around the corner, it’s particularly heartbreaking to realize that an even more pressing crisis is hunger, which also affects veterans in disproportionate numbers. Even before the shutdown the wolf was already at the door of the households of many Vets, as some 1.2 million veterans nationwide rely upon Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP benefits).










This Dedication Day, let us follow the charge of President Abraham Lincoln by fighting the battle still before us, offering “increased devotion” to those veterans among us.


About 60,000 of these live in Pennsylvania, which is about 9% of our local veteran population. In Pennsylvania in particular, food insecurity is “an ongoing battle for many” veterans, especially because the recent shutdown made it clear that SNAP benefits have become just another ante in the high-stakes game of hold ‘em that Washington politicians continue to play with other folks’ lives.
There is some short-term good news on this front for Pennsylvanians, however. On the last day of October, “Governor Josh Shapiro announced new state-led efforts to support Pennsylvania’s charitable food network and the two million Pennsylvanians who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). He channeled $5 million to Feeding Pennsylvania in order to expedite distribution through that organization’s“network of food banks throughout the state.”
In addition, the commonwealth provides emergency financial assistance to Veterans in need through the Veterans Temporary Assistance (VTA) Program, funded by donations.” Such assistance is vital because veterans are disproportionately at risk for a range of challenges, and are much more likely to find themselves homeless than are members of the general population.

Veterans often face such challenges in no small part as a result of their service.
Falling as it does the week after Veteran’s Day, Dedication Day offers a perfect opportunity not simply to glorify the heroes of the past, but to embrace and to offer solace to the living who have served their country with honor but have fallen upon hard times.
This Dedication Day, let us follow the charge of President Abraham Lincoln by fighting the battle still before us, offering “increased devotion” to those veterans among us. 
Let us seek out those in need and offer them support in terms of food and shelter and other necessities. 
Moreover, let us be, in Lincoln’s words, “dedicated to the great task remaining before us,” and find ways to address the health care crisis facing veterans and others in the short term and to provide better services for hungry and homeless veterans in the long term.

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)In 2018, immigration lawyer Jacob Sapochnick noticed that a massive influx of overseas social media influencers were trying to obtain a highly exclusive visa reserved for wealthy and influential immigrants or those with artistic talents.
But it wouldn’t be until 2020 that Sapochnick, based in San Diego, was contacted by an OnlyFans model who hoped to secure an O-1B visa. At first, he was skeptical. 
Then he saw her monthly salary.
“She said, ‘Let me show you the backend of my platform.’ I looked, and she was making $250,000 a month,” Sapochnick told the Florida Phoenix in a zoom interview. 
“I was like, oh my god. Okay. I can use that.”
Learning that she was also involved in fitness influencing, he took her case. She became Sapochnick’s first OnlyFans client to obtain the O-1B visa. In the next two years, Sapochnick represented influencers from places like China, Russia, and Canada — many of whom were fitness influencers “dabbling” in OnlyFans.
Sapochnick’s story isn’t unique — at least, not anymore. According to five other immigration lawyers across the country who spoke with the Phoenix, the immigration sphere began to slowly shift toward the digital world a decade ago before exploding after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The O-1B visa was initially created in 1990 for acclaimed actors, musicians, performers, and other artistic professionals who continue to reap the lion’s share. But many of the lawyers specializing in these visas told the Phoenix that close to half (and up to 65%, in one lawyer’s case) of their clients are immigrants with massive platforms on TikTok, Youtube, or Instagram.
Of note, not all of them work with OnlyFans creators. In fact, those who did noted that the number of OnlyFans workers successfully obtaining these visas has largely declined since 2022 because that market has become “over-saturated,” with more women on the platform and pornography viewers instead turning to AI-generated porn.
OnlyFans, founded in 2016 but popularized during Covid, is a platform where subscribers can pay a fee to view or request content including sexually explicit images and videos from creators.
These little-reported statistics come amid a sweeping, nationwide crackdown on both illegal immigration under President Donald Trump and a growing movement on the right to make legal immigration more difficult. 
That push was strengthened when Trump imposed a $100,000 fee for companies hiring foreigners on certain specialty work visas, and fortified by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call on universities to stop accepting these visas, called H-1Bs.
 What about the O-1B visa?

O-1Bs are considered one of the more exclusive visas. They’re specifically designed for immigrants with “extraordinary” talents, and people in the hunt for them need to check off at least three of six boxes. They can be renewed every three years.
These include starring in distinguished productions, national recognition, performing a lead role for distinguished organizations, a record of major commercial or acclaimed success, significant recognition from experts, or a high salary.
Many of these can be accomplished through expensive brand deals, high follower count, high engagement rates, and collaborating with other influencers. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy.
“Not everyone’s an O1, and that’s OK. If you’re just great at your job — you’re not an O1,” said Rishi Oza, a 20-year immigration law veteran and partner at the North Carolina branch of Brown Immigration. 
He explained that obtaining an O1 visa, whether it’s O-1B or O-1A — used by athletes, scientists, and business workers — is incredibly difficult, and they only go to those who stand out from others in their field in their home country.
“If there’s a woman with a masters in biostatistics at Yale with six years’ experience but no awards or reports, she’s not an O1,” Oza said. However, “It wouldn’t surprise me to see a dramatic uptick in online personalities applying for O-1Bs. There isn’t a visa for a digital online personality. 
“Inherently, you get forced into the O1 category.”
According to data on the State Department’s website, the U.S. issued 125,351 O1 visas between 2017 and 2024, the latest data available. Unfortunately, the department does not distinguish how many of those are O-1A versus O-1B visas, nor what professions they’re used for.
What is clear: Issuance of O1 visas has steadily increased year-over-year since 2000 — the earliest data provided on the department’s website, with minor fluctuations. The massive exception was 2020 and 2021, when COVID restrictions caused O1 issuance to plummet to 2007-2011 levels.
 Not all are successful

Sapochnick told the Phoenix that fitness influencers often cross over into the OnlyFans world, usually using Instagram as a “front gate” to their porn accounts.
“People will follow them [on Instagram] and they just show a little bit. Then they’ll have a link to their OnlyFans, and there, people will engage with them more,” Sapochnick said. 
He told the story of a Canadian woman he worked with who had more than 2 million followers on Instagram and was making “a lot” of money on OnlyFans. She used that wealth to start a fitness company, began helping brands contact other influencers, and created a program to help women lose weight.
By then, she’d created enough jobs and proved herself enough of an entrepreneur to qualify for a green card.
But not all are success stories. As an example, a Singaporean influencer asked Sapochnick for help with an O-1B visa application, but he told her she didn’t have enough traction online. 
“That’s fine,” she told him. “I’m just gonna keep doing my OnlyFans and when I’m ready, I’ll come back.”  
She was making $6,000 to $8,000 a month.
Careful regulation?
Although Elizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Immigration Studies and a former senior adviser at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, believes influencers can qualify for O-1B visas under existing law, she also believes policymakers should “carefully regulate” how these petitions are reviewed.
USCIS, the agency in charge of determining whether immigrants are eligible for visas, lets applicants submit “comparable evidence” of extraordinary ability when their field doesn’t neatly fit the criteria.
“The risk, therefore, is that immigration officers treat evidence — such as a decent social media following, some press or brand collaborations, perhaps — as evidence that the beneficiary is ‘outstanding, leading or renowned’ when I think the average media-literate American would understand that these types of achievements a[re] merely evidence of simply above-average talent, given the enormous volume of influencers/digital content creators out there in 2025,” Jacobs said in a written statement.
She added that Congress could tighten the statute by excluding digital creators or adult entertainers, setting a cap and ranking system, or redefining what counts as “extraordinary” in digital fields. Lawmakers could also “re-anchor” eligibility exclusively to awards by professionals or cultural institutions, barring the use of “comparable evidence” altogether.
USCIS did not respond to a request for comment on whether it keeps data on which professions it’s granting O-1B visas to.
 ‘Social media is the new generation’

Other immigration lawyers who spoke with the Phoenix, including Beverly Hills attorney Eli Kantor, his son Jonathan, Miami lawyer Joe Bovino, and New York attorney Michael Wildes, had similar messaging on social media and immigration:
The times are changing.
“It’s always changing. Traditionally, it was actors and actresses but, with the advent of social media, you started getting people who were both — even people who do OnlyFans,” said Kantor, who’s been practicing since 1976. He’s worked with three OnlyFans models in the past three years.
Most of his clients seeking O-1B visas are young aspiring actresses or models, often with brand partnerships with companies like Nike. Kantor often recommends they make appearances at influencer events like the Kentucky Derby or work with additional brands to expedite the green card process.
Bovino, who’s worked in immigration law for “decades,” said his clients are largely young women. He began to focus on the social media sphere after COVID, when he saw the potential for big business. He stressed that he has not worked with any OnlyFans creators.
“It’s not just cat videos anymore [online], it’s social media influencers making lots of money,” Bovino said, estimating that as many as 60% to 65% of his clients seeking O-1B visas are content creators.
 “And if you can make money there, suddenly it becomes a basis for a potential visa application.”
Wildes, whose long-standing immigration firm was founded by his father, who represented John Lennon in his visa application, said his firm works with “tons of social media influencers” and has been “very successful” with OnlyFans models.
“Though my wife doesn’t really approve,” Wildes joked. He said his company has dozens of them in the queue, although he noted it’s important for them to branch out past OnlyFans to eventually obtain a green card.
“If they just have a lot of money and they’re very sexy, it’s not gonna cut it,” he said. 
“Social media is the new generation.”

The first train arrived in Stamford almost two centuries ago and still today we ride these same trains that connect us deeper into New England and New York City. From wealthy businesspeople to blue collar workers, we all share one space in common: transit.
With the most expensive high school in New England history, we have another expensive infrastructure project under planning for our city. The Stamford Transportation Center Master Plan may improve our downtown transit center; but it is not the solution to the problem this city faces.
Like many cities in the U.S., our city has a car dependency problem and unlike many other U.S. cities, Connecticut cities have the potential for the most expansive transit networks in the United States. Our urban planning has been kept mostly intact below the Bulls Head intersection and there is massive potential for us to get back to our times of transit glory.
The Stamford streetcar network was one of the most expansive in all of New England when it started rolling back in 1894. It connected up and down Route 1 to Norwalk and Greenwich, throughout Glenbrook and Springdale, up the historic Bedford Street and past Washington Boulevard. It made our city accessible, not just for the few but for all. Everyone loves to talk about traffic on our streets, but no one wants to talk about the real solution: public transportation.
The Connecticut Department of Transportation and lawmakers in Hartford provide CT Transit with the money to do the bare minimum in our cities. Even with a recent federal grant providing brand new electric buses it hasn’t changed the fact that the frequencies are not often enough, the routes don’t cover every part of our city, there are not enough dedicated busways, there are no orbital connectors, they don’t run late enough, and have loop routes on weekends and evenings. 
Hundreds if not thousands of commuters in our city drive right past a bus station every morning on their way to work or the train, perhaps even passing the exact bus that is already going where they are going. These buses are nice, but there has not been enough of a push to make people aware of our transit system and that is not the fault of the residents; it is the fault of our city government and CDOT.

While our city government has made a push to make biking in our city safer, they have forgotten about the one form of transportation that is truly accessible to all: the bus and rail. Since our former Mayor Dannel Malloy was making a push to be the Transportation Secretary during the 2016 Clinton Campaign not one lawmaker has brought up the subject of transportation in any serious capacity. The 2010 planning for streetcar network rebuilding in Stamford and New Haven has been all but forgotten and, in a period where the federal government has been hesitant in its transit spending and the state has been lacking true innovation and out-of-the-box thinking, it must be noted that a time for real change is needed.
While our governor has done an excellent job controlling many issues that our state faced eight years ago, such as the state pension debt, there must be a new push to address the problems we have now as well. Stamford, New Haven, Bridgeport, and Hartford will struggle with growth if we do not push for higher spending on transit projects and operations. 
People in power must begin to think about a new future for transit in Connecticut or it will be a dark future for our state’s biggest cities and suburbs. The glory days may be behind us although much of the work has already been done to show that it is possible to get more people on transit. Unless the urban planners in Hartford want to have a new push for streetcars or even just an orbital bus system that is not only hub and spoke they will not help enough people, not now, and not ever.
It is time the politicians come to realize that ridership does not indicate your budget like we have seen with the current trickle flow of funding towards Shore Line East , instead to quote a great movie about the American Pastime “If you build it, they will come.”

On a Monday afternoon last month, 15,000 people lost power, with winds reaching up to 48 mph in Groton and Bridgeport. Trees fell on roads and power lines, heavy rain flooded parts of the state. 
Where I live in Willimantic, the lights stayed on, but the scale of the damage elsewhere reminded me of the flooding and extreme weather I faced growing up in Bangladesh. Even in a completely different economic and geographical setting, the effects of climate change are evident, and the same challenges with infrastructure struggling to keep up are clearly visible. 
As an environmental engineering student, I am concerned that Connecticut’s infrastructure may not be ready for a changing climate. Each time a major storm passes, the urgency fades. People move on, and the problem resets —until the next round of outages reminds us again. We must start planning and investing now, updating design standards, strengthening power systems, and preparing for the climate we actually live in, not the one we used to. 
Connecticut’s climate has been changing for decades. The Governor’s Council on Climate Change reported that precipitation has grown by 0.17 inches per decade since 1985, with the largest increases in fall, the very season when nor’easters often strike. Across the state, rain totals were up to two inches during last month’s storm. Days with more than one inch of rain are expected to rise with climate change. In a high greenhouse gas emission scenario, the average annual precipitation could increase 8% (four inches every year). That means wetter soil, more treefall during storms, and higher risks of power outages during storms. 
According to CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, past guidance for design precipitation about “10-, 25-, or 100-year storms” are no longer reliable. A storm that used to happen once in a century may now happen much more often. Most power lines and roads were built for an older climate, not the new reality of stronger storms. The CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s Stormwater Manual has updated its design standards to account for climate change and resilience considerations. 


Eversource, Connecticut’s largest utility provider, has acknowledged that most outages are caused by trees falling on power lines. The company has invested in trimming branches and removing high-risk trees to reduce storm damage. These efforts have helped, but they cannot prevent all outages, especially as storms become stronger and more frequent with changing weather. Even with tree trimming and other maintenance, trees fall more easily because of wetter soil and heavier winds. 
Maintaining overhead lines is also expensive: Eversource spent more than $1.5 billion from 2010 to 2019 on repairs and tree removal. Burying lines underground would cost an estimated $28 billion for a quarter of the state, but annual maintenance would drop to $15 million, compared with $130 million for overhead lines, showing that underground lines could save money over time and reduce outages. 
Our planning and design practices need to catch up with rising temperatures, heavier rainfall, and the realities of climate change. Decisions about infrastructure, whether to bury power lines or continue maintaining overhead ones, should be based on careful research to find the most effective and sustainable solutions. 
Residents can also help by staying aware of storm risks, reporting hazards like unstable trees, and supporting local climate initiatives. The key is to treat these issues seriously and consistently, not to forget them once a storm passes. 
Rapid, well-informed action is essential to reduce damage from future storms and protect our homes and communities.

Clockwise from top right, they are Senate Preisdent Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), Aro, Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss. (Screenshot)A former executive director of the Department of Legislative Services warned a redistricting commission that if the state attempts to redraw boundaries of its eight congressional districts before 2030, it will end up in court.
“I won’t say I’m an expert, but I’ve been through a lot,”said Karl Aro, the former executive director of the Maryland Department of Legislative Services, who has been directly involved in “five rounds of redistricting.”
“I’ve seen a lot, and I have to say that I think that doing this midterm redistricting is a major mistake, very high risk for a lot of reasons,” said Aro, one of more than 40 people who testified during a virtual meeting Tuesday of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission.
It was the third meeting in a week for the fast-tracked commission, and the second at which it took public testimony. Gov. Wes Moore (D) created the five-member commission earlier this month and charged it with a “pressure test” of the state’s current congressional district map.
While Moore said the panel needs to consider whether the map is “fair” — a term he has not defined — it meets as other states engage in their own hyper-partisan midcycle redistricting, in an attempt to gain partisan advantage in the 2026 midterm electionss. Moore has also said Maryland and other blue states must keep pace or risk ceding congress to Republicans.
But if Moore was counting on an outpouring of support for redistricting at the commission hearings, that has not been present so far.
In first night of redistricting testimony, majority of speakers say ‘no’

More than 100 people signed to speak at the first two hearings. A third virtual comment session is scheduled for Dec. 5. On Friday, testimony ran 2-1 against redistricting. Testimony Tuesday was nearly even, with a slim edge to those who called for redistricting. Nearly all testifying in favor were Democrats — many with ties to progressive advocacy groups or party organizations.
Many redistricting supporters cited what they described as an existential threat to democracy, as President Donald Trump encourages Republican states to draw new maps that reduce the number of Democrats in Congress in what could be a tough midterm election for Trump and his party.
“The wheels are coming off of our democracy,” said Michael Replogle, a Severna Park resident. “However, as Republicans have weaponized the process of gerrymandering across the country and created a process where nationally, the majority opinion of our national population of voters isn’t fairly represented in Congress. Maryland needs to counter those Republican gerrymanders by advancing our own efforts to protect our national democracy.”
Opponents mostly identified themselves as Republicans or unaffiliated voters.
Dona Sauerburger, an unaffiliated voter from Anne Arundel County, said a week does not go by when the president, in her opinion, “does something that is such a threat to democracy that sets my hair on fire.” But responding in kind should not be the response, she said.
“A redistricting plan whose purpose is to determine how many candidates of which party will be selected to represent the people before the people even have a chance to vote — That’s voter suppression,” she said. “It threatens our very democracy.
“And you know, just because the parties in some states choose to subvert the democratic process by suppressing their voters’ voices to rig the election in their favor does not mean that the way that we can defend democracy is to also suppress the voices of some of our citizens here in Maryland,” she said.
Some of those testifying Tuesday, like Aro, were veterans previous redistricting battles.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Aro was involved in 2021, whena a congressional map drawn buya legislative committee was struck down by Judge Lynne Battaglia, who called “extreme partisan gerrymandering” and who linked partisan map-making to potential violations of Maryland’s Declaration of Rights.
Aro said lawmakers then believed they had adhered to constitutional requirements. But Democratic lawmakers redrew the lines to get the map in use today, and appeals of Battaglia’s ruling were withdrawn before they could reach the Maryland Supreme Court. Her decision is not binding but some Democrats, including Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), are not taking it for granted.
Registered Democratic voters make up a little more than half the state’s voters, compared to about 25% each for registered Republicans and unaffiliated voters. But Democrats hold seven of the state’s eight congressionak seats, with Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) as the lone Republican.
Harris and his district are the clear — if unspoken — focus of efforts by Moore and other state Democrats anxious to stand up to  Trump and hyper-partisan redistricting in Republican-controlled states.
Aro warned that the courts might not look favorably on a midcycle effort.
“I think if you eliminate the only remaining Republican congressional district, you’re going to find yourself in court with, again, extreme partisan gerrymandering, and I think, quite frankly, the state will lose,” he said.
The timing of the current effort will disrupt state and local election boards, he said.

“You’re going to create tremendous problems logistically for them,” Aro said. “You’re going to confuse voters, and you are probably going to anger a lot of independents, who already, from what I’ve heard this evening, are not very happy about things, and I think that that’s just going to exacerbate the situation.”
That was echoed by Diane Butler, one of two Republicans on the Maryland State Board of Elections.
“Our boards of elections work very hard at what they do at the local level and at the state level, but we have many strict deadlines, and they have to be met, some of which have already passed,” said Butler, who told the panel she was speaking as a private citizen and not as an elections board member.
“Redistricting now will negatively affect the local boards and the state board and their ability to give the citizens of Maryland the very best voting experience,” she said.
And a legal challenge is all but certain, Aro told the panel.
“I used to joke and say that the last step in redistricting was to go to court, because no matter what you do, you’re going to go to court,” he said. “And I think the timing of this is very bad.”
Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) was the lead plaintiff in the 2021 map challenge struck down by Battaglia. She said she is preparing to go to court again if the state opts to move forward new out-of-cycle maps.
“The members of this redistricting commission can conclude that congressional redistricting midcycle is not a good idea,” Szeliga said. “You can oppose it, and I urge you to do that. Should you push through a map extinguishing Republicans, you can call it fair, but it would just be a power grab that flies in the face of democracy.
“If another gerrymandered partisan map is passed, we will see you in court and we will see you at the ballot box,” Szeliga warned.

Aro offered what he acknowledged as an unorthodox alternative to redistricting: He said the Democratic Party should “find somebody, a Republican, who is not MAGA” to challenge Harris, who is “full-on MAGA now, and those policies are very unpopular.”
“In fact, in my craziness, I think you should try to convince Larry Hogan to run in the 1st,” he said.
Hogan, the Republican two-term governor, lives in Davidsonville, outside the 1st District.
“You don’t have to be a resident of your congressional district to run it or represent it,” Aro said, adding Hogan is “very popular. He’s not a MAGA guy.”
For now, witnesses are testifying on the concept of redistricting. There is currently no redrawn map, although the chair of the redistricting commission, U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), said last week that she hoped to provide a map on which the public can comment.
Neither Alsobooks nor former Attorney General Brian Frosh attended Tuesday’s meeting.

Karen Simpson (D-Frederick), left, and Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee, chat before a briefing Tuesday to discuss Maryland’s wiretapping and two-party consent law. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)For Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County), the debate over Maryland’s wiretapping law boiled down to one question.
“We don’t require consent for video, but we do require consent for audio. Does that make sense?” Phillips asked.
That was just one of the questions during a two-hour briefing Tuesday for the House Judiciary Committee on the wiretapping law, as lawmakers consider amending it when the 2026 session convenes in less two months.
Maryland is currently one of only a handful of states that has a two-party consent rule, under which everyone in a conversation must agree to it being recorded. Under the law, a person wjho records another without their permission could face up to five years in prison or up to a $10,000 fine, or both.
But modern technology has led to some tricky interpreations of the law, said David Gray, a professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, who participated in the briefing. He said that while a doorbell camera might capture video and audio of an alleged crime, the video can be admissible in court under the current law, but not the audio.
“My understanding of the history of the law is that it was adopted at a time where video recording was relatively unavailable, and so it just wasn’t on the minds of the legislature at the time,” said Gray, who participated in the briefing virtually.
“You’re right to recognize that technology might have overtaken us, and trying to write that law now in our current technological environment,” Gray said. “I would not envy you or your staffers.”
There are exceptions to audio and video recordings that are allowed under the law. Claire Rossmark, an analyst with the Department of Legislative Services, and counsel to the Judiciary Committee, said they include telephone companies employees, 911 calls, police body-worn cameras and court-ordered wiretaps for investigative work.
But lawmakers are looking clarify other carve-outs to the law, including in cases of domestic violence or housing discrimination.

Legislation coming back?
Several bills from the 2025 General Assembly are already being eyed for the next session. They include House Bill 314, sponsored by Del. Robin Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County). It would allow any oral or electronic communication to be used as evidence in court if “the interest of justice will be served,” such as protecting domestic violence victims.
A companion bill, sponsored by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), passed the Senate unanimously last year but stalled in the House.  Grammer filed a prefile version of the bill Tuesday.
Another bill slated to make a return is House Bill 392, sponsored by Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the Judiciary Committee who presided over Tuesday’s briefing. Her bill would allow a fair housing tester to obtain evidence of any housing violations under the law.
Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) sponsored a Senate version that was approved 28-18 in the Senate, but did not advance in the House.
Heather Morton, who directs the financial services, technology and communications program with National Conference of State Legislatures, said her research did not find any other state with a specific wiretapping exception for fair housing testing programs.
Morton said her research could not find a law similar to Grammer’s HB 314. But she said California does let a domestic violence victim seeking a restraining order record confidential communications with an abuser that “may be held germane as evidence for that restraining order and for it to be admissible” in court.
‘Maryland is an outlier’
Morton said Maryland is just one of 10 states that is a two-party, or “all-party” consent state. The majority of states are one-party consent, which lets one person record a conversation without needing the other’s permission.
“So for example, if you’re on a phone call with a colleague in a one-party consent state, you can record that call without telling the other person or obtaining their consent,” Morton said.
Two attorneys at Tuesday’s briefing had differing opinions on what Maryland should do.
Joyce King, chief counsel with the Frederick County State’s Attorney’s Office, said certain recordings should not need any consent, especially when they deal with domestic violence, child or elder abuse, or other violent crimes.
“Maryland is an outlier,” she said. “These cases are limited to crimes committed against a person, that the recording is not just to embarrass or to be salacious … not to capture your private conversations at the dinner table. It’s a material fact of a crime.”
But Baltimore City Public Defender Marguerite Lanaux said two-party consent provides privacy protection from “fabricated evidence” through artificial intelligence and audio manipulation that “helps prevent malicious actors from creating or editing recordings to frame individuals.”
“Just because we are in the minority [among states] doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to move to the majority,  where the majority is in a place that doesn’t afford protections that the Constitution is truly rooted in,” Lanaux said.
After the briefing, Bartlett said one of the key points in assessing the use of two-party consent next year will be the admissibility of evidence to be reviewed by judges.
“They would have all the evidence, and they could weigh the evidence and see is this the best evidence? Is this evidence going to help prove the material of fact, just as they will with any other evidence that gets admitted,” she said. “It was a good briefing to have this discussion.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dels.-Karen-Simpson-and-Sandy-Bartlett-11-18-2025-1024x804.jpg,,,2025-11-19 05:57:28.125358

That was the focus of a daylong hearing Tuesday by the National Transportation Safety Board, which also reported that protective barriers on the 50-year-old Key Bridge were no match for the size of modern cargo ships. The NTSB also said that workers on the bridge might have been able  to escape, but no one called them to warn them of the impending crash.
Bridge police were called 1 minute, 29 seconds before the crash, giving them enough time to close the bridge to traffic and save lives in the process, according to the NTSB investigation.
The workers were sitting in their vehicles on break at the time. Had they been alerted at the same time as the police, it still would have been an incredibly tight window get clear of the bridge — one worker was parked a little more than a half-mile from safety — but that phone call was not made, said the board.
Two other crew members survived the collapse: An inspector who fled the falling spans on foot and a worker who escaped his vehicle after it plunged into the Patapsco River.

Much of Tuesday’s meeting, however, focused on the mechanical failures on the 984-foot-long cargo ship, Dali, as it lost power and veered toward the Key Bridge in the middle of that cold March night. The failures occurred so close to the bridge that scrambling crew members, who responded as efficiently as possible, did not have time to prevent disaster, according to the board’s findings.
NTSB investigators traced the blackout to a single wire with a misplaced label, which created a precarious electrical connection that allowed the wire to disconnect from its terminal box and plunge the ship into darkness.
“Locating a single wire that is loose among thousands of wires is like looking for a loose bolt in the Eiffel Tower,” said Board Chair Jennifer Homendy, who applauded the work of investigators.
Among a host of safety recommendations for governments, businesses and others, the board said Hyundai Heavy Industries and other ship builders should ensure that wire labels are installed correctly, preventing wires from becoming dislodged. Board staff also recommended that ship inspectors use a technology called thermography, which could have detected the wiring issue in advance of the crash.
The Dali also had a loss of power in port a day before the crash, but that blackout was unrelated to the power outage a day later that led to the bridge collapse, according to the NTSB. A crew member working on the ship “inadvertently closed” an exhaust mechanism, causing the engine to sputter, said the NTSB’s Barton Barnum.
“It was all rather, rather obvious, OK, he knew immediately that his actions had caused the engine to disconnect and black out the vessel,” Barnum said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
NTSB staffers said Tuesday that they do not think the ship’s crew was under any obligation to report that power loss to the pilots who would guide the Dali out of the Seagirt Marine Terminal, because they had no reason to believe it had compromised the ship.
In addition to the mislabeled wire, other key pieces of equipment aboard the ship were set up incorrectly and unable to handle the power loss, investigators said.
Aboard the Dali, a fuel flushing pump was improperly installed as a fuel oil service pump, serving two diesel generators. When the ship lost power, that pump could not automatically restart. So once the ship briefly came back online, those diesel generators were starved of fuel, causing the second blackout.
The NTSB believes that the improper configuration had been in place on the Dali for at least seven months, because the normal pump system was believed to be contaminated.
“In order for them to use that system, it would need to be opened up and cleaned, a process that would take a couple days. So they opted to continue using the flushing pump,” Barnum said.
The ship’s owner, Synergy Marine, should have discovered the improper setup based on email reports coming from the ship and addressed the  problem, according to the board.

Several board members expressed concern that new emissions reduction standards might have been part of the reason for the impermissible flushing pump hookup.
“I’m certainly supportive of strengthening environmental regulations,” Homendy said. “But we have to also look at safety impacts, and make sure there are not unintended consequences by use of some other configuration to comply with those emissions standards.”
But the perfect storm of events leading to the collapse also included “woefully inadequate” infrastructure protecting the Key Bridge, said Dan Walsh of the NTSB.
The bridge had 25-foot-diameter concrete “dolphins,” structures meant to prevent impacts to the bridge’s piers. But modern container ships have dramatically increased in size and capacity, and small dolphins are incapable of slowing them. Not to mention the fact that the Dali did not come into contact with any of the four dolphins around the Key Bridge, the board found.
By comparison, the Delaware Memorial Bridge has 80-foot-diameter dolphins, which are capable of puncturing the hull of even a large container ship before it strikes a pier.
Though it was not legally required to do so, the Maryland Transportation Authority failed to conduct a study of the bridge’s vulnerability to ship strikes, which would have revealed that the bridge was nearly 30 times above the acceptable risk standard.
In March 2025, the NTSB released urgent recommendations for 68 bridge owners across the nation who had not conducted that analysis to do so as soon as possible.
Some but not all of the bridge owners have since completed those studies, and bridges in New Jersey and Ohio, along with several in Louisiana are above the acceptable risk threshold. So, too, are both spans of Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
In its statement Tuesday, the MdTA also defended the Bay Bridge, adding that it meets federal permitting requirements, and has passed its inspections. But the agency noted that it is undertaking a $177 million project to design more protection for the critical spans, the only bay crossings that connect Maryland’s Eastern Shore to the rest of the state.

“MDTA has taken steps to enhance the Bay Bridge’s physical protections because, although vessels have increased in size, weight, and speed, maritime regulations have not kept pace with the changes,” the statement reads.
Homendy took issue Tuesday with inaccuracies that she cited in the MdTA filing to the NTSB. She said she was “disappointed” that the state agency violated NTSB regulations by relying on items from discovery in its lawsuits against the companies operating the ship.
That filing referenced an “unlicensed” electrician working on the ship, Homendy said, but the NTSB found no evidence of certification issues with the mariners working on the ship.
“He was a credentialed marine electrician,” Barnum said. “He worked under the guidance of senior engineering officers, including the chief engineer.”
Maryland’s filing also argued that the blackouts in port on March 25, 2024, should have been reported on a “pilot card” for the mariners who would guide the Dali past the Key Bridge. NTSB staff disagreed.
Maryland’s filing also implied that dropping anchor could have stopped the crash, Homendy said. But NTSB staff members also disagreed on that point.
“It takes a long time to deploy an anchor that size,” said the NTSB’s Capt. Marcel Muise, adding that the speed of the vessel means the anchor would have been unlikely to prevent the crash into the Key Bridge.
The Maryland Transportation Authority did not reference the concerns about its filing in its statement, and did not respond to questions on the subject from Maryland Matters.
Homendy closed Tuesday’s briefing by emphasizing the importance of the board’s “meticulous” and lengthy study of the crash, especially when it came to the wiring on the Dali.
“We all too often get pushed in the early stages of an investigation — in fact, while we are still on scene — to determine the cause of an accident,” Homendy said. “Our investigations take time. Our findings in this investigation are a perfect example of why.”

Spartans defeated Sussex Academy, 1-0, for D2 State Championship Title
DOVER — Scott McDermott stood with the ball at his feet and the Spartan offense in position in front of the goal ready for the sophomore’s free kick toward the net. Standing around the 20-yard line marker on Dover High School’s football field, McDermott hit a line drive shot toward the goal. 
The low line drive held its line and cleared the array of defenders and teammates alike without interference. McDermott’s shot weaved through the traffic and landed in the netting of the back left post. Happiness was all he could feel when the shot went in.
“I was reminiscing on all the hard work me and my teammates put in and it really just paid off,” McDermott said postgame. “I’m just so glad. I’m so happy.”
McDermott’s goal in the 66th minute led to St. Mark’s 1-0 victory over Sussex Academy in the Division Two Boys Soccer State Championship game Saturday afternoon. It’s the Spartans first boys state title since 2001 and their first since the tournament was split into two divisions.

The Seahawks’ offensive attack tried to mount a response and worked the ball down into the Spartans’ defensive zone multiple times earning both free kicks and corner opportunities.
In the 76th minute, the Seahawks generated one of their better scoring opportunities on a corner kick that reached the heads of multiple players in the box. The ball bounced off the head of one Seahawk before bouncing off another in an attempt at an equalizer. The shot went wide and the Spartans took over possession.
In the final minutes, the Seahawks generated a frenzy of opportunities, but none could make it past goalkeeper Thomas Swasey and the Spartan defense. It looked like Sussex Academy would have one more attempt before the game ended, but they couldn’t get the corner attempt off in time. 
“[Sussex Academy is] the gold standard in D2 soccer, and we knew it was going to take a really heroic effort to take them down, and that’s what our boys did,” said head coach Dan Swasey.  
Saint Mark’s performed well on the defensive side of the ball all game and throughout the season. The Spartans allowed a single goal in their three postseason games and held opponents scoreless in ten of their regular season games. 
“Our defense is our backbone,” Swasey said postgame. “Sussex Academy has three or four high level all-state players and our guys stayed right with them, didn’t give them much at all. … I thought that was impressive by our defense.”
St. Mark’s ends the season with a 15-2-1 overall record and the first boys state championship in Swasey’s career. While that might be a wonderful memory itself, the fact he got to do it with his son in net made it even more special. 
“He’s been on every sideline since he was like two years old,” Swasey said. “I’ve had to console him more times than anybody, because he’s so invested in this program. So to get one with him, it makes it even more special for me.”
The resounding sentiment from Swasey and the players alike following the game was the special chemistry the team had. Swasey said the team genuinely liked being around each other, hanging out with one another and that the team was truly a group of “22 brothers”. 
His son agreed, saying the chemistry from this team will be what he remembers. 
“We all love each other. I mean, we’re the most goofy team in the state. I’ll stand by that, but we get it done when those games come around,” Thomas Swasey said postgame.

DOVER — Senior Joseph Turtoro received the corner kick outside of the box standing to the left of the Caesar Rodney goalkeeper about ten yards away from the net. Between him and the goal was a mass of bodies. There wasn’t an apparent window for a pass or drive into the box, but Turtoro stayed patient and found a small window.
Turtoro rocketed a line drive pass by a pair of Rider defenders that settled at the feet of fellow senior Chase Esser. Esser settled the pass and fired. His shot ricocheted off a defender, but settled at the top of the net in the opening 13 minutes of the game. 
Esser celebrated the score with a cartwheel on the right corner of the pitch as his teammates swarmed to celebrate with him. The goal set the tone in Sallies, 3-0, victory over a Rider team that defeated them in the championship game a year ago.
“[Caesar Rodney] play positive and they play aggressive, so we wanted to set the bar,” head coach Scott Mosier said about his team’s fast start. “We didn’t want to like chase their energy and we wanted to come out and set the bar really early.” 
The message about bringing the energy was evident throughout the Sallies roster. At the start of the game, players on Sallies’ starting unit yelled the word energy as they clapped and moved around in both an effort to stay warm on a 40 degree afternoon and generate the energy for the game ahead. 
Esser’s goal early in the game carried over into the second half where it seemed Sallies energy level only increased.
Salesianum scored two goals in the first 20 minutes of the half with contributions from both Esser brothers. Sophomore Brady Esser scored on a header from a pass by fellow sophomore Bryan Perez-Herrera in the 49th minute. Less than five minutes later, Brady assisted on Chase’s second goal of the game, setting his brother up with a one-on-one matchup with the goalkeeper.
“That was a amazing ball by Brady across the box,” Chase said postgame. “I took a touch, taking my time, I had time and I finished. I finished the game off.”
Chase said playing with his brother has been amazing and he’s looking forward to playing with him sometime in the future. Although it may be a couple of years before they take the pitch together again — Chase is graduating this year and Brady is a sophomore — the way they competed together this season and in the championship game was impactful. 
“We play amazing together,” Chase said. “I play the high forward, Brady plays kind of below and I like playing with him. I knock the ball back to him, he plays me through and we score goals together.”
Sallies scored plenty of goals this season scoring two or more goals in 14 of the 17 games they played. Sallies ended the regular season 11-2-1 and parlayed that momentum into postseason wins over Delcastle and Sussex Central which earned them their 15th straight appearance in the state championship game.

Mosier said that the team talked about their 3-1 defeat to the Riders last season. He added that there was a different vibe to this iteration of the team and it stemmed from a maturity they gained following their loss a year ago. 
“You could tell from the beginning there was a vibe about them, a positivity and a confidence about them and an enthusiasm about playing in states, not like a nervousness,” Mosier said postgame. 
This championship is Mosier’s 20th as a boys soccer coach. He said that each championship team is different for him because each year it’s a new group of kids that make the journey memorable.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4354-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 22:56:50.239473

“For it to be a larger turnout than the primary just speaks volumes of how important this is to the voters,” Nelson said. “I’m just very thankful for the people who believed in me and supported me and led me to victory.”
Nelson campaigned on income tax reform. The current state tax rates and income threshold are locked via a 1933 constitutional amendment, though deductions may be changed by statute.
Dixon campaigned on recruiting “good paying” jobs to the district, improving infrastructure and supporting public schools. 
The counties were sharply divided. Dixon, a resident of Smiths Station, won Lee County by a 3:1 margin. Nelson, who lives in Lanett, won Chambers County by a 4:1 margin. 
Dixon conceded on Facebook Tuesday evening, thanking his supporters.
“It has been an honor to meet so many people across House District 38 and to hear directly about the hopes and concerns people are facing. I grew up here, and I am raising my kids here. My commitment to making our home a better place does not end tonight,” he said in a post.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of a panel charged with overseeing content and searching for a director of the University of Iowa Center for Intellectual Freedom wrangled Tuesday over whether the initiative is inherently academic or political as they worked to determine committees and bylaws.
The advisory council for the UI Center for Intellectual Freedom met for the first time Tuesday. The most significant — and most contentious — item on the agenda was approval of proposed bylaws that will steer the council and its committees as it starts its national search for a permanent director and begins planning for future events and content.
“This is an exciting opportunity for the state of Iowa,” Regent and advisory council chair Christine Hensley said. “We’re all learning our way here. We may not have it 100% right, but I can guarantee you that from my perspective … we’re going to work to make sure that we do get it right, and that it is extremely successful.”

Passed into law during the previous legislative session, the UI Center for Intellectual Freedom’s goal is to bring more intellectual diversity to the university and expand students’ learning of American traditions and values, U.S. government and civic life and discourse.
Luciano I. de Castro, a UI professor and economist who spoke to lawmakers about the benefits of such an initiative during the session, is serving as interim director of the center. There are 26 members of the advisory council, half of which are faculty at universities across the U.S. The other half includes current and former regents, business leaders and former lawmakers, including former Gov. Terry Branstad.
A nine-person executive committee with a five-four split between scholars and other members was approved by the group, but councilmember and former state Sen. Liz Mathis questioned whether there should be political balance among the group members. Regent Nancy Dunkel brought up the same concern in discussion of the advisory council when names were first proposed, to which Hensley said at the time and emphasized Tuesday there is political balance.
“I think in designing the executive committee, since there are already five faculty members, the four people who are non-faculty should at least have a balance,” Mathis, a Democrat, said. “That’s all I’m asking for, is fairness in that.”
Tom Gallanis, a law professor at George Mason University, said he was concerned at the insinuation that all committees in the state must be politically balanced, and those in the advisory council shouldn’t be factoring in politics when deciding on who would be best to serve on the executive committee, whose job it will be to handle the director search.
He was joined by other scholars who repeated throughout the meeting that the center is supposed to be an academic institution, not a political one, and should be treated as such.
“This is not a fundamentally political operation. It is fundamentally a matter of academic norms and intellectual quality,” Mark Bauerlein, professor emeritus of English at Emory University, said. “To call it politics is to introduce precisely the degradation and distortion that has led to the necessity of centers like this in the first place.”
Mathis and Hensley will both serve on the executive committee alongside Branstad and Mike Whalen, president and CEO of hospitality and real estate company Heart of America Group. Whalen ran for Congress as a Republican in 2006.
Scholar committee chair and University of Texas at Austin associate professor of finance Richard Lowery will also serve, as well as Bauerlein, Gallanis, Stanford Graduate School of Business associate accounting professor Iván Marinovic and Joshua Rauh, a professor of finance at Stanford.
Bylaws approved after tabling by board of regents
Bylaws for the advisory council were tabled by the Iowa Board of Regents during its November meeting The advisory council approved an amended version unanimously. The only change to see contention from members was the very one that got it tabled in the first place — language requiring that a majority of the executive committee be scholars.
Members of the board of regents, including advisory council member Robert Cramer, asked to strike language in the bylaws stating the executive committee must be majority faculty. Regent Nancy Dunkel shared concerns at the time of out-of-state control of the council.
As the council is in an advisory role and not a governing body, Gallanis said the center will always be under Iowa control since it is under the governance of the board of regents.
He and other scholars on the council wanted to keep the language in the bylaws, saying academic experts need to have a large hand in the search for a director and everything that comes after.
“I do think it’s quite important as a signal to the commitment of this organization to it being an academic organization, that the institution has a process whereby scholars have a majority vote in not the appointment, but in the recommendation, because as was pointed out previously, the advisory council is just an advisory council,” Rauh said.
Cramer told the advisory council Tuesday he believes “we really do need those changes in order to get the approval of the board of regents,” as there worries among legislators, “probably as well as a lot of us on the committee,” that over time the UI will “gobble up” the center and influence its mission away from what it originally was.
The amendment passed with a vote of 10-7. Other amendments included a change to state the center director “shall develop policies and procedures for the Center, subject to the approval of the Advisory Council and the Board,” where previously approval was not stated as necessary, and a similar change to language stating the director will create an annual budget and report of expenditures that previously left out approval from the advisory council.
Hensley agreed with Cramer’s statement and added that the board of regents will have the final vote on the bylaws.
“We’ve talked about that at length, but it is important that we get the bylaws approved. There’s been input from regents. There’s been input from faculty,” Hensley said. “I’m going to be the first to admit not everybody’s going to be happy about this, but you know what, we’re in a good place right now, way better than I thought we would be, and we need to move forward.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Faculty leaders at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln overwhelmingly passed a resolution Tuesday expressing “no confidence” in Chancellor Rodney Bennett and urging his bosses to reconsider his employment.
It is the first “no confidence” vote to pass against a UNL chancellor in the university’s nearly 157-year history.
The UNL Faculty Senate voted 60-14 to pass the advisory resolution from Elizabeth Lewis, a professor in the Department of Teaching, Learning and Teacher Education. It calls on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents and NU President Jeffrey Gold to immediately review Bennett’s “continued fitness to serve” and urges them to consider firing him or negotiating his departure.

Lewis told her colleagues that her resolution came as public education is “under attack” at all levels. She said the “battleground has shifted” and that some people not as committed to defending higher education are being “invited in” and “embedded” in roles where faculty need an advocate.
“It is possible that you may find his [Bennett’s] actions honorable and selfless. If so, feel free to vote against the motion,” Lewis said. “If you, too, are aggrieved, now is the time to vote in favor of this resolution of no confidence to advocate for better stewardship at UNL.”
After the vote, Lewis said faculty needed to take action but took no pleasure in the vote. She said it was not “mean-spirited” and that faculty couldn’t keep fighting “on all fronts.”
“Our community is amazing, and this is not something that we did lightly,” Lewis told the Nebraska Examiner.
Bennett declined to comment on Tuesday’s vote, according to a spokesperson.
Regents have final say
A major part of the resolution also asks the regents to pause consideration of a Bennett-led plan to eliminate four academic programs at UNL, a combined $6.74 million cut that the regents will consider at a Dec. 5 meeting. 
Those cuts are part of a larger $27.5 million budget reduction plan. Of the plan, $21 million is meant to close a “structural deficit” at UNL, and the rest are considered “proactive” cuts to prevent the need for additional ones in the future.
The program areas proposed to be cut are Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million), Statistics ($1.75 million), Educational Administration ($1.69 million) and Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million). Each will be subject to a Board of Regents vote in December.

A spokesperson for Dr. Gold and the NU system said faculty-shared governance is “one of many voices” in higher education and that NU values their input at UNL.
“However, ultimate decisions rest with the Board of Regents,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Reached Tuesday, Regent Paul Kenney, chair of the NU Board of Regents, said he knew faculty were talking about a no-confidence vote, and “what they do is 100% their opinion.” 
Kenney said he doesn’t think it changes how he’ll approach budget-related votes come Dec. 5.
“We were short a lot of money to start with,” Kenney said. “That hasn’t changed.”
Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, the longest current serving member of the regents, declined to comment. The six other elected regents did not respond to Examiner calls seeking comment. 
‘Not just about one person’
Multiple UNL faculty said Bennett, who joined UNL as chancellor in July 2023, should have implemented a plan to close UNL’s structural budget deficit with more faculty involvement sooner. Instead, many faculty argue Bennett and his executive team created and used faulty data that led to improper and statistically flawed results without faculty input.
Bennett’s contract expires June 30, unless extended by the regents. Bennett, in October, told the Examiner he had “no idea” if or when a vote extending his contract might come.
“But I sure hope it comes quickly, because I love being here, love being a part of the community and clearly we have important work yet to do,” Bennett said Oct. 5.

That same day, Gold said he favored extending Bennett’s contract but that it was up to the regents.
Corey Rumann, a professor of educational administration, said the symbolic vote Tuesday was not solely meant to influence Bennett’s contract or whether he should resign. Rumann said it shows faculty will not “stand by” and let administrators determine UNL’s future without them.
“A vote of no confidence is not just about one person,” Rumann said. “It is about systemic failures at the administrative level that have led to decisions being made that are not in the best interest of this institution or the State of Nebraska.”
A committee of faculty, staff and students advising the chancellor on academic budget reductions also criticized Bennett in an unsigned Oct. 24 letter. A majority of members split from him on key academic cuts that he continues to pursue. The letter said the short time frame — cuts were announced Sept. 12 and finalized Nov. 10 — made it difficult to find alternatives.
A message to all administrators
John Lindquist, a professor in the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, said all faculty members in his department he heard back from supported the no-confidence resolution. He and multiple faculty said it was an indictment not just on Bennett but on all upper administrators.
“Maybe, after all this is said and done, there will be people in our administration who start to think, ‘Huh, how do I begin to repair the damage that has been done to this institution, to the people of the institution?” Lidquist said.
Advisory committee splits with UNL chancellor on key academic program cuts

L. J. McElravy, a professor in the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communications, said his department was mixed on Lewis’ resolution. In part, that’s because McElravy’s department is planned to be merged with another, and some faculty feared passing the resolution could open up the budget process and change the outcome for his department.
However, McElravy said the review of the process by the advisory committee alone, plus other budgetary problems, pushed him to support a “no confidence” vote.
The UNL Faculty Senate previously considered a “no confidence” resolution against former Chancellor Harvey Perlman in 2003 over budgetary decisions. The resolution ultimately didn’t come to a Faculty Senate vote, and in a “straw vote” of faculty campuswide, faculty overwhelmingly opposed punitive action.
Perlman continued as chancellor until 2016.
Scott Gardner, a professor in UNL’s School of Biological Sciences, said he was part of one of those areas slashed in 2003. Gardner said Perlman had open forums once a week and “at least entertained what we were attacking him with. But in this case, there’s nothing.”
“We need to make some changes,” Gardner said. “If we don’t make the changes now, it’ll happen again in the same way very soon.”
‘Do I have to draw a picture?’
John Shrader, president of the UNL Faculty Senate and a professor in sports media and communication, emailed faculty representatives Monday and said there was “action” going on “behind the scenes” related to Bennett. So Shrader said he would entertain a motion to “table” Lewis’ resolution or effectively delay its consideration at Tuesday’s meeting.
“In the end, it appears we are going to get the personnel outcome that many faculty members were hoping for, regardless of this vote,” Shrader wrote Monday.

On Tuesday, Colin Meiklejohn, of the School of Biological Sciences, told Shrader that his emails were “incredibly cryptic.” Meiklejohn and others asked Shrader to clarify, who responded: “It is my understanding that serious action is being discussed at this time to come to a resolution about the leadership of our campus.”
“Do I have to draw a picture?” Shrader said, adding later he was “aware of what’s going on” but couldn’t say exactly what. 
From the crowd, Sarah Zuckerman, a professor of educational administration and president of UNL’s Association of American University Professors, interrupted Shrader and shouted: “Bulls—, tell us!”
Meiklejohn told Shrader he wasn’t accusing him of “deception” but asked how other faculty members could trust and believe the information.
“You can either trust me, or you can’t, and that’s fine,” Shrader said. “I won’t be hurt either way, honestly. I have the same interest in this as every single person in this room.”
The resolution overcame the motion to wait, with 41 faculty opposing it and 28 others in support. Had it passed, the resolution would have been delayed until Dec. 2.
The need for investment
Some faculty told the Examiner that Tuesday’s effort was also a message for Nebraska state lawmakers and Gov. Jim Pillen, who decide how many state dollars go to NU. The annual increase in state dollars going to the university has slowed and not kept up with inflation, particularly since Pillen became governor in 2023 after serving 10 years as a regent.

Zuckerman said Tuesday that the no-confidence vote shows faculty won’t accept a lack of transparency, exclusion from decision-making or “erosion” to NU’s mission to educate students.
Lewis said without further investment, the university would be a college that just “happens to be located in Nebraska,” instead of the land-grant, public-facing University of Nebraska that faculty, staff, students and all university supporters are asking for.
“To view this institution in only dollars and cents is the wrong lens,” Lewis said. “We’re just basically begging them to keep investing into the future of our young people and our professionals.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Low-income aid advocates, faith leaders and environmental groups came together Tuesday to stand against state leaders’ proposal to put a 1,300-bed homeless “campus” in a field with wetlands near a small agricultural neighborhood in northwest Salt Lake City.
They held a news conference on the side of the road near the property to announce they were delivering a letter that had been signed by more than 1,400 people to Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, who have both expressed support for moving away from “Housing First” strategies in favor of programs that will bring more “accountability” to the state’s homeless system. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

The letter calls on state leaders to “halt” the project because it’s “so bad in so many ways,” said Deeda Seed, a senior campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity. 
“We recognize Utah’s urgent need for expanded homeless services and support effectively assisting individuals experiencing homelessness with dignity and compassion,” the letter says. “However, the proposed campus would bring new safety, environmental, health, and infrastructure challenges to an area unequipped for them, placing an unfair burden on one neighborhood to absorb a statewide issue.”
“There are times when you just need to stand up and say, ‘the emperor has no clothes,’” said Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of the low-income aid nonprofit Crossroads Urban Center. “This project is a hodgepodge of bad ideas that even if they fit together, they still won’t work because they’re all bad ideas.”
Gov. Spencer Cox recently called the campus a “top priority” in order to both bring more “compassion” and “accountability” to Utah’s homelessness system. 
State leaders’ vision (which has been years in the works) also coincides with President Donald Trump’s executive order issued in July, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” That executive order encourages cities and states to enforce stricter anti-camping laws, expands power to involuntarily treat and civilly commit people experiencing homelessness, and directs federal officials to end support for “Housing First” strategies, an approach to homelessness that prioritizes providing housing while offering — but not requiring — treatment.

Plans for the campus are still taking shape. But the state’s top homelessness leaders have proposed including hundreds of beds for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. They also envision an “accountability center” or a “secure residential placement facility” for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
In response to a request for comment about the letter, Utah’s Office of Homeless Services referred to the campus’ website, which describes the campus as a place where people experiencing homelessness “can find help for recovery, mental health, healthcare, employment, criminal justice assistance, and housing through services and treatment accessible in a single location.”
“This is more than a campus, it’s a turning point for Utah of reimagining hope,” says the state’s homeless coordinator, Wayne Niederhauser, in a statement on that website. “It will further fulfill the identified need to provide additional beds and treatment in Utah’s homeless response while providing individuals served by the campus a transformative path from crisis to stability and, ultimately, thriving.”
Schultz, Adams and the governor did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. 
Not a shelter but a prison, advocates say
Tibbitts, however, said the campus’ vision is the result of a group of “very influential people who have had this idea that if you build a shelter, you will reduce homelessness.” 
Utah Gov. Cox says homeless campus — envisioned to fulfill Trump’s order — is a ‘top priority’

“That’s a lot like saying that if you built a better emergency room less people would get sick,” he said, arguing that the fact that more people are becoming homeless for the first time “has nothing to do with what’s happening inside a homeless shelter” but rather “everything to do with what’s happening in the economy, what’s happening in people’s lives.” 
One of the biggest objections Tibbitts says advocates have is that the proposed campus is shaping up to be more of a prison where people will be forced into drug or mental health treatment. 
“Incarceration is not a homeless service,” he said. “That will make the entire campus feel like a correctional facility and reduce outcomes for everyone.” 
State leaders including Cox have argued true “compassion” is not allowing people to suffer with drug addiction or mental illness while sleeping on the streets. 
But Tibbitts said the real problem is a lack of emergency homeless shelter capacity in Utah’s existing system, as well as a lack of investment in other existing resources like deeply affordable housing for low-income people or seniors on fixed incomes. 
“You need to actually help people be stable in the community, and that’s not going to happen with a mega shelter,” he said. “It’s going to happen with housing.”
The Rev. Brigette Weier, the pastor at St. Matthew Lutheran Church in Taylorsville and a member of the Crossroads Faith and Advocacy Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness, said true “compassion” is meeting people where they are and providing housing first while also addressing larger economical issues. 
‘Compassion that kills’: Gov. Cox says ‘sea change’ in Utah’s homeless system is coming

“If we are truly a compassionate people, we will do what it takes to be with the people that are suffering to meet their needs,” she said. “And that is to raise the minimum wage, which is lagging a generation.”
She also said true compassion is giving anyone and everyone health care. 
“Everybody with a body deserves health care. That is compassion,” she said. “It is not for the rich. It is not for the elite. Having a body is what entitles you to health care.” 
She also argued state leaders need to stop using a “lack of money” as an “excuse.” Last year, Utah’s state budget exceeded $30.8 billion. 
“It is not a lack of money,” she said. “It is a lack of will, and it is a lack of political will from our elected leaders.”

Treatment by choice, not coercion
Dusty Trent, the pastor of Murray Baptist Church, said he’s “lived through addiction and knows what it’s like to lose control of your own life.”
“When I was at my lowest, the turning point in my recovery didn’t come from being pushed somewhere or told what I had to do,” he said. “It came when people treated me like a human being with choices, dignity, and the right to say yes or no. Healing can’t be forced, and recovery never grows out of coercion. That’s why this proposed mega shelter concerns me so deeply.”
He said it’s built on “the involuntary model, moving large numbers of vulnerable people into a massive, centralized facility.” 
“Anyone who has lived with addiction, trauma or instability knows that being placed somewhere against your will doesn’t create safety or trust. It creates fear, and it pushes people further from real help,” he said. 
Instead, Trent said “what works” is “smaller shelters, supportive housing, trauma-informed care, peer support and human-sized solutions.” 
Utah homelessness rose 18% in 2025, state report says

The governor and other state leaders have argued that Utah’s existing homeless system hasn’t worked, with more people becoming homeless and many cycling in and out of jail and shelters with substance abuse and mental health issues going unaddressed. 
But Trent and other advocates argued state leaders should focus on pumping more money into existing services — especially supportive and deeply affordable housing — rather than experimenting with a new, expensive campus.
Weier took issue with describing the campus as an “involuntary shelter.”
“No, that’s too clean. It’s a prison with no due process. That’s actually not quite right either,” she said. “It’s a concentration camp where people will have to prove their worth and depend on the people who are making a profit off of them to be let free.” 
Cox recently balked at a quote in a New York Times article in which a woman experiencing homelessness compared a rendering of the homeless campus to a “concentration camp.” The governor argued it’s “crazy” to compare the project to “Nazi Germany” as if “Hitler were to, what, round up people who are dying on the streets in their own filth addicted to drugs and giving them the support they need? Like, there is no comparison — at all.”
Advocates call for more focus on housing, health care and wages
Weier said she’s concerned about state leaders’ plans to move away from Housing First strategies. 
“For the Utah lawmakers to abandon Housing First, in which we used to lead the nation, is as if I were to leave my car on the side of the road because I refused to pay to put gas in it, and decided to go back to a horse and buggy,” she said. “The Utah Legislature, nor our federal government, have never truly, adequately funded Housing First for it to have a chance to succeed.” 
Utah Gov. Cox says homeless campus — envisioned to fulfill Trump’s order — is a ‘top priority’

She argued it’s “disingenuous” to say Housing First hasn’t worked “because it’s never been tried.”
Weier pointed to the governor’s recent comments that the campus will be a “statement of who we are as a state.” 
“My Lord, I pray that is not true,” she said. “I pray that we are better than involuntary incarceration of our beloved siblings who deserve care, dignity and flourishing on their own terms.” 
The Rev. Lora Young, minister for South Valley Unitarian Universalist Society in Cottonwood Heights, said she also opposes the “mega shelter,” calling the rhetoric around it “appalling.” 
“People experiencing homelessness are not in need of moral development,” she said, arguing state leaders should be focusing their attention and funding upstream of all social issues rather than expanding capacity for involuntary drug and mental health treatment. 
“Unaffordable, unsafe or just plain unavailable housing, artificially low wages, artificially high food prices, and artificially high medical costs are the primary drivers which lead someone to find themselves unhoused,” she said. 
“We live in a system that consistently places profit over people (and) profit over the land,” she added. “This is the moral failing. The evidence is clear. Profits over people create poverty and suffering. Profits over the land create environmental degradation and poor life outcomes for everyone in the community.”

Housing First
Susy Colvin, with Powerful Moms Who Care, said she relies on a housing assistance voucher to keep a roof over her head in Salt Lake City. She argued homelessness is full of misconceptions, and she worried that moving away from Housing First strategies would result in hundreds more people becoming homeless. 
“If they do away with the Housing First model and take away our voucher, we will be homeless again,” she said. “Our rent is double our income. That’s just our reality. It’s not because we’re mentally ill. It’s not because we’re drug users. It’s not because we’re lazy. It’s the very real reality that our income will not cover our rent and we are maxed out on our earning power.” 
She took issue with a model that focuses on making “people that are worthy to be housed.” 
“What makes you worthy?” she asked state leaders. “Search your heart. I don’t want to hear about their worth. I want to hear about your worth. What makes you worthy to have a safe, comfortable place to sleep at night?”
Northpointe community concerns
Throughout Tuesday’s press conference held alongside a busy road, speakers had to raise their voices to be heard over the semitrailers continually roaring by.
The trucks were evidence of the warehouse district development pressures that have been chipping away at the neighborhoods’ agricultural fabric. 
Allison Musser, who lives in the Northpointe community, said it appears state leaders chose the Northpointe neighborhood out of “convenience” because it was the “path of least resistance,” while also accusing Salt Lake City leaders of allowing “unchecked industrial expansion.”

The neighborhood — with a busy warehouse district now pushing up against it — is Salt Lake City’s “last agricultural district,” Musser said, “home to generational families, small farms and about 60 single-family homes in this area, but nearly 1,500 housing units in the larger census tract surrounding the neighborhood.”
Musser said the plans for the campus are also “fiscally reckless,” pointing to state officials’ estimates that the campus will cost upwards of $75 million to build and $34 million in ongoing funding every year — but so far no funding source has been identified. She also pointed to the overrun price tag on the state’s $1 billion prison in a wetland area in northwest Salt Lake City.
“Have we learned nothing from our costly new prison?” she said. 
The Northpointe community believes in “real solutions” to help people experiencing homelessness. “But sacrificing an established neighborhood simply because it’s the path of least resistance is not a solution,” she said. “Northpointe deserves protection.” 
Wetland concerns
Seed said the area proposed for the shelter contains wetlands — previously protected in Salt Lake County’s shoreline area preservation plan before the area was annexed into Salt Lake City — that will be “paved over with impermeable surfaces,” which could have a “really significant impact on the environment.” 
“Paving them over has implications beyond the actual site, and has ripple effects outward. From an ecological standpoint, development like this proposed mega shelter would be significantly destructive,” she said. 
Seed also pointed out mosquitos thrive in the area — much like the new Salt Lake City prison property, which has had a “horrible mosquito problem,” and “there are no good solutions.”
“You end up spraying people with pesticides, which are very dangerous, or you let them be exposed to mosquitos,” she said. 
The “mega shelter” proposal is a “horrible idea,” Seed said, that will cause more harm than good.

(Photo by Ed Saunders, used with permission). NorthWestern Energy didn’t adequately evaluate more affordable options before it built the Yellowstone County Generating Station, and it “knew it was making a risky decision” to build the plant, according to Public Service Commission legal and regulatory staff.
The monopoly utility also didn’t manage risks in a cost effective way, and it likely could have avoided $45 million in cost overruns, said the staff report.
As such, staff recommend the Public Service Commission exclude those costs from the amount NorthWestern can recover from customers in a pending rate case.
“Staff concludes that there were significant deficiencies in the planning and procurement processes that raise serious doubts about whether NorthWestern minimized total costs and risks for customers,” said Public Service Commission staff.
Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission heard recommendations from legal and regulatory staff on the case filed by NorthWestern Energy.
Public Service Commissioners did not take up a decision on the Yellowstone County Generating Station.
However, commissioners heard details from a staff report that outlined the ways NorthWestern Energy misstepped in selecting and building the methane-fired plant in Laurel, estimated at $320 million, as it evaluated its options to supply electricity to customers
In briefings, the Montana Consumer Counsel, a group of conservation organizations, a coalition of large businesses, and federal agencies agreed NorthWestern should not get to foist onto others the expenses that were the result of, as one party put it, the utility’s “lack of cost discipline.”
In the Public Service Commission staff report, analysts said NorthWestern botched the process to evaluate “the full range of cost-effective resource options” in the first place. It eliminated at least one viable option without explanation or justification, the report said.
The report also said NorthWestern never demonstrated that the Yellowstone County Generating Station “achieves the lowest long term total cost for customers.”
For example, the report said NorthWestern knew battery capacity paired with reciprocating internal combustion engine units would be low cost and low risk, but it conducted its request for proposals in a way that prevented that pairing in its cost analysis.
The analysts pointed to other problematic factors in the way NorthWestern evaluated its options, such as including the Yellowstone plant in 27 of the 36 different resource portfolios it designed, but including the “lowest-cost resource” on the shortlist in just one portfolio.
NorthWestern had resource offers that would have “entirely avoided” the risks and subsequent cost overruns to build the plant, the staff report said.
And it said NorthWestern clearly knew of the risks because it cited them when it withdrew its application for preapproval of the Yellowstone project by the Public Service Commission.
The report also said NorthWestern didn’t provide nearly enough information about the construction of the plant and its evolution, as the agency requires.
The Public Service Commission’s rules “emphasize the importance” of evaluating, managing and mitigating risk through “transparency and documentation,” the report said.
But it said NorthWestern didn’t provide any documentation to explain the reason the expected costs for the plant had increased when it terminated an agreement with one contractor and executed another, nor did it document a rationale for replacing its contractor.
In fact, the report said analysts agree with Renewable Northwest, a party that participated in the case and argued NorthWestern didn’t make its case the plant was a needed investment.
“NorthWestern has continually failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that YCGS represents a prudent investment, or to furnish the commission with sufficient data to verify that fact for itself,” the staff report said, citing Renewable Northwest.
It said a “glaring example” of how its application failed regarding transparency and documentation involves the costs of potential alternatives to the Yellowstone plant.
Over the course of nine months, NorthWestern was asked to provide the information about cost multiple times, but it failed to do so until the day the hearing started — a move that deprived the Public Service Commission and other parties of “essential information” and violated state regulations, the report said.
The staff report also said NorthWestern tried to earn a return on a portion of the Yellowstone plant that should be depreciated, which does not comply with “regulatory accounting fundamentals,” and staff recommended an adjustment accordingly.
“Staff’s recommendation would reduce NorthWestern’s proposed $287 million YCGS rate base, associated with 16 engines in use, to $227.7 million,” the report said.
The Public Service Commission is expected to take up the Yellowstone plant portion of the case at a meeting on Wednesday.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Methane-Plant-3.1-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-11-18 20:57:13.314683

Staff at All My Children Childcare on Angier Avenue locked the doors, put up signs saying agents could not enter, and called parents to tell them not to pick up their children. 
Staff tried to shield the children from the disruption and fear that gripped Durham and other cities in the Triangle when U.S. Border Patrol agents arrived Tuesday and began apprehending people. 
“We did not want them to be aware of what was going on outside,” said Elisha Muhammad, the childcare’s regional director. “It was very scary for not just me as a childcare provider, but for my staff that take care of these kids every day,” said Muhammad, who described the daycare’s children as mostly Black and brown.

Muhammad spoke at a news conference Tuesday evening organized by the immigrant rights group Siembra NC and attended by elected officials and clergy. 
The aim of the Border Patrol operation is to instill fear, speakers said. The Trump administration has sent federal agents to Democratic-led cities throughout the country in an immigration crackdown. The Border Patrol began operations in Charlotte Saturday and expanded them to the Triangle on Tuesday. 
In Charlotte and the Triangle, Border Patrol agents are detaining people who are pumping gas, walking outside grocery stores, hanging up Christmas lights and otherwise going about their daily lives, said Nikki Marin Baena, Siembra NC co-director. Her organization trains volunteers who make video recordings of federal arrests and warn people of the presence of federal immigration agents. 
Where Border Patrol is active, there are reports of businesses closed and higher-than-usual public school student absences. 
“This administration has a goal of creating intimidation and fear for the immigrant communities and then laughing about it,” Marin Baena said. 
Durham City Council member Javiera Caballero praised Durham residents for watching out for each other. 
“Durham will not be cowed,” she said. “People will always stand up and defend our neighbors.”
Andrew Willis Graces, Siembra NC senior strategist, said the organization did not know how many people in the Triangle have been detained, but about a half dozen people called the group’s hotline late Tuesday afternoon about loved ones who had been arrested. Border Patrol was spotted in at least 20 locations in the Triangle, he said, but was certain that is an undercount. 
U.S. Customs & Border Protection did not respond Tuesday night to questions about how many people from the Triangle were detained, where they are being held, and if they have criminal records. 
In Raleigh, a few hundred people gathered in Moore Square, holding signs decrying ICE and Border Patrol and chanting “down, down with deportation.”
“Our friends, our neighbors, our family members are now being forced into hiding,” said Nicole Drapluk, an organizer with the Triangle chapter of the Party of Socialism and Liberation. “Afraid of being kidnapped from their own homes, for simply being human. And they have the nerve to tell us this is about getting criminals off the streets.”
Another Raleigh protest speaker criticized Gov. Josh Stein’s statements on the immigration raids, saying he “can’t open his mouth without saying how much he can’t do for our immigrant community.”
At an event in Johnston County Tuesday, Stein, a Democrat, said his administration has gotten no information about the sweep from federal immigration authorities. He accused Border Patrol agents of “operating in the shadows” in the weekend crackdown in Charlotte. 
“If this were targeted to going after known people who are criminals or known people who are drug traffickers who are engaged in violent crime, that would be a good thing,” Stein said. “But they’re just sweeping sidewalks. They’re sweeping parking lots. They’re going into stores and churches.”
“This is causing widespread fear, widespread uncertainty,” Stein added. “This is not about public safety.”
State Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham), speaking at the news conference outside the daycare center, she was proud of everyone who rallied to protect neighbors.
“We have seen this authoritarian playbook before,” she said. “As a Jew, my people know this all too well. It always starts with attacking immigrants, and it never ends there. I know this in my body, as an elected official, it is my responsibility to do everything that I can to speak out and to stop families from being torn apart.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4596-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 20:57:13.314683

Mike Cheokas (left), an Americus Republican, listens while Austin Hackney, executive vice president of Home Builders Association of Georgia, presents the bill on Nov. 18, 2025 in Atlanta. Georgia House of Representatives livestreamProponents of a bill designed to speed up the construction permitting process say the changes are needed to address a lack of affordable housing. 
But local officials and environmental groups warn the proposal would add a “shot clock” that could compromise public safety and lead to increased water pollution from construction runoff.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Cheokas, an Americus Republican, and backed by the home building industry, was met with sharp opposition Tuesday at an off-session hearing before a subcommittee of the House Governmental Affairs Committee. 
The measure could limit local governments’ ability to adopt more stringent building codes by requiring a Georgia Department of Community Affairs review and accelerating the review timelines for denied soil erosion permits. The bill would mandate a specific written list of deficiencies and a subsequent 14-day review period.
“The bill that you see in front of you … amends the existing statute to give that approval or disapproval process some teeth. If a local government wants to adopt a more stringent mandate in the construction code, they can continue to do that, but our goal would be for (DCA) to review that local amendment and make a binding determination about its need and whether it should be adopted locally,” said the executive vice president of Home Builders Association of Georgia, Austin Hackney, who sat next to Cheokas during the presentation.
The association and other proponents said that the delays, which they say can occur after a project has already received zoning approval, turn a process that should take two months into a year or more ordeal.
“Currently, I’ve heard horror stories of the length of time it takes for contractors to get a building permit,” said Cheokas, saying that such delays add to the cost of housing. He argued his measure is one step toward addressing the rising cost of homes.
The proposal faced pushback from the Georgia Municipal Association and the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, which expressed concern that the mandated deadlines would compromise public safety and environmental oversight.
Noah Roenitz, senior governmental relations associate with the Georgia Municipal Association, said a main reason for delays is not “politics” or “obstruction,” but “incomplete submissions, unlicensed engineers drawing plans, repeated revisions that introduced new scopes to the developments, and understaffing.”
The legislation was also opposed by environmental groups and Soil and Water Conservation Districts. Chattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth, a district supervisor with the Fulton County Soil and Water Conservation District, said the accelerated timelines could apply to gigantic commercial projects like data centers, not just housing, saying it would cause “a lot of confusion, a lot of heartache.”
“I’m all for expediting housing, but to apply it to every project in Georgia is pretty tough to do, I think. And I’ll say this, I have reviewed thousands of plans. I’m a certified plan designer. I’m a certified plan reviewer. And out of all the plans that I see, the ones that slow down are the ones who don’t do it right,” Ulseth said.

(Photo courtesy of the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality)The Arkansas Board of Corrections voted Tuesday to spend $1.95 million on upgrades and repair work at the Cummins-Varner Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The decision came after the Arkansas Advocate published a deep dive into the delays and shifting timelines for fixing the plant, which has been under a consent order with the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality for persistent water permit violations since 2022.
Fix for aging Arkansas prison wastewater plant years behind schedule

The funds to pay for the work will come from the state’s prison construction trust fund.
According to the board’s meeting documents, the money will be used to construct new mechanical bar screens at the front end of the Cummins plant’s treatment process, in order to “intercept and remove large solid objects … from raw sewage before it enters more sensitive treatment stages.”
The department cited inadequate screening last year as one of the reasons for some of the plant’s permit violations. New fine screens, which catch smaller objects as the name suggests, have already been installed.
“This is just the first little thing to start [the work], because we can’t finance the whole thing up front,” said Eddie Powell, the department’s assistant director of construction and maintenance.
The department missed an initial 2024 deadline for completing repairs and returning the facility to compliance with its wastewater permit. Despite an extension of the deadline to 2027, the corrections department has yet to move beyond the early planning stages on an expansion of the plant’s capacity.
The plant treats waste from two of the state’s largest prisons — the Cummins and Varner Units in Lincoln County — and is at least 50 years old, according to a report filed with DEQ in 2021. It hasn’t had any significant upgrades since 2001, the corrections department said last year.
Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace told board members Tuesday that “this isn’t the first thing that’s been done” at the plant, “but we are to the point in making improvements that it’s going to take a significant amount of money.”
Equipment repairs in 2022 coincided with fewer pollution limit violations, and records viewed by the Advocate show that the department has continued repairing and replacing other plant components since then — though violations have continued to creep upward as the plant ages.
The $1.95 million will be used for “off-the-shelf improvements” that can be completed quickly, Wallace said. The department is still looking at how it will pay for the rest of the long-needed work.
“The [original] plan was to build a whole new treatment plant, but the longer that had gone down the road of looking for funding sources, the more expensive” the project got, Wallace said. “We’re trying to get the most bang for our buck. … This will be a significant step for us.”
In 2021, the DOC’s engineering consultant initially said the department would construct a 3.25 million gallon per day replacement plant to permanently fix issues, though it has since pivoted to expanding the existing plant.
The corrections department’s most recent progress report indicated it won’t be in compliance until 2028. Other documents obtained from the department put the projected compliance date as late as mid-2030 — three years after a revised compliance deadline and six past the original.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image-11-7-25-at-3.07 PM-1024x769.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 20:57:13.314683

(Provided by American Prairie)American Prairie says it has no other option than to sue the Gianforte administration and Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation because the agency refuses to complete an environmental review and issue a grazing lease for a portion of its bison operations.
American Prairie, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating and maintaining one of the nation’s largest nature reserves, owns large swaths of property and has been dedicated to promoting and preserving prairie land and graze bison. It also offers hunting and recreational opportunities throughout central, northern and eastern Montana.
In a lawsuit filed in Lewis and Clark County District Court, American Prairie said that it renewed a grazing lease, originally granted by the state in 2009, when it expired in 2019. Since then, though, the lawsuit said that the department has sat on the application, arguing at times that it was not bound to the Montana Environmental Policy Act, and conversely that the Act allowed it to take no action on the grazing renewal.
The state DNRC said it has told American Prairie officials that because the land is adjacent to federal grazing land leased by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, it is awaiting a final decision about bison grazing there before taking action on its state permit. Currently, the Gianforte administration is challenging the federal lease to American Prairie, saying that federal grazing law does not allow bison, but a federal administrative judge previously rejected that argument and refused to stop American Prairie’s bison grazing. The Gianforte has appealed that federal decision, and court filings say it could take years to resolve. But for now, the federal leases remain intact.
The legal dispute appears to be part of an ongoing campaign by Gov. Greg Gianforte and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, both Republicans, to push back against American Prairie, which they say threatens Montana cattle and beef producers. However, American Prairie’s origins remain rooted in the conservative conservation policies championed by Bozeman-based Property and Environmental Research Center, which advocates for conservation by private property acquisition.
  Timelines 

In court documents, American Prairie said that it submitted a completed application to the DNRC in 2019, requesting approval for bison grazing on state trust lands. DNRC requires a review under MEPA laws, but the conservation group argues that state law sets out a specific timeline. It argues that the DNRC must complete a public scoping within 60 days of a completed application, and an environmental review with in 90.
According to court documents, neither action has happened — something the agency doesn’t appear to dispute.
However, American Prairie officials say that despite communication to DNRC Director Amanda Kaster and though department officials recommended approving the lease, the agency has not yet acted on the six-year-old application. Attorneys Mary Cochenour and Matthew Cochenour of Helena, who are representing American Prairie, say that the DNRC has used contradictory legal rationale — at times arguing that the agency isn’t subject to MEPA statutes as a state agency, while also telling American Prairie that MEPA allows it to “take no action” on a state lease, something the conservation group disputes.
American Prairie is taking a rare legal move of filing for a writ of mandamus, a legal maneuver that asks a court to compel a person or agency to complete a task outlined in law. The lawsuit also asks the court to declare that the DNRC has intentionally ignored the request and should be forced to order the grazing permit since American Prairie says the permit complies with law and the organization has used the grazing land previously.
The lawsuit also alleges that the DNRC has granted bison grazing permits on other parcels of state, including noted media mogul Ted Turner’s land. The group alleges that not only has its due process rights been violated, but it has been targeted for unequal treatment.
The lawsuit also claims that MEPA was revised more than 20 years ago by the 2001 Legislature to include a timeline of approval so that the law couldn’t be used to delay decisions indefinitely, which they say is now the case.
“The 2001 Montana Legislature, concerned that MEPA was being used as an obstructionist tool to delay projects, imposed strict timelines for agencies to complete environmental review with the goal of accelerating environmental review,” the lawsuit said.
  Cattle, bison and Montana law 

American Prairie also pointed out in its court filing that Montana law doesn’t differentiate between cattle and bison. According to the lawsuit, the department manages the land based on a measurement called “animal units month.” Essentially the statistic is meant to gauge the “carrying capacity” of any piece of land. For example, grazing sheep or smaller animals on land takes less forage, water and may have lesser impact on soil and vegetation as the same number of larger animals, like cattle. Since 2009, Montana has applied one AUM for cattle and bison, meaning they’re measured identically by grazing officials.
While American Prairie said that some changes to the lease — like changing use from grazing to agriculture or recreation — would take a review, state trust leases do not require a change on a grazing lease depending on animal, so long as they obey the AUM limits.
“Although the state leases themselves do not require agency approval for change of class, DNRC has long required MEPA environmental review from changing grazing from cattle to bison on state lands,” the lawsuit said.
The DNRC last month told American Prairie officials that it was waiting until a final decision was reached by federal officials, although that could take years.
“DNRC has refused to perform its own independent MEPA analysis related to bison grazing on state trust lands until its appeals of the federal final decision are resolved, even though DNRC is not bound by such federal action,” the lawsuit said. “The appeals could be active for years and could outlive the 10-year leases.”
Currently the federal leases are being reviewed by the BLM’s Office of Hearings and Appeals, and the lawsuit notes that there are multiple levels of challenges that could continue, including going as far as the United States Supreme Court, likely years aways.
“DNRC cannot both require MEPA analysis and, at the same time, invoke an exemption to avoid MEPA procedures, which is exactly what the agency is doing here. Either MEPA applies, or it does not,” the lawsuit said. “DNRC’s expansive interpretation of the MEPA exemption statute— using it to garner authority to not act all all on any decision, MEPA or otherwise — is an abuse of the agency’s authority and, at best, an arbitrary and capricious and unlawful act by the agency.”
American Prairie said that in addition to legal costs, which it is asking the courts to award, it has now been forced to purchase thousands in materials and spend time to comply with the DNRC’s delaying a decision.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington state budget writers got a mild dose of good news on Tuesday, but are still looking at a strained balance sheet.
Revenue projections show collections up $105 million for the current two-year state budget compared to the last forecast in September. That amounts to a 0.1% increase, a change from previous reports showing precipitous drops.
House Democrats’ chief budget writer, Timm Ormsby, called the forecast a “little welcome relief.”
“We’ve leveled out a bit and stabilized, which was pleasing, but it certainly doesn’t take away from the challenges and difficult decisions we’re going to have to make in the upcoming session,” said Ormsby, of Spokane. “At least we’re not going backwards.”
In the late September forecast, anticipated collections had slid over half a billion dollars since Gov. Bob Ferguson signed off on the new two-year budget in May. Tuesday’s projections inch the state back toward even.
Tuesday’s forecast is the last one before lawmakers return to Olympia on Jan. 12 for a 60-day legislative session where they’ll adjust the budget. 
Attention next turns to Gov. Bob Ferguson. 
The first-term Democrat will release a budget plan before Christmas, with his proposed tweaks to the two-year, $77.8-billion framework lawmakers passed this year. This current budget runs through June 30, 2027.
“This forecast was not as bad as we feared,” he said in a statement. Still, he said, “This forecast does not change the scale of the problem that my team and I have been working on.”
Ferguson said the next round of budgeting will involve “many difficult decisions” as the state works through deep financial challenges. He said he’d propose a plan that “preserves core services but still makes investments in important areas.”
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, in a statement, said the forecast won’t force the governor to “change course.”
“We will see in a matter of weeks whether he is on the side of taking even more money for government or standing with the families of our state, who have to live within their means,” said Gildon.
Talk of further hikes
Long-term, the state’s budget outlook is still not good. 
Estimates show the $105 million rise in expected revenues will be dashed by the end of the next fiscal cycle. 
Total revenue through mid-2029 will be down $66 million since projections in September, the state’s chief economist, Dave Reich, told the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council on Tuesday. This includes a slight uptick in revenue in the now-finished 2023-25 budget. 
This year, Democratic lawmakers passed billions in new and increased taxes, along with spending cuts, to balance the budget amid a shortfall in the $12 billion to $16 billion range. 
The dispiriting projections are driving discussion about additional revenue ideas for 2026, including the untested “wealth tax” and, possibly, an income tax on richer Washingtonians. 
But late last month, Ferguson said he was “skeptical of additional revenue.” This year, he rejected a number of tax proposals before signing the eventual package lawmakers approved, which was slimmed from their earlier proposals.
Sen. June Robinson, the Senate Democrats’ budget lead, has already told her Senate colleagues to not even bother asking for earmarks next year from the state’s operating budget because of Washington’s budget crunch. 
Robinson and Ormsby are set to meet with Ferguson next Monday to discuss budget plans.
Verging on a recession?
Tuesday’s forecast pegs revenue fueling this budget at over $74.4 billion. While Washington operates on a two-year budget cycle, the budget has to be balanced across four years.
Lagging housing permits and employment growth were drags on Tuesday’s forecast, while it benefits from tobacco settlement payouts and projected increases in estate tax revenue. Statewide employment isn’t likely to grow in 2026, Reich said.
“One explanation could be, we’re actually heading into a recession. They’re hard to see those coming,” Reich said. “But another explanation, and one that many economists have been talking about, is just that we’re in this kind of period of not only slow demand, but slow supply.”
Moody’s Analytics recently listed Washington among nearly half of U.S. states that are in or near a recession. State Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, said the state’s policies would be to blame for this, not the federal government. 
“If that’s true, we’ve put ourselves into a recession,” said Couture, the budget lead for House Republicans.
The latest forecast only covers the state’s operating budget, which funds everything from public schools and health care to social services and prisons. 
There are separate revenue projections for transportation. Estimates for the transportation budget last week showed an expected $66 million drop in receipts over the next four years, compared to predictions from September. That factors in better-than-anticipated returns in the 2023-25 cycle.
The next operating budget forecast is expected in February.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washington-state-capitol-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 20:57:13.314683

(Courtesy of 1X2 Architecture)OMAHA — A $40 million redevelopment project poised to dramatically change the look of the Little Bohemia neighborhood south of downtown Omaha got a final nod Tuesday to kick into action.
Tom McLeay of Clarity Development, who is leading the “Little Bo Village” mixed-use venture, said the Omaha City Council’s 6-0 approval of tax-increment financing contract language means site and demolition work should start in the next few weeks.
About $8.2 million in often-controversial public TIF financing will help build the multifaceted project centered along the South 13th Street corridor south of William Street. The city previously approved the general TIF plan, as well as rezoning and other components of the village.
$40M Little Bo Village project aims to be a ‘front door’ to Nebraska’s largest downtown

When done, one square city block and parts of two others will be transformed with 10 new or revamped buildings that contain a total of about 160 new residential dwellings, restaurants, retail and recreational venues, such as pickleball courts and a swimming pool.
McLeay, who has finished other redevelopment projects in the area, expects his latest to be done in phases and wrap up within two years.
He said the village is the most sizable redevelopment initiative in Little Bohemia in a century. Among its bigger components is a 113-unit apartment complex near 14th and Briggs Streets.
“Development is finally starting to move south of downtown in neighborhoods that have needed it for a long time,” said McLeay.
The project faced opposition along the way by some merchants concerned about parking.
The village area was rezoned to a “neighborhood business district,” a designation that has no minimum parking space requirements. Guests are to rely on street and neighborhood area parking. 
McLeay has said that many who are drawn to the area walk and use ride-hailing services to get around. He said it would not be financially feasible to redevelop and modernize such older, urban pockets if parking ratios were as strict as in newer suburban areas.



Tax-increment financing
How TIF works typically: Increased property taxes generated by new improvements on TIF sites are diverted over 15 or 20 years to help developers pay eligible costs of transforming the area.
The tool was created to help spur economic development. Critics have objected in part because local taxing jurisdictions forgo that increased property tax while the developer’s loan is being paid off.
A TIF project requires approval from a city. State law says the venture must be in a “blighted” area and be deemed impossible for development “but for” the subsidy.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s Statewide Official Compensation Commission voted on Tuesday to increase the salaries of 11 statewide elected officials. 
These salary increases total around $413,000 dollars per year. 
The commission previously voted Nov. 12 to increase salaries by more than $500,000, but rescinded this decision and approved different numbers.
The median household income in Oklahoma is just over $66,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Salary adjustments range from increases of 18% to over 40%.
Changes to salaries will not go into effect until after the next general election in November 2026.  
Salary increases include: 

The governor will make $185,000, up from $147,000; 
The lieutenant governor will earn $150,000 a year, up from $114,713;  
The attorney general’s salary was bumped up to $175,000, an increase from $132,825; 
The state superintendent will make $175,000, up from $124,373. The panel had previously voted to increase this to $250,000; 
The treasurer’s salary will be $160,000, an increase from $114,713; 
The state auditor and inspector’s salary increased to $160,000, up from $114,713; 
The insurance commissioner will make $150,000, an increase from $126,713; 
The labor commissioner will earn $130,000, up from $105,053; and 
The three members of the Corporation Commissioners will each make $150,000, an increase from $114,713. 

The Commission also included language in each motion that if any current lawmakers are elected to a statewide position, they can serve and earn the old salary. 
“This was some language to try to least set that this body felt like should a sitting legislator want to run for a statewide office, our action here shouldn’t keep them from their ability to do that,” said David “Chip” Carter, chair of the Commission. 
Former Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City, questioned the panel’s transparency during a public comment period and said there was no public knowledge of what the proposed salary changes were ahead of the meeting. 
The panel discussed salary changes behind closed doors in an executive session after discussing them in public at a meeting last week. 
Carter said the executive session allowed members to discuss changes to salaries more freely.
“I think we were able to sit down and have a good conversation and have a chance to just reflect on what happened last meeting,” he said. “I think everybody wanted a do-over after last meeting.”
He said the Commission determined the new salaries based on inflation. He said in the years since the last salary adjustment, inflation had grown around 50%. 
“I think all of us are aware of what’s being said and thought,” Carter said. “And we wanted to both do the right thing for the state’s elected officials, but also be very mindful of the hard working Oklahomans and how they will receive that, particularly when we’ve been in a hard economic climate here recently.”
The group was forced to reconvene after it was discovered that a member, James Leewright, was a registered lobbyist and ineligible to be on the board. Leewright is a former Republican lawmaker. House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, then replaced Leewright with Krista Ratliff.
There were three other new members of the panel on Tuesday, including Bill Kern and Charlie Hannema, appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, and Leslie Walker, appointed by Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle. They replaced Chairman Brian Jackson, Robert DeNegri and Gary Unruh.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Every member of Nebraska’s all-Republican congressional delegation voted for a bill to compel the U.S. Department of Justice to release all files related to its investigation into late Florida sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
After months of stalling by House GOP leaders and White House pressure to prevent the vote — with a federal government shutdown in between — the House voted 427-1 to advance the bill that had to be forced onto the House floor last week by a bipartisan discharge petition. 
Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., had told the Examiner in September that he would vote for releasing the files if the measure reached the floor after not signing the discharge petition. Bacon has criticized President Donald Trump’s handling of the files.
He said he supported the release of “any Epstein documents held by the executive branch,” but he has said he presumed there’s not much there, because both sides have leaked them over the past five years.
“This is the most porous town in the world … I’m also proud of the work done by the Oversight Committee that has released thousands of documents to the public already,” Bacon said in a statement. 
A House committee has subpoenaed people seeking more information, including Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s co-conspirator, several former U.S. attorneys, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 
The committee, led by U.S. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., released a massive trove of emails from Epstein’s estate after the panel’s Democrats released a selection of the correspondence that included the allegation that Trump “knew about the girls because he asked ghislaine to stop.”

Some emails have hinted that Epstein has ties to Israeli intelligence, according to left-leaning news site Drop Site News. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, alluded to this during a CNN interview last week. 
Hours after the House vote, the Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. It heads to Trump Tuesday evening. U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., told the Examiner he would vote for it. 
“Jeffrey Epstein committed disgusting, illegal acts. I support releasing the Epstein files. Protecting his victims is also incredibly important,” Ricketts said.

U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., had no immediate comment on the vote. 
The discharge petition that pushed the bill to the floor, co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, and Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, got the needed signatures after the House’s newest Democrat, Arizona’s Adelita Grijalva, was sworn in last week. 
Three other House Republicans, Greene, South Carolina’s Nancy Mace and Colorado’s Lauren Boebert, joined all Democrats in signing on. 
Trump changed course and told House Republicans to vote for the bill on Sunday night after he failed to pressure them to withdraw their signatures. The move is seen as a political retreat to avoid an embarrassing loss for the White House. 
Trump said Monday that he would sign the bill if Congress passes it. 
Nebraska’s 1st District U.S. Rep. Mike Flood voted for the bill. He told NOTUS he was a “yes two months ago.” He criticized the bill in September, saying it was “written in a sloppy way” and “all-out reckless” to CNN. He opposed the discharge petition, he said, because “I support regular order.” 
But Flood restated his support for releasing the Epstein files and hoped the Senate would tweak the bill. 
Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith said the “vote is another small step towards accountability and justice for the survivors of these heinous crimes.”

City councilors passed a resolution calling for better oversight after UVM students described mold, leaks and other issues in the university dorms.

The Burlington City Council decided Monday to seek more accountability from the University of Vermont and Champlain College on housing conditions in student dorms in response to UVM student complaints of poor living conditions.
In the past few weeks, students at the University of Vermont have brought their concerns to City Council meetings. Students read multiple testimonies describing water leaks, mold, insect and rodent sightings, defective heating systems, inoperative elevators, inadequate living space with rooms for two people converted into “forced triple,” and more, while highlighting the lack of a timely and effective response when they submitted complaints to the university.
Ben Robke and Alva Yanowitz, UVM students and representatives of the Student Tenant Union, which was created in September 2024, said the union had six meetings with the university administration to discuss these issues but didn’t see any progress.
They said some of their requests included a cap on enrollment to ensure less crowded dorms and avoid overburdening Burlington’s housing market; compliance with safety and habitability standards; an end to the tiered housing system — where room cost varies by dorm, making it hard for some students to access dorms with better housing conditions — improvements in housing accessibility; and increased transparency.
“We found that the university was not interested in meeting our demands,” Robke said, so the students decided to bring the issues in front of the City Council.
Councilor Marek Broderick, P-Ward 8, who is also a UVM student, sponsored a resolution that the council passed unanimously Monday. 
During the meeting, Broderick said that UVM has failed to provide the Department of Permitting and Inspections with records of certifications showing the university has conducted regular inspections in student dorms and certified compliance with the city’s minimum housing standards.

The resolution requests that UVM and Champlain College share details on their inspection and complaints systems and data on housing code violations from the beginning of the 2023-24 academic year to the passage of the resolution, which should be submitted within the next three months.
Additionally, the resolution tasked DPI with creating a template for universities to use to certify comprehensive inspection and complaint procedures, and called on the council’s Ordinance Committee to determine whether the existing regulations go far enough to ensure university dormitories are safe and healthy for residents. The Ordinance Committee will also consider whether universities and colleges should provide students with information to submit external complaints to DPI.
In a letter to DPI, Amanda Clayton, executive director of facilities management at UVM, listed the services the university provides to ensure safe living conditions and align with minimum housing standards but said there are limitations on what the city can regulate. 
“The minimum housing standards are outside of the scope for what can be regulated by the municipality and certification of every aspect of these standards would interfere with the intended functional use of the institution and place an exceptional and undue burden on the University,” she wrote.
Hence, the resolution also asks the City Attorney’s Office to weigh in on the city’s authority to require universities and colleges to comply with housing habitability codes and inspection requirements and provide certifications of their compliance. 
“The city gives the university a courtesy and a privilege to allow it to conduct its own inspections,” Councilor Evan Litwin (D-Ward 7) said. “We need to be in lockstep with the university for that to work.”
Adam White, director of communications at UVM, wrote in a statement to VTDigger that the university is working with students “to evaluate and improve processes and outcomes related to residence halls.”
Robke said the students were pleased with the outcome of the City Council meetings, but there was still a lot of work to be done. 
“We plan on showing up to these ordinance meetings and making our voice continue to be heard,” he said, adding that the students plan to continue having conversations with UVM to end the tiered housing system, ensure gender inclusive and accessible housing, and institute an enrollment cap.
“We are really hoping that people are able to see that this is not just an isolated problem, and that things that are affecting UVM students are also affecting Burlington and Vermont residents,” Yanowitz said.

The governor's $11.1 billion request would boost state worker pay, bolster wildfire-fighting capacity and renovate the veterans home in Buffalo, among other things. 
The post Here’s what Gov. Mark Gordon is proposing for Wyoming’s next budget appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon released his budget recommendations Monday, outlining an $11.1 billion proposal to boost state worker pay, bolster wildfire-fighting capacity, renovate the veterans home in Buffalo and put $250 million into permanent savings, among other priorities.
“The state government we have should only provide what is absolutely needed and what people cannot do for themselves,” Gordon wrote in his budget letter. “It should function effectively and efficiently and focus on the essentials.” 
Gordon is also proposing the Legislature — which ultimately holds the purse strings — use state dollars to cover a reduction in federal money for SNAP benefits, increase funding for waivers that support developmentally disabled residents, and immediately appropriate $9.3 million to the Department of Corrections to cover housing costs for inmates incarcerated outside the state. 
“In the last six years, our conservative fiscal discipline maintained the state through two of its largest losses of income: a major pandemic and prior [presidential] administration bent on humiliating every industry that built Wyoming,” Gordon wrote. “After years of extraordinary budget volatility, this budget is an heir to our conservative philosophy and predicated on the fundamentals from which Wyoming emerged.”
The two branches
The governor’s recommendations now go to the Joint Appropriations Committee for consideration as the panel begins its budget hearings the first week in December. The panel is ultimately responsible for drafting a budget to present to the entire Legislature when it convenes in February. 
Gordon’s two-year budget proposal marks his last in his second term as governor. It is, however, his first since the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won control of the House in 2024. Its allies and members also make up the majority of the House Appropriations Committee, and have committed to cutting the budget. The group has criticized Gordon in the past for not being conservative enough.

The Freedom Caucus hasn’t presented a plan for where and how deep those cuts may go, but the group of conservatives has at least said it’s aiming for “pre-pandemic spending levels.” 
Gordon appeared to caution lawmakers against that approach in his budget proposal. 
“Wouldn’t it be great if everything still cost what it did back a decade ago? Despite all that will be said, this budget — like those before it — is fiscally responsible, consistent with modest, essential growth to maintain the essential services our citizens expect, and within the norms of overall inflation,” Gordon wrote. 
“Nostalgia is sweet, but it is not a recipe for the future. We cannot budget in the past to prepare for our future,” Gordon wrote. 
Instead, the governor said his office “remains committed to four core principles.” They are to: “Protect Wyoming citizens and ensure their future,” “Support core industries, grow new ones, and expand opportunities,” “Maintain and improve effective and efficient government,” and “Respect the principle that the government is best when it is closest to the people.”
It’s not unusual for the Legislature and the executive branch to spar on the budget, nor is it out of place to see contentious debate between appropriators. The last two-year budget passed the Senate by just two votes after most Freedom Caucus members and allies voted against it in the House. Plus, lawmakers will have to deal with the decision they made earlier this year not to pass a supplemental budget — an unprecedented move. 
Savings and SNAP
“Much has been made in the news about our investment income, which is expected to be the largest source of revenue this year,” Gordon wrote in his letter. 
As WyoFile previously reported, earnings from the state’s investment portfolio realized a record high of $1.86 billion in revenue. That’s 25% more than Wyoming’s severance taxes and federal mineral royalties combined. 
“But what does that really mean? This biennium alone, every Wyoming taxpayer can thank Wyoming’s Treasurer for the investment portfolio reducing the overall tax burden,” Gordon wrote. 
And as such, Gordon recommended $250 million be added to permanent savings — which produce investment earnings — “to protect against hard times and benefit Wyoming’s future taxpayers,” he wrote. 
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which was supported by Wyoming’s congressional delegation, cut federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that over 28,000 state residents, mostly children, rely on to buy groceries. Gordon proposed that lawmakers spend $5.5 million to mitigate that reduction. 
“When working mothers and fathers are unable to meet the family’s wholesome nutritional needs, despite working sometimes three jobs, we have to acknowledge the problem,” he said.
Gordon also highlighted the newly formed Rural Health Transformation Program, another product of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which earmarked $50 billion to strengthen health care access and outcomes in rural communities.

Wyoming stands to receive up $800 million through the program. The state’s application, Gordon wrote, addresses “the most pressing of Wyoming’s rural healthcare needs, such as adequate access to obstetric labor and delivery services, support for rural healthcare providers, including our small hospital and EMS services, and our behavioral health crisis system.”
Otherwise, Gordon suggested lawmakers “make reasonable adjustments” to several Wyoming Department of Health items to account for rising costs and to “maintain access to safety net services.” 
Department of Health
The Department of Health has the largest budget of any state agency, which prompted lawmakers to form a subcommittee in the legislative off-season to scrutinize its spending.
Approximately 95% of the department’s budget covers medical services, including at facilities such as the Wyoming State Hospital in Evanston, the Life Resource Center in Lander and the Veterans’ Home of Wyoming in Buffalo. 
“This has been a fact-finding thing,” Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, who chairs the committee, previously told WyoFile. “This isn’t a grudge match. This isn’t going out and trying to hack with a meat cleaver or anything. But the necessary may well be there — that we’re going to be forced to do some cutting. And if that is the case, we want to do so as judiciously as possible.”
In its own budget proposal, the department requested $3 billion, with federal funding accounting for more than half of that sum. The governor recommended $14.1 million less. 
“In accordance with legislative directives, I request the current year’s external cost adjustment for developmental preschools,” Gordon wrote in his budget letter. “Additionally, to sustain Wyoming’s provider network for critical services, my budget recommends increases to assure care for people with developmental disabilities, increase home health reimbursements for high needs children, improve access to maternity services for new moms and families, and continue providing community based resources that allow seniors and those with disabilities to stay in their homes longer.”
Prisons and fires 
In even-numbered years, lawmakers craft the state’s upcoming two-year budget, also known as a biennium budget. In odd-numbered years, the Legislature works on the supplemental budget — which as the name implies, supplements the financial plan already in effect. 
But because Senate leadership ultimately chose not to pass a supplemental budget earlier this year, Gordon said the Department of Corrections’ budget “needs immediate attention.”

“While the Department is successful in recruiting and training new correctional officers, the chronic high number of employee vacancies delay the return of many out-of-state prisoners,” Gordon wrote. “The Department used its flex authority to cover the out-of-state housing costs, but requires $9.3 million to be effective immediately to cover those financial obligations.”
Gordon also requested lawmakers earmark $9.6 million to help the Department of Corrections account for the increased food, medical and utilities costs after the Legislature did not provide inflation-related funds in 2024. 
After a historic wildfire season in 2024, and another active one this year, the governor is asking lawmakers to “expand and rethink our ability and approach to wildland fires and other disasters.”
More specifically, Gordon is recommending the Legislature spend $4.5 million to establish two firefighting modules, including expanding the state’s Smoke Buster program, and to replenish the state’s emergency fire suppression account to $20 million.
“Wyoming is blessed with willing, competent, and committed volunteers, who drop everything at moment’s notice to go fight fire, especially when a neighbor’s place is ablaze,” Gordon wrote. “However, the size and scope of recent fire activity often simply exceeds a volunteer’s available time away from work and family.”
Local governments, energy and water 
Lawmakers have been considering changing the way the state distributes sales tax to local governments. More specifically, there’s a proposal to increase the percentage local governments receive as well as codifying that formula — the idea being to provide more certainty for local budgets. 
In the meantime, Gordon recommended the customary $105 million distribution, “with the caveat that it be suspended should the Legislature increase the current sales tax distribution to local governments.”
That type of “support is vital now,” Gordon wrote, “especially with recent property tax reductions affecting local funding for schools, roads, snow plowing, fire, water irrigation, and sewer districts.”
The governor warned lawmakers that “how our state, her communities and people will adjust to a new, narrower, tax structure is not yet fully understood.”
Meanwhile, Gordon wrote that the “2025 change in federal administration portends well for Wyoming,” quoting Teddy Roosevelt’s view that “conservation means development as much as it does preservation.”
As such, Gordon recommended that lawmakers fully fund the Department of Environmental Quality’s budget request of $165.5 million “to capitalize on this window of opportunity.”
“I also recommend expenditures that will continue internationally recognized leadership in energy-related research, including continued enhanced oil recovery research, the full development of our coal pyrolysis plant in Gillette to produce more products from coal, and research to extract critical minerals from coal ash,” Gordon wrote. 
The governor also warned lawmakers about water.
“The prize of control of our water becomes ever more pronounced,” as the state continues to deal with drought, he wrote. 
Gordon requested $5 million to buttress the Wyoming Attorney General on water litigation as well as two full-time employees in the State Engineer’s Office. The governor also recommended $9.4 million to run the Wyoming Water Development Office and $30 million for a new water development program.

Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s School Financing Review Commission finished the first phase of its task to recommend ways to improve the state’s school funding system, but its next steps may prove more challenging.
At its fourth meeting Tuesday, commission members approved a report that will be presented to the Nebraska Legislature on or before Dec. 1.
The report shared preliminary findings the commission made about the current landscape of K-12 education funding in Nebraska and gave a glimpse into what the commission will examine over the next year.
“(We’re putting) something together as a point to discuss, a point to argue from, today, so we’re not starting from scratch,” said Brian Maher, Nebraska’s education commissioner who chairs the commission.
The commission was established earlier this year through the passage of Legislative Bill 303 from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who now serves on the commission as a non-voting member. It includes 18 members, the majority of which are school administrators and current or former state legislators.
Under Hughes’ law, the new commission has no expiration date.
The first meeting was in August, and since then members have been working to build a first report ahead of the Dec. 1 deadline. The next report won’t be due until Nov. 1, 2026, with annual reports slated to continue coming each November after.
Preliminary findings
The report’s central finding covers the shifting balance of funding sources going to Nebraska’s school districts. The state currently carries the majority of school funding, at 52.6%, while local and county spending on schools has fallen to about 38% — a reversal from the previous five years, when local property taxes accounted for the majority of support.
According to data the Nebraska Department of Education shared in September, public schools accounted for about $5.3 billion in estimated spending in the 2024-25 fiscal year, combining state, federal, county and local revenues.

The report notes that the shift to focus more on state aid for schools resembles what neighboring states have done in recent years. Liz Standish, a commission member and associate superintendent for Lincoln Public Schools, said she expects this change will improve Nebraska’s rankings with other states in terms of school funding.

Much of this shift can be attributed to recent policy changes over the last five years. In 2023, lawmakers approved $1,500 in per-pupil foundation state aid to schools, and doubled the state’s special education reimbursements from 40% to 80% of allowable expenditures.
Despite this, the report notes that there are still significant differences among general fund levies across Nebraska’s 244 school districts, and several commission members expressed concerns with how much some districts spend. Hughes has said one of her goals is to bring statewide levy rates closer together.
Next steps
The report hints at what the commission will focus on in the second phase of research. Ideas include recommending a “target” for the proportion of state aid going to schools, assessing key aspects of Nebraska’s current school funding formula and ensuring that existing state aid to schools doesn’t erode over time.
Former State Treasurer Tom Briese, who serves on the commission, suggested the report list some of the “hard conversations” he expects in phase two. Some of the topics he listed were analyzing district spending — including administrative costs, spending caps and the adequacy of spending compared to district outcomes — as well as considering new revenue sources for schools and evaluating the efficacy of past legislative proposals.
While hearing Briese’s suggestions initially made Maher “bristle” as a former superintendent, he said he realized that his reservations gave the commission even more reason to have those discussions, rather than shy away from them. Standish requested that the list of subjects be kept “neutral” and that commission members shouldn’t have pre-formed opinions on any of the topics.
Former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn, another member of the commission, backed Briese’s suggestion, saying that identifying the challenges ahead for the commission will increase the chances the Legislature takes them seriously.
“If you don’t put down that it’s going to be hard and what we’re going to discuss, we won’t be taken seriously by the Legislature,” Linehan said. “Because if we don’t say we’re going to look at these things, and we’re going to have … discussions, then what are we doing?”
Maher will provide the Legislature’s Education Committee with an update Thursday about the commission’s progress.

(Main photo via Google Earth; inset photo courtesy the family of Kerry Morris)An Iowa nursing home company has faced at least 17 wrongful-death and negligence lawsuits over the past 16 months, a review of court records shows.
The lawsuits have been filed against Care Initiatives, a nonprofit corporation based in West Des Moines that operates 43 Iowa nursing homes as well as several assisted living centers and hospice locations.
While some of the lawsuits have been settled out of court and dismissed during the past 16 months, others are still being litigated or have been stayed as the disputes are handled through private arbitration. In each of the lawsuits, Care Initiatives has denied any wrongdoing.

The company, which says it does not comment on pending litigation, cares for roughly 2,800 elderly or disabled Iowans who receive care in one of its state-licensed nursing facilities or assisted living centers.
The latest lawsuit, brought by the estate of Maris Bergis, seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from Care Initiatives and one of its nursing homes, Parkridge Specialty Care of Pleasant Hill, for alleged dependent adult abuse, recklessness, negligence and wrongful death.
The lawsuit alleges Parkridge “negligently cared for Bergis and violated numerous regulations, laws, rights, and industry standards, causing (him) personal injury, illness, harm, and a decline in health.”
According to the lawsuit, Bergis was admitted to Parkridge on Sept. 1, 2023, for a 48-hour stay following his hospitalization for pneumonia. Upon admission, he was allegedly alert, awake and oriented, and Parkridge was tasked with providing physician-prescribed breathing treatments and monitoring him for difficulty with breathing and any signs of anxiety, confusion or restlessness.
During the course of Bergis’ stay at Parkridge, the staff at the home allegedly failed to administer the breathing treatments. The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing subsequently cited Parkridge for its care of Bergis finding that it had delayed providing necessary medical care and treatment.
While the lawsuit does not indicate when, where or how Bergis died, it claims the “gross negligence, and/or recklessness” of Care Initiatives and Parkridge “were the cause of Bergis’ decline in health, injuries, damages and untimely death.”
State inspection reports indicate Bergis was alive, but was increasingly nonresponsive, late in the afternoon on Sept. 4, 2023, which was three days after his admission to Parkridge. The inspection records indicate Bergis was sent to a hospital by ambulance at his spouse’s insistence, but they provide no information as to the hospital’s diagnosis or treatment outcome.
Other wrongful death or negligence lawsuits that have been litigated against Care Initiatives over the past 16 months include:
Northcrest Specialty Care, Waterloo: In January 2024, the family of the late Lora Pavlovec sued, alleging Pavlovec was admitted to Northcrest in January 2022 after which the home failed to provide sufficient, qualified staff to meet her needs, specifically as related to skin care and the prevention of pressure sores. That alleged failure, the lawsuit claimed, resulted in severe pain, septic shock and, in May 2022, Pavlovec’s death. The matter was resolved shortly before trial with the family filing a motion to dismiss the case.
Northcrest Specialty Care, Waterloo: In January 2024, the family of the late Janice Schmitt sued, alleging Schmitt died on Sept. 28, 2022, after sustaining multiple traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages and bone fractures as a consequence of a fall caused by the home’s negligence. The case is pending, with a trial scheduled Feb. 17, 2026.
Northcrest Specialty Care, Waterloo: In January 2024, the family of the late John Nichols sued, alleging he was admitted to Northcrest on Feb. 8, 2022, and, eight days later, fell while in the shower. Nichols was taken to a hospital where he allegedly died hours later due to a brain bleed attributed to the fall. Care Initiatives successfully fought to have most of the family’s claims settled through arbitration. Court records indicate the lawsuit is currently stayed, pending the outcome of the arbitration proceedings.
Northcrest Specialty Care, Waterloo: In May 2023, the family of the late Georgia Demuth sued for negligence and wrongful death, alleging Demuth died in June 2021 as the result of Northcrest’s failure to provide adequate care. In September 2024, the family filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Southridge Specialty Care, Marshalltown: In January 2024, the family of the late Larry Nichols sued, alleging that within a few weeks of Nichols’ admission to Southridge in March 2022 he suffered from sepsis and septic shock caused by the staff’s failure to treat pressure sores and wounds. Nichols died on July 24, 2022. In April 2025, in response to Care Initiatives’ efforts to have the case dismissed due to an arbitration agreement, a judge ordered the bulk of the case to proceed to arbitration with the remaining claims against Care Initiatives stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.
Centerville Specialty Care: In October 2024, the family of the late Debbie Thomas sued, alleging that Thomas suffered second-degree burns on one leg due to a heating element near her bed and that she sustained a serious pressure sore the staff failed to adequately treat. Thomas allegedly died after being admitted to a hospital where she was diagnosed with a 4-inch-long pressure sore, an infection and dangerously low potassium levels. A trial is scheduled for Jan. 12, 2027.
Corning Specialty Care: In January 2024, the family of the late Angela Segebart alleged Segebart was admitted to the Corning home in September 2017 and that on Jan. 20, 2022, she tested positive for COVID-19. On Jan. 27, 2022, the staff allegedly dropped Segebart while transferring her in or out of bed, resulting in two broken legs. The lawsuit claims the staff then failed to assess Segebart’s injuries and placed her back in bed. Two days later, she was experiencing respiratory problems and was transferred to a hospital, where she subsequently died. Care Initiatives successfully fought to have the bulk of the case settled through arbitration, and the family filed a motion to dismiss its lawsuit against the company in September 2024.
Wapello Specialty Care: In March 2023, the family of the late Alice Ward used, alleging that after Ward was admitted to the Wapello home in June 2021, she was deemed to be at a high risk for falls. In February 2022, she allegedly wandered from the home, fell and sustained a neck fracture and head wound, and then died five days later. The judge in the case stayed the court proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration and in May 2025 the lawsuit was dismissed at the family’s request.
Avoca Specialty Care: In January 2024, the family of the late Craig Christensen sued, alleging the staff at the Avoca home failed to treat Christensen’s urinary tract infection, leading to the development of sepsis, septic shock and, on Feb. 20, 2022, death. The attorney for the family later informed the court a settlement in the case had been reached and in June 2025 the case was dismissed.
Ravenwood Specialty Care, Waterloo: In May 2025, the family of the late Mickey Neal sued, alleging negligence and wrongful death. The lawsuit claims Neal was admitted to Ravenwood on March 15, 2024 and that two weeks later, on April 3, 2024, the staff allegedly found him on the floor of his room, incontinent and bleeding from a head wound. He was then transferred to UnityPoint Allen Hospital where he died on April 7, 2024. A trial is scheduled for July 13, 2027.
Corydon Specialty Care: In December 2024, the family of the late Gloria August sued, alleging her death after a series of falls in 2020 and 2021 was caused by the Corydon home’s negligence. In October 2025, the family filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
Parkridge Specialty Care, Pleasant Hill: In June 2024, the family of Neuang Boun Sisamouth sued, alleging that on June 20, 2022, the staff at Parkridge failed to respond to her deteriorating condition, despite dangerously low blood sugar levels. Licensed Practical Nurse Dezaree Major failed to call 911 as ordered, and there was a 90-minute delay in transporting Sisamouth to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later, the lawsuit claims. A trial is scheduled for March 29, 2027. In 2022, the Iowa Board of Nursing alleged Major was working at an unspecified Iowa nursing home in 2021 where, for five months, she falsified various medical records and performed nursing services beyond the scope of her license.
Parkridge Specialty Care, Pleasant Hill: In August 2024, the family of the late Kerry Morris sued, alleging that Morris died at age 58, one week after being admitted to Parkridge for what was supposed to be a temporary stay to assist with recovery from a leg amputation. The lawsuit claims that on the evening of Aug. 23, 2022, two nurses failed to respond to a certified nurse aide’s request that they come to the assistance of Morris, who was in respiratory distress at the time.
Morris was allegedly left alone in his room, fell out of his bed, and went into cardiac arrest while the CNA unsuccessfully sought assistance from the staff. Workers were then unable to find the home’s crash cart, the lawsuit claims, adding that “video evidence shows that there were at least six people who were not attempting to assist Kerry Morris and who were standing in the hallway.” In July 2025, the lawsuit was dismissed at the request of Morris’ family.
Fonda Specialty Care: In October 2024, the family of Marvin “Pete” Jacobs sued, alleging negligence and wrongful death. Jacobs died in February 2023 at Fonda Specialty Care, after which the state alleged the staff had repeatedly failed to clear Jacobs’ tracheostomy tube, which provided an airway for him to breathe.
Pocahontas County prosecutors later charged caregiver Becky Sue Manning, 70, of Lake View, with felony wanton neglect of a health care facility resident. Manning entered an Alford plea of guilty to a reduced charge in which she didn’t admit to the underlying allegations, but acknowledged there was sufficient evidence to prove wanton neglect should the case go to trial. The Jacobs family’s lawsuit has been stayed while the matter is handled through private arbitration.
In a separate but related civil-court proceeding, former Fonda Specialty Care employee Tylene Schultz is suing Care Initiatives for wrongful termination, alleging that after Jacobs’ death she received multiple text messages from a supervisor saying, “Keep your mouth shut and keep your opinions to yourself,” along with instructions that she should not communicate with Jacobs’ family. A trial is scheduled for Aug. 4. 2026.
Crestview Specialty Care, West Branch: In January 2025, the family of Ruth Bartow sued, alleging recklessness, negligence and dependent adult abuse. The lawsuit cites state inspection reports that indicate an unauthorized male visitor was found in Bartow’s room on April 5, 2023, lying in bed with Bartow without any clothes on. A trial is scheduled for May 17, 2027.
Odebolt Specialty Care: In February 2025, Elaine Gunderson sued, alleging negligence and breach of contract. The lawsuit claims that on July 2, 2024, the 88-year-old Gunderson was found at the bottom of a set of 13 concrete stairs that led from the Odebolt home’s kitchen to the basement. Although the kitchen was considered a restricted area from which residents were barred, a staff member had allegedly propped open the door, allowing Gunderson to wheel herself into the area.
After she was found at the foot of the stairs, she was transported to a hospital where, according to state inspectors, she was admitted with a head wound that required seven stitches to close as well as “bruises on her head, hands, legs, hips, both eyes and all over basically.” The lawsuit has been stayed pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings.

Montana drivers can now sport a new specialty license plate that will help fund wildlife connectivity and vehicle-animal collision risk reduction programs throughout the state.
Kylie Bute, a recent graduate of Gallatin High School designed the artwork for the specialty plate, winning a contest organized by the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership along with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Montana Department of Transportation and several other conservation groups in the state.
“My passion for art has always been about telling stories, and this design is a way to spread awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and movement,” Bute, said in a press release. “I’m deeply appreciative and proud to know that my artwork will soon be on vehicles across our great state, helping Montanans connect with the incredible wildlife that surrounds us.”
Bute’s design — a bull elk standing on the edge of a wildlife overpass with mountains in the background — will help fund the newly established Big Game and Wildlife Highway Crossings and Accommodations through FWP.
“Meaningful conservation efforts take all of us working together,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in a statement. “This is a great example of how state agencies and conservation organizations can partner with community groups to find unique ways to help protect wildlife migration and provide for public safety.
The account, and license plate idea, stems from a law passed during the 2025 Legislature to help FWP and MDT research, design, build and maintain wildlife crossing structures, such as overpasses, underpasses, culverts and fencing.
House Speaker Pro Tempore Katie Zolnikov, a Billings Republican, introduced the bill, which is aimed at lowering the high rate of collisions with wildlife Montana drivers are part of each year.
Gov. Greg Gianforte held a ceremonial signing for the bill in August, and companion legislation, in August near the Jens exit of I-90, where MDT completed a fencing project to push elk into an underpass rather than across the interstate.

Data analyzed by State Farm Insurance shows collisions with wildlife contribute to more than 10% of all car accidents in Montana, making Big Sky Country the second-highest risk state, and surveys have shown that 70% of Montana drivers have been involved in a collision with wildlife.
Numerous studies have shown that wildlife fencing, crossings, and associated structures greatly reduce wildlife collisions, including up to 80% for large wildlife overpasses, such as the “Animals’ Trail,” a 197-foot-wide vegetated bridge that spans U.S. Highway 93 near Gray Wolf Peak Casino at the southern end of the Flathead Indian Reservation.
“Montana’s big game migrations are iconic, and safe highway crossings are essential for wildlife and drivers alike,” Ryan Chapin, Montana field manager for the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership said. “We applaud MT FWP for establishing this wildlife movement specialty plate and congratulate Kylie Bute on her winning design which will soon be proudly displayed on vehicles across our great state.”
National Wildlife Federation, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Glacier-Two Medicine Alliance, Vital Ground Foundation, and Montanans for Safe Wildlife Passage also supported the Montana Big Game and Wildlife Highway Crossings License Plate Artwork Contest.
 Zinke seeks permanent federal funding for wildlife crossing programs

Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke announced on Tuesday that he had introduced legislation in Congress to make a federal Wildlife Crossings Program, permanent and extend funding through 2031.
“Wildlife crossings save lives and are good for healthy herds,” Zinke said in a press release. “As the Secretary of the Interior, I launched the first federal effort to protect big-game migration corridors and dedicate federal dollars to crossings in the west. This bill locks in the progress we started, keeps the funding flowing to the states and tribes that need it most, and ensures Montana families don’t have to risk their lives or lose the wildlife we all cherish driving to work or school.”
The program, currently considered a pilot project administered by the Federal Highway Administration, provides grant funding to state and tribal governments to construct wildlife crossings.

In 2023, the CSKT received an $8.6 million grant through the program to construct a wildlife overpass spanning U.S. 93 within the Ninepipe National Wildlife Management Area, along with an additional $74.9 million grant in 2024 for reconstruction and safety improvement work along the highway corridor which was slated to include numerous wildlife crossing structures.
However, the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rescinded much of the funding, leading MDT to scale down improvement projects along U.S. 93.
Improvements near the intersection of U.S. 93 and Eagle Pass Trail, which include a wildlife overpass, shared-use path, new turn-lane, and widened shoulders are still planned for construction in 2027, according to the department.
In addition, the Post Creek Hill project is scheduled to begin construction in 2026, though MDT says construction costs now exceed available funding. Planned improvements include a northbound truck climbing lane at Post Creek Hill and a new bridge over Post Creek that facilitates wildlife movement.
The Wildlife Road Crossings Program Reauthorization Act of 2025 would turn the program from a pilot program to a permanent one; extend funding through 2031; provide 100% federal cost share for projects led by Tribal governments; created a Tribal technical assistance program; and caps administrative costs.

Gov. Josh Stein announced Tuesday that North Carolina-based defense contractor Vulcan Elements will open a nearly $1 billion rare earth magnet plant in Benson, bringing 1,000 jobs to Johnston County. The plant is projected to grow the state’s economy by $2.6 billion over the next 12 years.
The facility will produce advanced neodymium iron boron magnets used in everything from smartphones to AI data centers to military drones. It’s the latest round in the manufacturing race between the U.S. and China, as the American government seeks to rebuild a defense industry that can compete on even footing.

According to Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin, China produces 94 to 98% of the world’s supply of rare earth magnets, while the U.S. manufactures less than 1%. That imbalance, he said, could be “weaponized to impair national security.”
“A semiconductor is like your brain, a battery is like your heart, and a rare earth magnet is like your spine. It literally converts electricity into motion,” said Maslin, a U.S. Navy veteran who previously worked on the nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier program. “This is about enabling national security, this is about increasing economic resilience, this is about creating good-paying American jobs right here and now.”
The facility is certain to transform Benson, with enough workers to make up about a quarter of the town’s current population. Its projected average salary of about $81,900 is roughly one-and-a-half times the average in Johnston County.
And the plant will bring major infrastructure changes with it, with about $250,000 in anticipated funding for road improvements from the General Assembly. The project will require the state to move nearly $6 million into its industrial development fund for utility upgrades.
Benson Mayor Max Raynor quipped that his town of a little over 4,000 could help make the Research Triangle into the “Research Trapezoid.”

“Yes, Benson, North Carolina, a place known for Mule Days, a gospel singing convention, and now, global magnet supremacy,” he said. “This project brings a thousand good-paying jobs and a thousand families who can stay, grow and thrive right here.”
The company’s first facility launched in the Research Triangle Park in March. Stein pointed out that North Carolina was “one of Vulcan’s first investors,” awarding them the state’s One Small Business Program grant when they had less than 20 employees.
“This veteran-owned company will enable North Carolina to keep leading the way on national security as well as building the economy of the future,” he said.
The federal government agreed to back Vulcan Elements’ expansion plans earlier this month through a $620 million direct loan from the U.S. Department of Defense and $50 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce through the CHIPS and Science Act, according to a Nov. 3 press release from the company. Vulcan is relying on an additional $550 million in private capital, and the state agreed Tuesday to issue up to $17.5 million in job grants over the next 12 years.
As part of the federal agreement, the U.S. will have a direct stake in the company, with the U.S. Defense Department receiving warrants — or the right to purchase stocks in the future at a pre-agreed price — in Vulcan and partner ReElement Technologies. The U.S. Commerce Department is also receiving $50 million in equity in Vulcan.

Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), who helped broker the company’s partnership with the federal government, said those are non-voting shares, meaning the U.S. will not be able to directly influence company decisionmaking. He said he was confident the Trump administration would fulfill its grant promises despite uncertainty over the future of the CHIPS Act.
“This is about fully decoupling from China,” Budd said in an interview. “All the way down to the chips in the phone that you’re using, everything seems to use rare earth, so we have to build our own supply chain.”
Stein said after the event that he has concerns over the federal government’s stake in the company. “We didn’t demand equity,” he noted of the state’s efforts to secure the facility.
“We are definitely in unprecedented territory in terms of how the federal government is considering its investors,” Stein said. “I am comforted by the fact it’s not voting stock, but I do worry that it might distort the government’s policy going forward.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB185117-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 19:57:26.474623

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Reproductive, maternal, and community health advocates called on state lawmakers Tuesday to safeguard women’s health care access from mounting threats in Washington, D.C.
Pennsylvania has been a haven for reproductive rights, speakers said in a rally at the state Capitol, as other states have criminalized abortion. The commonwealth has also expanded health insurance coverage for expectant mothers as the federal government has cut back, they said.
“Pennsylvania has a real opportunity right now to be a state where people are safe, where they’re supported and where we’re able to make decisions about our bodies, our futures. Our communities are asking for this,” Roxanne McNellis of The Women’s Centers, a group of independent abortion providers, said. “We’re going to make it impossible to ignore.”
In the coming year, members of the legislature’s Women’s Health Caucus and Black Maternal Health Caucus said they plan to redouble efforts to protect women’s rights to decide when to have children and ensure they remain safe and healthy when they do.

“It’s no longer a threat,” House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said. “We are at the door … where decisions will be made on the future of not only where our daughters can get health care, but where we as women … and our neighbors and our friends and our constituents, our sisters, our daughters, our nieces, are able to get health care.” 
The Black Maternal Health Caucus, founded by Reps. La’Tasha D. Mayes (D-Allegheny), Gina Curry (D-Delaware) and Morgan Cephas (D-Philadelphia), launched in 2023 with a package of legislation, dubbed the “Momnibus,” to combat alarming maternal morbidity rates among women of color.
According to the latest report from the state Maternal Morbidity Review Committee, Black women suffered pregnancy-associated deaths at well over double the rate of white women in 2021. In total, 129 individuals lost their lives during pregnancy, delivery, or up to one year postpartum.
Black Maternal Health Caucus marks ‘Momnibus’ day with approval of new bills

The caucus introduced eight bills related to maternal health in 2024 and two made it to Gov. Josh Shapiro’s desk to become law. They provide Medicaid coverage for doulas, who are women that provide guidance and support for mothers during labor and after childbirth, and require the state Health Department to help women experiencing postpartum depression find resources to help.
This year, Mayes said, the caucus aims to pass House Bill 1234, introduced by Mayes, and H.B. 1088, introduced by Rep. Mandy Steele, which respectively would require Medicaid and private health insurers to pay for blood pressure monitors for pregnant women. Hypertension during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or death of the mother.
Mayes said the caucus will also work to advance legislation to guarantee access to in-vitro fertilization. “We must make sure that no matter what your income is and no matter what your insurance coverage is, that you have access to IVF services,” she said.
Another bill modeled on the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act would make it a crime under state law to interfere with staff or clients entering reproductive health care clinics.
The caucus also has sights set higher than making new laws, with a bill sponsored by Mayes and Reps. Liz Hanbidge (D-Montgomery) and Danielle Friel Otten (D-Chester) to start the process of amending the state Constitution to protect access to abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson reversed a half-century-old precedent that guaranteed a right to privacy in decisions about reproduction across the country, giving states the ability to ban abortion.

The proposed amendment would guarantee the “right of privacy with respect to personal, sexual, and reproductive healthcare decisions, including the right to choose or refuse an abortion, the right to choose or refuse contraceptives, and the right to choose or refuse fertility care, all without discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or relationship status,” according to a memo by seeking support for the bill.
“Our mission is not about political ideology,” Rep. Mary Jo Daley (D-Montgomery) said. “It is about ensuring that no one is denied medical care due to fear or force. Our state must be a place where personal freedoms are protected and where every resident can access health care without interference.”
Women’s health advocates are also working in the courts to defeat a discriminatory ban on Medicaid covering abortions, noted Lila Slovak, director of the Philadelphia office of the Women’s Law Project, a public interest legal advocacy group focused on women. 
It is leading a group of reproductive health care centers in the litigation and won a historic decision by the state Supreme Court last year that overturned a 42-year-old decision that upheld the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act’s ban on Medicaid-funded abortions except in cases of rape or incest. 
The ruling cleared the way for the Commonwealth Court earlier this month to hear arguments in the underlying lawsuit in which the centers claim the ban violates the commonwealth’s Equal Rights Amendment. 
Republican Attorney General Dave Sunday’s office filed a brief earlier this year arguing the state has compelling interest in protecting life, safeguarding women’s health, and respecting the conscience rights of taxpayers. Sunday’s brief also argues there is no right to abortion or “reproductive autonomy” under the state’s constitution and any rights can be regulated or limited by the legislature.
“Our mission to focus on state law and state constitutional protections has never been more urgent than it is today,” Slovak said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5800-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 19:57:26.474623

The walk-in Front Porch center’s renovation plans to offer even more robust alternatives to emergency rooms in the Northeast Kingdom.

The next phase in a yearslong effort to expand access to emergency mental health care in the Northeast Kingdom begins Wednesday: The Newport-based mental health urgent care Front Porch plans to open four overnight beds after months of construction. 
Several mental health agencies across the state staff 24/7 crisis phone lines and offer daytime walk-in urgent care options. But when the Lakemont Road facility opened in Newport City in June 2024, Front Porch became the state’s first — and only — around-the-clock walk-in mental health urgent care program. 
However, until this week, people who arrived at Front Porch for help could only stay for 23 hours and 59 minutes because the facility was not set up nor licensed as an overnight option. With the new beds, people can come and go for up to 10 days — no hospital admission or doctor’s referral required. 
The space is meant to be a landing place for people navigating a mental health crisis, large or small, without needing to rely on a hospital’s emergency room or 911. 
“You can come here. You can stay here, in your community,” said Kelsey Stavseth, the executive director of Northeast Kingdom Human Services, the organization that runs Front Porch. “It’s about stabilizing in your community, so you don’t need to leave. You don’t have to go inpatient. It’s really tailor made for folks who are struggling with mental health needs.” 
For the staff at the Vermont Department of Mental Health or the designated private nonprofit organizations the state works with — including Northeast Kingdom Human Services — the phrase “continuum of care” has become a mantra. The oft-echoed guiding principle is to create “someone to call, someone who can come to you, and somewhere to go.”
Front Porch fits into that continuum alongside the 988 suicide text and call lifeline and the state’s mobile crisis response, a coordinated county-by-county response effort that provides a team of clinical professionals to meet patients wherever they may need assistance with mental health or substance use crises. 
To get the Front Porch off the ground, Northeast Kingdom Human Services benefited from state grant funding, awarded after the Covid-19 pandemic drove steep demand for increased inpatient psychiatric services as well as more community-based mental health urgent care. 
The costs of acquiring the land and originally building the space came to $1.3 million, which Erica Perkins, the organization’s director of communications, confirmed. The renovations alone cost $1.9 million — all of it was covered by $2 million in state funding, plus a million dollar contribution from Northeast Kingdom Human Services’ reserves, Perkins said. 
Prior to Front Porch opening last year, people in the Newport area had nowhere else to look for crisis support than over-burdened hospital emergency departments. Across the state, more than $3 million has been awarded since 2023 to programs that offer an alternative to the emergency department, including Front Porch. Since then, Front Porch has also received allocations from the state’s General Fund.  
In addition to Front Porch, the state has seven other emergency department alternatives. Adults can access this care through Interlude, run by Counseling Service of Addison County in Middlebury; the Access Hub in Montpelier; and the Howard Center’s Mental Health Urgent Care in Burlington. The Burlington Police Department also has run a Crisis Assessment, Response, and Engagement Services team, though that program will end in December. For children, services reside at the Bennington-based Psychiatric Urgent Care for Kids, Morristown’s Emergent Psychiatric Intervention for Children and the Youth Stabilization Program in Brattleboro.

In the Northeast Kingdom, this entire continuum has yielded especially positive results, according to Stavseth. After leaving Front Porch, 96% of people return to the community, he said. Including outcomes for people who seek help through the crisis line and mobile support team, that number is between 85% and 90%.
Stavseth said he hopes that extending the amount of time people are able to stay will help them build more resilience to tackle mental health challenges beyond Front Porch’s walls. It is important, he added, that people will be able to do this locally. They can stay at Front Porch overnight and still commute to work, without needing to sacrifice a paycheck for the stability Front Porch provides.  
“Having a professional place to go is good, but what’s really going to create the resilience is saying, ‘Do you have a job? Do you have family or natural supports in healthy relationships? Do you feel secure in your housing? How can we enhance and support the things we know build healthy life?” he said.
‘Just show up’
The four bedrooms in the Front Porch are light-filled and cozy. They look more like guest bedrooms than clinical spaces, with pine furniture, big windows and canvas photos of the natural world lining the walls. 
“We’re always going to need the hospital, but it’s not always appropriate for people to be in there. It’s not really therapeutically appropriate if you’re going to be there for a long period of time. And so we really want to make it home-like,” Stavseth said. 
Above each bedroom’s door sits a window so people can see if the lights are on in the communal space that each room opens onto. It is supposed to help people gauge whether they want to join people outside of their room, without sacrificing the privacy of a windowless door. When VTDigger visited the space in mid-September, the facility centered around an open kitchen with a collection of tables and chairs and a big living room with vaulted ceilings lined with more pine beams.
All of it strives to follow a philosophy of nature-guided design that has been shown to bolster well-being and physical health. Along the perimeter are single-stalled bathrooms with white marble tiles and a shower.
The expertise and resources that an individual can access while staying at the renovated Front Porch, are not too different from what was available before. But now, they can access them for longer stretches of continuous time. 
The services are accessible to all ages, Stavseth said. He also added that there is no baseline level of severity that people need to meet to come. 
“Stress and anxiety can come from a flood. It can come from losing your housing. It can come from losing your job. It can come from raising kids, which we know is difficult and challenging,” he said. “I think people are like, ‘What’s the threshold to come here?’ Really just show up and we’ll figure it out with you.” 
When someone arrives at Front Porch, they go through an assessment and screening to determine what support they might need. If the person does have a medical need, Front Porch will connect them to the hospital.
“Anything but that we will support,” Stavseth said. “That can be a wide ranging spectrum, from suicidal ideation to generalized anxiety (or) just to stressors at home that you need a break (from) and you need to talk to somebody about.” 
At Front Porch, people can join group therapy sessions or meet individually with a therapist. They can walk through the center’s community garden or living room spaces. They can get a cup of coffee, take a shower and decompress. 
Additionally, they can talk to a peer support specialist.
Byron Savoy, who works as one such peer support staffer at Front Porch, described the position as “radically egalitarian.” 
“We’re not authorities. We’re not experts,” he said. “I think one of the most significant things that we do is just to listen to people.” 
From there, Front Porch’s staff can help connect people with other, more directed services, like ways to access food, support for finding housing, substance use help or specific mental health counseling. 
Often, though, the act of having a peer listen and talk can be profound: “Some of the stigma attached to mental health is bridged by people saying ‘I’ve gone through the same thing. Let’s just chat.’ This isn’t about assessing you or diagnosing you. It’s about supporting you through a challenging situation,” Stavseth said. 
The space aims to incorporate lots of natural light and ‘biophilic design’ which has been shown to lower stress and boost physical health. Photo by Olivia Gieger/VTDigger
Firehouse model
For now, all of the services at Front Porch are free.
Eventually, they would like to be able to bill insurers for the services they provide — which are less costly and demanding on the overall health system than someone occupying a bed in an emergency room. 
But doing so will take time for the center to sustain itself on a fee-for-service model. 
“Crisis services need to be funded from a capacity mindset, not like a fee-for-service,” Savseth said, citing the importance of being open all day, every day. “They call it a firehouse model. You want enough fire(fighters) around to go to fires, but if they had to be funded on how many fires they put out, then you’d be wishing for more fires.”
Starting this week, Stavseth said, staff at Front Porch are ready to put out whatever fires people bring to their doorstep. They are now prepared to respond, whether the process takes hours or days.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Independent Ethics Commission advanced complaints filed against 17 Democratic state legislators that allege they broke the state’s law prohibiting elected officials from receiving gifts. 
Colorado Common Cause, a pro-democracy organization, filed complaints against members of the Colorado Opportunity Caucus alleging they accepted payment for luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail. The gathering was first reported by The Colorado Sun. The commission Tuesday unanimously determined all 17 of the complaints are “not frivolous,” meaning they will move forward to the commission’s investigation process and public hearings.
The complaints allege the involved legislators are members of the Colorado Opportunity Caucus, a nonprofit that Common Cause said was “created, staffed, and funded by a pro-business dark money group, One Main Street.” Caucus leaders allegedly asked One Main Street to pay a $25,000 bill for legislators’ hotel expenses while at the Vail retreat.

Colorado voters in 2006 approved a gift ban for elected officials. 
“No one is above the law or the state constitution. The trust the public places in our leaders when we elect them to office is sacred and not to be taken lightly,” Aly Belknap, Colorado Common Cause’s executive director, said in a statement. “Common Cause commends the Independent Ethics Commission for taking appropriate action, and we reaffirm our shared mission to defend the public interest.”
Common Cause filed complaints against Sen. Lindsey Daugherty of Arvada, who chairs the Opportunity Caucus, Rep. Shannon Bird of Westminster, Rep. Tisha Mauro of Pueblo, Rep. Michael Carter of Aurora, Rep. Jacque Phillips of Thornton, Rep. Rebekah Stewart of Lakewood, Rep. Meghan Lukens of Steamboat Springs, Rep. Karen McCormick of Longmont, Rep. Cecelia Espenoza of Denver, Rep. Matthew Martinez of Monte Vista, Rep. Katie Stewart of Durango, Rep. Sean Camacho of Denver, Rep William Lindstedt of Broomfield, Sen. Marc Snyder of Manitou Springs, Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City, Sen. Kyle Mullica of Thornton, and Sen. Judy Amabile of Boulder. Each legislator will be able to respond to the complaints with a private attorney at the public hearings. 
“This is a grotesque, intentionally orchestrated miscarriage of justice,” Daugherty said in a statement. “The dark money operatives behind this mudslinging should do some serious soul-searching and Coloradans should let them know that joining Donald Trump in attacking Democrats, trampling on justice, rejecting due process, and abandoning integrity to score cheap political points is not the kind of behavior that our state wants, deserves or will accept.”
A joint statement from the Opportunity Caucus called the accusations in the complaint inaccurate and incendiary. The statement said Common Cause did not file the complaints because of ethics but rather as “a publicity and fundraising campaign to silence Democratic incumbents ahead of their 2026 elections.” 
Rep. Bird didn’t attend event
Bird, who is running for Congress in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District and was the founding chair of the Opportunity Caucus, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against her as she did not attend the retreat and was no longer chair during planning of the retreat. Eve Zhurbinskiy, Bird’s campaign manager, said the complaint “is as false as it is absurd.” 
“Shannon Bird was not at the event in question, she was not Chair of the Caucus, and she, quite literally, had nothing to do with it,” Zhurbinskiy said in a statement. 
Shad Murib, chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, condemned the complaints after the hearing and said lawmakers are taking “good-faith steps to address the situation.” He said legislators made “a sizable contribution to the Food Bank of the Rockies, regardless of whether they believe a violation occurred.”
“Colorado Democrats hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards, and that includes allowing the Independent Ethics Commission to do its work without political games,” Murib said in a statement.

Nov. 18, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel held a roundtable with the Michigan League for Public Policy on Tuesday afternoon to discuss food security, specifically impacts of the lapse of SNAP during the federal government shutdown and the continuing attacks on the food aid program. 
Advocates at the roundtable represented a number of groups, from the Midwest Independent Retailers Association to the Disability Network of Michigan, but all emphasized a similar underlying point — that SNAP and federal food assistance programs are necessary to ensure that people have enough food to eat. 
“Families who are on these programs deserve dignity,” said Terrell Couch, the coalitions director at Detroit-based family and mother advocacy group Mothering Justice. “They deserve the opportunity for economic justice, and they deserve the opportunity to thrive in Michigan.”
SNAP benefits had been paused for the month of November during the federal government shutdown, though federal legal action by Nessel and other Democratic state attorneys general led some contingency funding to be released to partially fund the program, which has since restarted now that a federal budget has passed. 
But changes to the program are still forthcoming — most recently, a change put forth by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins that would require every recipient of SNAP benefits to re-apply. That policy has not been officially put forward, though Nessel noted during the roundtable that if it did, her office would consider legal action against it.

“It’s a lose-lose situation in so many ways, and we can’t have a functioning, healthy society if people are desperate,” said Jen Schaap, the food & farming program director at the Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities. 
One criticism of the SNAP program nationally is errors in the administration of the program, which could result in either overpayment or underpayment of benefits. Michigan’s error rate for SNAP in 2024 stood at 9.53% — below the national rate, but above the 6% threshold that states are supposed to meet. 
Neil Giovanatti, an assistant attorney general under Nessel in charge of the Federal Accountability Unit, noted that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, who manage the program, are working to lower that rate — but that an overwhelming surge of federal changes is actually making it worse. 
“The barrage of actions from FNS [the Food and Nutrition Service] that is being taken against states that appear to be intentionally designed to force states to have high error rates,” he said. “That appears to be an intentional action by FNS to create this problem for the states.”
A number of the advocates present at the roundtable expressed that the threats to SNAP are part of a broader attack on the lives of low-income Americans. 
“This is the beginning as to what we believe is a campaign to create destabilization among folks who are low-income,” said Sarah Prout Rennie, the senior director of advocacy and engagement for the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness. “People’s lives will be lost.”
“We view this as another piece of anti-immigrant legislation, that they’re really trying to starve our community out in more ways than one,” added Cindy Gamboa, the executive director of MI Poder, a Latinx advocacy group. 










So when we have the government, for one reason or another, cut off these programs, they’re essentially just taking our money. And it really begs the question, why are we paying federal taxes, if then the money’s not going to come back to us?


– Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel


The importance of food access, across the board, was driven home by Nessel throughout the roundtable.
“I don’t know what’s more important than people having the ability to eat,” she said. 
And crucially, Nessel added, though they work hard, food banks and charities cannot sustain adequate food assistance at the same magnitude of a federal program like SNAP, calling it “misinformation” to say that they would be able to take care of the problem.
“Food pantries can’t keep up,” Gamboa said. “I’ve seen mile-long food lines of people lining up to get boxes from Gleaners [Community Food Bank in Detroit] in my community.”
Other roundtable participants stressed the importance of SNAP funding on local retailers and farmers, many of whom rely on customers using SNAP dollars to make ends meet.  
“Every dollar invested in local farms and markets returns to our communities many times over, in jobs, local economic activity, healthier families and strengthened food security,” noted Joe Lesausky, Food Access Director at the Michigan Farmers’ Market Association. “Farmers are ready to grow the food we need. Farmers markets are ready to distribute it. Our communities are ready to support a stronger local food community. What we need now is the commitment to ensure that the funding and policy keep pace with the realities farmers are facing.”
“Because SNAP pays for itself, I really want people to realize that this is an intentional attack on folks who are in poverty, who are homeless, and who are insecurely housed,” Rennie added, referencing statistics from Jerry Griffin of the Midwest Independent Retailers Association on how SNAP money being paid into local retailers produces about $1.80 into local economies per dollar of SNAP funding spent. 
“We cannot have food security without farmer security,” Lesausky continued. 
Data security was a concern among participants as well, as it was at another roundtable hosted in Grand Rapids last week by Nessel’s office. Those concerns are especially significant among immigrant populations, and Nessel’s team has previously been granted a preliminary injunction blocking data-sharing of SNAP recipient information with the Department of Homeland Security. 
“People need to feel comfortable that when they’re accessing these resources that are not only important for them, but also for the state, that their data is not being used against them, that they’re able to have some safety in using these programs,” said Rima Meroueh, the director of the National Network for Arab American Communities at ACCESS. 
“Food insecurity is not new, but now with these threats and quite frankly, attacks on our community, our community does not know who to trust,” Gamboa added. 
Nessel expressed frustration with the federal government not properly disbursing funding for federal programs, including SNAP, that are congressionally appropriated and required to go to states. 
“This was our money to begin with,” Nessel said. “Here we are, paying well over $30 billion a year to the federal government. So when we have the government, for one reason or another, cut off these programs, they’re essentially just taking our money. And it really begs the question, why are we paying federal taxes, if then the money’s not going to come back to us?”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_3024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 18:58:08.794768

Nov. 18, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel held a roundtable with the Michigan League for Public Policy on Tuesday afternoon to discuss food security, specifically impacts of the lapse of SNAP during the federal government shutdown and the continuing attacks on the food aid program. 
Advocates at the roundtable represented a number of groups, from the Midwest Independent Retailers Association to the Disability Network of Michigan, but all emphasized a similar underlying point — that SNAP and federal food assistance programs are necessary to ensure that people have enough food to eat. 
“Families who are on these programs deserve dignity,” said Terrell Couch, the coalitions director at Detroit-based family and mother advocacy group Mothering Justice. “They deserve the opportunity for economic justice, and they deserve the opportunity to thrive in Michigan.”
SNAP benefits had been paused for the month of November during the federal government shutdown, though federal legal action by Nessel and other Democratic state attorneys general led some contingency funding to be released to partially fund the program, which has since restarted now that a federal budget has passed. 
But changes to the program are still forthcoming — most recently, a change put forth by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins that would require every recipient of SNAP benefits to re-apply. That policy has not been officially put forward, though Nessel noted during the roundtable that if it did, her office would consider legal action against it.

“It’s a lose-lose situation in so many ways, and we can’t have a functioning, healthy society if people are desperate,” said Jen Schaap, the food & farming program director at the Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities. 
One criticism of the SNAP program nationally is errors in the administration of the program, which could result in either overpayment or underpayment of benefits. Michigan’s error rate for SNAP in 2024 stood at 9.53% — below the national rate, but above the 6% threshold that states are supposed to meet. 
Neil Giovanatti, an assistant attorney general under Nessel in charge of the Federal Accountability Unit, noted that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, who manage the program, are working to lower that rate — but that an overwhelming surge of federal changes is actually making it worse.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas lawmaker expressed concern Tuesday that upcoming restrictions on food stamp recipients’ purchases could make SNAP inaccessible to rural Arkansans if the state doesn’t give retailers clear guidance on how to implement the new rules.
In June, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved a waiver to allow Arkansas to ban its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients from using their benefits to purchase certain foods deemed unhealthy, such as soda, juices with less than 50% natural juice and other “unhealthy drinks,” along with “confectionary products with flour and artificially sweetened candy.”
The waiver will take effect July 1, 2026. Retailers have three options for how to identify and keep lists of ineligible foods, said Mary Franklin, director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of County Operations.
Two of those three options are to use DHS guidance or a third-party contractor to apply the GS1 Global Product Classification standard to food products, Franklin told the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review subcommittee Tuesday.
The third option is to “take the broad definitions that we are providing through the GS1 framework and apply it in good faith to their own product array without contracting their expenses,” she said.
PEER co-chair Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, called the three options “not workable” and not cost-effective for “mom and pop” businesses in “communities where our big chains may not be able to exist.”
“What I’m scared you’re going to do is create a scenario where entities, probably in areas that need it the most, are not going to be able to offer SNAP because of the risk associated with not appropriately categorizing an item,” Dismang said.
Proposed SNAP asset limit increase hits roadblock as DHS takes action on 2023 law

Franklin said she and other DHS administrators have no intention of pushing businesses out of SNAP and will discuss Dismang’s feedback.
Arkansas has the highest prevalence of food insecurity in the nation, according to a 2024 USDA report that the agency has stopped issuing. More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households in Arkansas received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to DHS.
The federal government shutdown from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12 delayed this month’s issuance of SNAP benefits, but DHS said last week that benefits would be issued by Nov. 14. SNAP is completely federally funded but administered by the states.
Dismang has sponsored bills for two consecutive legislative sessions that would raise the state’s asset limit for SNAP enrollees. He has argued that SNAP-eligible families need to be able to save more money in order to someday no longer need SNAP, while other Republican lawmakers have said the proposal will keep people on government assistance longer.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PEER-11.18.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 18:58:08.794768

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top election official floated potential legislation Tuesday that would allow prospective candidates to pay their way onto the ballot.
Some members of the state Board of Elections responded during their meeting in Pierre by saying they oppose the idea, but the board took no formal action.
“I’ll be honest, I’m a hard ‘no’ on this one,” said board member Austin Hoffman, who’s also a Republican candidate for state attorney general.
The proposal came from the office of Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Deadrick walked the board through a slate of 17 “concepts” for legislation that could be introduced during the annual legislative session that starts in January. 
Deadrick said some other states, including Kansas, already allow people to pay to get on a ballot. A spokesperson with the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office confirmed to South Dakota Searchlight that while independents in that state collect petition signatures to earn a ballot spot, members of a political party can pay a filing fee to get on the ballot.
The South Dakota proposal would give all candidates two options for qualifying: collecting the required number of petition signatures from registered voters, as they do now, or paying a fee to have their name printed on the ballot. Under the draft, any fees collected would go into the state’s general fund. Deadrick did not specify how much candidates would be required to pay. 
“We certainly thought it was time to bring it up here and discuss it, and say, ‘What do you think of that scenario?’” Deadrick told the board.
Deadrick added that the fee option could be helpful when candidates drop out of a race at the last minute, and there’s little time to gather petition signatures before the replacement candidate deadline.
Hoffman was not swayed.
“Regardless of the reality of it, the optics of it are you are giving a pay-to-play pathway to being a politician,” he said. “To me, going out and talking to the public, and listening to the people, and getting those signatures is one of the most important parts of that process.”
Multiple other board members echoed the sentiment.

Another proposal would replace South Dakota’s petition signature formulas for candidates with new thresholds tied to the number of registered voters for partisan, independent and new-party candidates. Currently, candidates for some offices get on the ballot by turning in petition signatures from registered voters equal to a small percentage of the votes cast for governor in the last general election, with specific percentages varying by office and party status. 
Hoffman “ran the numbers” and provided an example when the new formula would require fewer signatures for somebody running as a Republican and more signatures for somebody running as a Democrat. 
“I just don’t see that as being fair,” Hoffman said. Other members agreed. 
Deadrick acknowledged the point. He said the idea stems from the difficulty candidates have in identifying the required signature number for their jurisdiction — such as a legislative district, which often includes parts of multiple counties — under the state’s current formula.
Other bill ideas include allowing people to challenge a voter’s registration on the grounds that the voter is not a U.S. citizen, and letting the secretary of state use a federal verification system to confirm the citizenship status of people who apply to register to vote in South Dakota. 
Another idea would require anyone signing any type of petition to list their voter registration address, which would have to substantially match the address on file for the signature to count. 
Deadrick said the office would send board members more polished versions of the bill proposals in the near future for feedback, before final consideration.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Lawmakers and housing advocates in Pennsylvania are calling on the commonwealth to take a more compassionate response to homelessness on the heels of a monumental ruling that allows local government to ban outdoor sleeping even if there are no shelter beds available. 
The 2024 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court — Grants Pass v. Johnson — sparked a wave of proposals nationwide that penalized camping, sleeping and storing personal property on certain public land. Such actions essentially criminalized homelessness, advocates said, when people have no other options.
“Instead of working to create safety and stability for their people, governments across the country have doubled down on punitive measures that would turn homelessness and poverty into crimes punishable by jail,” said Sen. Nikil Saval (D-Philadelphia). “Study after study shows that the criminalization of homelessness is cruel; that it is a gross misuse of public resources; and that it serves to exacerbate the crisis it professes to combat.” 
Municipalities sometimes argue that the fines and jail time are a solution to the growing number of homeless people, which includes over 12,000 Pennsylvanians “on any given day,” according to the state’s Department of Community and Economic Development.
Pa. House and Senate Democrats decry U.S. Supreme Court ruling on homelessness

Rep. Ismail Smith-Wade-El (D-Lancaster) urged elected leaders to reprioritize their expenses from prisons to affordable housing, putting “human interest before business or political interests.” 
“What the actual evidence shows is that municipalities who treat people like problems, instead of like human beings, end up sending their people to municipalities where there is shelter, where there is housing and where there is compassion,” said Smith-Wade-El. “I want to make your streets safer, give more of our neighbors a home and save you money that you’re currently pouring into prisons and enforcement.”
Those potential savings are what Saval said could be used to win Republican support in the GOP-controlled Senate for companion bills sponsored by himself and Smith-Wade-El. 
The two proposals codify a “Shelter First” approach to homelessness in Pennsylvania, bucking a shift from the federal government away from such policies. 
 More on the bills

Saval’s Senate Bill 1089 and Smith-Wade-El’s House Bill 2028 legislation would require municipalities to provide “adequate” indoor spaces for people experiencing homelessness before that government body could enforce outdoor sleeping bans. 
“Adequate,” as defined in the bill, means a shelter must:

Be available indefinitely, without a daily reapplication
Be available free of charge 
Accommodate disabilities 
Accept pets 
Accommodate partners, including those who are unmarried, as well as family members and other support individuals 
Accommodate personal property 

Such requirements were important, said Smith-Wade-El, because, “Oftentimes, we assign folks who are unhoused to a sort of housing we would never consider for ourselves.”
“Many people would be shocked to know the number of people who wake up in the morning at a shelter for the unhoused, go work a full-time job … and then come back at night to sleep in the shelter,” said Smith-Wade-El.

Prior to his election to the state House, Smith-Wade-El served on Lancaster City Council after working with area nonprofits, including the Lancaster County Homelessness Coalition. 
In his home county, he said law enforcement had pushed encampments from one location to another, “playing hot potato with human lives.” Such actions “will no longer be an acceptable approach,” he said. 
Candice Player, a vice president with Philadelphia’s Project HOME, said her organization had been “on the frontlines fighting homelessness” for decades. That court decision, she said, “unleashed a wave of legislation … that criminalizes basic survival activities.”
“But let’s be clear: the Supreme Court’s decision in Grants Pass isn’t a mandate, it’s a choice,” said Player. “Here in the commonwealth, we have the power and responsibility to take a stand.” 
Player highlighted federal actions that represent a shift in the national approach to end homelessness, such as recent cuts to permanent housing programs and a Trump administration executive order making it easier to remove homeless people from the streets. 
“The upheaval at the federal level underscores how essential leadership in Harrisburg will be in the months ahead; Pennsylvania cannot wait for federal solutions,” said Player. 
Being unhoused compounds existing mental and physical health issues, acting as a barrier for addiction treatment or other counseling. Player said that adding criminal penalties “traps people in a cycle of citations, fines and incarceration, instead of helping them find stability.” 
Under the legislation, the state attorney general will have the authority to bring a civil action. Smith-Wade-El also called for additional investments into the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency alongside rental assistance and ongoing support for home repair programming.

Burlington plans to scratch a mental health response program that fell short of its vision. At a Monday night meeting, City Council members expressed skepticism that nobody would be left behind.

Burlington plans to terminate a mental health response program within its police department, called CARES, that fell short of its vision. The piece of police reform will be left behind by the city, once state funds to launch the program lapse at the end of this year. 
In its absence, Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak maintains that the Howard Center has the capacity and is better suited to take on any work championed by the sunsetting program. But at a Monday night City Council meeting, many councilors expressed skepticism that a transition would be so seamless. 
Underlying councilors’ concerns begged the question, are there any exit ramps? 
Employees at the Howard Center said it has the capacity to take on the work of the CARES team. It’s a social services organization that the Queen City supports with hundreds of thousands of dollars. But some city councilors aren’t sure their services will meet the same needs. 
“We know there’s a gap here if CARES goes away,” councilor Buddy Singh, D-South, said during the meeting. 
When city officials first devised the CARES program, it was slated to include a supervisor, two clinicians and an emergency medical technician or a registered nurse. CARES, an acronym for Crisis Assessment, Response and Engagement Service, was designed to provide more long-term casework, rather than be a first responder to people in crisis, Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke said.
But when Mulvaney-Stanak took office in 2024, the program had no staff, she said during an interview in early November. All three roles sat empty. 
The first CARES position wasn’t filled until earlier this year and the second was only filled within the last six months, Mulvaney-Stanak said. In late October, Burke said one of those two employees gave notice that she would leave in early November upon finding out the program would end. 
“This isn’t a huge loss of human resources and it’s work that will have to be outsourced from the police department,” Burke said. 
Burke said the city was unable to fill the nurse position for regulatory reasons. In Mulvaney-Stanak’s memo to the City Council about ending the CARES program, she blamed the vacant nurse role on “unsuccessful negotiations” with the University of Vermont Medical Center.
Leaving that role unfilled would create funding complications. 
Without the nurse position, the team couldn’t provide the same care it set out to, Mulvaney-Stanak said. In response, the state scaled back the funds it was giving to the city, she said. 
With state funds set to expire at the end of the year, the city decided not to continue the program, Mulvaney-Stanak said. 
The CARES team originally came about in the wake of 2020 Black Lives Matter protests that called on city officials to rethink policing. For years down the line, community members were pushing city officials to consider how they could better support people in mental health crises, Mulvaney-Stanak said. 
It was modeled after the CAHOOTS crisis response model, which was used in Eugene, Oregon, to deploy a crew of crisis workers to respond when someone is in a mental health crisis. 
Former Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger considered partnering with the Howard Center to provide crisis management, before later deciding the city wanted to run the program within the police department. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said that housing the CARES team within the police department proved problematic for a number of reasons. 
Someone seeking help from the CARES team would have their information stored within police software, Mulvaney-Stanak said. That made their mental health records public records and did not provide them with protections under medical privacy laws, she said. 
People in the CARES team were also supervised by the police chief, who isn’t best suited to manage mental health casework, she said. 
When the program sunsets at the end of the year, Mulvaney-Stanak said the Howard Center’s street outreach team will fill the gaps. 
During Monday night’s meeting, councilor Sarah Carpenter, D-Ward 4, said she was surprised to get the memo from the mayor about the program ending when the council had received very few updates on its progress.
It’s still unclear what mental health crises the city is responding to well, and where the gaps are, she said. She posed the question: “What are we still missing?” 
Councilor Melo Grant, P-Central, said she was disappointed the program was ending only a couple years after city officials worked to put it in place. Later in the meeting, Grant said she found out CARES was ending when a constituent reached out to her. 
That constituent had received help from the CARES team after a traumatic experience, Grant said. “They were very upset to find out that the program is being defunded,” she said. 
Grant said she did not believe the CARES team duplicated services provided by the Howard Center, and that it had a distinct role. 
Katherine Levasseur, a spokesperson for the Howard Center, said the organization has an equivalent of six full-time employees on its street outreach team.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A board on Tuesday approved raising the salaries of Oklahoma lawmakers to $54,900 and increasing stipends for over a dozen other legislative leaders. 
The Board on Legislative Compensation, made up of appointees of the governor, the House speaker and the Senate president pro tem, approved an additional $1.3 million annually for lawmaker salaries and leadership stipends. 
The board previously voted to increase stipends for legislative leaders while keeping lawmaker pay stagnant. 
Lawmakers will earn $7,400 more per year, up from $47,500. Their salaries had not changed since 2019. 
These changes are effective after the next general election on Nov. 18, 2026. Currently, lawmakers are prevented from taking a salary increase during the term of office. 
The House Speaker and Senate President Pro Tem will receive a stipend equal to 50% of the new base pay, or $27,450. 
About another dozen leaders in the House and Senate will receive stipends of more than $18,000. 
The group was forced to reconvene after it was discovered that a member, James Leewright, was a registered lobbyist and ineligible to be on the board. Leewright is a former Republican lawmaker. House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, then replaced Leewright with Krista Ratliff.

There were three other new members of the panel on Tuesday, including Bill Kern and Charlie Hannema, appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, and Leslie Walker, appointed by Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle. They replaced Chairman Brian Jackson, Robert DeNegri and Gary Unruh. All new members voted in favor of increasing the salaries and stipends. 
Only two board members, Scott Douglas and Jeff Baumann, voted against the pay hikes. 
The board rescinded its previous votes on lawmaker pay and instead approved the across-the-board raises. 
Former Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City, spoke against increasing pay for public officials during the public comment period of the meeting. 
“Legislative public service was once considered exactly that, public service, not a career path,” he said. “If money is the motive, you’re motivating the wrong people.”
The panel discussed the salary changes behind closed doors in an executive session, a change from its previous meetings where the discussion was in front of the public.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)In a rare move Tuesday, an Ohio House committee voted to advance a bill changing the deadline for absentee ballots after a single hearing. What’s more, lawmakers folded in portions of a different controversial measure related to proof of citizenship just hours before the hearing.
Advancing the proposal, Ohio Senate Bill 293, puts both changes on the fast track for approval.
The Ohio House could take up and vote on the bill during Wednesday’s session.
After Tuesday’s hearing, state Rep. Sharon Ray, R-Wadsworth, who chairs the committee, said she expects that to happen.
The Ohio Senate would still have to approve the changes.
It meets Wednesday and on Dec. 10, before breaking for the holidays.
One of the bill’s sponsors, state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, made no promises but said he hopes to secure approval for the bill quickly.
“I’m hoping that we can get something done before we go on break,” Brenner said, “so this is available for the primary next year.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He contends it’s better to make the changes in a primary so officials can work out any potential “glitches” ahead of the general election.
Ray, who’s a former election official, made a similar argument.
But Ohio state Reps. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, and Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington said the timeline is too rushed.
“We have sponsor testimony, all (public) testimony, amendments and a vote, all in one committee hearing the day before it is going to go on the floor,” Russo said.
“That is highly unusual, and I think speaks to the lack of interest in getting input into this legislation.”
Brent added, “(the) amendment being shown to us at 8:24 am, it just does not allow us a good enough time to vet this bill.”
“This is a rush job for somebody else’s agenda to encourage voter suppression,” Brent said.
Absentee ballot changes
The original bill eliminated Ohio’s current four-day grace period for the return of absentee ballots so long as they’re postmarked before Election Day.
That change represents the third successive reduction in the return timeline for federal elections.
As recently as 2022, properly postmarked ballots would still be counted if the arrived within 10 days of Election Day.
The changes come following pressure from the Trump administration.
In an executive order the president asserted a new reading of federal statutes claiming all ballots arriving after Election Day are invalid.
In a testy exchange, Russo argued that Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is pushing for the changes because of the Department of Justice’s contention that absentee ballots open the door to fraud.
“That’s their argument. I never made that argument, and I’m not making that argument,” LaRose responded.
“But you’re asking us to change state law based on that argument,” Russo insisted.
Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected a Mississippi law allowing a similar grace period for absentee ballots.
That circuit’s precedents don’t apply to Ohio, but the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case.
LaRose cited both points in testimony for the bill but insisted considerations beyond Ohio’s borders aren’t driving his support.
“The arguments about what the federal law says or not have never been my primary motivation behind this,” LaRose said.
“My primary motivation for doing this is to make sure that Ohio is very clear with an easy to remember date.”
LaRose regularly reports his findings of alleged voter fraud. Those allegations have largely come to nothing.
Although cases of voter fraud do occur, they are exceedingly rare.
Still, LaRose emphasized as recently as two months ago, “even one illegal vote can spoil the outcome of an election.”
But when it comes to otherwise valid ballots arriving late, LaRose downplayed the issue.
He noted 7,579 ballots arrived after Election Day last year but said it’s “a logical fallacy” to assume that many voters will be disenfranchised by the bill.
“Human behavior isn’t static,” LaRose said, indicating voter behavior will change with new requirements.
The ACLU of Ohio’s Collin Marozzi dug a bit deeper into the potential impact of ballots arriving after the election.
In the election Ohio held this just a few weeks ago, more than 7,000 ballots arrived during the grace period.
Marozzi rattled off eight races where those absentee ballots could’ve decided the race.
“Lawful voters casting lawful ballots by a lawful method should not be punished for something completely out of the of their control,” he insisted.
Proof of citizenship
The last-minute changes related to citizenship would make it far easier to cancel voters’ registrations.
Under the original measure, Ohio Senate Bill 153, election officials would have to send confirmation notices to voters if they couldn’t verify the voter’s citizenship through state records.
The county board would only cancel the voter’s registration if they didn’t respond to two notices.
The citizenship requirements in Tuesday’s amendment, however, put far more emphasis on the secretary’s routine audits of state voter rolls.
The same reviews that have resulted in hundreds of flagged registrations, but only a handful of indictments, would be the only data point necessary to cancel a voter’s registration.
Naturalized citizen targeted in recent voter audit argues Ohio Secretary of State not following law

The measure states the “board promptly shall cancel” a voter’s registration if the secretary’s review of state and federal data indicates that person is not a citizen.
“That’s a problem, because the Secretary of State’s data is out of date,” Jen Miller from the League of Women Voters of Ohio said.
“We know that his investigations routinely call into question the citizenship of individuals who have been naturalized,” she added.
“So, using bad data to assume that someone is not an eligible voter and kick them off the rolls without significant due process is problematic. It’s not acceptable.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to LaRose for comment but the secretary didn’t respond.
Without the confirmation notices, an otherwise eligible voter might have their registration cancelled and not know it.
“Well, I think they could always try to vote provisionally,” Rep. Ray said after the hearing, “or at least go down to the board of elections and remedy this situation.”
For a provisional ballot to count, the voter needs to provide proof of eligibility within the four-day cure period following Election Day.
That can present challenges when many people don’t have ready access to the documents they need.
Research from the University of Maryland indicates more than 21 million Americans don’t have ready access to documentary proof of citizenship.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee will appeal a ruling requiring the state to remove the National Guard from Memphis as part of a massive police action.
Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tuesday the state will challenge a Davidson County chancellor’s decision temporarily blocking Lee from continuing to deploy the Tennessee National Guard to the city.
“The case presents important legal questions that have ramifications for not just the safety of Memphians now but for all Tennesseans for centuries to come. We look forward to further litigation on appeal,” Skrmetti said a day after Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal issued her ruling.
During arguments before Moskal earlier this month, the attorney general’s office said the courts should not have authority to overturn the governor’s decision to send National Guard personnel to Memphis.
A group of state lawmakers and Shelby County officials filed suit Oct. 17 asking for the Guard to be permanently removed from Memphis where they are part of a local, state and federal force of 31 agencies trying to clamp down on crime.
In her Monday ruling, Moskal said the Guard’s role in the Memphis Safe Task Force violates the terms and conditions of Tennessee’s Military Code. Moskal agreed with the plaintiffs that Tennessee’s Constitution allows the Guard to be mobilized only in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” and even then, “the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
Neither the legislature nor Memphis officials requested the Guard to be deployed to Shelby County as part of the task force.
Judge temporarily blocks National Guard deployment in Memphis

Lee directed Guard personnel to Memphis after President Donald Trump signed a memo ordering the Memphis Safe Task Force to be formed. The governor never issued an order for the deployment, only a press release.
Lee said Tuesday he is standing by his decision.
“Memphians know their city is facing a violent crime emergency that the state must address, and we’re confident higher courts will ultimately recognize this as well. The state will appeal, and the Tennessee National Guard will continue to operate as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force while the case is on appeal, per the judge’s order,” Lee spokesperson Elizabeth Johnson said in a Tuesday statement.
The task force has made 2,800 arrests, confiscated more than 450 illegal firearms and located 114 missing children, Johnson said, and added, “there’s no question these public safety efforts must continue.”
These numbers haven’t been able to be independently verified.
More than 1,000 of those arrests were on warrants for homicide, narcotics, firearms and sex offenses committed in Memphis, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The task force has also issued thousands of motor vehicle citations, eliciting criticism from some local officials that law enforcement is focusing on speeding tickets and minor violations.
The judge’s injunction requires removal of the Guard from Memphis only if the state fails to appeal within five days.
Memphis Police said last week fewer than 200 Guard personnel were in Memphis, but that number was expected to more than double. Recent court filing indicated more than 700 Guard members are patrolling the city.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Bev and Ron Puhalla came out of retirement 18 months ago to save their local paper, the Pawnee Republican, from closing down.
Now, the Puhallas and community leaders in southeast Nebraska’s Pawnee County are launching an effort to ensure the future of the Republican, the oldest, continuously published weekly paper in the state.
A recent meeting in the community led to the creation of the Sunrise Publications Journalism Trust, a nonprofit foundation aimed at gathering financial support, via tax-deductible contributions from individuals and organizations, to keep the paper operating.
The effort in Pawnee County, population 2,500, is a rural duplicate of what has happened in many urban areas across the country, including Omaha, where the nonprofit Flatwater Free Press has built a newsroom that rivals the for-profit Omaha World-Herald via philanthropic support.
The pathway to finding financial support in rural areas can be much more difficult, given fewer organizations and less population, but it can be done, according to the head of a journalism trust in western Iowa.

The Western Iowa Journalism Foundation, which is based out of a farmhouse outside Breda, Iowa, now hands out more than $300,000 a year in grants, helping 11 community newspapers add and retain staff and fund the transition to digital publication.
“We just need to educate people that this isn’t a failing business that you’re just propping up,” said Becky Vonnahme, the executive director of the foundation. “This is helping people to stay connected and helping a community stay visible and relevant.”
The foundation was formed in late 2020, she said, as publishers of small-town community newspapers came to realize that the old model of supporting local journalism via ads from mom-and-pop retailers on the main drag had disappeared due to the closing of such businesses and an exodus of advertising to Facebook and other digital platforms.
Vonnahme said that philanthropic support is necessary for small papers because it’s unclear, at least so far, whether online subscriptions can sustain a newsroom into the future.
Research has shown that when a town loses its local newspaper, many “bad” things happen, she said, including a decline in voting and political candidates, disengagement from community affairs and an increase in corruption and political partisanship.
“This really is the last line of defense for rural Iowa, rural America. No one is coming in to talk about Breda, Iowa, or Carroll, Iowa,” Vonnahme said.
Bev Puhalla and her husband, who took over the 157-year-old Pawnee Republican in 1990, were forced to return to the paper after a new owner, who bought the paper in 2019, quit suddenly. But they’re both in their mid-70s and want to get back to retirement.
Puhalla said she had watched how Flatwater had grown via donations, and floated the idea of doing something similar during a community meeting a few weeks ago.
She asked if those in attendance would serve on a board to oversee such a journalism trust. The response, Puhalla said, was “overwhelming” and “heartwarming.”
The Sunrise Publications Journalism Trust Board includes the heads of the local hospital and school district, a local lawyer and accountant and a local banker.
“They understand the important role the newspaper plays in the community,” Puhalla said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One member of the new board, Todd Evans, superintendent of the Pawnee City Public Schools, said a local newspaper is a “key component” in preserving the quality of life, and civic engagement, in a small town.
“Newspapers celebrate successes, mourn losses and report important local events,” Evans said. ”I am very appreciative of the focus of the City of Pawnee that embraces small-town living. The local newspaper contributes to, supports and defines our community.”
The number of newspapers in Nebraska has declined in recent years from 146 to 133 due to some closings but also due to mergers to create a single, county newspaper. Nine counties in the state have no newspapers anymore, including suburban Cass County, which sits between Omaha and Lincoln — though a Plattsmouth-based newsletter, the Cass Gram, provides a wrap-up of local news.
Small-town newspapers face headwinds besides the loss of local advertisers, including uncertain mail service, difficulties in hiring staff and trouble finding a press to print a newspaper.
Dennis DeRossett, the executive director of Nebraska Press Association, said he was glad to see the Pawnee City community come together in support of the local newspaper. He said the Press Association is looking at transitioning its existing foundation to duplicate what the Western Iowa Journalism Foundation has done — to provide grants to sustain Nebraska newspapers. Currently, the Nebraska Press Association Foundation is focused on providing scholarships and education.

He said that instead of paying a $50 subscription, a reader could provide a larger donation to a foundation.
“This is a way to keep a local newspaper and do it through a tax-deductible gift,” DeRossett said.
In Pawnee City, the Sunrise Publications Journalism Trust has already gotten a “sizable” contribution from a local booster club, Puhalla said, and is beginning to solicit other donations. A Flatwater staffer, she said, has pledged to help their effort.
In Iowa, the Western Iowa Journalism Foundation was aided by a national documentary about one of the area’s newspapers, the 3,000-circulation Storm Lake Times Pilot. Despite winning a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 2017, the paper was struggling financially and short of staff.
Vonnahme said that the PBS documentary focused on the plight of community newspapers — small staffs that fill a variety of jobs — while also posing the question, “Does democracy survive” without local journalism?
The documentary, she said, helped kick-start donations and led a California philanthropist to make a five-year pledge to support two to three reporters at the Times Pilot. It allowed the Storm Lake paper to cover city council, school board and county board meetings it couldn’t cover previously, as well as do enterprise stories that had to be set aside for nuts-and-bolts reporting, according to the paper’s award-winning editor, Art Cullen.
Vonnahme said that getting donations requires telling the story of how the business model of local newspapers has been decimated by the shift away from print to digital advertising, and that with some partial support from donors, local journalists can stay on the job.
“It just takes a lot of education to show why it’s so important to keep that local news source,” she said.

Burlington, Vermont
Died Sept. 21, 2025
Tucson, Arizona
Details of services
A memorial service in Burlington will be announced at a later date.

Jordan passed away on September 21, 2025, in Tucson, AZ. He was born in Burlington, VT, on February 16, 1992, where he lived until moving with his family to Tucson in 2003. Jordan graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in Tucson and then attended Denison University in Granville, OH.
From his youth, Jordan was a voracious reader and had an active, wide-ranging intellect. He could be seen, with a travel mug of tea in hand, walking to his elementary school, lost in the book held close to his face. With his ever-curious mind he preferred self-learning over formal education and enjoyed the camaraderie and competition of the extracurricular spelling bee team in grade school and the Academic Decathlon in high school. While at Denison Jordan was pursuing a major in Classical Studies and worked in the Online Communications department.

While growing up in Vermont, Jordan had fun outdoors during all the seasons. He loved camping, alpine skiing, playing hockey on the backyard rink, and adventures with his 4-H club. Memorable trips were ice fishing on the lake and an overnight stay in the mountains in a handmade snow shelter, both in subzero temps. Some months after moving to the Sonoran Desert, Jordan remarked that “Arizona has two seasons, summer and hell.”  But he had adapted to the heat by then, having found relief at the neighborhood pool where he joined the swim team and quickly made a new group of friends. Through his Tucson 4-H club and a youth program with the AZ Game and Fish Department, he continued shooting skeet, trap, and sporting clays, a sport he first practiced in Vermont. Jordan found more friends and mentors at the Tucson range and excelled in competitions in and out of the state, ultimately becoming a certified referee. In high school he trained in ninjitsu, outdoors, year round. As a freshman at Denison he joined the sailing team and found a new passion competing in regattas around the Midwest, both for his school and on private boats.
After leaving college, Jordan lived and worked in Vermont, San Francisco, Seattle, Tucson, and New York City. He was employed in administration and sales at several established companies and in startups. He also worked regularly in hospitality, starting at age 14 in the kitchen of a gelato shop and most recently as a bartender. Jordan was a talented writer, a skill he used in his work settings and in creative, expository, and critical pieces that he published online.
From a young age, Jordan was kind, affectionate, funny and loyal. He enthusiastically affirmed and celebrated his family and friends. His warmth, curiosity, and quick wit served him well, both personally and professionally. He was engaging, approachable, and non-judgmental with friends, roommates, and customers. Jordan was a skilled shopper and enjoyed fine things. He eagerly shared his opinions on bespoke clothing (steam, don’t iron!), gourmet foods, chef’s knives (stone sharpen!), literature, and opera (Maria Callas!). He was equally cozy with fast food, dive bars, trendy music, and dented vehicles.
Jordan had a heart-felt sense of justice. He was troubled by abuses of power and was an advocate for victims of systemic oppression. The suffering caused by police brutality, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and civil war in Yemen weighed heavily on his mind. He yearned for a world with more compassion, equity, and tolerance. We honor Jordan’s memory when we embrace these values and act on our moral convictions.
Jordan’s personal suffering was deeper than many of us knew and his death by suicide is a heartbreaking and devastating loss to many. Our immense grief reflects our deep love and care for him. His absence from our lives will be an ongoing sorrow but memories of his universal empathy, off-beat humor, and clever commentary will continue to make us smile and keep his spirit alive.
Jordan is survived by his mother, Michelle Mraz (Rob Backus) of Burlington; his father, Mitchell H. Kurker (Juanita) of Tucson; his brother; his grandmother, Frances Kurker of Tucson, and many aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends. He was predeceased by his grandparents, Margaret and Charles Mraz of Middlebury, VT, and his grandfather, Mitchell A. Kurker, of Tucson.
If you would like to make a contribution in Jordan’s memory, please consider your local library, center for the arts, or agency for mental health services.
Jordan’s family is grateful to those who have expressed their sympathy and provided comfort and support since his passing. Thank you.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)TOPEKA — The federal government shutdown threatened food program benefits for 180,000 Kansans, and near daily guidance from courts left state leaders unsure about November payments.  
On Nov. 7, the state of Kansas paid out November benefits in full to all Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, after days of back-and-forth filings in lawsuits that first indicated 50% of November benefits should be paid and then a miscalculation increases that amount to 66% of benefits. 
Based on a court order and guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Kansas made the full November SNAP payments “with the expectation the USDA would fully fund SNAP with federal funding,” said Erin La Row, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department for Children and Families in an email. 
But on Nov. 8, the USDA issued guidance that states were to pay partial benefits and said, “To the extent states sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized. Accordingly, states must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025. Please advise the appropriate FNS regional office representative of steps taken to correct any actions taken that do not comply with this memorandum.”
Kansas was one of at least four states that paid out benefits Nov. 7, including New York, Wisconsin and Oregon. 
The memo said that if states didn’t comply, the USDA could possibly take action, including cancelling the federal share of state administrative costs and holding states liable for any overissuances from the noncompliance.
However, La Row said Tuesday that Kansas doesnt expect any problems after paying out benefits on Nov. 7, the day before the USDA ordered states to “undo” paying the benefits. 
She referred to a USDA memo on Nov. 13 that ordered states to transmit full November payments after the government shutdown ended. 
“FNS (Food and Nutrition Services) shall not pursue any additional penalties against State agencies, pursuant to 7 CFR 271.7(h), due to extraordinary circumstances,” the memo said.
Even before SNAP payments were delayed, Kansas food pantries were stretched to meet the needs of families as costs rose and the governtment shutdown took its toll. Communities across the state stepped up to provide resources, including four Kansas health philanthropies.
The United Methodist Health Ministry Fund, Kansas Health Foundation, Sunflower Foundation and REACH Healthcare Foundation contributed more than $381,000 to support food banks and community pantries, the groups said in a news release. The money will be distributed before year’s end.
“Kansans are struggling to put food on their tables right now, and it’s important we help where we can in the short term,” said David Jordan, Health Fund president and CEO.

The company has filed a notice of its intent to apply for a construction permit to build the $276 million, 131.2-megawatt facility.
NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said although the company plans to seek a permit, it will make a decision later about moving forward with the project. 
“This has to be cost efficient and meet the needs of our South Dakota customers,” she said.
The Public Utilities Commission heard the company’s plan at the commission’s Tuesday meeting in Pierre.

Construction could start this spring, with commercial operations set to start by mid-2030, according to documents submitted to the commission. The company said it’s responding to an “imminent” and growing need for electricity.
Consumers in the state used 95.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2023 — up 5.6 billion cubic feet from the 89.9 billion consumed in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas consumed for electric power drove most of that consumption.

Population growth and energy demand drive the need for another natural gas plant, Black said.
“As an energy service provider, we need to plan for all the things we need to do to deliver reliable energy service in South Dakota now and into the future,” she said.
If built, the facility will be located on the south side of Aberdeen, near 135th Street and South Fifth Street, on a piece of land already owned by NorthWestern Energy and near an existing natural gas plant. The facility will tap into existing infrastructure.
In addition to the Aberdeen plant, NorthWestern has a natural gas plant in Huron. NorthWestern provides electricity or natural gas to about 842,000 customers in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Yellowstone National Park.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Northwestern-Public-Service-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-11-18 18:58:08.794768

A tentative deal between the Ohio House and Senate has been reached on marijuana and hemp policy, but it’s not one that Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, supports.
“I am as frustrated and disappointed as anybody, given how much time and effort and capital I’ve spent on this. To be looking at potentially getting nothing is very frustrating,” he said.
Fischer was on the small conference committee to deal with Ohio Senate Bill 56, the vehicle for all THC policy.
The Ohio House has been protecting access to THC, but Fischer said they are losing the battle.
In a sneak peek at the legislation expected to be passed this week, he explained that all “intoxicating” hemp, low-level THC products would be banned in Ohio. This includes THC beverages.
“That’s the biggest point of contention right now,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear these drinks, as they stand today, are not causing a problem.”
There would be an off-ramp for sellers to adjust to the ban, but it’s not enough, he said.
The Ohio House lost leverage in regulating the product due to the federal government banning hemp, the lawmaker said.
When voting to open the government, federal lawmakers in Congress closed a loophole created in the 2018 Farm Bill that allowed for low-level THC products to be sold without regulation.
Congress’s Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill) allowed for hemp products to be sold as long as they have .3% THC or less.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued guidance on their website that under the law, the Drug Enforcement Administration no longer has the authority to seize and criminalize sending or buying seeds with less than .3% THC.
In 2019, Ohio legalized the product as well.
Fischer has spoken with some members of Ohio’s congressional delegation about rescinding the hemp ban and is hopeful that representatives will address it within the next six months.
“I would say, given the circumstances, there was so much interest in getting the shutdown over with from everybody involved,” he said. “As a lawmaker, there are some times you just want to get it over with and then deal with it later.”
Upset and still fighting for hemp, state Rep Jamie Callender, R-Concord, said that, at least on the marijuana side, the Ohio House got a lot of its priorities.
“It would guarantee that we have the six plants per person and 12 per household that the people voted on,” Callender said.
Along with protecting access to THC levels, it finally gives cities with dispensaries a part of the tax revenue from sales.
It’ not in the legislation yet, but it is expected to also provide money for filing fees in the expungement process for low-level marijuana offenses.
But Callender is upset with some legal aspects of it.
“If you are a license holder, medical card holder, or you’re known to visit dispensaries … that would be probable cause to stop you and to search you,” Callender said. “I have a problem with that.”
The House has been standing up to the Ohio Senate for years on marijuana and hemp, so we asked Fischer why they aren’t fighting back anymore.
“It is difficult when you have just a fundamentally different opinion on all of this stuff,” Fischer said, adding that he didn’t realize the Ohio Senate’s negative opinion of the THC drinks.
“Do you think that the hemp sellers could see you as caving if you go through with this proposal as it stands?” I asked Fischer.
Asked if hemp sellers could see him as caving if he goes through with the proposal as it stands, “They might,” he replied.
“There’s going to have to be a lot of give and take.”
But now, he’s in a last-ditch effort to take a little more for his side.
The bill is expected to be introduced and voted on Wednesday.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington succeeded Tuesday in getting the House to publicly reprimand a Democratic colleague.
But she needed support of nearly every House Republican as the vast majority of her own party, including six fellow Washington Democrats, opposed her resolution targeting Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois, for an electioneering toe-tap to anoint a successor.
Gluesenkamp Perez applauded Garcia’s career in public service and said he was retiring for honorable reasons. “But election subversion is wrong no matter who’s doing it,” she added.
The House approved Gluesenkamp Perez’s measure on a 236-183 vote, with 23 Democrats joining 213 Republicans to pass it. Republican U.S. Reps. Michael Baumgartner of Spokane and Dan Newhouse of Sunnyside voted in favor. U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier of Sammamish was the lone Washington Democrat to side with her in-state colleague.
The five-paragraph resolution “disapproves of the behavior” of Garcia in the run-up to the filing deadline for 2026 Democratic candidates in the deep blue, Chicago-area district.
Garcia submitted a petition to run for another term. Days before the deadline, the four-term congressman abetted his chief of staff in gathering required signatures to become a candidate. When the filing deadline passed, and it was clear they were the only two Democratic candidates, Garcia announced he would retire at the end of his term.
Baumgartner, on Monday afternoon, criticized Garcia’s “secret switcheroo” that left his top aide as effectively the only Democratic choice for voters. “”Obviously not a great look for Democracy in the best of light,” he told reporters.
Gluesenkamp Perez laid out the timeline of Garcia’s actions Monday night in a spirited sparring session with fellow Democrats on the House floor. It was an unusual scene as the centrist stood alone at a podium enduring withering verbal attacks from her own caucus after most Republicans exited the chamber. 
At one point, Garcia defended his actions and decision to retire to spend time with his family.
“When a colleague chooses his family, that shouldn’t be a moment for division; it should be a moment for understanding and unity,” he said.
In her statement Tuesday, Gluesenkamp Perez said, “It shouldn’t have caused as much friction as it did to speak honestly and consistently about election subversion,” adding that “Congress is a legislative body, not a social club.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marie-Gluesenkamp-Perez-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 18:58:08.794768

Gretchen Whitmer addresses the 2025 state budget impasse and the damage of federal tariffs on the state's economy at Heritage Hall in Lansing, Mich. Sept. 16, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe legislative earmark reforms championed by Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) during the fraught 2025-26 budget process became law on Tuesday after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed the House and Senate’s respective bills into law.
Whitmer signed House Bill 4420 and Senate Bill 596, now Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025.
The laws together would institute new earmark rules initially instituted in the GOP-controlled House during the budget process, which were later adopted by the Senate, run by majority Democrats, as bargaining chip to end the stalemate that saw the government shut down briefly as lawmakers worked into the night to hammer out a deal to fund the state of Michigan.
Part of that deal required both sides of the legislative chambers to adopt some aspects of Hall’s framework. The biggest new piece is that legislative earmarks need to be disclosed at the front end of the budget process and must marinate in the public view for nearly 50 days so the public, press and appropriations leaders can scrutinize whether the requests would be in the greater interest of the state and the communities they serve. 
That scrutiny, as it did in the 2025-26 process, would serve as a future hedge against earmarks that don’t meet that standard from making it into proposed appropriations plans and a final legislative budget deal.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Whitmer praised the bills in a news release issued after the signing.
“Since I took office, I’ve been committed to increasing transparency in our government, so Michiganders know exactly where their hard-earned dollars are going,” Whitmer said. “That’s why I made a promise to increase transparency on legislative earmarks in my most recent State of the State. Less than a year later, I’m proud to sign these two bills that requires lawmakers to put their names on any projects they propose. I’ll keep working with anyone to serve Michiganders and increase transparency in our government.”
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said in a statement that Michiganders deserve the transparency of knowing where their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent.
“That’s why I’m proud that my Senate Democratic colleagues and I championed this legislation — which passed with bipartisan support — to require all earmarks and enhancement grants to be publicly disclosed before the passage of the state budget,” Brinks said. “Today’s signing of this legislation into law underscores our continued commitment to ensuring our government remains accountable and accessible to the folks we’ve been entrusted to serve.”

And yet, the big winner was arguably Hall, who backed the push early and made it a major sticking point in the negotiations that went down to the wire of the October 1 start of the new fiscal year. Although Democrats blamed Hall and his chamber for holding up the budget process after failing to meet the statutory July 1 deadline to produce a budget, which the Senate did in April, the push for transparency on earmarks got across the finish line largely due to his efforts early in the cycle.
“The signing of the Hall Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (HEAT) plan is the most significant reform to our state budget in decades,” Hall said. “For far too long, politicians and Lansing insiders have abused the system to stuff the budget full of anonymous pork projects they can’t defend. That abuse ends today.”

(Photo courtesy of Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation)The highly anticipated groundbreaking ceremony for the Agent Orange Memorial on Nov. 15 in Sunset, Utah, marked an important phase in the construction of an extremely significant and rather ambitious project.
The official ceremony was a special occasion that helps increase public awareness of a project that began nearly two years ago and is now nearing completion. For the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF) and its supporters, the event represented a major milestone.
Following an extensive amount of planning, fundraising events, and a public relations campaign, the UAOVF has achieved an immense measure of success. This accomplishment however, has by no means been attained without a number of disappointing setbacks along the way.
Project challenges are certainly not uncommon in undertakings as enormous in scope as the Agent Orange Memorial. One of the key challenges encountered by the UAOVF, for instance, was obtaining official site approval for such a large monument.
Months of diligent efforts to get permission from the Layton City Council to locate the memorial in Layton Commons Park proved unsuccessful. It was not until the summer of 2025 that the monument received a sanctioned home in Sunset Veterans Park, which is located several miles north of Layton near Hill Air Force Base. 
The lack of an official site for the Agent Orange Memorial also had an adverse effect on much needed financial support. Some of the people who were interested in supporting the UAOVF’s mission were reluctant to make donations until the nonprofit organization found a place to locate the memorial.
Other issues encountered were delays in the construction and acquisition of various components. One problem involved the monument’s orange-colored stone. In a September 2025 phone conversation with Larry Kerr, chairman of the UAOVF, I learned that the stone had broken in half in transit due to an obscure defect.
Those and other frustrating complications forced the UAOVF to reschedule its plan to dedicate the monument on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, 2025. Nevertheless, formidable obstacles were overcome one by one and essentially overshadowed by the triumphant groundbreaking ceremony in Sunset.
While the event was certainly a joyous occasion, it was also inherently somber in nature. This was due to tragic consequences of toxic chemical exposure. Those circumstances were the motivating force that led to the establishment of the UAOVF and its mission to build a monument that pays tribute to victims of Agent Orange.
The U.S. military stopped using Agent Orange more than 50 years ago. Since then, hundreds of thousands of Vietnam veterans have died from their exposure to it and similar toxic herbicides. Thanks to avid veteran advocacy, the passage of time has not suppressed the memory of those and other veterans who suffered a similar fate.
In addition to Vietnam veterans, other victims of toxic chemical exposure will also be recognized by the Agent Orange Memorial. Earlier this year, the UAOVF included Gulf War veterans who served in places like Kuwait and Iraq as well as veterans who served after Sept. 11, 2001 and were stationed in Afghanistan and other countries. 
The groundbreaking and corresponding activities in Sunset exemplify advocacy that helps preserve the memory of toxic chemical victims who served in Vietnam and elsewhere. This is because those actions help facilitate the construction of one of the most meaningful and distinctive military monuments in the entire Beehive State.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2305-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-11-18 18:58:08.794768

It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our dearest Jack Williamson, née Harold John Williamson, on October 24, 2025 at age 85, with family at his side. Jack was the son of Dr. and Mrs. Harold Williamson, longtime residents of Bristol, Vermont.
Jack will be remembered as an individual who genuinely cared about the people he met throughout his life. People gravitated toward him for conversation, advice, and at any random moment when they needed to be heard. He often could be seen at the Charlotte Post Office or the Shelburne IGA stopping to chat with those he knew and those he had just met.
Nothing was more important than family to Jack, beginning as the oldest of five boys. He played a big role in the lives of his brothers Ron, Mark, Bruce, and Chris, and he cherished his years with them. Since age 11, Jack spent his summers at the family lake house at Cedar Beach in Charlotte, VT. Because he loved Lake Champlain and had been a deckhand on the ferry since he was 14, Jack got his Coast Guard Captain’s license so he could pilot the ferry between Charlotte and Essex, NY during his summer vacations. He quickly realized that Cedar Beach was exactly where he wanted to be for the rest of his life.
Jack graduated from Bristol High School and the University of Vermont, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi fraternity. He then served in the Vermont Air National Guard, and began his career in publishing, joining the college division of McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. With his love of Cedar Beach, he wrote to the owners of a home next door to his parents’ summer house while in high school, asking that they tell him if they ever wanted to sell their summer home. And true to a Vermont neighbor, they wrote him many years later. Thus, at age 25, with incredible foresight, Jack bought the summer house that became his family’s beloved year-round home on Lake Champlain to this day. 
In 1969, Jack married Susan Soloway, beginning a lifelong union based on love, respect, working together, shared goals, humor, and a love of life in Vermont. In 1974, their daughter Sarah joined them and enriched their lives from that day forward. In 1977, their son Zachary was born, completing their family. What joy Jack found in his children at every age!
In 1971, Jack left McGraw Hill to start Garden Way Publishing in Charlotte for Lyman Wood. At Garden Way, he built one of the first publishing houses that extended the movement of homesteading to include energy efficiency by publishing “Designing and Building a Solar House”, “The Underground House Book”, and “Heat Pumps: An Efficient Heating and Cooling Alternative,” among other ground-breaking books — all published in the 1970s.
Jack and Susan founded Williamson Publishing Company, a children’s book publishing company focused on ‘learning by doing’ and empowering kids to follow their curiosity in 1983. Every book was written so that a child, parent, or teacher could explore a topic on many levels. Like everything he did, Jack found joy in all aspects of publishing, loved providing new approaches to learning, and meeting book-people around the world.
Jack is survived by his family, many friends, and business associates. He leaves his loving wife of 56 years, Susan;  their daughter, Sarah (Jonathan) of Newton, MA; their son Zachary (Kimberly) of Burlington, VT; their four treasured grandchildren: Aidan, Jackson, Eva and Isaac; his brothers who were lifelong friends, Bruce Williamson (Linda), Chris Williamson (Ginger); his much loved sisters-in-law Gretchen Williamson (Mark), Elaine Dratch (Paul), Jane Soloway (Mitchell Moody); Debra Sobin (Stanley), 12 nieces and nephews who were always dear to his heart, and his cousin Janet Gibbs. He was predeceased by his parents, Harold and Eleanor (Dorsey) Williamson, his brothers Ronald Williamson, and Mark Williamson; and his brother-in-law, Dr. Paul Dratch.

The Role of the Adult Caregiver and the Challenging Decisions about what is “best”
WILMINGTON, Del. — An adult caregivers and caregiver, in the broadest sense, is anyone who invests time, money and energy to assist an older adult who needs help. In many families, it takes a village—relatives and friends, neighbors, nurses and aides, the person who handles the bills, the one who fixes the leaky sink, the cook who keeps meals coming. All of them are caregivers in their own unique ways. But the primary caregiver is different. The buck stops with that person. They make the hard decisions, explain changes to the family, and too often become the lightning rod for suspicion, grief and frustration when reality doesn’t match expectations. It is one of the most demanding roles a person can hold.
A growing share of us are caregivers. Experts at Easterseals Delaware estimate that 30% or more of adults ages 45 and up are serving as caregivers, a share that is rising as people live longer with complex needs. For many, this season arrives suddenly and without a playbook, piling stress onto already full lives of work, children, and finances. The result is a simple, anxious question that starts the process: What do we do now?
“Where do I start?”“When families call us, the first thing they say is, ‘Where do I start?’” said Lynn Paxson, a leading consultant to caregivers in Delaware and president of Oasis Care Advisors. “Overwhelm, guilt, and fear are common. The good news is that once options are clear, most people feel relief and empowerment.”
A journey, not a single decisionThe path to care rarely begins with a moving truck or a signed home-care agreement. It starts with unease as small lapses turn into patterns. A doctor’s visit brings new instructions; a hospital discharge adds urgency. By then, the conversation has shifted from if help is needed to what kind of help will keep a loved one safest and most supported.
Five stages families face


Early concerns: Subtle signs—missed medications, skipped meals, isolation—raise the question: Is Mom safe at home?


Health decline: Falls, ER visits or memory lapses push the discussion forward as safety becomes the priority.


Care and housing decisions: Families compare staying at home with a caregiver versus moving to a senior living community, weighing the cost, care level, and lifestyle.


Legal and financial planning: Power of attorney, advance directives, and budgets move to the front burner; families may explore VA Aid & Attendance or long-term care insurance.


Transition and adjustment: Whether moving or starting home care, emotions run high; ongoing support helps the new routine stick.


The turning point: choosing a care settingSenior living communities offer structure: staff on site around the clock, medication management, a built-in social life, and a predictable monthly bill that bundles housing with care. For older adults who are lonely, missing meals or struggling with routines, the daily rhythm—and the presence of peers—can be stabilizing.
Why do many stay home?In-home care preserves the familiarity of the house and neighborhood. Care is scheduled by the hour or day and tailored to what the person needs, whether that’s help with bathing, transportation or specialized dementia support. The tradeoff is coverage: safety at home depends on how many hours a caregiver is present and how well those hours match the risks.
What it costs—and what fits?Communities invoice monthly and adjust fees as care needs rise. Home care can begin modestly—just a few hours a week—but expenses climb quickly if nights, weekends or specialized skills are required. “Families often discover there is no single ‘cheap’ option,” Paxson said. “There’s the option that best matches risk, personality, and budget.”
Paperwork with a purposeEven as families compare models, a second track of tasks arrives with its own clock. Power of attorney, advance directives and a workable budget are no longer paperwork for “someday”; they become essential tools to avoid crises. Some households qualify for help through long-term care insurance or VA benefits; others stitch together resources with savings and family support. Social workers and case managers can coordinate therapies, equipment and home-health orders that complement either path.
The first weeks are emotionalOnce a decision is made, a new set of emotions takes center stage. Moves are rarely purely logistical; they are identity-shifting. Families who choose home care worry about finding the right fit; those who choose a community worry about how their loved one will adjust to a new routine. “That’s where coaching matters,” Paxson said. “We walk with families through the first weeks—touring, matching caregivers and checking in after move-in—so small problems don’t become big ones.”
Vetting in-home care agenciesFor households opting to remain at home, ask whether the agency has caregivers available now in the right ZIP code and with the needed skills—mobility support, memory-care experience or chronic-disease know-how. Screening, training and a reliable backup plan for call-outs are nonnegotiable, as are transparent pricing and proper licensing.
Touring communities the right wayVisit at mealtimes, observe an activity, and talk with residents and families, not just the marketing team. Note staffing visibility, response times and how teams interact with residents who need extra prompts or redirection.
Avoid the pitfallsA few warning signs can help primary caregivers steer clear of costly detours and unsafe arrangements.


Unverified call centers and vague online ads — They often sell your contact information instead of solving problems.


“Too good to be true” offers — Beware of hidden fees, unlicensed operators or services that won’t meet your loved one’s needs.


Pressure tactics without a full care assessment — Anyone rushing you to decide, especially without transparency, is a red flag.“Your loved one’s safety and dignity should always come first,” Paxson said. “Work with credentialed advisors, ask blunt questions and see the care up close—whether that’s in the living room or the dining room.”


How to get started todayWrite down the specific worries—falls, medication mix-ups, loneliness—along with current diagnoses, medications and doctors.

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 18, 2025.
Things have been busy at Boisvert’s Shoe Repair in Barre over the last few weeks while the family has been selling inventory and auctioning off equipment. The 75-year-old anchor business on Main Street in downtown Barre is closing Nov. 24, ending a five-generation legacy that started in Quebec, moved to Northfield, and finally settled in Barre when Ernie Boisvert moved the shop there in 1950.
The community isn’t just losing a longtime family business; it’s losing a service that is increasingly hard to find. The closest shoe repair service to Barre is Balance Works, 66 miles away in Rutland.
Megan Boisvert, 34, the fifth generation to run the shop, said the closing is critical for her family, allowing her father, Karl, 70, to retire. She cited dwindling retail sales; two major floods, in 2023 and 2024; and COVID among the reasons for shuttering the business.
None of the Boisverts (and one volunteer) could talk for long about the move without tearing up. On a busy Thursday last week, customers came and went, picking up their shoe repairs for the last time, and buying discounted polish, shoes, laces, boots, and other leather goods before the option no longer exists. One customer even bought the store clock.
Loreen Abraham, of Barre, said she’s been a Boisvert’s customer since 1993. The former owner of Bag Ladies Deli in Barre has had countless repairs done at the shop, gotten her shoes polished there regularly, and even had a knife sheath that belonged to her father repaired about a month ago. 
But mostly, Abraham said, “I always come in for a polish.”

As Abraham spoke, a shop volunteer, Marcy, explained the store’s three-step polishing process to another customer, surgeon Dick Butsch. “We do the pigment, dense cream, so then you put it on with a soft cloth, small circles, let it set for a few minutes, buff it off with a brush. Or you can buff it off with another clean cloth,” she told him, “Then you use a brush and put wax on, and then you buff after that, and then you snow proof.”
In response to his confused look, she said he can call her if he forgets any of the steps. Butsch said he has been a Boisvert customer since the 1970s. “I’ve had everything repaired here except my car,” he said. Boisvert’s closing, he added, is “the worst thing in the last 30 years. There’s no other one like it in the state.”
Over the years, Butsch said he’s bought new shoes at Boisvert’s, along with winter socks and winter gloves. But, “one of their problems is, everything they sell lasts.”
And there’s the rub. Megan Boisvert noted that the store’s business used to be 70% retail and 30% repairs. As customers increasingly started shopping online, that flipped, and now the store revenue comes mostly from repairs.

Because of that, she said, “I just felt like the business wasn’t strong enough for me to take over. And, unfortunately, with retail being down, I’d be here all the time doing repairs.”
Megan Boisvert repeatedly urged customers to shop locally if they want to keep local businesses open. Another factor, she said, is that without a staff, she has to close the shop at 4 p.m. most days so she can go to her two other jobs, as a bartender and server at local restaurants.
Mary Ellen Boisvert, wife of fourth generation shop owner Karl, said the shoe repair has been a major feature of the shop, but they have also ended up fixing tents, zippers, jackets and more. Megan Boisvert recalled the time her father and one of their stitchers made a leather bra for a cow whose udder was dragging on the ground. They also once made a harness for an iguana, she said, and fixed a leather sex toy for a local couple.
But the heart of the business has always been shoe repair, what Megan calls “the basics”: heels, half soles, rips, elastic, shines, stretching (“lots of stretching”), replacing rivets and hooks, and, often, a polish-while-you-wait.

When her grandfather opened the shop, Megan said, he was given the space rent-free for two weeks, which was exactly how long he had to make a go of it in order to start paying rent. So he lined up chairs and polished shoes while customers waited. There were six other shoe repair shops in town at the time, but his approach beat them out.
“He had no choice,” his granddaughter said. “He just worked and did what he knew.” Ernie Boisvert had learned shoe repair from his father, Adelard, who had the shop in Northfield, and Adelard learned it from his father, Joseph, who ran a shop in Quebec.
Megan will miss the customers. Some have been coming to the shop since before Megan was born, and they’ve known her all her life. She runs into them everywhere.
In a Facebook post, Megan closed with a message to the shop’s many customers: “To our loyal customers and neighbors: thank you for your trust, your support, and your friendship through the years. It’s been an honor to keep your shoes — and this community — walking strong.”
Cassandra Hemenway has been a customer of Boisvert’s off and on since 1994, over which time she has had countless pairs of shoes polished, stretched and repaired.

Tate Reeves elected vice chair of Republican Governors Association,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/18/tate-reeves-elected-republican-governors-association/,Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves' election to vice chairman makes him the likely choice for the Republican Governors Association chairmanship in 2027.,"Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves will serve as the vice chair of the Republican Governors Association, the organization announced Tuesday.
The association that helps elect Republicans across the country, held its own elections for leadership positions at its annual conference this week in San Antonio. Republican governors elected Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte as chairman, Reeves as vice chairman and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee as policy chairman for 2026.
The governors will assume their positions immediately, serving a one-year term. The move means Reeves will help support other Republicans during 2026 midterm elections.
His election to vice chairman also makes him the likely choice for the RGA chairmanship in 2027, but ascension is not automatic.
Reeves will replace Gianforte as vice chair. Reeves previously served on the association’s executive committee. In a news release Tuesday, Reeves said it has never been more important for states to elect Republican governors as the Democratic Party “sprints toward socialism.”
“We’re focusing on the things that matter – like creating high-paying jobs, investing in American families, and keeping neighborhoods in our states safe,” Reeves said. “Alongside Governor Gianforte, Governor Lee, and President Trump, we’ll continue to elect more Republican governors and expand the American Dream.”
The leadership elections took place on the heels of Republican losses in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey.

(Courtesy Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority)Water infrastructure projects across New Mexico are $200 million short of being fully funded for fiscal year 2026, according to the New Mexico Municipal League.
Leaders with the Municipal League, a nonprofit organization that aims to solve common problems shared by locales across the state, told state lawmakers at a Legislative Finance Committee hearing Tuesday morning that statewide drinking water infrastructure needs have a price tag of more than $3 billion.
In addition to those steep costs, League officials raised concerns about how long the funding process takes and how an eroding tax base is making it disproportionately difficult for smaller cities and towns to pay for their critical infrastructure needs.
In 27 of New Mexico’s 33 counties, the state Water Trust Board has authorized 113 water infrastructure projects with a combined cost of $522 million, according to the League’s report. Those include $16 million in improvements to a Gallup water reclamation facility, $4 million for water meter replacements in Las Vegas and $10.8 million for a lake conveyance project in Raton.
The discussion came as water systems in virtually every corner of New Mexico are feeling strain. Last year, the state identified issues with nearly 140 drinking water systems. More recently, issues of contamination have cropped up in Curry County, where “forever chemicals” were found in drinking wells, and in Doña Ana County, where the New Mexico Environment sued the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority over alleged mismanagement and repeated failed arsenic tests.
“What we saw this year was over $500 million in notices of intent…we’re still $204 million short of what we need to fully fund the applications that came in,” New Mexico Municipal League Executive Director AJ Forte told lawmakers Tuesday. “They just don’t have the revenue in place to update these systems. It’s not in the millions, it’s in the tens of millions to get them updated.”
Forte said much-needed funds for water infrastructure projects stay in an irritating holding pattern after they’re approved. By law, the state Water Trust Board makes loans and grants for water projects, but the money can only be disbursed by the state Legislature during the legislative session. That can delay funding by as much as 180 days, Forte said, and can lead to a host of issues including inflation, supply chain constraints and missed construction windows. In July, the Municipal League said it wanted lawmakers to give the New Mexico Finance Authority the power to greenlight water-related funds for three years.
One state lawmaker pushed back on Tuesday. Sen. George K. Muñoz, D-Gallup, said that removing legislative oversight could cause more problems than it solves.
“When we give up our legislative authority, things can go awry very quickly,” Muñoz, who serves as chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said. If the funding decisions are less centralized, Muñoz said, the state runs the risk of disproportionately funding these sorts of projects in bigger cities with deeper pockets. “You’ll see a large municipality outbidding a smaller pueblo.”
Concerns over funding voiced on Tuesday stemmed from what the Municipal League report called “tax base erosion.” Municipal budgets largely depend on tax revenue to fund costly projects, but local governments often use tax deductions or exemptions to entice developers to build, meaning these locales must rely on a “narrow and volatile base,” the report said.
Some reductions to gross receipts tax revenue have come from state law. The report said that Senate Bill 425, a 2019 law aimed at GRT deductions for defense-related satellite contracts, has led to $1.75 million in reduced taxes; and House Bill 252, a 2024 law that provided GRT deductions for Medicaid home renovations, childcare and geothermal facilities, has led to $12 million in reduced taxes.
Three-quarters of New Mexico cities rely on gross receipts tax revenues of less than $10 million, according to the report. And 40% of cities rely on GRT revenues of less than $1 million, meaning that the cost of a water infrastructure project is likely to eclipse what is often a small town’s largest source of revenue.
“These things really add up. These are significant numbers,” Alison Nichols, New Mexico Municipal League’s deputy director, told lawmakers, adding that the idiom she and her colleagues use for these proposals is, “death by a thousand cuts.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AERATION-BASIN-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 17:57:02.129489

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s congressional delegation announced Tuesday that the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) will receive $25 million in federal funding to grow its hybrid electric bus fleet.
Funding comes from the Federal Highway Administration’s Low or No Emission Grant Program, created under the 2022 bipartisan infrastructure law. The program is meant to help transit agencies buy or lease low- or no-emission buses and other advanced vehicles, supporting cleaner, more energy-efficient service nationwide, according to the announcement from U.S. Sen. Jack Reed’s office.
“This federal funding will help shift RIPTA’s bus fleet to newer, more energy-efficient buses, resulting in reliable rides, cleaner air, and lower costs for taxpayers,” Reed, a member of the upper chamber’s Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
With the funding, RIPTA can purchase upward of 25 new buses, agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry confirmed in an email. A final cost will be set once vehicle specifications are finalized and formal bids come in, she added.
Of its network of 230 fixed-route buses, only eight of RIPTA’s buses are hybrids, while another 14 are all electric. All electric buses are used exclusively by the R-Line, the state’s only rapid bus line which connects Cranston, Providence and Pawtucket.
The other hybrid buses are randomly assigned to RIPTA’s other fixed routes, most of which have been operating on a more reduced schedule since the agency had to enact sweeping service cuts caused by a multimillion dollar deficit due to federal pandemic aid drying up.

Mike Braun on Tuesday made his most overt political threat to recalcitrant Republican state senators over early congressional redistricting, saying he’d look for ways to “compel” them to act — and vowing to support primary challengers.
Braun’s rebuke came shortly after a deep divide among Senate Republicans was exposed with a typically routine vote on adjourning Tuesday’s procedural Organization Day session until January.
Votes in the Senate and House set Jan. 5 as the date lawmakers will return to the Statehouse and start the new legislative session — not on Dec. 1, as previously planned, to take up President Donald Trump’s wish for Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The Senate’s adjournment resolution was approved by a 29-19 margin. All 10 Democratic senators supported the resolution, while Republican senators split 19-19 on whether to back Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray’s decision last week against meeting in December, on the grounds of too little support for a congressional redistricting to pass the chamber.
The Senate’s action sidesteps Braun’s call for a special legislative session that was to have started Nov. 3, with Braun responding Tuesday that “it’s time now for our state senators to commit to showing up for work.”
“Unfortunately, Sen. Rod Bray was forced to partner with DEMOCRATS to block an effort by the growing number of America First Senators who wanted to have a vote on passing fair maps. Now I am left with no choice other than to explore all options at my disposal to compel the State Senate to show up and vote,” Braun said in a statement. “I will support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers for Indiana’s senators who refuse to support fair maps.”
Braun’s office did not answer questions from the Indiana Capital Chronicle about what steps the governor could take to “compel” Senate action.
In a statement to the Capital Chronicle, Bray downplayed the dispute.
“Senate Republicans may have a difference of opinion on a policy matter with the governor, and that happens from time to time, but we are committed to pursuing policies that will make life better for Hoosiers, and we will continue to look for ways to collaborate with the governor,” Bray said.
Bray: redistricting “not the right way”
Redistricting supporters wanted Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine of the state’s congressional districts favoring Republicans. They’d be based on 2020 census data, like the current maps. 
Those were drawn by Republicans in 2021, and maintained a 7-2 GOP majority — with Democrat Frank Mrvan holding the 1st District in northwest Indiana and Democrat André Carson holding the 7th District, which covers much of Indianapolis.

Bray told reporters Tuesday that redrawn maps wouldn’t guarantee “an automatic nine” Republican Hoosier members of Congress.
Bray said he wants to see Republicans maintain the U.S. House majority but that he and other GOP senators didn’t favor redrawing the 2021 maps.
“I’m not sure that a number of members of our caucus, at least I’m included in that number, don’t feel like it’s the right way to move forward, simply because it’s not the right way to get that goal achieved,” Bray said.
House Speaker Todd Huston said Tuesday that “House Republicans have the necessary votes to address this issue and we stand ready to get the job done.”
Huston adjourned the House until Jan. 5, but told members to remain prepared for a possible return during the first two weeks of December.
“My hope is that with our great colleagues in the Senate, we’ll embrace this, and then we all return in early December for a special session to pass new maps,” Huston told reporters. “… This has been a fluid situation for a while now, and it’ll continue to be fluid, I’m sure.”
Despite Indiana being among Trump’s targets for congressional redistricting since August, Huston maintained that Republicans haven’t settled on a new map plan.
“We haven’t gotten that far,” he said. “Had some conversations, we haven’t gotten that far.”
Trump rebukes senators again
Trump has used social media in recent days to rebuke Bray and other Republican senators who don’t support redistricting.
Trump did so again Tuesday with a post that said Braun “must produce” on redistricting.
“I won Indiana in a landslide, the most votes ever gotten in the State – Such an HONOR! A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn’t care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem,” Trump’s post said.

One senator seemingly switched his position on redistricting. 
Sen. Jim Tomes, R-Wadesville, had been counted as a “no” for weeks but clarified on the Senate floor Tuesday that “when push comes to shove,” he would vote “yes” in support of Trump.
Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, came out in opposition on Tuesday.
“The message from my district has been clear — they do not support mid-cycle redistricting, and therefore I cannot support it,” Holdman said in a statement.
The current standing among the 40 Republican senators who have publicly stated a position on redistricting is 15 in favor and 10 against. Several other Senate Republicans declined to state their position, with some wanting to see a proposed map first.
Braun sees redistricting fight in ‘first inning’
Braun sat alongside Huston and Bray during an unrelated event a couple hours ahead of the afternoon floor sessions.
Neither of the legislative leaders nor the governor spoke to the few dozen people attending a pro-redistricting rally feet away, which drew redistricting advocates Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith and Secretary of State Diego Morales.
Braun suggested to reporters Tuesday morning that the House could advance a redistricting bill even without senators in the Statehouse.
“The House is already publicly out there for it, anxious for them to get a bill out there that they send to the Senate,” Braun said. 
Tuesday’s Senate vote also divided Republican leaders there. Bray and Holdman — who holds the No. 3 leadership post as majority caucus chair — voted to adjourn until January, while Senate Majority Floor Leader Chris Garten, the second-ranking leader, voted against the resolution.
Braun maintained that momentum was building in favor of Indiana going along with Trump’s redistricting push.
“When that decision was made by Senator Bray, that’s because it was so close,” Braun said. “With all the pressure, all the stuff that’s going to come from here forward, this is just in the first inning, so we’re going to see what happens.”

A raccoon’s long-toed footprint adorned the muddy lakeshore. A killdeer screeched overhead and a fluffy-tailed coyote loped through nearby grasslands. Yet the animal that wildlife biologist Wendy Hanophy sought on a hot October day remained elusive.
The northern leopard frogs she was searching for were likely bedded down in wetlands surrounding the Aurora Reservoir to protect their moist skin from the midday heat. The amphibian’s absence underscored the stakes: Scientists agree the indicator species, which is difficult to spot, count and monitor, is particularly at risk from habitat disturbances.
Hanophy and hundreds of Aurora residents are hoping the imperiled vertebrate will help them persuade state regulators to deny a request by Crestone Peak Resources Operating LLC to build one of Colorado’s largest oil and gas pads on a former bombing range less than a mile from the reservoir and their homes in the Denver suburbs.

“Frogs will disperse up to three miles as soon as they’ve bred and hatched,” said Hanophy, a retired Colorado Parks and Wildlife employee, as dry grass crunched under her hiking boots. “They have to eat, and they don’t stay in the reservoir for that. They are foraging all up and around these areas.”
Indeed, several weeks before Hanophy’s fruitless search, herpetologists hired by a residents’ group found three northern leopard frogs uphill from where she stood close to the proposed 35-acre oil and gas site. The discovery came after state officials listed “Oil & Gas Exploration & Extraction” as a threat to the species in a 2025 wildlife action plan. The document categorized the amphibian as requiring “conservation interventions most urgently.”
The dwindling numbers of leopard frogs also prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to participate in an ongoing case study to restore habitat for the amphibian in an area northwest of Denver. Early findings noted that the four-inch-long vertebrate is “identified as a species of greatest conservation need in many western states” and is “considered sensitive, threatened, or endangered.”

The proposed 32-well State Sunlight/Long pad is one of several oil and gas sites slated for what is now known as the Lowry Ranch. Situated about 25 miles southeast of downtown Denver, the picturesque property is surrounded by fast-growing suburbs. The State Land Board, which owns and manages the 26,000-acre ranch, echoed Fish and Wildlife’s conclusion that the frogs need undisturbed habitat in a “2050 Stewardship Framework.”
The planning document found the ranch’s Piedmont grasslands support “several species of conservation concern that require habitat components that are unique and rare.” The land board signed a lease with Crestone’s parent company, Civitas Resources, that allows it to drill on the property. State regulators are charged with approving the locations of the wells.
There is precedent for imperiled species like the northern leopard frog slowing down, changing the design, or even shutting down industrial projects altogether. The Braken Bat Cave meshweaver spider stopped construction on a San Antonio highway. In West Virginia, the Indiana bat stalled progress on a multimillion-dollar wind farm. The endangered snuffbox mussel halted work on a bridge over the Grand River in Ohio. And in California, the delta smelt prevented an effort by the first Trump administration to make “improvements” to the state’s water infrastructure.
Northern leopard frogs are known to frequent the area where the Sunlight/Long pad is proposed. Surveys conducted by consultants hired by Crestone found the amphibians near the site over the last decade, according to a summary the energy company filed with state regulators prior to a highly anticipated Nov. 19 hearing on the proposed pad.
The vertebrates were found in creek beds near the proposed project site in surveys conducted from 2012 to 2015 and again in 2018, according to the summary. After additional surveys in 2024 and this year, consultants concluded the amphibians may spend winter in nearby creek beds.
Researchers hired by a 2,400-member residents group known as Save the Aurora Reservoir, or STAR — who observed three frogs in the area this fall — said in a Sept. 22 report that repeated sightings “seems to indicate a stable population at this site.”
“This site is likely part of a larger, and not fully researched, metapopulation for northern leopard frogs which may connect this population to other breeding populations” nearby, wrote researchers with Adaptation LLC, the company retained by residents to conduct the survey.
Frog population declining
To protect this population, state wildlife officials suggested in a Sept. 30 letter to the state’s Energy & Carbon Management Commission that an alternative location for the massive oil and gas pad would better protect the frog because it would keep more of its habitat intact.
Even so, Colorado Parks and Wildlife biologist Brandon Marette acknowledged in the letter to commission director Julie Murphy that such an alternative is not feasible because it doesn’t comply with Arapahoe County rules that oil and gas operations be situated at least 3,000 feet from reservoirs.
Marette also wrote that “the western U.S. population of (northern leopard frogs) is declining” and that in the region where the pad is proposed these groups are “fragmented and limited and existing threats are likely to significantly increase in scope and/or severity within ten years.”
Because of this, he suggested mitigation measures designed to divert frogs away from an access road slated to handle scores of truck trips a day from the proposed oil and gas pad. The byway will sit just 500 feet from the reservoir, leading to concerns about frog “mortalities resulting from truck and vehicle traffic,” he added.
The biologist asked state regulators to require the energy firm to construct the pad and make improvements to the road between Dec. 1 and Feb. 28 when the frogs are hibernating. Colorado Parks and Wildlife also requested the company conduct “windshield surveys” to “document any (frog) mortalities on the road” at least once a week between March and November when the amphibians are active. Crestone’s consultants must report any deceased frogs to Parks and Wildlife.
The frog’s prominent role in the Nov. 19 hearing on the Sunlight/Long pad is underscored in a recommendation by Murphy, the Energy & Carbon Management Commission director, to the five-member commission that it approve the oil and gas project. The amphibian is referenced 90 times in her 265-page report.
Murphy wrote that Crestone agreed to time construction on the pad to coincide with the frog’s hibernation period, to survey for frogs prior to disturbing the land and to build silt fences that guide amphibians to culverts that cross under the road.
Crestone acknowledged concern about the frogs in a prehearing statement filed with state regulators in advance of the Nov. 19 hearing. The company gave a nod to the Adaptation report in the prehearing statement, noting wildlife officials incorporated “aspects” of its findings into mitigation measures that the company agreed to.
“The (Parks and Wildlife) consultation letter speaks for itself on the issue of Crestone’s extensive protection of wildlife resources and should be relied upon by the commission,” wrote Jamie Jost, an attorney representing Crestone before the commission.
Habitat disturbance is already underway on other parts of the Lowry Ranch. State energy regulators earlier this year approved several multiwell pads included in a 50-square-mile comprehensive area plan drilling plan. The development could include up to 166 wells at eight locations to be constructed through 2030.
Resident group’s influence
Residents in neighborhoods ringing the ranch’s southern edge organized STAR to protest drilling near their communities when Crestone initially submitted the plan to state regulators in 2022.
The group’s concerns about pollution, earthquakes, noise and traffic drew nationwide scrutiny to a 2019 mission change that requires Colorado’s energy agency to prioritize health, safety and the environment over fossil fuel company profits. State officials promulgated 426 pages of rules — during 17 rulemaking periods — to implement this change.
STAR’s activism changed the way the five-member energy commission considers neighborhood concerns. Its members filed thousands of comments opposing the Sunlight/Long pad.
The outcry prompted the commission to hold a rare public hearing in the community in September. STAR, represented by an attorney, also became the first residents’ organization to appear in front of the commission at a hearing in 2024 and will again testify on Nov. 19.
The nonprofit continues to test the boundaries of the state’s new oil and gas rules in its prehearing statements by challenging how Crestone complied with requirements that companies devise wildlife protection plans for new and amended locations.
“Wildlife resources are to be protected to the same extent as people and the environment,” wrote STAR’s attorney, Mike Foote. “Neither Crestone’s wildlife mitigation plan, nor (Parks and Wildlife’s) consultation report gave any serious consideration to placing Sunlight Long in a location that could avoid adverse impacts to the (frogs) in the first place.”
Even with mitigation measures agreed to by Crestone and state wildlife and oil and gas officials in advance of the hearing, Hanophy, the retired biologist, remains concerned that pollution, noise and vibrations that she says could disrupt breeding; land disturbance; and traffic will prove fatal for the amphibians.
“If they can’t get from point A to point B, that’s one population that could crash,” said the STAR wildlife adviser as she stood on a bike path that encircles the Aurora Reservoir.
“Extinction usually isn’t immediate — it happens slowly, and then quickly, and you get to a point where a population can’t take care of itself.”

State Ports Authority)MOUNT PLEASANT — Micah Mallace is making good on his promise to quickly focus on projects that will boost cargo at the Port of Charleston.
The S.C. State Ports Authority’s board of directors on Tuesday approved a pair of grants totaling $1.5 million to help two businesses that will rely on Inland Port Greer for their product distribution. The grants will help pay for public infrastructure such as roads.
The grants are in line with an initiative Mallace announced at his first State of the Port speech late last month in which “capital investments will be tied exclusively to revenue-generating opportunities.”
SC Ports shifting focus to growth with immediate benefits, new CEO says

Mallace, who took over as the authority’s president and CEO on Oct. 13, called the need for immediate cargo growth one of the maritime agency’s biggest challenges.
“SC Ports works collaboratively with our partners at the S.C. Department of Commerce and our state leaders to attract businesses that support growth and have a meaningful economic impact on our state,” Malice said in a written statement. “These incentive grants are a part of SC Ports’ commitment to ensuring that port-dependent businesses have the necessary infrastructure in place to move their goods from the Port of Charleston and beyond.”
The first grant, totaling $1 million, will help retailer Costco develop a 541,000-square-foot distribution center in Rock Hill. The facility, expected to be online by mid-2027, would distribute imported and other products to roughly 20 Costco stores in the Carolinas and Georgia.
The $240.3 million distribution center, which had been going by code name Project Sample, is expected to employ 165 people with an average wage of $27 per hour. In addition to the port’s grant, Costco is seeking about $30 million in state and local tax breaks for the project.
The second grant, totaling $500,000, will help solar panel manufacturer First Solar expand its Gaffney manufacturing site by 1.3 million square feet and add a 560,000-square-foot distribution center.
First Solar, a longtime customer of Inland Port Greer, expects its $330 million investment will create more than 600 jobs by mid-2026 with wages starting at $21.60 an hour.
The expansion, previously known as Project Oranges, will bring the final production process for First Solar’s modules to the U.S. from overseas. First Solar is also seeking state and local tax incentives for the project, located at the Cherokee Commerce Center off Interstate 85.
The two projects will add an unspecified number of cargo boxes to Greer’s inland port, which has handled nearly 69,000 containers since the current fiscal year started on July 1. That’s about 2.2% more than the same period last year.
All told, the number of cargo containers of all sizes has increased by about 1.1% at the Port of Charleston this fiscal year. However, October totals trailed the same period a year ago by roughly 1%.
Imports spur stellar August for SC Ports, but tariff troubles await

“Recent reports continue to show weakness across the market,” said Byron Miller, the authority’s chief commercial officer. “Typically, October is one of the strongest months of the year – it’s a peak month toward the holidays.”
Miller noted that some U.S. ports are seeing double-digit declines in imports, adding the lower October figures are probably due to retailers importing cargo early to get ahead of tariffs.
“We saw a lot of early shipping to avoid some of the trade policy impacts,” he said.
The National Retail Federation is forecasting lower-than-normal imports for the rest of this year, with most holiday merchandise already in stores or warehouses.
“We’ve spent most of the year worried about the impact of tariffs on both inflation and the supply chain, but the holiday season is here, and mitigation efforts appear to have paid off,” Jonathan Gold, the federation’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy, said in a written statement.
“Store shelves are well-stocked and the effect on prices has been minimized,” Gold said, “largely thanks to retailers taking steps like frontloading imports during times of low or delayed tariff increases or absorbing the costs themselves.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/inland-port-greer.jpg,,,2025-11-18 17:57:02.129489

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A Florida bill replacing all allusions to “child pornography” in state statute with “child sexual abuse material” unanimously passed its first committee test on Tuesday.
Filed by Rep. Jessica Baker, HB 245 argues that applying the legal term “pornography” to images of sexually battered children is inappropriate, because children cannot consent to sexual activity.
“The current term is misleading. It implies a lawful form of pornography when, in fact, any sexualized depiction of a minor is a crime, and we must call it what it truly is,” Baker told the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee, speaking during one of the legislature’s six committee weeks.

“Using accurate terminology reinforces that this material is a serious crime against a child.”
Baker’s bill, which has an identical companion in the Senate, would align Florida with Pennsylvania and Louisiana, which have already adopted similar language. Delaware and Texas will take up these measures during their 2026 legislative sessions.
The bill takes direction from the Justice Department, which in 2023 published a memo noting that although the term “child pornography” still appears in federal law, officials prefer to use “child sexual abuse material” because it better reflects the crime, the Phoenix previously reported.
This is only the latest Florida legislation addressing child sexual abuse. During the 2025 session, Florida Republicans added human trafficking of minors as a crime eligible for the death penalty, building off a 2023, first-in-the-nation law expanding the death penalty to child rapists. In 2024, the Legislature created punishments for “grooming” children into sexual abuse.

According to the report, soil moisture conditions were slightly dry across the state. On average, 62% of topsoil and 63% of subsoil across the state had adequate moisture. Twenty-seven percent of both top and subsoils averages across the state were short in terms of moisture. 
Eastern parts of the state had the driest soils, with between 39% and 57% of topsoil and subsoil in the regions listed as short. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, precipitation across Iowa was low for the reporting period, with most stations reporting no precipitation. The normal statewide average for the period is four-tenths of an inch, but Glisan said the statewide average was below a measurable amount. 
Temperatures at the beginning of the week were 18 degrees Fahrenheit below the climatological normal, but on Friday, average temperatures across the state were 15 to 30 degrees above normal. 
The statewide average temperature for the week was about 42 degrees, which is nearly 4 degrees above normal.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the dry weather and warm temperatures allowed farmers to make a “final push” on harvest and move on to other field work. According to the crop report, farmers had 6.4 days suitable for field work during the period.
“With dry conditions and drought creeping back in, many will welcome the forecasted moisture that could help recharge our soils as we head toward Thanksgiving,” Naig said in a statement.

Bobby Scott of Virginia and Mark DeSaulnier of California — the respective ranking members of the House Committee on Education and Workforce and its Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions — offered three recommendations to Daniel Aronowitz. He is the assistant secretary of the DOL’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, or EBSA. “Improper claim denials impose substantial health and financial hardships on individuals, leading to delays in necessary treatments, worsened health outcomes, and high out-of-pocket costs,” Scott and DeSaulnier wrote.“In far too many tragic cases, denials lead to the unnecessary deaths of people who have earned benefits through their plan, but are nonetheless denied the care that could have saved their lives,” they added. Improvements called for in collecting data on denialsAs head of EBSA, Aronowitz is responsible for administering, regulating and enforcing Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, which is intended to protect participants’ and their beneficiaries’ interests when it comes to benefit plans under their employers. DOL estimated roughly 136 million participants and beneficiaries were covered by approximately 2.6 million ERISA-covered group health plans in 2022.  As part of their recommendations, Scott and DeSaulnier called on Aronowitz to “implement long-delayed transparency requirements to collect data on health claim denials by insurance companies and group health plans.”The two suggested building upon Form 5500, ERISA’s annual reporting requirement, to “improve data collection from group health plans.” Staffing at agency, Trump budget cuts citedScott and DeSaulnier also urged Aronowitz to “commit to fully enforcing the law and to ensuring that EBSA is adequately staffed to fulfill its mission,” pointing to a decline in more than a fifth of the agency’s staff under President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request for DOL also called for $181 million in funding for EBSA, a $10 million proposed cut from the prior fiscal year. The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its annual bill to fund DOL, including EBSA, back in July and maintained funding for the program in fiscal 2026 at $191 million. The corresponding panel in the House also approved its bill to fund DOL in September, aligning with the administration’s request of cutting funding for EBSA by $10 million in fiscal 2026. The Democrats also recommended Aronowitz take steps to “improve consumers’ ability to appeal wrongfully denied health benefits.” They encouraged the assistant secretary to consult the Advisory Council on Employee Welfare and Pension Benefit Plans and to “reverse” DOL’s current posture regarding the council. Scott and DeSaulnier noted that DOL took several steps to “undermine” the council, including “delaying public release of its report, purging documents such as testimonies from consumer advocates from the Department’s website, and, to date, failing to convene the Council for any of the four statutorily-mandated meetings.” The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",,,,2025-11-18 17:57:02.129489

Andy Levin on the night he lost his primary, Aug. 2, 2022 | Andrew RothThe progressive candidate on the Democratic Party side of the U.S. Senate race gained a powerful ally in former Congressman Andy Levin, a stalwart labor union supporter.
Levin’s endorsement of Abdul El-Sayed, who is seeking the Democratic nomination in the contest to replace retiring U.S. Sen Gary Peters of Bloomfield, came on Tuesday after the pair jointly authored an op-ed in The Detroit News published on Monday. The opinion piece focused on the party’s need to rally around workers to be successful in the 2026 election.
The former congressman represented Michigan’s 9th district in the U.S. House of Representatives, covering Oakland and Macomb counties, between 2019 and 2023. His career in Congress ended when Haley Stevens defeated him in the Democratic primary in 2022 following redistricting. 
Stevens, of Birmingham, is one of three Democrats also seeking the nomination, along with state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak.
Levin, in a statement circulated by El-Sayed’s campaign, said, “the startling moment we’re living through proves we need one thing above all in our leaders in Washington — moral courage and clarity.”
“Know who you are. Know what you stand for. Know who you’re fighting for. And actually fight for them, brilliantly, creatively, relentlessly,” Levin said. “That’s Abdul.”
El-Sayed thanked Levin for his support, which now adds a former member of Congress to the support he’s gained from incumbent U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, as well as U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna of California and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont).
“Andy Levin has spent his career fighting for the dignity and power of workers, and I am honored to have his endorsement,” El-Sayed said. “Andy and I know that Democrats can only win by fighting for Michiganders most basic rights: the right to join a union, to get healthcare without breaking the bank, to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and to build a dignified life. That’s what this campaign is about and that’s why I’m so proud to have Andy by my side.”

The move follows an Aug. 26 letter from the Administration for Children and Families —which is under the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services— instructing North Carolina to remove all references to what the agency calls “gender ideology” from materials used in the Personal Responsibility Education Program, or PREP. The program funds evidence-based sex education for adolescents.
North Carolina was one of 46 states and territories to receive the directive, which is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to eliminate what it terms “gender ideology” from federally funded educational and health programs.
The agency did not define the term, but prohibited content includes explanations of gender identity, guidance on pronoun use, and descriptions of transgender, nonbinary, or gender-expansive identities.
The federal letter argued that material addressing gender identity or support for LGBTQ youth is outside the scope of the law authorizing the program, even though such content had previously been approved.
State officials said they worked with curriculum developers to revise three programs: Family Life and Sexual Health; Rights, Respect, Responsibilities; and the Teen Outreach Program. In an Oct. 27 letter to federal officials, Kelly Kimple, director of the state Division of Public Health, said the state removed whole lessons from FLASH, rewrote portions of the 3Rs curriculum and made similar changes to the Teen Outreach Program.
The state is now briefing the five organizations that operate PREP programs in 10 counties, both in traditional public schools and charter schools, on the coming changes
North Carolina received $1.56 million in PREP funding for fiscal year 2025. Another $3.3 million for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 could have been at risk if the state had failed to comply.
The Trump administration framed the move as ensuring PREP reflects congressional intent and said it would hold states accountable.

(Courtesy of the Rhode Island Office of the General Treasurer)An auction of forgotten watches, rings, old coins, and other treasurers held earlier this month by the Rhode Island Office of the General Treasurer netted $1.1 million, money that will be kept in state coffers waiting for rightful owners of those items to claim it.
The Nov. 8 sale at the Department of Administration building in Providence — the first unclaimed property auction held by the state in over a decade — drew hundreds of people interested in approximately 5,000 items being offered.
Most items came from bank safe deposit boxes that went on to be stored in the lost-and-found vault in the basement of the General Treasurer’s Warwick office. 
The proceeds exceeded the state’s expectations: An appraisal estimated the value of all the items at $752,000, Grace Voll, a spokesperson for General Treasurer James Diossa, said in an email Tuesday
And it’s all thanks to the skyrocketing price of precious metals such as gold, which West Warwick auctioneer Jack Martone said made up the bulk items that were sold.
“When I started appraisals in July, gold was $3,100 an ounce, by auction it was $4,200,” Martone said in an interview.
The state has rules for how long a safe deposit box can be left unattended before it can be deemed dormant and its contents transferred to the general treasurer’s office.
Items sold at the auction were divided into 419 lots, ranging from historic banknotes, silverware, jewelry and even baseballs signed by New York Yankees legends Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle. That pair of baseballs fetched around $2,300, according to Diossa’s office.
The highest-selling item was an 18-karat solid gold paperweight, which Diossa’s office said sold for $20,000.
Diossa’s office hired Martone, 77, to handle the auction duties, along with weighing and testing the items that were sold, after issuing two requests for proposals. Martone submitted responses to both of the bid solicitations. 
It’s the third time Martone has overseen a live unclaimed property auction for the state, which tends to happen once a decade. The November sale has easily cleared as the biggest money maker, he said.
The most recent auction held in 2014 netted roughly $384,000, Martone recalled. 
Auction earnings will go to the state’s general fund, though any rightful owner or their family can reclaim the sale proceeds if they come forward. For those looking to collect auction money, anyone can search their name on the state database and then file a claim for free at: findrimoney.com. 
In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, Diossa’s office reported returning over $17 million in unclaimed funds.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 21:49:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT wake surfers seek statewide regulation in effort to limit local bans,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/ct-wake-surfing-regulation/,A recent ban on wake surfing in a northwestern Connecticut lake has prompted advocates of the sport to ask the state to create uniform rules.,"Seeking to prevent a wave of local prohibitions on wake surfing, advocates of the fast-growing sport are asking state officials in Connecticut to step in with a common set of rules for lake goers.
That effort kicked off Tuesday in response to a recently enacted ban on wake surfing in northwestern Connecticut’s Lake Waramaug. A group opposed to the ban, Lake Waramaug Friends for Common-Sense Regulation, filed a petition asking the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to rescind its support for the ban and instead establish a common set of regulations governing wake surfing.
“The appropriate thing to do, in our opinion, is to have statewide rules that address wake surfing throughout the state, because right now you have several bodies of water with several different methods of regulating wake surfing,” said Lee Hoffman, an attorney who is representing the group in its appeal to DEEP.
“That’s a little puzzling to recreational users,” Hoffman added. “And the other thing is, there’s been no demonstration by anyone that wake surfing when done properly, causes either environmental harm or a safety risk.”
A spokesperson for DEEP did not immediately offer comment on the letter Tuesday.
Wake surfing enthusiasts say they want to avoid a patchwork situation, where different rules apply across the state’s hundreds of lakes and ponds.
“I think everybody’s open to regulation,” said Tom Godward, a wake surfer who owns a home on Lake Waramaug. “There’s a lot of very, very thoughtful ways to do it, but a lot of it is really just recognizing that these resources are shared-use, and just devising a set of regulations and rules that will accommodate as best you can everybody’s wishes and desires on the lake.”
Wake surfing is similar to other towed water sports except that the rider drops the rope once they are standing in order to “surf” the the artificial wave created by the boat’s wake. Surfers often use boats that are modified with special weights or wake shapers to produce waves up to 3 or 4 ft. high.
It is the presence of a larger wake, however, that has also attracted controversy.
Critics say that so-called “wake boats” churn up sediment, reducing water quality and disturbing underwater habitats while producing large waves that can erode the shoreline and create hazards for other boaters. The use of ballast tanks to weigh down the boats can also contribute to the spread of invasive species, such as hydrilla.
“People are outraged about the big waves,” said Kelly Williams, a co-chair of Protect Lake Waramaug, a group of local residents that pushed for the ban on wake surfing.
Last year, Williams’ group commissioned a study which reported that the propeller downwash created by wake boats had caused a temporary increase in phosphorus levels on the lake. (The report also cautioned that its findings were preliminary, and warranted further study.)
“Even before we understood how significant the environmental damage could eventually be to the lake… the safety and nuisance concerns about the big waves were already compelling the selectmen to say, ‘No,'” Williams added. 
Wake surfers and their supporters argue that those concerns have been overblown, and that the report commissioned by Protect Lake Waramaug was flawed in its methodology. As for safety, they said records of boating accidents show that wake surfing is no more dangerous than other watersports such as wake boarding or jet skiing.

The wake surfing ban on Lake Waramaug was overwhelmingly approved by voters in the three towns surrounding the lake in August. It followed a similar ban on Bashan Lake that was approved by officials in East Haddam the same month.
Voters in Morris, meanwhile, voted down a proposed ordinance that would have restricted wake surfing and wake boarding within 500 ft. of the shore on Bantam Lake.
Hoffman, the lawyer for Lake Waramaug Friends for Common-Sense Regulation, suggested that the state could restrict wake surfing within a certain distance from shore, likely around 200 ft, to avoid causing conflicts with surrounding homeowners.
Similar restrictions have been put in place by states such as Pennsylvania and Tennessee, the later of which also restricts wake surfing in lakes under 50 acres. In Vermont, use of wake boats is limited to certain “wakesport zones.“
Those who supported the ban on Lake Waramaug, however, said calls for a more uniform set of rules around wake surfing ignored the unique features of each lake and pond. For example, Williams said that wake surfing could be better suited for nearby Candlewood Lake, which is several times as large and deeper, on average, than Lake Waramaug.
“What doesn’t make sense about a statewide ordinance is every every body of water is different,” said Washington First Selectman James Brinton. “In other words, some are deeper, some are larger acreage. It couldn’t be that way. It couldn’t be a one size fits all.”
Still, surfers such as Sherman Baldwin, said they felt unfairly maligned by a vocal group of residents on the lake.
“We always are respectful and give people a wide berth if we see people kayaking or paddle boarding,” said Baldwin, who was encouraged by his children to take up wake surfing after purchasing a home on Lake Waramaug four years ago.

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-Essex) resigned her seat in the House of Representatives Tuesday months ahead of her inauguration as New Jersey’s 57th governor.
Her resignation will become effective at 11:59 p.m. Thursday.
“It has been an honor to serve the residents of the 11th Congressional District since 2019. I’ve been proud to fight for our communities, getting shovels in the ground for the Gateway Tunnel project, slashing through red tape on critical flood mitigation projects, protecting Picatinny Arsenal’s Mission, and funding community projects that support our students, infrastructure, and public safety,” she said in a resignation letter to Gov. Phil Murphy.
Sherrill leaves Congress partway into a fourth term in the lower chamber. She entered politics in 2018, when she and a group of Democrats secured all but one of the state’s House seats in wave elections broadly seen as a repudiation of President Donald Trump’s first term.
The former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot had announced her intention to resign from Congress before she is inaugurated as governor on Jan. 20. She defeated former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R-Somerset) by a little more than 14 points to win a term as the state’s chief executive.
In the current Congress, she served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.
“Public service is a public trust. I look forward to continuing to serve the residents of the 11th District and all New Jerseyans as governor next year,” Sherrill said in her letter to Murphy.
Gov. Phil Murphy is expected to order a special election to fill the remainder of Sherrill’s unexpired term. Already, 10 Democrats have announced their intent to seek the nomination.
That group includes former Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-Hunterdon), Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlet, Morris Township Mayor Jeff Grayzel, and former Obama White House staffer Cammie Croft, among others.
Sherrill’s House seat is expected to remain empty for months. Though state law and the U.S. Constitution permit New Jersey governors to temporarily fill Senate vacancies by appointment, the Constitution requires empty house seats be filled by election.
New Jersey’s laws for filling House vacancies run on long time horizons. The state must hold a special House primary between 70 and 76 days after a governor issues a writ of election calling for a special race to fill a vacancy. Special general elections follow 64 to 70 days after the primary.
Murphy is expected to issue a writ calling for a special election shortly after Sherrill’s resignation, though the law does not set any timeline for when such a writ must be issued. Indeed, the law does not demand the governor call a special election at all.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sherrill_wins3-1024x710.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

Lauren Boebert speaks to supporters during an election night watch party on Nov. 5, 2024 in Windsor, Colorado. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert played a key role in forcing a U.S. House vote Tuesday on a measure that would compel the release of Department of Justice files related to its investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
The Republican-controlled Senate will also need to approve the measure, and President Donald Trump will need to sign it. Boebert, a Windsor Republican, was one of only four House Republicans who signed a discharge petition to force the House vote. 
Speaker Mike Johnson held up a bipartisan effort to vote on the legislation amid opposition from Trump, keeping the House in recess throughout the duration of the federal government shutdown that ended last week. But Trump on Sunday abruptly changed his position and encouraged House Republicans in the majority to vote to release the Epstein files.

The House voted 427-1 to release the files, with every member of Colorado’s House delegation voting in favor of the measure. 
US House overwhelmingly votes to force release of Epstein files

Last week, Boebert was the sole member of Congress in a Situation Room meeting with White House officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel. The meeting was part of an administration effort to get Boebert to remove her name from the discharge petition, according to reports, though Boebert told CNN that Trump did not pressure her to take her name off. She did not speak with Trump while she was at the White House, and she spoke with Bondi about gun laws in addition to the Epstein files, she said. 
“The president has not forced me to do anything. The president has not put pressure on me. I was not asked by the president to remove my name,” Boebert said, according to CNN. “Every conversation that I had was welcomed and very civil, and, you know, it’s OK for people to have discussions about things that are going on with our nation.”
In a post on X after the meeting, Boebert thanked White House officials for meeting with her and said, “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.” 
The White House has also described the meeting as being focused on transparency. 
U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, co-sponsored the petition with U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Californian Democrat. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina are the other two Republicans who signed on. 
Trump has personally attacked both Massie and Greene for pushing to release the Epstein files, but has not commented on Boebert’s involvement. Boebert is a staunch Trump loyalist, and the Epstein case represents the the most significant break from Trump by his supporters. 
At a press conference after the vote, Greene said the Trump administration’s refusal to release what are collectively referred to as the Epstein files “has ripped MAGA apart.”
Boebert’s team did not respond to a Newsline request for comment.

The village of Woodstock is cracking down on homeowners who are refusing to keep shutters on their homes. Officials say the loss of shutters would hurt the village’s historic character.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 17, 2025.
WOODSTOCK VILLAGE — All five members of the Woodstock Village Design Advisory Committee resigned in protest earlier this month after they said the committee’s role has been “marginalized” by recent steps taken by town leaders.
For years, committee members had been working “with the understanding that any project in the design review district that affected the exterior would come before us,” former Chairman Phil Neuberg said in a phone interview earlier this month.
That changed this fall, when town leaders announced that applicants were no longer required to appear before the advisory committee.
Woodstock Municipal Manager Eric Duffy said the town learned from the Two Rivers Ottauquechee Regional Commission and town legal counsel that Woodstock was “breaking State law by compelling applicants to go in front of advisory boards,” Duffy wrote in an email.
Neuberg disputed the town’s interpretation of 24 V.S.A. § 4433, which states that the advisory commission and committees “may advise appropriate municipal panels, applicants, and interested parties.”
In their resignation letter, members wrote that “the Town has effectively stripped this (committee) of any meaningful role” by removing the requirement that applicants had to appear before it.
The committee’s role for decades has been to offer advice to applicants proposing changes to properties in Woodstock Village’s design review district, Duffy said. Woodstock Village’s historic district has been on the National Register of Historic Places for more than 50 years.
Property owners were required to appear before the committee to discuss changes they wanted to make to the exterior of their properties, from additions to rebuilding a stone wall.
Committee members would vote and pass along their recommendation to the Village Development Review Board, which is legally tasked with approving projects.
The Woodstock Village Board of Trustees has not replaced the committee members who resigned.
“Instead of rushing to fill the vacancies in the committee, we are going to have conversations with residents, businesses, the Planning Commission and the former VDAC members on their ideas for how to move forward,” Seton McIlroy, chair of the Village Trustees, wrote in an email.
Given that the Planning Commission “is in the process of updating Village zoning bylaws, this is the perfect time for Woodstock to discuss how we want our Village to look on the future,” McIlroy wrote.
Town says design review still part of process
In spite of no longer requiring applicants to go before the committee, members are still welcome to offer recommendations on projects presented to the Development Review Board, Duffy said. “There is a misconception that this means that design review no longer exists,” Duffy wrote.
Proposed developments in the design review district are “beholden to the standards set forth in the zoning bylaws, and the Development Review Board has always been responsible for reviewing them for compliance,” he wrote.
To some extent, the issue came to a head during recent discussions about the Woodstock Resort Corp.’s proposal to demolish two historic homes it owns in Woodstock Village. The Woodstock Resort Corp. voluntarily presented its plans before the Village Design Advisory Committee this fall and its members voted against the demolition.
In spite of the advisory committee’s position, the Village Development Review Board approved the demolition in October. The project now must go through the state’s Act 250 review process. “Until the demolitions, it wasn’t clear to us that our work was optional,” Neuberg said.
Several other Vermont communities, including Manchester, Stowe and Winooski, have committees similar to the one in Woodstock Village. Those committees also provide opinions to development review boards about potential projects. 
Often, they are made up of people with backgrounds in architecture, design or other related fields, State Historic Preservation Officer Laura V. Trieschmann said.
“Those commissions and boards do not have as much expertise as they need so they create advisory committees to assist them,” Trieschmann said in a phone interview. “They don’t have to take their advice.”
In Woodstock, Neuberg is an architect, while other members included a landscape architect and interior designer. For now, that type of expertise will be missing from the town’s review process.
In their resignation letter, the advisory committee members noted Woodstock’s Development Review Board is responsible “for interpreting design standards, despite the fact that its members are not required to have specialized expertise in historic preservation, architecture, or design.”
“The result is a process that places one of Vermont’s most architecturally significant villages at risk of incremental erosion of its historic character.”
Neuberg encouraged town and village leadership to continue to take historic preservation seriously. He noted that downtown’s appearance is “critical in a village like Woodstock that depends upon the tourist economy because it appears like the perfect historical village.”
“There has been a lot of effort to maintain that, and hopefully there will continue to be,” he said.
Neuberg also chairs the Village Historic Preservation Commission, which is focused on applying for grant funding to improve the historic district. That commission does not give formal recommendations to the Development Review Board.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-18 21:31:19+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Health care workplace violence bill finding traction,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/health-care-workplace-violence-bill-finding-traction/,"According to a bill summary, someone in a Massachusetts health care facility is assaulted, threatened or verbally abused every 38 minutes.","SIGNALING A POTENTIAL breakthrough on a bill that has bottomed out on Beacon Hill for over a decade, the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday advanced legislation addressing the growing problem of violence in health care workplaces, setting up a Wednesday floor vote.
The bill (H 4767) represents the collaborative work of the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association, Mass. Nurses Association and the state division of 1199SEIU. It would require health care employers to adopt comprehensive violence-prevention systems and create new criminal and privacy protections for workers.
It cleared the Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 31-0, a margin that signals the bill is likely on track to advance to the Senate. 
According to a bill summary, someone in a Massachusetts health care facility is assaulted, threatened or verbally abused every 38 minutes.
Under the bill, all health care employers must conduct annual, facility-specific risk assessments in collaboration with employees and labor representatives. They must also implement written violence-prevention plans that include mitigation strategies, employee training, incident debriefings and crisis-response programs. 
For the first time, employers would be required to report all incidents of workplace violence annually to the Department of Public Health and to regional district attorneys, with the data published publicly by occupation and type of incident. Noncompliant employers could face civil penalties of up to $2,000 per violation, and workers would be shielded from retaliation.
The bill also creates new criminal penalties for assaulting health care workers. Assault causing bodily injury could carry up to five years in prison, while assault causing serious bodily injury could carry up to ten years. 
The bill is on the move at a time when the Legislature also appears to finalizing legislation meant to enhance workplace protections for public transit workers (S 2697). That bill extends assault and battery protections against public workers to also include workers at the MBTA, commuter rail and regional public transit authorities, with penalties of between 90 days and 2.5 years in a house of correction of a $500 to $5,000 fine.
The coalition behind the health care legislation testified in April that intentional assault and battery is treated as a misdemeanor, a misalignment they said fails to reflect the severity or frequency of the violence. 
“What happens every 36 minutes in a Massachusetts hospital?” said MHA President and CEO Steve Walsh during the bill’s hearing. “It isn’t a lifesaving procedure. It isn’t the beginning of a new career. It isn’t a lifesaving technology or therapy. It’s the assault of one of our workers every 36 minutes.”
A component of the House Ways and Means version is a new paid leave guarantee for health care workers directly employed by a facility who suffer bodily injury on the job due to workplace violence. They would be entitled to paid leave without being required to use sick, vacation, or personal time — a provision advocates said is critical to ensuring workers can recover or handle court proceedings without financial penalty. 
This is an expansion from the bill that went to Ways and Means, which allowed health care employees to take seven days leave in any 12-month period following a violent incident.
The bill also includes privacy protections, allowing victims who are hospital employees or union members to list their facility or union address on court documents instead of their home address. 
Additional provisions mandate a statewide report from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security on alternatives to criminal justice involvement for high-acuity behavioral health patients, along with recommendations for non-arrest pathways that preserve confidentiality.
Lawmakers signaled in April that they were aware of the need to balance worker protection with concerns about criminalizing patients in crisis. 
Sen. John Cronin noted that the bill requires that a perpetrator “knowingly and intentionally” commit assault to face the higher penalty charges, calling it “really clear, and [demonstrating] that appropriate balance.” 
Walsh told the committee the coalition worked to ensure the bill protected workers without punishing individuals unable to form intent.
The sense of urgency around health care workplace violence has grown in recent years. A May Beacon Research poll of 505 registered nurses found that nearly seven in 10 described workplace violence and abuse as a serious problem — five points higher than last year and 27 points above March 2021.
For many advocates, Wednesday’s expected vote represents the closest the Legislature has come to enacting protections they have sought for years. Bills aimed at cracking down on escalating assaults on health care workers have languished in the Legislature for 16 years. 
During testimony in April, Dr. Joseph Kopp, an emergency physician at Faulkner and Brigham and Women’s hospitals, urged lawmakers not only to advance the bill but to push leadership to bring it to the floor. 
“Please, I’m asking for you to be our champions,” he said.
With the bill now slated for debate, lawmakers are on the verge of deciding whether the rare alignment among labor, nurses and hospital executives is enough to carry the measure across the finish line in the House.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Nursing_Health-Care_Nurse-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

The New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness on Nov. 17, 2025 released the latest results of its “point in time” count detailing demographic and other information about the state’s unhoused population. (Patrick Lohmann /Source NM)A coalition of advocates for New Mexico’s growing unhoused population on Monday released the results of its “point in time” count, an annual survey of hundreds of unhoused people across the state, both sheltered and unsheltered.
The New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness enlists volunteers to fan out across the state to count the number of people living on New Mexico streets. They also count the number of people staying in shelters on a given night, and draw from other sources in hopes of detecting demographic trends and other factors contributing to homelessness.
The coalition then compiles results into a report that differentiates between homelessness in Albuquerque and the “balance of state,” which is everywhere outside of the state’s biggest city. 
According to the coalition’s findings, homelessness in Albuquerque continued its steady increase over the last several years, with 2,960 people counted earlier this year. That’s an 8% increase over the 2,740 people counted in 2024. 
Elsewhere, however, the number of people counted dropped. In 2024, volunteers counted 1,909 unhoused people; this year, they counted 1,723, a nearly 10% decline. This year, for a survey of just unsheltered people, volunteers conducted surveys with 779 people on the streets, versus 1,011 last year.
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

In its report, the coalition attributes the drop to fewer volunteers to conduct the count versus fewer unhoused people. The drop outside of Albuquerque “likely reflects reduced geographic coverage and logistical challenges rather than a true decline in homelessness,” report authors wrote.
Volunteers conducted surveys with 714 people in 19 counties outside of Albuquerque, about two-thirds of them in Southern and rural Southeastern New Mexico. The largest number of surveys outside of Albuquerque came from  Doña Ana County, where 204 people completed surveys, followed by 78 in Otero County and 76 in Lea County.
One major difference between residents outside Albuquerque lay in the barriers they identified to finding homes, with deposit and application fees cited as the most common impediments. While Albuquerque’s unhoused people also cited deposit and application fees, that barrier was only fourth on their list, behind missing documents; lack of rental subsidy vouchers; and rental prices.
Regarding application fees, lawmakers in January passed and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed Senate Bill 267, which requires landlords to be more transparent about application fees, and caps “screening fees,” which landlords often charge to pay for credit reports, at $50. The law also prohibits landlords from charging application fees for unavailable units.
That law went into effect in June, about six months after volunteers conducted the “point in time” count. The count in Albuquerque and elsewhere occurred in late January, after President Donald Trump took office for a second term and fears about cuts to services like Medicaid and food assistance were widespread, volunteers told Source during the Jan. 28 survey in Albuquerque.
Also looming over the Albuquerque count was the specter of encampment sweeps that could make it harder to find and count people, volunteers said. In Albuquerque, the police department agreed not to conduct encampment sweeps to maximize chances for an accurate count, but the report’s authors noted that they were unaware of any such agreement in cities or other rural areas surveyed in the rest of the state.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9290-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Rep. Julie Fedorchak was among those who voted Tuesday to release unclassified Department of Justice records relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In a 427-1 vote, House members passed a resolution requiring the Department of Justice to release all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials about Epstein and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The bill will now move to the Senate for its consideration.
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Fedorchak said she supported the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform’s work over the summer in releasing material to the public obtained from the Epstein estate. She said she supports transparency and justice.
“I support these victims. They deserve justice. The crimes were terrible and I, 100%, support justice for them,” said Fedorchak, a Republican.
She also applauded the House oversight committee on its work of releasing information related to Epstein and Maxwell to the public in recent months.
“The reason we’re talking about all these emails today, and there’s all this new information, is because of that oversight committee’s work,” Fedorchak said. 
US House overwhelmingly votes to force release of Epstein files

She added that she does not support a pardon for Maxwell.
Fedorchak did not sign the discharge petition that enabled Tuesday’s vote, but publicly signaled her support of releasing the documents last week in an interview with WDAY.
In a statement Tuesday, Republican Sen. John Hoeven’s office said he supports the documents being released.
“We should address the questions regarding the Epstein case in a responsible way that both protects victims and provides information to the American public in a straightforward and transparent way,” Hoeven’s office said.
Sen. Kevin Cramer’s office did not return requests for comment through emails and phone messages this week.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-18 21:24:31+00:00,Mississippi Today,Gov. Tate Reeves withholds details of anticipated $500 million rural health plan as other states go public,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/18/reeves-withholds-rural-health-plan/,The federal government has said states may post plans to their websites at their discretion.,"While most states have made public their proposals for a $50 billion federal investment into rural health care, Mississippi is keeping its plan under wraps. 
Thirty-two states have made their full application or proposal summaries for the Rural Health Transformation Program available to the public, according to a report from Princeton University’s State Health & Value Strategies Program. Ten states, including Mississippi, have announced but not shared their application, and 8 have not made any details public. 
All 50 states submitted applications for the one-time funds, which will be doled out over five years beginning in 2026 as part of a major federal investment into rural healthcare. The federal government has said states may post plans to their websites at their discretion, though the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will not release awardees’ project summaries until funding decisions are made. Awards will be finalized by the end of December. 
Gov. Tate Reeves, whose office oversaw the development of Mississippi’s plan, denied Mississippi Today’s public records request for the application. He told reporters at a press conference Nov. 4 the state will work with CMS to determine when it can make all or part of the document public. 
“The primary reason for denying the request is to protect sensitive technical and detailed budgeting information that could jeopardize and undermine the competitive nature of the procurement process that must be followed in awarding federal funds,” said spokesperson Shelby Wilcher in an email to Mississippi Today.
Mississippi is expected to receive at least $500 million – and possibly more – as a part of the program, Reeves said Nov. 4. He shared an overview of Mississippi’s plan, which includes conducting a statewide assessment to study rural health, facilitating collaboration between providers, expanding the medical workforce, advancing health technology and closing gaps in care. The plan largely mirrors the broad strategic goals of the federal program. 
Heather Howard, a professor at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, said states publishing the proposals is important because it allows stakeholders to see the programs they are pursuing and states to share ideas for tackling the widespread challenges rural communities are facing in accessing health care. 
“Transparency is always the best practice in government,” Howard said. “And I would say, particularly so given the significant funding at issue and the underlying rural health challenges across the country.”
Concerns about duplication have already risen. Leaders advising on how to spend tens of millions in opioid settlement dollars noted that several of the projects proposed could also be eligible for funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program. 
The Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council is “wanting to be careful not to double-fund when funds are limited,” State Health Office Dr. Dan Edney, a co-vice chair of the committee who also supported the governor in crafting the rural health plan, said at the council’s meeting Nov. 3. 
In a letter denying Mississippi Today’s request for the state’s Rural Health Transformation Program, Reeves’ office said the requested records “appear to be confidential under Federal law” until awards are made, citing the same document that says states may post plans to their websites at their discretion. 
It also pointed to a state law that exempts public bodies from the Mississippi Public Records Act’s deadlines during procurement. The law does not bar the state from releasing the records, but says it is not required to meet the usual deadlines until contracts are awarded. 
“If potential subgrantees are able to gain access to detailed budgeting information for each initiative in the application, they might use such information to inflate their bids and thereby deplete the limited federal funds that are critical to improving health outcomes in rural Mississippi,” said the letter. 
States can redact sensitive information or publish a summary of the application to address valid concerns about releasing proprietary or sensitive information, Howard said. Six states have opted to release only a summary of their application as opposed to the full document. 
“It’s good that they are sensitive to that, but states have ways to address that,” she said.
The Rural Health Transformation Program was tacked on to President Donald Trump’s tax-and-spending law passed this summer, which cuts federal Medicaid spending. Congressional Republicans added the one-time money for rural health to soften the blow associated with the permanent cuts in rural areas. 
The program’s funds will offset just over a third of the estimated $137 billion cuts to federal Medicaid spending expected in rural areas over 10 years, according to analysis from KFF. 
In Mississippi, cuts to payments that help hospitals offset low Medicaid payments will amount to a loss of $160 million a year statewide beginning in 2029, Mississippi Medicaid Director Cindy Bradshaw told lawmakers Sept. 24.
Some critics have noted that the program is temporary funding that will not cover the losses rural hospitals are facing. And, the funding is aimed at implementing new programs to strengthen rural health, not making direct payments to hospitals to make up for this difference. 
“What we’re seeing is a real interest in workforce development and health technology, which is exciting,” Howard said of applications states have made public. “…But that’s not going to make up for the day-to-day reimbursement cuts that hospitals are reeling from.” 
Mississippi’s plan will not include direct financial assistance to hospitals, which the federal government has made clear it will not approve, Reeves said Nov. 4. 
Half of the $50 billion program will be distributed evenly among all states with approved applications. The other half will be calculated based on a formula that calculates each states’ rurality, the quality of its application and implementation of policies aligned with the Make America Healthy Again agenda.

The Mississippi Arts Commission and the Phil Hardin Foundation contributed $500,000 each. In addition, two anonymous donors gifted $200,000 each. The donations are directed to the Foundation of Mississippi History, a nonprofit that supports Mississippi Department of Archives and History projects.
“It’s such an uplifting day today to see this, to see dreams become a reality through the generosity of so many donors, and really all of us working together,” Spence Flatgard, president of the state archive department’s Board of Trustees, said at a press conference on Tuesday in front of Two Mississippi Museums and across the street from the future park .
Katie Blount, director of archives and history, said the park would help the larger push to revitalize the downtown area.
“A park can really galvanize other improvements, and we’re really excited about that,” she said.
The new park is currently in phase one of construction. It’s set to open at Mississippi Makers Fest in 2027. It will be a green space with a children’s area, a walking trail, a splashpad, a pavilion and more.
Lloyd Gray, executive director of the Phil Hardin Foundation, said the park would help the Two Mississippi Museums provide educational opportunities to Mississippi students and that their donation was an investment in the capital’s revitalization. 
“No entity in our capital city is more important to the educational, cultural and civic life of our state than the Two Mississippi Museums, and we at the Hardin Foundation are both honored and excited to be a part of their continued growth and development,” he said.
The Legislature allocated $3 million to support construction of the park, according to an archives and history press release.
“The arts enhance the quality of life and local economies,” said Mississippi Arts Commission’s Executive Director David Lewis in the release. “With the generous support from the Mississippi Legislature, we can activate our citizens’ innate creativity and invest in our communities.”
The park is located at the former site of the Eudora Welty Library.
Once a Sears department store, the Welty library became the flagship branch of the Jackson/Hinds Library System in the 1980s. The library closed its doors in June 2023 after falling into disrepair. The Jackson City Council transferred the property to Mississippi Department of Archives and History in December that year. The state department is now turning the site into a park and green space, inspired by the city of Jackson’s original layout.
Margaret Ann Crigler Park gets its name from the late wife of Noble Crigler, a retired businessman who contributed $1 million in lead funding to the project in 2023.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/18123308/3X0A5037.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

(Photo: Laura Leslie/NC Newsline)At a small Latino shopping center tucked into the corner of a Garner neighborhood, the usually bustling parking lot was mostly empty Tuesday morning.
Emilin Gaona was behind the counter at La Zacatecana, a small, tidy, family-owned bodega. She said her family almost hadn’t opened the store this morning. A lot of their workers were too afraid to come in, she said, because of the news that the Border Patrol would be active in Raleigh. 
Gaona said she and her mother decided to open anyway because many people in the community rely on the small store to pay bills and send money internationally. But she said they had had almost no business as of midday.
Gaona was born in the United States, but she’s still nervous about the federal agents.
“I was kind of scared to even drive over here because, like, they see you, they see brown, they’re stopping you,” Gaona told NC Newsline. “They don’t let you show your papers. They don’t really care about that. They just take you.”  
Gaona’s 12-year-old sister is a U.S. citizen, too. She said her sister had seen what was happening on her phone and didn’t want to go to her Garner school this morning.  
“She was crying because she was scared. She was afraid. And I get it, I understand,” Gaona said. “But we can’t really stop our lives either, and we just have to keep going.”
Next door, the Elvia hair salon was closed. Two doors down, the Tres Hermanos grocery store was open, but there wasn’t a single customer browsing its aisles or ordering at the meat counter. The manager declined to be interviewed, but said business was very, very slow. 
It was the same story all across Garner, a working-class suburb of Raleigh with a sizable Latino population. 
At the Home Depot, the contractor parking area – usually packed – was nearly empty. Most of the shops at the International Foods plaza, a major Latino shopping center, were closed at midday. A taekwondo studio had a sign in its window: “No class today and tomorrow due to the situation ongoing in our cities.”
NC Newsline asked Gov. Josh Stein Tuesday why he believes North Carolina is being targeted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Stein said he doesn’t know.
“We’ve reached out to the White House. We haven’t gotten any word,” Stein said after an event in Benson on Tuesday. “We’re not hearing directly from [U.S.] Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”
Stein, a Democrat, accused Border Patrol agents of “operating in the shadows” in the recent sweep in Charlotte. 
“If this were targeted to going after known people who are criminals or known people who are drug traffickers who are engaged in violent crime, that would be a good thing,” Stein said. “But they’re just sweeping sidewalks. They’re sweeping parking lots. They’re going into stores and churches.”
“This is causing widespread fear, widespread uncertainty,” Stein added. “This is not about public safety.”
NC Newsline also asked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol why they’re targeting North Carolina. The agency did not immediately respond. 
However, Greg Bovino, the commanding CBP agent who has led operations in Chicago and now Charlotte, has instead targeted Stein through social media posts and TV hits. 
He accused the governor of using “heated rhetoric” in a Fox News appearance Tuesday. And he later reposted a video of a woman threatening agents with a screwdriver on X, writing: “Governor Stein, you caused this.”
“I put a lot of the blame on our elected leadership,” Bovino told Fox News.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 21:17:03+00:00,CT Mirror,Attorney: AG’s office is ‘victim-blaming’ in prison sex assault case,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/ct-prison-sexual-assault-lawsuit-victim-blaming/,Lashanda Gregory's attorney claimed the AG's office had engaged in 'victim-blaming' after she sued for being sexually assaulted in prison.,"Civil rights attorney Alex Taubes alleged in a letter to Attorney General William Tong on Tuesday that his office had engaged in a pattern of “victim-blaming” toward a woman suing the state after she was sexually assaulted at York Correctional Institution. 
Lashanda Gregory, who was first incarcerated at York in 2014, filed a claim for $2.5 million with the state claims commissioner in June 2023 alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by two correction officers in 2022. 
“There were warning signs, there was inadequate safety and security, and the Department of Correction shows carelessness in its efforts to comply with the Prison Rape Elimination Act and in preventing sexual misconduct,” Gregory wrote in her claim. 
On Nov. 6, Claims Commissioner Robert Shea gave Gregory permission to sue the state of Connecticut for negligence. 
A few days later, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Beizer sent an email to Taubes, who is representing Gregory, saying that the Supreme Court was likely to side with the state and offering a settlement of $25,000. In the email, Beizer said that Gregory was “the instigator/willing participant in the incidents” of sexual assault, making her “contributorily negligent.” 
After Taubes shared the email with CT Insider last week, 12 female lawmakers sent a letter to Tong expressing concern about Beizer’s language. 
“Simply stated, sexual contact with DOC staff is statutory rape. Framing an incarcerated survivor as responsible in any way for her own abuse, and transferring her out of state, undermines trust in our institutions and suggests a broader culture of retaliation of incarcerated members, chilling future reports of sexual violence within Dept. of Correction custody,” the lawmakers wrote.  
The lawmakers also said that just because the two correction officers who were involved had been legally prosecuted didn’t mean the state wasn’t responsible. They asked that Gregory, who was transferred to a prison in Delaware in May, be brought back to Connecticut and that the Department of Correction provide assurances that people reporting sexual assault wouldn’t face retaliation. 
Tong responded in a letter to lawmakers on Monday that the language in the email had been “misinterpreted” and did not reflect the position of the state. 
“The State of Connecticut and the Office of the Attorney General does not believe, has not asserted, and will not assert that Ms. Gregory is responsible for her sexual assault. There is no question that Ms. Gregory is a victim of sexual assault; this has already been established in court in the criminal cases of the two former corrections officers responsible for this heinous crime,” Tong wrote in the letter. 
Tong said that his office was not arguing the guilt of the correction officers. Instead, he said, it was his job to defend the state against a claim that the state had been negligent “in allowing these crimes to occur through insufficient training, supervision, or failure to act once the incidents were known.” 
Tong added that he felt Taubes’ decision to share the settlement offer was “communicated improperly and unethically to the press in an effort to gain leverage over the state of Connecticut.”
But Taubes, in a response to the Attorney General’s Office on Tuesday, doubled down on his allegation that the email was only part of the state’s overall strategy of “victim-blaming.” 
“This is not a misunderstanding or a ‘misinterpretation.’ It is a deliberate framing of a woman in state custody as a willing participant in sex with the guards who held power over her — despite Connecticut law making clear that incarcerated people cannot legally consent to sex with correctional officers,” Taubes wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Taubes also shared the transcript of a deposition on Jan, 8, 2025, in which Beizer asked Gregory whether she had engaged “voluntarily” in the sexual acts she’d performed with Correction Officer Michael Mabry and whether she’d “derive[d] any sexual pleasure” from the acts. 
At one point, Gregory said Mabry hadn’t “forced me or pinned me down” but added that Beizer couldn’t understand the situation she was in. 
“You don’t understand what it’s like to be in that kind of situation. I know to you it seems like you should have said no, should have, could have, would have and then dealt with the consequences later. Yes, it was voluntary,” she said later in the deposition. 
Gregory said she had engaged in sexual acts with Mabry twice. Mabry resigned from the Department of Correction and in 2023 pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault. 
She also said she had “flirted” with Correction Officer Bobby Wilson and engaged in sexual acts with him six or seven times. Wilson resigned from the Department of Correction and was charged with fourth-degree sexual assault. He later applied for an accelerated rehabilitation program through the court system, according to documents attached to Gregory’s initial claim filing. 
“I cannot and will not accept the premise that exposing a victim-blaming litigation position is an ethical violation. It is precisely what an ethical lawyer representing an incarcerated survivor is supposed to do,” Taubes wrote in his letter.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

This was part of the basis of why university officials say he should be terminated; he sent this photo to at least one inmate at the Montana State Prison, because of a friendship that began when he was teaching in a Prison Education Program (Photo provided to the Daily Montanan). New documents show that Montana State University-Billings officials placed two tenured professors on immediate leave because they say communicating with Montana State inmates voluntarily via email after classes ended was a “safety risk.”
A disciplinary document that is forming the basis of the university’s decision to terminate both Jennifer Scroggins and Joshua Hill’s tenure and jobs details the communications, and has also formed the basis for the university to allege both of them had lied about a romantic relationship with each other, which they said did not develop until recently.
The move by MSUB administrators to terminate the two professors, though, began after the professors had brought up concerns about a prison education program about which other faculty had raised concerns. Those concerns range from whether students could even earn a degree, if it was draining the prisoners of federal loan eligibility, and whether Department of Corrections officials were retaliating against the professors as faculty members pushed for answers about the program.
Hill and Scroggins are longtime professors at the university, and were told on the first day of class this fall that they were being placed on administrative leave immediately, leaving students enrolled in their courses — they both were teaching full-time — to find other courses. Previously, students told the Daily Montanan that they may have stay additional semesters to get the courses they need, and said they were left in the dark by the school’s administration.
University officials have declined several opportunities to discuss the matter with the Daily Montanan, saying they will not comment on personnel matters.
The Daily Montanan also requested an interview with Travis Anderson, the director of education for the Montana Department of Corrections, and the administrator who decided email communication with the students violated prison policy to such an extent that he banned both Scroggins and Hill from teaching or entering a facility.
Anderson also warned MSUB officials that he was reporting the incident to the Montana Department of Criminal Investigation, according to emails provided to the Daily Montanan.
The Montana Department of Corrections, through a spokesperson, declined an in-person interview with Anderson, saying that they would only consider emailed questions.
  The email 

In an interview with the Daily Montanan, Hill, who is a professor of economics and has taught at MSUB since 2013, admits he and Scroggins are in a romantic relationship. He said it has been going on this year, after a longtime friendship with her.
Hill also admits he and Scroggins have been critical of the prison education program, and have raised those concerns with the faculty and administration. He claims the university uses the program as a money maker, but was not concerned about incarcerated students getting a degree that could be usable after serving their sentence.
He said that because of the tension and because the university’s faculty — not the administration — own the curriculum, he and Scroggins were targeted and silenced. However, he also said they were not the only ones to share concerns.
However, he said the university is using a benign friendship with former students and illegal justification to silence them by trumping up charges to dismiss them, possibly sending a message to other faculty members to quit raising concerns about the program.
Meanwhile, Hill said he’s disappointed that the union that represents the faculty, the Montana Federation of Public Employees, has mounted such a tepid fight, while Hill and Scroggins’ professional and personal reputations hang in the balance.
The MFPE did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story, and didn’t comment when the news of the termination broke. Moreover, the union may have its own internal conflict: It not only represents the faculty of MSUB, but it also represents the guards of the prison in Deer Lodge.
In a 13-page Oct. 24 memorandum, Lee Vartanian, the MSUB provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs, outlined the specific allegations against Hill, while frequently referencing Scroggins. Sources close to the situation tell the Daily Montanan it forms the basis of the proceedings against both of the professors.
That document shows it was Anderson with the Department of Corrections who began the process, when he claimed that the two professors were in violation of DOC codes, and made a report to university officials.
It was from there that the DOC combed through the email of three inmates and the correspondence from the professors. Anderson and the DOC claim that email communication regarding anything else besides coursework was against the DOC policy, and served as the basis to kick Hill and Scroggins out of the Prison Education Program, and furthermore, he said it threatened the university system’s relationship.
That policy is four pages. The particular passage Vartanian zeroed in on prohibits “engaging in personal or business relationships that may compromise professional integrity, compromise security, or cause embarrassment to the Department of Corrections or the State of Montana.”
The Department of Corrections Policy 1.3.12 also warns employees or service providers not to engage in behavior “unrelated to a legitimate correctional purpose, such as socializing or sharing of personal information.”
In his memo, Vartanian said that violating the Department of Corrections policies is one of the reasons that he’s recommending Hill and Scroggins be terminated. However, both professors point out they are not employees of the Department of Corrections, and they indeed honored the terms of the policies, even though both have said their employment and conduct isn’t governed by the DOC, rather through the Collective Bargaining Agreement of Montana State University.
Furthermore, at the time the email communications were started, Hill was not teaching courses in the program — it was the summer. Hill said he was not scheduled to teach in the program, and that all affiliation with the program had ended for him. The earliest email that Vartanian referenced was July 31 — months after the last day of class. Hill said the three students had become friends, much in the same way that former students become friends or keep in touch.
“I have always said my goal isn’t to teach students, but create colleagues,” Hill told the Daily Montanan.
Because he was communicating when he was not the inmates’ instructor, not in the PEP program, and because he said nothing inappropriate was discussed, the efforts should be dismissed. He also told the Daily Montanan that he found the timing of discipline odd in several ways: It happened directly after he had complained about the program, and the university’s bargaining agreement said that administration can only bar suspended employees from campus if they pose a security threat, something no document alleges.
He believes the harsh punishment serves a different reason — to muzzle and isolate Scroggins and Hill, and send a message to any other faculty members with concerns about the prison program.
Vartanian presented parts of eight emails in Hill’s disciplinary document. Vartanian and MSUB claim that the content of the emails violated the DOC policy, and that included a picture of Hill with his dog.
“A student inmate messaged him that he and the inmates would vote for him as governor,” according to the document.
Hill replied with the picture of the dog: “As long as that’s governor of snuggles!”
The disciplinary document also faults Hill for discussing “personal book and movie recommendations” as well as a talking about a home renovation project.
Photos of a home improvement project that Montana State University Professor Joshua Hill had begun. This is part of what the university describes as an inappropriate friendship with a group of Montana State Prison inmates that officials say should cost Hill and fellow professor Jennifer Scroggins their jobs (Photos provided to the Daily Montanan).
MSUB also says that Hill violated policies when he expressed sympathy about difficulties the student was having. Hill responded that the student was “in his thoughts.” Hill also “donated $25 to an inmate’s trust fund.”
These emails took place from July 31 through Aug. 10.
An unspecified number of emails appeared to be turned over from Anderson to MSUB officials. From there, university officials said they found evidence that suggested Scroggins and Hill’s romantic relationship had been going on longer than 2025.
That information forms the basis of the second prong of the complaint against Hill and Scroggins. For a period, Scroggins was the department chairwoman in the department he served. When one of Hill’s students appealed a grade he had given, she appealed to the department chairwoman, Scroggins.
According to the documents, Scroggins upheld Hill’s decision, as did Dean Tami Haaland. The student then appealed to the then-Provost Sepher Eskandari, who “validated the student’s concerns and changed it to a passing grade.”
The university’s human resources department contacted the professors, both of whom denied the relationship in mid-2024.
However, in the disciplinary document authored by Vartanian, he said that some of the email communications with the inmates suggested a romantic relationship before 2025.
For his part, Hill admits they are in a romantic relationship, and nothing in the collective bargaining agreement prohibits that. He said at the time of the grade dispute, there was no conflict of interest.
In one of the emails to the inmate on Aug. 8, Scroggins said Hill and she started “dating about 3.5 years ago,” but it also acknowledged that they “broke up.”
“We do have a weird situation with my being his friend before anything else, being colleagues (so we vote on one another’s review decisions), then my being his ‘department chair (which is why I get his student complaints.)'”
However, in that same email, she discusses that while Hill has a higher academic rank (full professor), she has the higher administrative rank (department chairwoman).
“There’s a lot of boundary setting and watching for conflicts of interest that has to go on to make this all work,” she said.
University officials in the disciplinary document characterized Hill’s previous characterizations of their relationship as “dishonest and misleading,” something he denies.
“It obstructed the university’s ability to recognize, manage and mitigate a clear conflict of interest in both student and faculty-related matters,” Vartanian wrote. “This repeated dishonesty represents more than an isolated lapse in judgment; it is a pattern of misrepresentation that compromised students rights, impeded university oversight, and damaged the institution’s credibility. Such dishonest constitutes a substantial failure to perform faculty responsibilities, as honesty and integrity in university processes are essential components of assigned duties and a fundamental expectation required of faculty.”
  Students respond 

During the coverage of this story, the Daily Montanan has interviewed nearly a dozen students. Every one of them said they were aware that Hill and Scroggins were involved in a relationship. Many of them pointed out they’re aware of the personal lives of many of their professors, who often share personal details. In every interview conducted with students, none said their conversations gave rise to concerns of impropriety.
The Daily Montanan has received several calls and testimonies from prisoners being held by the Montana Department of Corrections. They, too, have been enthusiastic about the courses offered.
Travis Soderberg, who has a lengthy felony and conviction record ranging from Havre to Billings, sent a two-page letter detailing the impact of Scroggins.
“I doubted my academic abilities,” he said. “I was terrified because I didn’t think I could do it, but I was desperate to have something meaningful in my life…When I think of a teacher worth remembering, Dr. Scroggins always comes up. Her genuine nature to help people is something that is rare. Although her classes were very challenging, she made them see achievable because she set a tone that made me believe in myself. My experience with these professors was amazing because they brought out the best in me.”
But that influence doesn’t stop at in the PEP program.
Tyrah Knudsvig, is student who attends classes in Billings and is not a part of the PEP program. A junior from Great Falls, she said she has stayed at MSUB because of Scroggins. She’s now expanded her horizons, double majoring in criminal justice and sociology, largely due to the inspiration Scroggins has provided.
She said she wants to be proud of her university, but it’s hard when she’s watched it target the most powerful influence on her academic career. She has been working with a local police department as well as working as a victim’s witness, something she said would have been impossible without the help of Scroggins.
She also has concerns about how the university has handled the suspension, leaving students hanging, while she’s read comments from university leaders, even the Board of Regents, complimenting themselves on how well they’ve taken care of students. She was left scurrying to find different classes, and she’s still not sure if she’ll have to spend extra time and money to take classes she needs to graduate. Scroggins taught many of the courses.
She utilized the dual-credit enrollment program offered through many Montana high schools to get a head start on her college career, but now Knudsvig thinks adding a summer term to make up classes may be the only way she can keep on track.
“We still have no idea what’s going and the department says it can’t saying anything,” Knudsvig said. “No one emailed us anything and they never informed student about the huge changes that affected us. They don’t care about the needs of the students.”
And, she heard nothing when she needed responses from Scroggins because the university instantly cut off communications, including university email, with the professors.  When she stopped to check in on Scroggins, her office door was shut. A university employee would only say: “She won’t be in for the rest of the week.”
“No one would say anything. (The students) were talking: What the heck is happening?” She said. “There was no communication.”
When she asked questions of the Dean of Business whose college was charged with helping students sort out the classes, she said she was told it could be a short-term problem or a long-term one.
That, she said, was no help to her or other students.
She described several other professors as “completely sealed up.”
“I want to feel proud of my university,” Knudsvig said. “But I don’t trust what they’re doing. I care about Dr. Scroggins and she’s trying to do the right thing and they’ve treated her horribly with disrespect. It’s hard to watch. But for them to say it’s not a student concern is just infuriating.
“I hope it all comes out, even if my school is dragged through the mud. They might need to do that if they’re treating professors that poorly.”
She said she wrote a letter and hand delivered it to MSUB Chancellor Stefani Hicswa, outlining her concerns.
She hasn’t received a response.
“We’re always told the goal is to graduate and succeed,” Knudsvig said. “And this administration has disrupted our plans to succeed.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1000000242-e1763495199256-1024x830.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

A St. Louis jury heard opening statements Tuesday in a lawsuit where consultant Mark Avent and his wife, Lisa, are seeking $5 million in damages, arguing the incident triggered a medical emergency that ended his career in the cannabis industry.
The incident in question happened at the facility at 5401 Bulwer Ave., owned by Blue Arrow Missouri LLC, where marijuana is grown and manufactured into products. 
In 2022, a lab technician accidentally mishandled the commercial vacuum used to clean the lab equipment. The vacuum blew fine marijuana dust particles into the air, and Avent suffered a severe asthma attack. 
He was taken to the emergency room and lost consciousness in the ambulance.  Doctors inserted a stent in his heart to save him, Meehan said, and he still hasn’t fully recovered four years later. 
“This was an accident that shouldn’t have happened,” said William Meehan, Avent’s attorney. “It was preventable, and they haven’t taken responsibility for it. That’s why we’re in trial.”
On the stand Tuesday, John Wilbers, founder and chairman of Blue Arrow, testified that the company acknowledged the incident. He read portions of the report the company submitted to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which described how the technician didn’t immediately shut down equipment when he saw the particles enter the air. 
The report also states that the door should be closed during “all processing activities.”
Wilbers told The Independent Tuesday after his testimony that the company isn’t trying to “sweep it under the rug.” Wilbers is a personal injury attorney in St. Louis who started the company with his mother, Kathy, who died last week. 
His mother was the majority owner of the two cultivation, one manufacturing and one dispensary licenses the state awarded them in 2019, according records obtained from the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation.
Wilbers said he understands how companies “play games” in personal injury lawsuits. 
“I deal with them on the other end,” he said, “and I don’t live my life like that. So if somebody’s injured, we’re going to help them.”
The point of conflict, Wilbers said, is how much the company should pay. Wilbers said Avent had a previous “asthmatic condition.” 
“He’s alleging that due to this inhalation, he had some asthmatic issue and medical conditions developed, and now he can no longer work,” he said. “Based upon my experience as a personal injury lawyer, that’s not supported.”
In the opening arguments, Meehan said Avent needs continued care to treat his heart damage and memory loss.
“Mark was a healthy person before this incident,” Meehan said. “He exercised regularly and he had no physical problems. He had no prior heart disease, no prior heart condition.” 
On top of his ongoing medical bills, Meehan said Avent has lost at least $130,000 a year in income because he can no longer work in the marijuana industry.
“His personal life,” he said, “has been turned upside down.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Greenhouse-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) introduced three wildfire-related bills this week in a newly reopened United States Senate, all of which use New Mexico’s recent wildfire experience as a guide — or a cautionary tale — for the rest of the country. 
The three bills seek to limit the number of out-of-state companies that receive fire-related contracts; expand the use of technology to monitor nascent blazes; and require the federal government to pay 100% of costs in rare circumstances when a federally managed prescribed burn escapes into a wildfire. 
Luján introduced the “Local Employment Access for our Forests Act,” or “LEAF Act,” on Monday, which incentivizes Forest Service to hire local contractors specifically for preventative forest maintenance, including thinning dense forests of organic material before a major wildfire hits. 
Luján spokesperson Seiichiro Nakai told Source that Luján’s office has heard from the New Mexico State Forester that contracts for hazard fuel mitigation are “frequently” going to “large, out-of-state foresters.” In a news release, Luján said the bill would require the Forest Service to give preference to local contractors and also to issue an annual report on how many wildfire mitigation contracts it gives to out-of-state companies.
NM Congressional delegation reports continued delays to Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire compensation

The “Fire Innovation Unit Act,” introduced Tuesday, would create a pilot program for emerging technology that detects, prevents and responds to wildfires. The bill requires the federal Agriculture and Interior secretaries to create a “Fire Innovation Unit” to deploy and monitor wildfire technology.
Luján pointed to the recent state partnership with Pano AI, which has installed wildfire detection cameras in the Albuquerque and Santa Fe areas recently. The company promises its cameras offer 24/7, 360-degree monitoring, along with artificial intelligence-powered wildfire detection. 
“As wildfires continue to wreak havoc on communities across New Mexico and the country, we must find innovative tools and technologies to combat the ever-changing threats posed by wildfires,” Luján said in a statement.
Finally, the Responsible Wildland Fire Recovery Act, also introduced Tuesday, would require the federal government to shoulder the cost if it caused a wildfire. 
In New Mexico, the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire in 2022, the biggest wildfire in state history, began due to botched United States Forest Service prescribed burns in Northern New Mexico. In that case, federal agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the federal Agriculture Department agreed to waive what is often a 25% state cost-share for disaster response expenses, but that was only because the senator required them to in a separate piece of legislation, according to a spokesperson. 
“The goal of the Responsible Wildland Fire Recovery Act is to ensure that were the federal government to set and lose control of another fire, Congress would not need to step in to waive the cost share again,” spokesperson Seiichiro Nakai said in an email.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9949-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-18 16:58:03.661720

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A former Lowcountry legislator made his first court appearance Tuesday in Charleston on accusations he swindled half a million dollars from multiple legal clients.
A federal grand jury indicted former Rep. Marvin Pendarvis on 10 counts including wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering, U.S. Attorney Bryan Stirling announced Tuesday.
The indictment alleges the 36-year-old personal injury attorney filed lawsuits and negotiated settlements on his clients’ behalf, then either kept all of the money or lied about the amount, claiming insurance companies settled for less than they actually did. In some cases, he forged his clients’ names and filed settlement documents with the clerk of court without his clients’ knowledge and/or approval.
According to the indictment, settlement money was wire transferred into his law firm’s bank account. Some of that was transferred to other bank accounts. The scheme netted Pendarvis at least $532,000 between January 2022 and April 2024. That’s when the State Law Enforcement Division began investigating claims in a former client’s civil malpractice lawsuit.
Pendarvis faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the wire fraud and money laundering charges. He faces up to six additional years on the three counts of aggravated identity theft.
U.S. Magistrate Molly Cherry released Pendarvis on a signed promise to appear at future court dates. He risks $50,000 if he doesn’t.
Reached later Tuesday by phone, his attorney, public defender Brendan Daniels, declined to comment.
Pendarvis, a North Charleston Democrat, resigned from the seat he held for seven years last September, four months after the state Supreme Court suspended his law license.
Despite his resignation, he still won re-election unopposed last November. He then declined to accept the win, triggering a special election.

Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, Miami, Orlando, St Petersburg, Tampa, and Wilton Manors all received 100% scores in the organization’s Municipal Equality Index.
“With federal and state governments too often leaving LGBTQ+ people behind, cities and towns are stepping up and embracing inclusion and equality,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign.
“For years now, state legislatures — and now Congress and the President — are waging a calculated campaign to erase LGBTQ+ people from public life and the cities that wish to welcome them. But there are still more of us who support equality than those who do not — and I commend each and every city that fought against tall odds to show their continued support of our community. In these challenging times, our work with the Municipal Equality Index and the leadership of these municipalities have never been more critical.”
Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia recently criticized several local governments for spending taxpayer funds on Pride events and for LGBTQ+ youth services as part of the Florida Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force findings.
The state’s Department of Transportation sparked outrage earlier this year when it began removing pavement surface markings of all political stripes, such as the rainbow-striped crosswalk outside the Pulse Memorial in Orlando.
Mayors from two of the cities that received perfect scores hailed their inclusion on the Human Rights Campaign’s annual list on Tuesday.
“I’m proud that our community has received this honor,” said St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch. “As we continue to build on this progress, we remain committed to making St. Pete a city that advances equity for all of its residents.”
“When everyone feels safe, supported, and included, cities become more creative, economies grow, and public life becomes more vibrant,” said Tampa Mayor Jane Castor in a press release. “Studies consistently show that LGBTQ+ equality makes cities stronger for all residents, attracting talent, inspiring innovation, and building the kind of trust and energy that allow neighborhoods, businesses, and people to thrive together.”

(Photo by Pramote Polyamate/Getty Images)Fewer Alaska babies were born in 2024 than the year prior, continuing a yearslong decline in the state’s births and women’s fertility rates, a new report shows.
There were 8,950 Alaska babies born last year, down from 9,031 in 2023, according to the Alaska Vital Statistics 2024 Annual Report released by the state Department of Health. The number of births has fallen in each of the past five years, the report showed. In 2020, there were 9,486 babies born in Alaska.

Annual numbers of Alaska births from 2020 to 2025 have declined steadily. The decline continued last year, according to the Alaska Vital Statistics 2024 Annual Report. (Graph from the Alaska Vital Statistics 2024 Annual Report/Alaska Department of Health)

Fertility rates — defined as the number of births per 100,000 women aged 15 to 44 — also continued to decline. In 2024, the statewide fertility rate was 61, down from 61.8 the year before and 65.5 in 2020. Fertility rates were highest in Southwest Alaska in 2024, at 86.9, and lowest in Southeast Alaska, at 48.5, the report said.
The most popular names for boys were Oliver and Theodore. For baby girls, the most popular names were Amelia and Olivia, the report said.
At the other end of the life cycle, there were slightly fewer deaths in Alaska last year than in 2023 — 5,525 in 2024, compared to 5,544 the year before, the report said. Alaska’s death total peaked in 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when 6,227 residents died, the report said. Death numbers have declined since then, and the 2024 total was similar to the 2020 total of 5,204.
Death statistics revealed that the top three causes in 2024 were the same as they were in most years: cancer, which was responsible for about a fifth of all Alaska deaths; heart disease, with totals for those deaths on the decline since 2021 and 2022; and accidents, a category that includes poisonings and drug overdoses.
COVID-19, which was the No. 3 cause of death in 2021, slipped out of the top 10 in 2023, a year when it was cited as the cause of 56 deaths. Its impact on state demographics was still small in 2024, when it was found to be the cause of 58 Alaska deaths.

	Embedded in the vital statistics report were some positive signs.
Life expectancy increased to a statewide average of 77.6 years, continuing an upward trend since the COVID-19 pandemic year of 2021, when life expectancy hit a low of 75.4 years.
The teen birth rate was the lowest since 2020, the report said. That rate, which measures the number of births per 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19, was 13.5 in 2024, down from 14.8 the year before.
Use of tobacco by pregnant women has also steadily declined in recent years, according to the report. In 2024, 7% of expectant mothers used tobacco, down from 11% in 2020.
Report shows declines in certain cancers
A separate report released by the department detailed cancer statistics through 2022, the year with the last available data.
The Cancer In Alaska 2022 Annual Report showed some positive trends as well.
Cancer incidence overall in Alaska decreased between 1996 and 2022, especially in the years 2009 to 2012, when incidents dropped by an annual average of 3.4%, the report said. Breast cancer remains the most frequent cancer among women, while prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer among men, the report said.
Certain types of cancers have decreased in Alaska since 2016, including leukemia, bladder cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. There is a caveat, however. “Recent trends have started to show an increase in prostate cancer statewide and nationally,” Shirley Sakaye, a spokesperson for the department, said by email.

	Also on the decline in Alaska was colorectal cancer, which ranked fourth on the list of diagnosed cancers in the state in 2022, according to the cancer report.
Colorectal cancer trends are of special concern in Alaska because of a high prevalence among Alaska Natives. Alaska Native people have had the nation’s highest recorded rates of colorectal cancer, according to a recent report by the American Cancer Society. The reasons are not fully understood by health experts, but they may relate to diet, according to the report.
While colorectal cancer numbers have declined in recent years, rates are notably high in one of the most rural regions of the state: the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in Western Alaska. The colorectal cancer rate there was 88 per 100,000 people in 2022, compared to the statewide rate of 40.8 per 100,000, according to the report.
Alaska Native tribal health organizations have boosted awareness, and screening has increased over time.
Because of relatively high rates of colorectal cancer among younger adult Alaska Native people, the Alaska Native Medical Center and Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium recommend that screenings start at age 40, compared to the recommendation for most Americans to start screenings at age 45.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As planning for the launch of the University of Iowa Center for Intellectual Freedom ramps up, the center’s interim director is working to address concerns from the public and others about the center’s intent and offerings.
Interim Director Luciano I. de Castro said in an interview Tuesday ahead of the center’s first advisory board meeting that Iowans should show their gratitude to the top scholars who will help advise the center during its infancy and help find the leader to steer it in the future.
Responding to concerns expressed by members of the Iowa Board of Regents at its November meeting about potential out-of-state control of the advisory council, de Castro said the fact is that the council is advisory, not governing. The center, like Iowa’s public universities, is under the oversight of the board of regents, and the advisory council won’t control it.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and her “advisers” were involved in the search for scholars to recommend for the council, de Castro said, suggesting names to be brought to the board of regents.
“Governor Reynolds insisted on writing to every scholar in our committee, because I think this was a very important vision that she had, and I really appreciate it,” de Castro said. “I’m grateful that she was able to see the value of associating this center with these scholars from top universities.”
A professor and research fellow in economics at the UI Tippie College of Business, de Castro has supported the idea of creating an initiative for intellectual freedom at the university since it first came up in last year’s legislative session. He presented to the Iowa House Higher Education committee on the creation of a school for intellectual freedom in February, saying the university and state could “pioneer a new educational model rooted in American values.”

Scholars included in the advisory committee membership bring two things to it, de Castro said — their academic advice and their aid in finding a permanent director. When conducting a national search for an academic leader, he said academics need to be involved to evaluate candidates’ academic standards and quality.
De Castro added that these academics are “scholars of the highest standards,” a majority of them coming from “top universities.” Institutions represented in the council include the University of Austin, Princeton University, Stanford University, Northwestern University and more.
As only one member is allowed to join the council from the UI, Senior Advisor to the President and Vice President for External Relations Pete Matthes is representing the institution.
“You have to understand this — these people are volunteering their time to help Iowa,” de Castro said. “I think that the people of Iowa should be grateful that they are willing to help us to build the reputation of the center and make sure that we have high standards in this new institution that’s created for the people of Iowa.”
The advisory council will discuss the search for a director, as well as committee assignments and bylaws, at its first meeting Tuesday evening.
De Castro said bringing in these scholars and having them be part of the center as it gains its footing should also help assuage concerns that first came about in last year’s legislative session, during debate on the bill — now law — that requires the center’s creation and sets certain guidelines.
One worry shared among those who were against the legislation was that the center for intellectual freedom would turn into a center for indoctrination, which de Castro said is the last thing he wants to do. He and those involved in the center want to create “true academic content” in the form of courses, guest speakers and other events and provide a space where lively discussion on topics can occur.
“We want to maintain academic excellence, and this is why we made so much effort to try to actually convince these scholars to be part of our efforts,” de Castro said.
Preparing for launch
De Castro is already planning the specifics of courses to be offered through the center in the spring, titled “Political and Economic Institutions in the United States” and “American Culture and Values.” Specific information on the courses, which will last seven weeks with weekly lectures and a pass/fail grading system, will be released in December, he said.
The center’s inaugural event will take place Dec. 5-6, de Castro said, with the main bulk of the event called the “Reforming Universities Summit.” Reynolds will be in attendance, as well as former regent and current U.S. Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education David Barker and scholars from the University of Chicago and Stanford University, among others.
Many of the academics set to attend the event are interested in “universities and the state of universities,” de Castro said, and so discussions and other activities during it will relate to “how we improve the state of universities, or try to correct some mistakes.” The ideas brought up during the discussion will be “extremely valuable to orient what we do in the center,” de Castro said.
When asked how these topics relate to the center’s mission to “advance top-tier scholarship in areas such as the texts and debates foundational to free societies, the principles and institutions of the American constitutional order, and the foundations of responsible leadership and informed citizenship,” as stated on its website, de Castro said the center is “the democratic process” at work.
De Castro said he believes that the people of Iowa were making their opinions known on Iowa higher education and what it’s missing through the lawmakers who voted to bring the center to life. The vote passed in the Iowa Senate 32-15 along party lines and 60-37 in the House, with Republican Reps. Shannon Latham, Brian Lohse and Matthew Rinker joining Democrats in voting against the bill.
De Castro said he has also worked to bring the other side, or the lawmakers who didn’t support or vote for the center, into his thinking and planning, having reached out to Democratic members of the Iowa House Higher Education Committee after he spoke with them in February.
“The people of Iowa manifested its will that we should be teaching these topics, because there is the perception, the popular perception, that the university is not doing a sufficiently good job at addressing these topics,” de Castro said. “This is why the legislators understood that they should vote for this law to create the center to offer these contents.”

,California,2025-11-18 20:57:46+00:00,CalMatters,Cal State wants to offer bigger raises to campus presidents while cutting elsewhere,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/11/cal-state-salaries-2/,"The current base pay for Cal State campus presidents ranges from $370,000 to more than $500,000.","In summary
The current base pay for Cal State campus presidents ranges from $370,000 to more than $500,000.



California State University’s trustees will vote tomorrow on whether to increase how much the system’s 22 campus presidents and other senior executives earn, potentially paving the way for up to 15% in annual incentive-based raises paid for by philanthropic funds and base salaries that reflect how much presidents at similar universities earn.Exact numbers aren’t available; those will be revealed during tomorrow morning’s board meeting. Committee members will discuss the matter and decide on whether to advance the idea during a scheduled vote before noon. The full board will vote on the measure in the afternoon. The plan will kick in the next year or two. No executives will receive raises under the proposed plan this year.Several hundred unionized staff and faculty rallied outside the board of trustees meeting today, raging against the proposed executive raises at a time of budget austerity, layoffs and program cuts.
“I am mad,” said Erin Foote, a union board member for California State Employees Union, during the rally. The union represents 35,000 office and student workers. The union is in a dispute with the system over additional raises of roughly 3%. “We are going to knock the doors of our legislators so hard there will be holes in them until they stand with us in their budget negotiations,” she said, and vowed to organize for a governor who’d replace Cal State’s chancellor and appoint more union-friendly trustees.Average base pay for campus presidents currently is $453,000, ranging from $370,000 to more than $500,000, system data show.Under the compensation plan, raises to executive base pay would be part of overall wage increases for Cal State workers. That’s in addition to the 15% incentive-based bump to base pay executives would be eligible for.The criteria for receiving the 15% increases hasn’t been finalized, said the system’s interim chief financial officer, Patrick Lenz, in an interview last week. The chancellor’s office will need a year or two to work on that, he said. 
The plan would depart from Cal State’s previous standard of capping base pay of presidents at a salary that’s no more than 10% above what their predecessors made. That plan, last updated 18 months ago, “inappropriately prevents the CSU from offering competitive compensation” to presidents who can lead large universities, the chancellor’s office staff wrote for the board meeting agenda item.
High-ed landscape in turmoil
The overhaul comes at a time when the system is hurting for cash and is also contending with epochal challenges to higher education as the Trump administration seeks to claw back billions in funding to universities and challenge long-held academic freedoms at campuses.
Last month Cal State pushed through initial hesitation to seek a $144 million zero-interest loan from California lawmakers, a financing deal the Legislature permitted to compensate for an equally sized cut to the system’s state support this year. System leaders say they want to use the money to offer pay raises to unionized workers and other staff, including senior executives. 
And Cal State is expecting smaller increases in state support than lawmakers initially signalled. The Legislature intends to increase state spending for Cal State in 2026-27 by just $101 million — far lower than previous promises from Gov. Gavin Newsom of about $250 million.
That’s upset some system trustee members, who say they OK’d raises for workers — many who went on strike for higher pay — and other spending increases based on those promises.
Cal State explains need for plan
In explaining the increased executive compensation proposal, a senior Cal State official said few individuals have the experience and skill set to run campuses with budgets in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
“We want people in these positions who will ensure that a campus’s fiscal condition is spot on, that they’re trying to meet enrollment challenges, that they’re dealing with the overwhelming fact that the state’s going to be hard pressed to invest in higher education over the next couple of years, and the federal government is decimating us,” said Lenz.“These are the people that we need to come in and help us get through these really tough times,” he added.
Cal State in the last four years increased staff and faculty pay by 17%, Chief Human Resources Officer Frank Hurtarte told CalMatters last week. He said campus presidents saw a 7% raise in that time span.The faculty union calculates that presidential pay has grown 81% in the past two decades even as inflation grew 63%.While typical executive pay is several times what it is for faculty and staff, the vast majority of the system’s spending goes toward pay for workers who aren’t executives — $5.6 billion, or 73% of the system’s budget, wrote Jason Maymon, a Cal State spokesperson, in an email.Executives — the systemwide chancellor, campus presidents and vice chancellors in the central office —  collectively earn $18 million, or .25% of the Cal State operating budget, Maymon wrote when asked. That’s about as much as the chancellor’s office cut from its budget this year, part of a systemwide effort to slash costs, including letting go of some lecturers.
Hurtarte pointed out that nationally about 30% to 40% of campus presidents left their jobs in the past 24 months. Cal State has six campuses with president vacancies, he noted. There’s both a lot of churn in the campus presidential job market and competition to fill vacancies.Margarita Berta-Ávila, president of the California Faculty Association, which represents 29,000 members, said in an interview that the executives have mismanaged state and tuition money and don’t deserve raises anyway. Some faculty don’t earn enough to afford rent in expensive cities, she said. 
“It’s unconscionable that they’re even talking about (the raises) when you got people living in cars,” she said.  She’s also upset that leadership at Cal State Los Angeles shared faculty names and other personal information with the federal government as part of an investigation into alleged antisemitism. The union has sued the Cal State board of trustees. 
Pay plan details
Executive compensation under the proposed plan would have four components: base pay, standard executive health and retirement benefits plus housing and car perks for presidents, a new deferred compensation plan and the possibility of the annual pay rising by as much as 15% after a performance review. 
While the base pay, like much of Cal State’s budget, would be paid with tuition and state revenue, the extra 15% would be funded with campus philanthropic efforts. Each university has a fundraising arm and they’d be expected to raise the money to supplement presidents’ pay, Lenz said.That fundraising money will also go toward the new deferred compensation program, basically an additional retirement account for executives at nonprofit or governmental organizations, such as universities.Cal State wouldn’t be alone in paying campus leaders with private funds. At the University of California, several campus heads, called chancellors, have a portion of their salaries paid with outside funds. 
“Compensation decisions must also be fiscally prudent, align with the CSU’s public mission, and be made within the constraints of available funding and budget priorities,” the agenda item says.Under this plan the systemwide chancellor will propose raises each November for board approval. 
The new compensation plan seeks to better attract and retain campus presidents by offering new presidents and other executives a base salary that reflects what peer universities pay and the skills the candidate brings. Those peer institutions include the public college and university systems in New York, Texas State University and the UC, Maymon wrote.
Under the current policy, raises for incumbents are also no higher than 10%. They kick in only after a satisfactory employee review and an analysis of whether the executive was underpaid relative to other presidents across the country. This approach “constrains competitiveness and adds administrative burden,” the agenda item says. The 10% cap for incumbents would also sunset in favor of the eligibility for annual 15% incentive pay.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/042924_CSU-Long-Beach_JH_CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-18 15:58:37.915615

The team will handle cases related to physical abuse or neglect, as well as financial exploitation, though Sunday said he expects the bulk of the work to center on the latter.
Sunday said the section has no new funding, but will have four to five full-time agents, one full-time attorney, and other attorneys working “on loan” from other departments in his office.
Chief Deputy Attorney General Elizabeth Schneider and Chief Agent Lucas Miller are leading the effort.
“I just feel so strongly that a society should be viewed by how it protects the most vulnerable citizens,” Sunday said. “It’s so heartening to have so many people here together that care so much about this and are putting so much work into these cases.”

According to Sunday, roughly one in 10 seniors has experienced abuse or exploitation, but as few as one in 44 cases are reported to authorities. Pennsylvania also has one of the oldest populations of any state in the country, when counting people 65 and older as a share of residents.
Sunday said cases of financial exploitation of elders often involve a relative or caregiver, and that many feel ashamed to bring it to law enforcement, or are afraid of the consequences a loved one might face. Advances in technology have also made online and telephone scams more common and convincing.
Elder exploitation cases can also be complex and “heavy on the investigative side,” Sunday said. Agents often have to go through many records and, in some cases, deal with witnesses who may have trouble with cognition or communication. Moreover, once money is taken, agents have to work quickly if they hope to recover any of the funds
“Municipal police departments may not have the resources required to take on these complex investigations, and that’s understandable,” Sunday said. “The elder exploitation section will have those resources and we expect referrals to come in.”
Sunday also said that those assigned to the team will have specialized training in working with the elderly, including those who struggle to communicate. 
The Attorney General’s office will also continue to raise awareness of common scams and forms of abuse through educational activities, as well as how people can seek justice if they’re victimized.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8098-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 15:58:37.915615

Janet Mills signs proclamations certifying the results of the November 2025 referendum election. (Photo courtesy of the Office of the Maine Governor)Gov. Janet Mills plans to propose funding to help implement the red flag gun law that Mainers passed earlier this month. 
Mills shared her intent to include such funding in her forthcoming budget proposal on Tuesday after signing proclamations certifying the Nov. 4 election results, which also included voters rejecting another referendum, which sought to make several changes to election procedures. 
With the passage of the red flag law, Maine now joins twenty-one other states, including four in New England, with an extreme risk protection order that allows family or household members to directly petition a court to temporarily confiscate someone’s firearms.
According to the Maine Secretary of State’s office, 307,911 Mainers voted in support of the referendum, which appeared as Question 2 on the ballot, while 181,601 were opposed. Just under 2,500 left the question blank.
The addition of this law does not replace Maine’s existing yellow flag law, a version no other states have that allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. Both processes will still be able to be used. 
Mills, who publicly opposed the referendum, said her administration “will work with law enforcement and the courts to implement the new law alongside our existing Extreme Risk Protection Order law, in order to carry out the will of the Maine people.”
When the Legislature begins its next session in January, Mills will propose a supplemental budget that will include funding to help implement the law, though neither the source nor how much she’s requesting is yet known. Per state law, approved ballot questions that require funding to implement take effect 45 days after the convening of the next Legislative session. 
Question 1, which sought several changes to state election law, including requiring photo identification to be shown at the polls, was rejected by just over 315,000 Maine voters, according to the Secretary of State’s office. In contrast, 175,751 cast votes in support and just under 1,250 left their ballots blank.

Clay Higgins, R-La., speaks during the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee meeting at the U.S. Capitol on March 25, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana cast the lone vote Tuesday against a congressional measure to compel the release unclassified investigative files from the FBI’s case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But there is a possibility he could eventually support it, he said.
Higgins, an ultra-conservative Republican who lives in Lafayette, has consistently positioned his views alongside those of President Trump, who flipped his stance Sunday and encouraged lawmakers to approve the release of the Epstein files. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, followed suit, urging its passage after weeks of resisting bipartisan calls to bring the matter up for a vote.
In a post on the social media platform X, Higgins explained his decision to stand apart from his 427 House colleagues who approved the measure, saying that he had been “a principled ‘NO’ on this bill from the beginning.”
“What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today. It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America,” Higgins said. “As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc. If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote.”
Higgins added that the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, of which he is a member, is “conducting a thorough investigation that has already released well over 60,000 pages of documents from the Epstein case.”
“That effort will continue in a manner that provides all due protections for innocent Americans,” the congressman wrote. “If the Senate amends the bill to properly address privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a long-litigated case about the Florida High School Athletic Association’s refusal to let two private religious schools pray over the PA system before a 2015 game. 
On Monday, the top court denied Cambridge Christian School’s appeal, more than a year after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit sided with the association.
Private school’s pregame loudspeaker prayer lawsuit answered by appeals court

The case focuses on the 2015 state championship game between Cambridge and University Christian School in Orlando in which the association denied the schools’ request to pray before the game, saying the game was in a publicly financed facility and the association served as a state actor.
The appellate court concluded it would be reasonable for the public to assume that a prayer from an announcer under these circumstances constituted government-endorsed speech.
Cambridge Christian prays on the PA system before home games but defers to the home team when playing away games, the circuit court said. The teams held a pregame prayer before the 2015 championship game, although not through the PA system.
Cambridge Christian, located in Tampa, sought damages, a declaratory judgement, an injunction against future restrictions on pregame prayer, plus attorney’s fees.
In 2023, the Florida Legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis approved HB 225, which established, “The athletic association may not control, monitor, or review the content of the opening remarks and may not control the school’s choice of speaker.”

The announcement was immediately met with intense backlash from Democratic members of Congress, who questioned its legality, and labor unions. 
The agreements — with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State — come as Trump has sought to take an axe to the 46-year-old department in his quest to return education “back to the states.” 
The move further fulfills a pledge Trump heavily campaigned on and later tapped Education Secretary Linda McMahon to carry out. 
“The Trump Administration is taking bold action to break up the federal education bureaucracy and return education to the states,” McMahon said in a statement alongside the announcement. 
“As we partner with these agencies to improve federal programs, we will continue to gather best practices in each state through our 50-state tour, empower local leaders in K-12 education, restore excellence to higher education, and work with Congress to codify these reforms,” she added. 
The announcement also came as the U.S. Supreme Court in July allowed the Trump administration to temporarily proceed with mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Education Department ordered earlier this year.
That plan — outlined in a March executive order Trump signed — called on McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of her own department. 
How Education agreements will work 
The Education Department clarified in fact sheets it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs” regarding all six inter-agency agreements.
A senior department official could not yet say how many Education Department employees would be transitioning to these other agencies, and noted that there will be “a bit of a lag” between the signing and when the agreements are fully executed. 
The official said the department is “still exploring the best plan” for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services and Federal Student Aid.
The Department of Labor will take on a “growing role” in administering elementary and secondary education programs currently managed under the Education Department’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, per a fact sheet. 
In another agreement, the Labor Department will also take on a greater role in managing the Education Department’s higher education grant programs, such as TRIO and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP.
The Interior Department will also take on a “growing role” in administering the Education Department’s Indian Education programs, per a fact sheet. 
Under an agreement with HHS, that agency will oversee the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation’s work. 
HHS will also “manage existing competitions, provide technical assistance, and integrate” the Education Department’s Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program, the department said. 
The Education Department’s agreement with the State Department will let that agency “oversee all foreign education programs,” per a fact sheet. 
‘Outright illegal effort’
Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, blasted the move as an “outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education.” 
Murray said “it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened — or even completely broken — in the process.” 
Rachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education Department workers, said “this latest ploy by the Trump Administration to dismantle the Congressionally created U.S. Department of Education is not only unlawful — it’s an insult to the tens of millions of students who rely on the agency to protect their access to a quality education.” 
She added that “students, educators and families depend on the Department’s comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs” and “that national mission is weakened when its core functions are scattered across other federal or state agencies that are not equipped or positioned to provide the same support and services as ED staff.”

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced awards to 18 states and territories for Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment funding. The goal of that federal program is to increase internet availability throughout the country.
“Since this historic funding became available, my administration has been dedicated to making sure Montana remains a leader to secure the resources we need to deploy broadband services to Montanans in unserved and underserved areas,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a press release.
Montana’s Communications Advisory Commission approved the plan in August. That plan includes significant investment in internet service provided by Amazon and SpaceX’s StarLink. Neither company has responded to comment requests from the Daily Montanan regarding BEAD awards.
Some fiber optic companies have struggled with completing some projects, for a variety of reasons including issues with railroad companies.
Federal rules changed for the program, which led to something of a scramble, committee members said in August – the focus was on speed and scalability. The committee had about 90 days to resubmit a BEAD application, they said this summer.
“We were proud that Montana was the first state to open its BEAD application portal back on August 13, 2024, and are thrilled to again be one of the first states to receive NTIA approval to deploy BEAD funding,” Department of Administration Director Misty Ann Giles said in a Tuesday press release. “This long but critical process to connect our unserved and underserved Montanans has been worth it, and we are excited to get to work.”
The Governor’s office said the funding includes 19 service providers and 32 projects to serve more than 68,000 unserved and underserved “Broadband Serviceable Locations.” The locations are in addition to more than 180 community anchor institutions, which are places such as health service offices, high schools, police departments, fire departments, and libraries, the release stated.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kid-with-laptop-getty-1024x684-1-1.jpg,,,2025-11-18 15:58:37.915615

“This is a real victory for all library professionals who are trained to select age-appropriate, developmentally appropriate material for students in both public and private schools,” Gillian Wilcox, the ACLU of Missouri’s director of litigation, told The Independent. “It is a real insult to their training and professionalism for the government to think that it knows better what books belong in those schools, and it’s an insult to parents as well.”
The now-void law, passed by Missouri lawmakers in 2022, expanded the state’s regulations on pornography to create the offense of providing explicit sexual material to a student. It applied only to those “affiliated with a public or private elementary or secondary school in an official capacity.”
The law is part of a larger trend placing higher scrutiny on what books are offered by libraries and schools. In Missouri, efforts earlier this year to place new restrictions on digital libraries and expand the officials who could face prosecution were debated but did not pass.
“The ACLU has been seeing an increase in the last at least five years in book removal from school libraries and public libraries for a variety of reasons,” Wilcox said. “And it all culminated in this law being passed.”
Missouri rule takes effect putting library funds in jeopardy over ‘obscene’ material

The Missouri Association of School Librarians and Missouri Library Association, represented by Stinson LLP and the ACLU of Missouri, challenged the law in 2023 after “hundreds” of titles were removed from shelves.
“Librarians and school professionals statewide now assess prospective and existing titles in their collections based on fear, rather than expertise,” their attorneys wrote in July. “They have been reluctant, or have refused, to add new art, books, or even digital access to such materials that contain diverse or marginalized content or viewpoints, lest some unknown government official determine the work contains prohibited ‘explicit sexual material.’”
The state has long prohibited people from giving pornographic material to minors. The decades-old law uses a different definition of pornography, one that has been held up in courts as only prohibiting speech unprotected by the First Amendment.
But the 2022 law extends beyond that precedent, plaintiffs attorneys argued, impeding free speech rights.
The case was originally filed against county prosecutors but is currently being defended by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office.
Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Freedlund labeled librarians’ arguments as insufficient, since they hadn’t presented evidence of the law being enforced.
“Absent evidence of any instance of any defendant actually enforcing the law against any of plaintiffs’ members, plaintiffs can only raise hypothetical enforcement examples in their vagueness challenge — an approach Missouri courts have consistently rejected as facially insufficient to raise a vagueness challenge,” he wrote.
Circuit Court Judge J. Dale Youngs offered little insight into the basis of his decision in the brief ruling, though he acknowledged in a footnote that with his retirement coming at the end of the month, “time is a factor.” 
“Moreover, the court recognizes — now more than ever — its status as a ‘way station’ to the Supreme Court of Missouri,” Youngs wrote. “What the parties here need is a decision that can be fully and finally considered by an appellate court that — consistent with its standard of review — gives no deference to what this court thinks or why.”
Wilcox said the judge’s decision, while brief, shows large agreement with plaintiffs’ arguments.
“By granting our motion on all counts and denying the state, the court did agree with all of our legal arguments and found that there were undisputed facts supporting those arguments,” she said.
In the months leading up to summary judgment, “thousands of pages of documents were exchanged” in discovery.

The association said, in a letter addressed to county boards of supervisors, the case before the court “highlights the importance of local control” and “has the potential to impact all counties nationwide.” 
Iowa State Association of Counties is a nonprofit organization with elected and appointed officials from all 99 counties, with a mission to promote effective and efficient local government. 
Leadership with the county association were unable to share up-to-date figures Tuesday as to how many counties have pledged financial support on the amicus brief. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the letter, dated Oct. 20, 2025, it will cost the association $25,000 to submit the amicus brief to the court, which is why it is soliciting suggested donations of  $500 from counties to help “cover the cost.” 
The association submitted the brief, according to the docket, Nov. 6. 
The letter said the brief would be submitted on behalf of the association’s membership and would stress the importance of local control. The letter explained to supervisors that a brief can help the court to “better understand” different arguments and the importance of a case. The briefs can also help in “improving a case’s chance” of being taken up by the Supreme Court. 
Background on the case 
Story and Shelby counties were each sued by Summit Carbon Solutions — a company that seeks to build a carbon sequestration pipeline across Iowa and several other surrounding states – over local ordinances the counties enacted. 
The ordinances included setbacks from structures and local permitting requirements to which Summit would have to adhere to build its pipeline through the counties. 
The cases were combined as they worked through the courts. In June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, located in Omaha, ruled in favor of Summit and a lower court, that the counties could not impose safety standards on a pipeline that is subject to federal standards.  
The counties then petitioned the federal appeals court for a rehearing of the case, which was denied, before the county supervisors voted in August to take the issue up to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The letter to counties included a summary of the case from Timothy Whipple of Ahlers & Cooney in Des Moines. The summary said the counties seek the U.S. Supreme Court’s review of the case because the appellate court decision was “legally wrong and problematic.” 
The counties allege the decision was wrong because it inquired into the motives of county supervisors when they made the ordinances, created a “vague and unworkable standard” and created a “regulatory void.” 
At the center of these arguments, and of the Eighth Circuit Court’s decision, is whether or not state and local governments can consider safety when enacting ordinances or if they may enact safety standards. The summary of the suit said the appellate court’s ruling could “invalidate” a “wide range” of local ordinances. 
Additional counties in Iowa have also been sued by Summit over their ordinances, but those cases have been put on hold while Story and Shelby counties’ case plays out. 
Summit filed requests to resume the other county cases on the argument that regardless of the Supreme Court outcome, counties would be preempted by state law in Iowa from dictating pipeline routes. 
Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. 
The brief, submitted on behalf of the Iowa State Association of Counties, said Iowa counties exercise “home rule authority” to govern matters like land use. 
“Expansive federal preemption, especially when based on motive, threatens counties’ autonomy,” the brief said. “The Association has a strong interest in vindicating the legitimate policymaking discretion of home rule counties.” 
In addition to the association, the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, Preemption Law Professors and the states of Minnesota, Arizona, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon and Vermont, have submitted briefs in support of the counties’ request for a reevaluation of the case.

Altogether the company plans to add 252 jobs and invest $912 million at its plants in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri. The company plans to invest $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years, it said.
“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president, manufacturing operations, said in a news release Tuesday. “Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”
During a news conference Tuesday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey celebrated the expansion saying that it reflects confidence in West Virginia’s people, workforce and economy. 
“Toyota’s continued investment in West Virginia demonstrates that our workforce, business climate, and communities deliver real results for companies,” Morrisey said in a statement. “This investment, which creates 80 new jobs for hard working West Virginians, reflects a strong confidence in our people and in the strength of our economy.”
The jobs added in Putnam County will help the company increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators beginning in 2027, according to the release.

Nurses at the Houlton hospital, which are represented by Maine State Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee, are in the midst of renegotiating a contract after their last agreement expired in November 2024. 
The nurses say they are frustrated with the lack of progress in bargaining, particularly around the issue of having enough nurses working in each department to safely meet the needs of patients.
“Short staffing remains a critical challenge within our hospital,” said residential nurse Brooke Howland, in a press statement. 
Howland, who works in acute care, said her unit as well as the emergency department and operating room “are the foundation of patient care,” and each of those units “must be adequately staffed to ensure the delivery of safe, high-quality care.” 
She said additional patients are often assigned to acute care “without the necessary increase in staffing.” 
When asked about the request for additional staffing, a spokesperson for the hospital pointed to a letter from Chief Nursing Officer Traci Peabody, which notes that the hospital’s patient satisfaction scores and quality indicators meet or exceed the national average.
The hospital, which partnered with Northern Maine Medical Center in May, noted in a press statement that its employees are “among the lowest paid in the country” and the administration has “begun the process of increasing wages to market levels and improving benefits for all employees, including offering the nurses significantly higher increases than the union had originally requested.”
While hospitals across Maine and the country are “closing at an alarming rate and services are being eliminated,” Houlton Regional Hospital said it is hiring more staff and recently added several new units, including outpatient behavioral health, orthopedics, cardiology, urology, pain management, and two new primary care providers.
“Despite the union’s decision to strike, our focus remains on our patients and our community,” said Houlton Regional Hospital CEO Jeff Zewe. “I want to reassure everyone that our staffing levels meet or exceed national safety standards, as reflected in our strong quality outcomes.”
Nurse-to-patient staffing ratios have been an ongoing issue in the state. In 2024, a legislative proposal to establish minimum staffing requirements was shelved after initially passing the Maine Senate.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/71d45865-85d3-fe8e-bdae-ce55e16c4343-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-18 15:58:37.915615

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma Supreme Court justices on Tuesday questioned attorneys about the burdens of a new law that puts more restrictions on the process used to get issues on the ballot.
“At some point, the burdens pile up and it becomes an undue burden,” said Justice Noma Gurich.
People will not try to get things on the ballot with all of the additional burdens placed on the process by the new law, said Randall Yates, an attorney representing those who filed the lawsuit.
Last session, lawmakers passed and Gov. Kevin Stitt signed Senate Bill 1027, forcing initiative petition signature collectors to visit several Oklahoma counties rather than concentrate on high-population areas.
Those seeking to place items on the ballot, under the new law, are prohibited from paying circulators based on the number of signatures collected. It requires sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bars out-of-state interests from donating.
Petition circulators would have to be registered voters.
It requires a political appointee, the Secretary of State, to approve the gist, which is a brief summary of the ballot measure that voters see at the top of the signature sheet.
Yates asked the Court to toss out the law in its entirety, rather than remove the offending sections.
Randall Yates, an attorney representing plaintiffs in a legal challenge to a new law, argues his case Tuesday before the Oklahoma Supreme Court. (screenshot image)
The new law does not preserve the constitutional right of people to get issues on the ballot, but frustrates it at every opportunity, he said.
“It imposes county signature caps that deny the right to otherwise qualified Oklahoma voters,” Yates said. “It installs a government gatekeeper to control core political advocacy. It layers on restrictions in circulation, funding and reporting to make the process so burdensome that it would be unrecognizable to the founding generation.”
Gurich said she had a concern about letting the governor control the content of the gist.
Even before the law passed, Oklahoma had one of the most demanding processes in the nation, with higher signature requirements and the shortest circulation period of 90 days, Yates said.
In the past 25 years, only five laws out of 11 state questions brought by the process have been created, he said.
“Senate Bill 1027’s new provisions will only drive those numbers down.” Yates said.
Zach West, director of special litigation for the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office, said it is nearly undisputed that signature collectors spend little time outside the major metropolitan areas.

“It was eminently reasonable for the legislature to consider this discarding of suburban and rural Oklahoma as a major issue worth addressing with Senate Bill 1027,” West said.
The Oklahoma Constitution requires the legislature enact suitable regulations on the process, West said.
He said the new regulations were reasonable.
About 15 of the 25 states that have an initiative petition process use geographic restrictions, West said.
He said it is up to the Court to decide if the changes are suitable.
“We think it is very suitable, very reasonable,” West said.

Environmentalists want a judge to review the matter.,"Environmental advocates rallied at the Bayshore Waterfront Park in Port Monmouth on Sept. 9, 2025, against Williams Transco’s proposed natural gas pipeline, the Northeast Supply Enhancement, and urged Gov. Phil Murphy to halt the project. (Photo courtesy of Evan Leong)Environmentalists have asked a federal judge to review a key approval New Jersey regulators granted earlier this month that will allow an energy developer to proceed with a controversial $1 billion underwater natural gas pipeline project between New Jersey and New York.
Regulators in both states granted required water quality permits on Nov. 7 for the 37-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement project, despite growing opposition from environmentalists and previous permit denials in 2019 and 2020 over concerns the project would violate water quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as a coalition of New Jersey-based environmental groups, filed separate petitions in federal appeals court seeking review.
New Jersey’s Nov. 7 permit approval is “unjustifiable” because energy developer Williams, whose subsidiary Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company first proposed the pipeline in 2017, did not remedy the reasons for the denials when it applied for permits again last June, the groups said.
They warned the underwater segment of the proposed pipeline, which would run beneath the Raritan Bay in the New Jersey-New York Harbor, would endanger marine habitats and dredge up sediments contaminated with mercury, copper, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The pipeline also would threaten wetlands and the environment in Somerset County, where Williams wants to build a compressor station, and Middlesex and Monmouth counties, where it would link existing pipelines between Pennsylvania and New York City, the groups said.
“New Jersey’s approval completely disregards its prior, sound decision to reject this pipeline over threats to the state’s water quality. This pipeline will not only destroy wetlands across New Jersey, but also would tear up the sea floor of Raritan Bay,” the NRDC’s Jared Knicley said in a statement. “We’re taking New Jersey to court to enforce the state’s water quality standards, which are incompatible with building this harmful pipeline.”
Spokespeople for Williams did not respond to a request for comment. Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, declined to comment.
Christopher Miller is executive director of the Eastern Environmental Law Center, which filed a petition Tuesday on behalf of the NY/NJ Baykeeper, Princeton Manor Homeowners Association, Central Jersey Safe Energy Coalition, Food & Water Watch, New Jersey League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, and Sierra Club.
“New Jersey’s decision to approve NESE after repeatedly rejecting the same project is indefensible,” Miller said in a statement. “It wrongly puts the interests of the fossil fuel industry above the public interest in clean water.”

“As policymakers, our understanding of the issue is complicated by the rapid emergence of this complex technology, and, as we’ve seen with social media, short-term legislative choices can have serious long-term consequences.”
The memo notes that Perez has asked subcommittee chairs to “facilitate discussions on the potentially positive and negative impacts of the use of AI in their respective jurisdictions.”
The AI discussion will come in addition to other scheduled work for the week.
“I would encourage all of you to come that week prepared to engage in this important topic, and I hope you emerge at the end of the week with a more fully rounded perspective on what AI means for the future of Florida,” Perez wrote.

Josh Turek, candidates competing to become Iowa’s Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in 2026, announced new endorsements in the race Tuesday.
One of the endorsements for Wahls’ campaign came from the Democratic Mayor-elect of Council Bluffs. Jill Shudak, a Council Bluffs city council member serving her first term, defeated incumbent Mayor Matt Walsh, a Republican, in the Nov. 4 election.
Walsh was a longtime fixture in Council Bluffs politics, having served three terms as mayor and was previously on the city council since 1996. In recent election cycles, Council Bluffs has tended to support Republicans, voting for President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra in the 2024 election.

But Shudak beat the odds in the 2025 election, winning by 117 votes, according to the Iowa Secretary of State’s office. In a news conference announcing the endorsement Tuesday, Wahls said he was proud to have supported her mayoral campaign, linking her priorities in the local race with his own goals running for the U.S. Senate seat.
“She won that campaign by connecting with Iowans, addressing their needs on the twin crises of rising costs and the need to challenge the establishment,” Wahls said. “And she did it by challenging the status quo, standing toe to toe against a political machine that had had a lot of success in her community, but that felt increasingly out of touch. … When I’m in the U.S. Senate, I’ll work with Jill and any other leader in Iowa to stand up for our communities and fight for hard-working people.”
The endorsement is also notable because one of the other high-profile Democrats running for the nomination — Iowa Rep. Josh Turek — is from Council Bluffs. Turek, who represents Council Bluffs in the Iowa House, first won election to the House District 20 seat in 2022 by a margin of 6 votes, and won reelection in 2024 by 5 percentage points.
Shudak said she knows Turek personally and likes him, and that the endorsement is not a slight against the fellow Council Bluffs Democrat.
“This is not the endorsement against Josh Turek. This is an endorsement for Zach Wahls,” Shudak said. “And really it came down to me actually seeing Zach wanting and asking to talk to people from across the spectrum … I’ve watched him answer those tough questions, get put through the paces, and really, that’s what solidified it for me that I was going to be backing Zach in this one. However, if, you know, if Josh ends up being our nominee, I am happy to get behind him as well.”
Wahls’ campaign has also announced recent endorsements from politicians including former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, as well as several labor organizations, including Teamsters Local 90, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1846, Communications Workers of America Local 7110 and Ironworkers Locals 67, 89, and 111, as signs that his candidacy has strong support heading into the 2026 primary season.
“He’s a true friend of labor unions and working people across the state,” Shudak said. “He’s a strong supporter of mine and my successful election this year, and I’m proud to back him in this election.”
Turek also announced a list of new endorsements Tuesday, including former Lt. Gov. Sally Pederson, who served during former Gov. Tom Vilsack’s administration. Pederson said in a statement she believed Turek would be able to win back the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who said in September she is not running for reelection.
“I know that we can win this seat back, and I believe Josh is the one to do it. Iowa has not ‘gone red’ – we are still the same state that elected Tom Vilsack and Tom Harkin,” Pederson said. “2026 will be the year we take back our state, and I’m proud to support Josh as the candidate to do it.”
Pederson was one of 14 new endorsements announced Tuesday, alongside several of Turek’s House Democrat colleagues, including Reps. Elinor Levin, Ross Wilburn and Beth Wessel-Kroeschell. Their names join the list of endorsers including former Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, former Iowa Democratic Party Chair Sue Dvorsky and Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, who dropped out of the U.S. Senate race after Turek launched his campaign.
Other local leaders also offered their support for Turek’s campaign Tuesday. Mary Riche, board member for the Interfaith Alliance of Iowa and a reproductive health care advocate, said Turek “will be a powerful spokesperson for the state, a U.S. Senator that will make all Iowans proud” in a Tuesday statement.
“This election provides a generational opportunity that excites me and Josh is a proven winner,” Riche said. He’s the type of candidate we need to win this important seat. I’m endorsing Josh because I know he is a competitor, a champion, and a fighter for women, the working class, and for all Iowans.”
Alongside Wahls and Turek, Nathan Sage, former Knoxville chamber of commerce executive director, is also campaigning for the Democratic nomination. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who announced her candidacy shortly after Ernst said she would not run for reelection, in considered the GOP frontrunner for the seat. Hinson has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and several other major Republican leaders in Congress.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation in both the U.S. Senate and House are pushing legislation to repeal a provision of the funding bill that reopened the government last week they say unjustly riches U.S. Senate Republicans.
The provision  makes it a violation for federal law enforcement to acquire senators’ electronic data without their knowledge. Each “violation” would be entitled to $500,000.
As previously reported, the provision is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2022, and would thus apply to the eight senators whose cell phone records were subpoenaed during a 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the senators to whom the provision would apply, told reporters previously he would “definitely” be filing a lawsuit after the new provision becomes law.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and U.S. Sen.Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), introduced on Tuesday the Anti-Cash Grab Act, which would repeal the provision.
“While Democrats were fighting to make health care more affordable and help working families put food on the table, Senate Republicans were focused on taxpayer-funded windfalls for themselves,” Heinrich said in a statement about his bill. “Let’s be crystal clear: negotiating a $500,000 windfall for yourself while refusing to help everyday Americans is wrong and deserves to be called out.” A summary of the bill’s text notes that it “does not preclude making legitimate reforms to notification requirements in future, separate legislation.”
All of New Mexico’s delegation voted against the government funding bill, citing Republicans’ refusal to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits, which was the sticking point of the partisan negotiations. 
Also on Tuesday, Democratic U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, introduced the No Payola Act, which both repeals the provision and requires any senator who receives money under the provision before its repeal to return the funds.
“This Senate payola provision is corruption of the highest degree dressed up as legislation,” Leger Fernández said in a statement. “The Senate refused to help working families afford their health insurance premiums but inserted a secret payday for themselves. Corruption is contagious and the carrier of the disease is Trump who has used his Presidency to enrich himself and his family to the tune of at least $500,000 each. These Senators wanted in on the grift. No other American receives a payout of millions if their phone records were reviewed under a lawful grand jury or court order.”
Both bills have multiple sponsors. In the U.S. House, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said he would bring a bill to repeal the provision.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_7797-1024x698.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 15:58:37.915615

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)It has been months since New Hampshire passed its state budget, and the status of $15 million appropriated for child care employers remains a point of confusion, including for lawmakers.
During the two-year budget process earlier this year, Gov. Kelly Ayotte proposed a series of spending reductions due to declining tax revenues. Among the cuts was $15 million that in the previous biennial budget had been appropriated to the Department of Health and Human Services for “the purpose of financing recruitment and retention bonus benefits and grants for New Hampshire child care employers.”
The loss of funding could have a detrimental impact on the child care industry, which is already struggling with low wages and a workforce shortage across the state. Child care employers used this money to help recruit new staff; for employee bonuses, professional development, and staff training; and to ensure employment eligibility, since in New Hampshire you must have specific certifications to be left alone with children under age 5.
So lawmakers offered a compromise: What if the state used extra federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, funds to help child care employers, rather than state general funds, as they had previously done? 
TANF is a federal program designed to help low-income families with children achieve “economic security and stability,” according to the federal Administration of Children and Families. Through the program, states receive grants to help design and operate programs that fall under TANF’s statutory purposes. 
According to Phil Sletten, research director at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the state receives about $38 million in TANF funds from the federal government every year. Thirty percent of the money is transferred to programs such as the Child Care Development Fund and the state’s Child Care Scholarship Program. A separate amount is also placed into a reserve savings fund each year, and the legislators proposed pulling money from there to fund the $15 million for child care employers. 
“Currently in New Hampshire law, there is a TANF backstop that a portion of TANF funds are set aside to make sure that those dollars are available in case the state runs out of [money] that supports the Child Care Scholarship Program,” Sletten said. “It hasn’t been needed in 15 years or so.” 
The allotted funds for child care employers would require approval, however, since that expenditure does not align with one of TANF’s statutory purposes. The Legislature passed the budget in June knowing it would need to ask for it, and so the law states that funding is “contingent upon the department seeking formal approval from the federal Department of Health and Human Services to use the funds for the purposes specified.”
The state Department of Health and Human Services was required by law to send its letter with the request by Aug. 1. 
“During the legislative session, there was a lot of advocacy around the $15 million,” said Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, a Concord Democrat, who serves on the House Finance Committee. “Providers had the funds to help their workforce and address workforce issues in the last biennium. Without the $15 million, that’s a real backsliding for the child care community.”
Before the federal government responded, state Department of Health and Human Services officials were skeptical that the state’s proposed funding method would work. Karen Herbert, director of the department’s economic stability division, said in a meeting with child care stakeholders in June that the department anticipated the federal government would not allow the funds to be used. 
“It’s a complicated funding program and even the rules around it can be very complicated,” she said. “But we will get through it, and we will do the best that we can.” 
 The federal government’s response last month confirmed those fears. 
On Oct. 2, Herbert received an email from Kisha Russell, a regional program manager for the Administration for Children and Families, the federal Health and Human Services agency responsible for allocating TANF funds.  
Russell wrote that TANF funds put into the Child Care Development Fund “can be used for child care worker bonuses and other retention activities.” However, Russell also wrote “it is not clear” to the agency “how recruitment and retention bonuses for New Hampshire child care employers meet a TANF purpose.” 
Jake Leon, director of communications for the state Department of Health and Human Services, said the Administration for Children and Families confirmed it “is not an allowable use” to use TANF funds to pay child care providers staff bonuses, although the department can continue to transfer TANF funds to support the development fund. 
“Funding childcare recruitment and retention initiatives does not fall into one of the four purposes of the TANF program specified in federal law,” Leon wrote in an email. 
The $15 million in funding is now in limbo, however Leon said the department is “committed” to growing the child care workforce in New Hampshire by working with community colleges and universities, nonprofits, and private-sector partners. 
The budget does not outline what the next steps would be in the event the federal government rejected the state plan. To address this, Wallner is proposing a bill next legislative session to find the money elsewhere. 
“I thought that it would be a good idea that we at least bring forth a piece of legislation that would say if the federal government answers back, ‘No, you cannot use the funds that way,’ or never answer … we would then use general funds for the $15 million,” Wallner said.

Credit: Related DigitalFollowing up on a request by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, the regulatory body overseeing Michigan energy companies announced on Tuesday that it would hold a public hearing to take comments on DTE Electric Co.’s application to approve contracts to supply power to a data center project in Saline Township. 
The Michigan Public Service Commission will hold the hearing on Wednesday, Dec. 3, between 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. on Microsoft Teams. Participants can join through the meeting’s Microsoft Teams link or by dialing 1-248-509-0316 and entering the conference ID 593258092# when prompted.
DTE filed an ex-parte request with the commission on Oct. 31, seeking the commission’s approval to provide 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center announced a day earlier. The project is being developed in Saline Township by Oracle, Chat GPT creator Open AI and Related Digital following a legal battle between Related Digital and the host community over the township board’s vote against rezoning the land for the project. 
On Nov. 6, Nessel filed a notice with the public service commission, asking the regulatory body to take public testimony on the matter and to treat the matter as a contested case, as the type of request DTE filed does not carry public hearing requirements.
While Dan Scripps, the chair of the public service commission, said the hearing will add an important element of transparency in evaluating DTE’s request and ensuring costs from the project are not borne by other ratepayers, Nessel argued the commission has failed to allow for meaningful intervention and review of the contracts.
“Without formal hearings and a contested case declaration, this alone would amount to little more than performative listening rather than thorough public scrutiny,” Nessel said in a statement. “I am concerned that the [commission] has yet to respond to my request to intervene and hold true hearings, and I am fearful that today’s announcement signals they have no intention to hold the formal hearings our residents and ratepayers deserve.

You can read more about the section here.

After reading about Katina Rankin’s “degrading” hospital stay, I felt compelled to do three things: (1) offer her my sincerest apologies, (2) share my perspective from a family member of a patient who was recently in two Mississippi hospitals and (3) propose a cost-effective solution to keeping our hospitals open. 
Ms. Rankin, thank you for sharing your story. You stated that you almost did not write about your experience, but I am so thankful that you did. It gave me, and I am sure others, a very candid picture of what it felt like to be in your shoes.  
When you shared that you “dragged” yourself to the restroom after waiting 15 minutes after pressing the call button for assistance, I visualized that scene and felt your distress. While you did not get the care that you deserved, I am respectfully answering your call by first saying that I am truly sorry about your experience. While our health care system has problems, it also has the potential to be greater, and it will take courageous patients like you to share their stories to strengthen our hospitals, not tear them down.  
Not to belittle Ms. Rankin’s experience, but I must share a completely different perspective after spending over two months in the hospital with my aunt.  It is important to note that our experiences are mutually exclusive of illness and other circumstances.  However, both are based on our own personal interactions and observations, which shaped our realities.  
On Aug. 23, my reality was that my aunt was critically injured in a car accident that took the life of her sister. That evening, my aunt was airlifted to a Level 1 trauma center where she was placed on life support. At this very critical and early stage of her care, there was nothing that the doctors or nurses could do other than pray, keep her comfortable and provide regular updates on findings from her lab work, scans and X-rays, which they did with intellect, grace and compassion.

Once my aunt was able to tolerate being off the ventilator for several hours, she was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital where her care and recovery were remarkable.  
As soon as I entered this hospital, I was visually reminded of the true healer in health care by Bible scriptures on the walls, including the 23rd Psalm, which reads, “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”  
Considering that my aunt was indefinitely confined to a hospital bed, I did not want her progress to be further complicated by pressure sores. Thanks to the attention, skill and compassion shown by her staff, she did not develop any ulcers in her over two-month hospital stay.  
Each time I pressed the call button for assistance, within five minutes, either a nurse or an aide arrived to help. It is important to note that their response and care were without their knowledge of my background in health care.
Ms. Rankin stated that she waited for 15 minutes after pressing the call button for help. Although there is no universal standard for response times after a call button has been pressed, a 2012 study by “BMC Health Services Research” found that the quicker the response time, the lower the rates of falls and associated injuries.  
Considering that Ms. Rankin carried her IV pole with her to the restroom, and further, with an unspecified neurological condition, those responsible for her care would have a lot of cleaning up to do had she fallen.  
Ms. Rankin identified several problems during her hospitalization, including personal cell phone use by hospital staff. A 2024 study published in “Hospital Topics” found that personal cell phone usage by nurses “is a barrier to effective nursing care in hospitals.” This risk also opens the door to medical malpractice lawsuits when patient safety is compromised; a problem that we do not need, especially when so many of our hospitals have closed and others are at risk of closing. 
Ms. Rankin also found that compassion and communication skills among the hospital staff were lacking. Additionally, she characterized emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient.  A 2025 overview of EQ by “Cleveland Clinic” explains that this quotient allows us to “respond and interact with others in a way that’s honest, reflective and respectful,” components that Ms. Rankin says were also missing during her hospital stay.
Patients such as Ms. Rankin have every right to report these and other weaknesses within our health care settings. However, we must use these experiences to strengthen our health care system so that all Mississippians can receive exceptional health care that will put us at the top, not the bottom of national rankings.   
As a family member of a patient of two Jackson-based hospitals that graciously aided in her recovery, I have hope that we are still the “City with Soul,” although with the unfortunate experiences of Ms. Rankin, it may not always be so obvious.  
As we have learned from Ms. Rankin, our health care system does need improvement, such as health care workers responding efficiently and therapeutically to the needs of their patients. What was a “degrading” experience for her, just may be the defining moment for health care providers to develop a universal response time to call button activations.  
Perhaps, the optimal response time could be five minutes or less as in the case with my aunt. However, further research is needed to develop evidence-based practices.  
Ms. Rankin, based on my answer to your call, I hope that it is clear that you and all Mississippians are important to me and that our hospitals need both patients and providers to survive. Again, I am sorry about your negative hospital stay experience and you have my prayers for a full recovery.  
We’re all a part of God’s body. The act of fostering compassion, emotional intelligence, and therapeutic communication does not cost a thing to start making small but significant improvements in our complex health care system.  
The transformation that we seek will also require others sharing their stories, whether positive or negative to move Mississippi forward.

The agents wore uniforms marked with the insignias of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI. 
An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that its officers and partners served a search warrant “in furtherance of a federal criminal investigation.” 
“There is no threat to public safety, and the investigation remains ongoing at this time,” the statement said.

One witness told the Reformer that she saw at least two people zip tied and loaded into a van by agents. The witness requested that her name be withheld for fear of retribution. 
A call to Bro-Tex had not been returned at the time of publication. 
At around 9 a.m., agents marked off a large perimeter around Bro-Tex with crime scene tape. Protesters chanted messages expressing opposition to ICE, and heckled agents, most of whom were masked. 
As the officers attempted to leave the scene, protesters linked arms to block their vehicles. Agents shot chemical irritants into the crowd, and in some cases, pepper sprayed protesters in the face. Some officers exited their vehicles to shove protesters out of the way, and drivers forced their way through the crowd, pushing some people to the ground with their vehicles.

“Community doesn’t want this blatant show of force — this blatant show of cruelty — and we want answers. We want accountability,” said Miguel Hernandez, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which runs a rapid response network to mobilize anti-ICE protesters when raids happen.
During a visit to Minnesota last month, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said thousands of newly hired ICE agents would be deployed around the country in the coming weeks, including in St. Paul. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the GOP megalaw signed on July 4, more than tripled ICE’s budget.
Notably absent from the scene was the St. Paul Police Department; after a similar raid and community response in Minneapolis over the summer, immigrant rights advocates have criticized the Minneapolis Police Department for providing crowd control while ICE executed a search warrant. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter chatted with protesters after the agents dispersed. 
“Though we don’t have many details right now, I share the concern and fear this raises for our workers, families and entire community,” Carter said in a statement posted to social media. 
He added: “Our officers will help de-escalate situations when possible. And they do not wear face coverings.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NN251118_0137-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, a Trump appointee, ordered the implementation of Remedial Plan 3, which Secretary of State Wes Allen, the defendant in the case, said was the “least bad of several bad options” in October to allow Black voters an opportunity to pick their preferred leaders in Senate Districts 25 and 26. The plaintiffs in the case said that the map was the “weakest remedy” to Manasco’s August ruling.

“Ultimately, the record makes clear that Remedial Plan 3 unpacks District 26 by reassigning some Black voters to District 25 such that both districts are Black opportunity districts,” Manasco wrote. “The court thus finds that Remedial Plan 3 completely remedies the unlawful vote dilution the court found in the Enacted Plan.”

Monday was the recommended deadline by Secretary Allen for a map to be implemented to be used for the 2026 midterm elections. 
The current map was drawn after the 2020 census. The state Senate map is one of two maps that were challenged in court due to Section 2 violations, in which plaintiffs argued that the drawing of the maps made it impossible for Black voters to have a meaningful voice in elections. Alabama’s congressional districts were challenged in 2021, ultimately leading to the redrawing of the 2nd Congressional District, currently represented by U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile.
A federal judge ruled that the current State Senate districts in the Montgomery area violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. (Map from court documents)
Manasco ruled in August that Alabama’s Senate maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
“The court orders the use of a remedial map that was prepared race-blind and affords Black voters in the Montgomery area an equal opportunity, but certainly not a guarantee, to elect Senators of their choice,” Manasco wrote in the Monday court filing.
Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively. She ordered a second district in Montgomery that had a 50% Black voting age population, or something close to it. 
After multiple check-ins with Manasco and lawyers with both sides, Gov. Kay Ivey said in September that she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a similar case in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana, in which the justices are considering whether majority-minority districts are constitutional. A ruling is expected by next summer.
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the Special Master, recommended two maps to remedy the VRA violation.
The special master recommended three maps, with two being what he thought was best. Should the U.S. Supreme Court rule for Louisiana in the Callais case, Alabama’s 2nd and 7th congressional districts — represented by Figures and U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham — could be placed in jeopardy. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling of a lower court panel, which included Manasco, that Alabama’s congressional maps denied Black voters a proper say in their governance, and ordered new ones drawn.
Each party has 30 days to appeal Manasco’s order.
Davin Rosborough, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon that his team has not discussed Manasco’s order yet and declined to comment further.
“I believe that the map that was ordered yesterday, regardless of any appeals, is what’s going to go into place next year,” Rosborough said.
Secretary Allen declined to comment on the litigation and referred to the Attorney General’s office. A message seeking comment from it was left Tuesday afternoon.

The special master’s maps

Remedial Plan 3 was not the special master’s recommendation. The map extends Senate District 25 into southern Montgomery and extends Senate District 26 into Elmore County, which is currently in District 25.
Remedial Plan 1 provides a weaker remedy to the Voting Rights Act violation than Remedial Plan 2, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)
Remedial Plan 2 aligns more with the current State Senate districts and provides a better Voting Rights Act remedy, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)
Remedial Plan 3 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.1% in Senate District 25 and 66.1% to 43.9% in Senate District 26. 
The special master recommended either Remedial Plan 1 or 2.
Remedial Plan 1 reallocates South Montgomery in Senate District 26 to Senate District 25, leaving a tail of the south-western portion of Montgomery County in District 26. The northern part of the district is extended into Elmore County, which is currently in Senate District 30 represented by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville.
Remedial Plan 1 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 49.7% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 20% in Senate District 30. 
The second map, Remedial Plan 2, completely reallocates the southern portion of District 26 to District 25. It also extends northward into District 30, but not as far. 
Remedial Plan 2 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 53.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 48.3% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 19.1% in Senate District 30.
According to Manasco’s order, Remedial Plan 3 should be used for the 2026 and 2030 midterm elections, as well as any special elections in Senate Districts 25 or 26.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL_Senate_023-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

The U.S. Supreme Court has set a date for a hearing on Idaho’s transgender athletics ban.
The court will hear arguments on Jan. 13. The hearing — and the court’s ruling, likely to come later in 2026 — will resonate well beyond Idaho, and mark a pivotal moment in the national debate over transgender athletics.
Idaho was the first state in the nation to pass a law banning transgender athletes from playing in women’s and girls’ sports. But the 2020 law has been mired in the courts since then, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has blocked it from going into effect.
The state of Idaho appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear Idaho’s case. A hearing date hadn’t been set until last week.
But some legal maneuvering continues to surround the case.
Lindsay Hecox, the transgender Boise State University student who has fought the Idaho law, has asked the Supreme Court to drop the matter. Hecox argues that the case is moot, because she is focused on graduating college and has no plans to play in women’s sports. The state has opposed her motion to close the case.
Last month, Chief U.S. District Court Judge David Nye kept the case open in Idaho’s federal court, rejecting Hecox’s motion to drop the matter.
Since Idaho passed its transgender athletics ban five years ago, 26 other states have followed suit.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)After New Hampshire banned surprise ambulance billing this year, the state is set to undergo a cost study on how much ambulance providers should charge for their services.
Senate Bill 245, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte in late July, bans the practice of surprise ambulance billing starting Jan. 1. Surprise billing, also known as balance billing, happens when an ambulance costs more than the patient’s insurer is willing to pay and the patient is billed, often unexpectedly, for the remainder.
Notably, the bill also sets the rate providers are allowed to charge. Throughout the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers fiercely debated what the rate should be. SB 245, which was sponsored by state Sen. Sue Prentiss, a West Lebanon Democrat, beat out several competing bills with different ideas on how to determine that rate. It set the rate at 325% of the federal Medicare rate, which varies depending on the location and other factors, for the first two years. After those two years, the legislation instructs the state Insurance Department to set a new, updated rate based on an actuarial study that takes into account inflation and other market factors.
During its meeting Wednesday, the New Hampshire Executive Council approved a contract with the RAND Corporation, an economic policy institute based in California, to complete the study at a cost of $400,000.
“We found a good partner, we believe,” Insurance Commissioner D.J. Bettencourt told councilors at the meeting, “that has a lot of experience to be able to do that work so that when we come back when the temporary rates sunset in two years we’re going to have hard actuarial numbers that we’ll be able to put into statute.”
The state has done a study like this before. In 2024, the Insurance Department hired Public Consulting Group LLC, a consulting firm, to conduct a similar study. The study was released in January and recommended a rate of 202% the Medicare rate. One of the competing bills to SB 245, House Bill 316, sponsored by Rindge Republican Rep. John Hunt earlier this year, used that rate in addition to banning surprise billing. That bill was lambasted by ambulance providers who wanted a higher rate. In response to the backlash, lawmakers approved SB 245 and its significantly higher rate.
At the time of the bill’s passage, Prentiss said she believed that the new study will come up with a higher rate despite the fact that the previous study was much lower. Ayotte called the rate a good compromise and said she’s glad the bill calls for a new study to update the rate based on evolving market factors.
It’s unclear if the RAND Corporation’s study will use the same methodology as Public Consulting Group LLC’s.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EMSWorkersatSB245Signing-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

Kennedy, members of New Mexico's congressional delegation said Head Start sites in 18 states and Puerto Rico ""have already been forced to halt operations and close their doors."" (Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)The New Mexico congressional delegation on Monday called for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to release November grant reimbursements to Head Start programs, including three of the state’s Tribal Head Start programs.
Head Start is a federally funded program that provides early education, early screening, meals and supports families. Due to the recent federal government shutdown and prior funding delays, New Mexico Tribal Head Start Programs Raman Navajo School Board, Alamo Navajo School Board and San Felipe Pueblo did not receive their federal grant reimbursements for Fiscal Year 2026 on Nov. 1. 
In a letter sent to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the New Mexico delegation asked for the department to send grant notifications and reimbursements to programs affected during this grant cycle across the country. 
“As of November 5th, Head Start sites in 18 states and Puerto Rico have already been forced to halt operations and close their doors,” the letter reads. The letter further points out that programs struggling to remain open to children may make cuts elsewhere, such as in staffing, transportation and operating hours. “Still others had to take out loans or use reserve funds, which have placed them in financial risk and strain already limited resources.”
The delegation also requested that the HHS maintain communication with Head Start grantees so the local programs can plan and sustain “essential services.”
The letter noted that about 60,000 U.S. children were impacted by the lapse in funding, including more than 250 New Mexico children supported by the three Tribal Head Start Programs.
According to the New Mexico Early Childhood Education Department, more than 7,800 children were served by Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Fiscal Year 2024. There were also 20 active Tribal Head Start and Early Head Start programs in the same time frame.
Last month, U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) introduced the Every Child Deserves a Head Start Act to protect Head Start from calls to eliminate it, as well as restore the programs’ regional offices. 
“Affordable, accessible childcare is a critical lifeline for working families in New Mexico,” the delegation’s letter reads. “Head Start programs play an indispensable role in delivering high-quality early learning, health, and family well-being services that are especially vital in underserved and low-income communities.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/preschoolchildren-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden launched a campaign to keep his job with an expression of his philosophy.
“Good policy makes good politics,” he said.
The comment came during remarks Tuesday at the Hotel Alex Johnson in downtown Rapid City, where Rhoden formally announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for governor next year in the June 2 primary election.
He has competition from three other declared candidates for the party’s nomination: U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, businessman Toby Doeden and state House Speaker Jon Hansen.
Rhoden was elevated from lieutenant governor in January when Noem resigned to become secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security. Since then, while serving the remainder of Noem’s second term, Rhoden has been attempting to prove his policy-over-politics mantra.

During the legislative session that ended in March, Rhoden stepped into a long-running controversy over a company’s proposed carbon capture pipeline through South Dakota. He signed a bill into law that bans such pipelines from using a legal process known as eminent domain to gain access to privately owned land.
He also proposed and convinced legislators to pass legislation containing multiple methods for slowing property tax increases. And he shut down Noem’s effort to build a prison on a strongly opposed location in rural Lincoln County, instead opting to appoint a task force that ultimately selected a site in Sioux Falls and won legislative approval for a $650 million project.
Rhoden said Tuesday that his policy efforts have succeeded because legislative leaders know he’s sincere about putting politics second.
“Even leaders want to be led, but they want to be led by somebody they trust,” he said. “And I think I’ve developed that reputation.”
Rhoden’s efforts have put him in a competitive position. An October poll of registered Republican voters commissioned by South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy found Johnson with 28% support, followed by Rhoden with 27%, Doeden with 15% and Hanson with 10%, plus about 20% of respondents who were undecided.
Johnson came into the race as the presumed favorite, having served four terms in Congress and built up campaign funds in excess of $6 million from his prior races. The funding status of the other candidates is unknown, because they don’t have a reporting deadline until January.

In response to a question from South Dakota Searchlight about Rhoden’s announcement, Johnson sent a statement saying Rhoden has been “a worthy caretaker for South Dakota.”
“However, the next 20 years could be the best in our state’s history,” Johnson said. “That is going to take energy, vision and a real plan. That is what I’m offering in this race.”
Doeden called himself the only “outsider” in the race.
“Their faces and names are different, but Larry Rhoden and Dusty Johnson are one and the same: career politicians that answer to big donors, special-interest groups, and the rich and powerful,” Doeden said.
Hansen avoided mentioning his opponents by name.
“If you want to vote for the proven conservative Republican fighter who will put you and your family first again, I am the only candidate in this race for you,” Hansen said.

To beat Johnson, Doeden and Hansen, the 66-year-old Rhoden will have to do something he’s never done: win his own statewide campaign. Rhoden was twice elected as lieutenant governor while he was Noem’s running mate, but when he ran in a five-way race for the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat in 2014, he finished a distant second to former Gov. Mike Rounds, who went on to win the general election.
Rhoden is a rancher and welder from rural Union Center, a sparsely populated area about 45 miles east of Sturgis where he grew up. He and his wife, first lady Sandy Rhoden, have four grown sons and seven grandchildren.
Rhoden was elected to the state Legislature in 2000 and served for 16 years before becoming lieutenant governor. After he ascended to the governor’s office, Rhoden chose Tony Venhuizen — who was representing Sioux Falls in the Legislature at the time — as his lieutenant governor.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., gathered enough signatures on a discharge petition to override leadership.

The Louisiana Republican told reporters at his regular House leadership press conference that the “forcing mechanism here prevents the very deliberate, professional, careful manner in which Congress is supposed to do this.”“But having now forced the vote, none of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,” Johnson said.The vote comes less than a week after lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released some 20,000 pages of emails from Epstein’s estate that repeatedly mentioned Trump’s name. In one email from Epstein to convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier and sex offender claimed Trump “knew about the girls.”Trump denies any involvement with Epstein’s alleged crimes, and has said that he kicked Epstein out of his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, because he alleged the financier had poached young female staffers from the club. Epstein was convicted in Florida of soliciting minors for sex in 2008. During a press conference in the Oval Office Tuesday alongside the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump told reporters, “As far as the Epstein files, I have nothing to do with Jeffery Epstein. I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.”Trump added, as he has repeatedly said before, that the files are a “Democratic hoax.”Stories of abuse Women who told stories of being abused by Epstein as teens rallied outside the U.S. Capitol Tuesday morning, alongside Massie, Khanna and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whom Trump attacked online this weekend, nicknaming her a “traitor.”Haley Robson, who has prominently shared her account of sexual abuse by Epstein, said that as a Republican herself, the advocacy from Massie and Greene is “unbelievable to watch, and we are so grateful.”“And to the president of the United States of America, who is not here today, I want to send a clear message to you: While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I'm grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can't help to be skeptical of what the agenda is,” Robson said.

In a Sunday night post on his own social media platform, Trump told Republicans to vote in favor of the bipartisan legislation Tuesday, which lawmakers have named the Epstein Files Transparency Act.Greene, who also spoke at the press conference, said the administration’s refusal to release what are collectively referred to as the Epstein files “has ripped MAGA apart.”“The only thing that will speak to the powerful, courageous women behind me is when action is actually taken to release these files, and the American people won't tolerate any other b- - - -t,” Greene said.GOP Reps.

If you or a loved one are in crisis, help is available 24 hours a day by dialing 988 or visiting 988hotline.org.WASHINGTON — A bill is heading to President Donald Trump’s desk compelling the release of unclassified investigative files from the case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a friend to the rich and powerful who died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.Senate Republicans on Tuesday night did not object to a unanimous consent request from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept and pass the legislation, as is, after the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved the measure earlier in the day.A senior administration official told States Newsroom the president will sign the bill “whenever it gets to the White House.”The lawmakers in the lower chamber voted 427-1 to compel the Department of Justice to release materials related to the government’s investigation of the financier who harmed over 1,000 victims, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was the lone “no” vote.Survivors and their supporters watched the vote from the chamber’s gallery seats. Among them was Sky Roberts, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre, who sued Epstein’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and the British royal family’s Andrew Windsor, who recently was stripped of his title of prince. Giuffre died by suicide in April.“I'm very happy with the outcome, but this is just the beginning, and we have a lot of work ahead of us, a lot more to do,” Haley Robson told States Newsroom in an interview after the vote. Robson is prominent among those who have shared their stories of abuse by Epstein.The bill now goes to Trump, who said Monday he will sign it.‘Courage and advocacy’ of survivors citedSchumer, a New York Democrat, wrote on social media earlier the vote would “not have been possible without the courage and advocacy of Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors. They made this vote possible. They risked their safety coming out of the darkness to share their stories and to tell the truth.”Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said earlier Tuesday he expected the bill to move through the Senate “fairly quickly” and likely without changes, according to reporting by CNN.The legislation compels the Justice Department to publicly disclose “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or Maxwell.” They include records related to Epstein’s detention and death; flight logs from Epstein’s planes; names of those connected with Epstein’s alleged crimes; records of civil settlements, and sealed and unsealed immunity deals and plea bargains; records pertaining to entities with ties to Epstein’s trafficking or financial networks; and internal DOJ communications “concerning decisions to investigate or charge Epstein or his associates.” The bill carves out exceptions for records containing victims’ identities, images of death or physical abuse, and information that could jeopardize a federal investigation. The bill also notes that the “DOJ may not withhold or redact records on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.”Trump, Johnson oppositionTrump and House Speaker Mike Johnson opposed the House effort to release the files until this week.Johnson said Tuesday morning that he will vote for the measure that has been forced to the floor after Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., gathered enough signatures on a discharge petition to override leadership.

Ralph Norman, R-S.C., is underway to formally reprimand Plaskett for texting with Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing that featured testimony from Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. News of the text exchange was originally published by the Washington Post.The official censure would remove Plaskett from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. A vote was expected Tuesday night.Plaskett defended herself on the House floor Tuesday afternoon, saying, ""We all know that Jeffrey Epstein's actions were absolutely reprehensible as a constituent, as an individual who gave donations to me. When I learned of the extent of his actions after his investigation, I gave that money to women's organizations in my community.""Stories of abuse Women who told stories of being abused by Epstein as teens rallied outside the U.S. Capitol Tuesday morning, alongside Massie, Khanna and Rep.

Smith will be succeeded by Stratton Politzer, the organization’s co-founder and deputy director, according to a press release issued Monday by Equality Florida.
“It has been the honor of a lifetime to help build Equality Florida into the most impactful statewide LGBTQ organization in the nation. Together, we have created a movement that has changed laws, saved lives, and inspired hope across our state, and served as a blueprint nationwide,” Smith said in a written statement.
“I step into this next chapter carrying Florida with me. I will remain rooted in this state, and my commitment to Equality Florida is forever. We’ve told the country for years that Florida is the front line, and you don’t abandon the front line in a fight. I’ll continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with this team and this movement.”
Politizer co-founded Equality Florida with Smith in the 1990s. The organization says that under the two of them, Equality Florida has grown into the largest LGBTQ civil rights organization in the state, with nearly half a million members. He says the group was built on the principle “that no single person defines our movement.”

“From the beginning, Nadine and I created an organization designed to endure, to stress-test leadership, to build a deep bench of talent, and to ensure that our team could thrive through any challenge,” he said. “We have never been stronger, more unified, or more ready for the fights ahead.”
Smith will begin her new duties with Color of Change on Jan. 12, 2026.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Maine regulators on Tuesday rejected Central Maine Power’s proposed rate increase, saying the private utility needs to resubmit a plan that takes into greater consideration long term resilience planning and the impact on ratepayers.
Public Utilities Commission Chair Phil Bartlett said during a hearing Tuesday the state is at an “inflection point.”
“We have real mounting concerns around affordability,” he said. “We have a new grid planning, which is designed to help us better assess and think about how the utilities are building out their system and modernizing their grid. And we’re also really trying to ramp up the use of more performance incentives to drive the kind of outcomes for customers.” 
This proposal, he added, “misses the mark in terms of meeting the moment that we’re at.”
While the three commission members opted to dismiss the request, Bartlett said the commission would provide CMP, one of Maine’s two private utility companies, guidance for developing another plan.
He said the dismissal does not mean a rate increase will not be considered in the future, nor that CMP’s proposed system investments are unnecessary. 
The proposal drew significant pushback from ratepayers and advocates who said Mainers, especially seniors and low-income households, can’t afford another increase when the cost of living is already so high.
Maine Public Advocate Sanborn said the commission’s decision “reflects the fact that Mainers were very engaged and spoke out about the unaffordability of CMP’s proposal.” 
In statements released Tuesday, she and other public officials commended the utility regulators for rejecting the proposal. 
“At a time when thousands of Maine people are already struggling to afford their electric bills,” she said, “CMP’s plan simply asked for far too much.”
In September, Gov. Janet Mills directed the Maine Department of Energy Resources to request the commission dismiss the request, arguing that CMP can’t prove the proposed rates meet the standard of being “just and reasonable” without first seeing the 10-year integrated grid plan the power company is supposed to file with the commission in January. 
In a statement, Mills called CMP’s request “outrageous.” 
“While strengthening the grid is important and much needed, CMP’s request – the largest ever in Maine history – was excessive and completely out of touch with the economic reality facing Maine people,” Mills said. 
The plan would have increased rates for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. About half of that increase, or $17, would have been felt as soon as October 2026. The proposal also would have resulted in increased profits for company shareholders.
In a statement after the hearing, Rebecca Schultz, climate and clean energy senior advocate with the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said CMP’s proposal was “unworkably skewed to serve the company’s interests at the literal expense of Maine families and businesses.
“Maine’s outdated grid needs investment so it can better withstand storms fueled by climate change and deliver lower cost clean energy sources,” Schultz added, “but that must be balanced with respect for the high costs facing everyday people.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6665-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

“Accelerate is really important, because you now have the platform to grow and dream as much as you want,” said Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann during one session last week.
Innovate Mississippi is a nonprofit that helps grow the state’s entrepreneurship scene. Innovate Executive Director Tony Jeff described it as a “connect the dots” organization, introducing entrepreneurs, business people and investors. 
Campusknot, a Starkville-based company, is an Innovate success story and recently raised over $1 million in new funding. 
One of Innovate’s flagship programs is CoBuilders. The 12-week accelerator program helps early stage entrepreneurs get their ideas ready to pitch to investors. Startups first have to participate in one of eight regional competitions. Innovate heard over 120 pitches for this year’s program. Only seven made it into the final stage.
“The companies need to show that the market wants what they have, validating that, and then demonstrating they have the plan to go out and replicate that times a hundred,” Jeff said. 
A month before the event, Sugam Panthi, co-founder of MagnoliaEd, was “really confident” about the company’s product but was still nervous about the impending competition. 
Panthi cofounded MagnoliaEd with Fan Zhang, a professor at University of Southern Mississippi. Zhang was looking for a better way to manage all the classes she was teaching when Panthi, her research assistant, proposed an artificial intelligence tutor. He built an early prototype of what became MagnoliaEd over a few months and students found the tool helpful, especially in large online classes. 
Their AI agent creates a personalized chatbot trained on course content that can help students around the clock. 
During the competition, those pitching ideas fielded tough questions from the audience about their revenue model and potential competitors. But at the end of MagnoliaEd’s 15 minutes on stage, Panthi was grinning. 
Panthi said the University of Southern Mississippi and Innovate went the “extra length” to help him prepare. He said it was an exciting opportunity to make more connections and have discussions about what role AI should have in the classroom. 
These conversations are exactly what the conference was designed to do, generating new ideas to build innovative companies.
At the end of the competition, Jeff reminded the crowd that Innovate will soon be accepting pitches for its next round. 
“Let’s go build something great,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/17134657/MG_8941.jpg,,,2025-11-18 14:57:26.894376

Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, blasted the move as an “outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education.” Murray said “it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened — or even completely broken — in the process.” Rachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education Department workers, said “this latest ploy by the Trump Administration to dismantle the Congressionally created U.S. Department of Education is not only unlawful — it’s an insult to the tens of millions of students who rely on the agency to protect their access to a quality education.” She added that “students, educators and families depend on the Department’s comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs” and “that national mission is weakened when its core functions are scattered across other federal or state agencies that are not equipped or positioned to provide the same support and services as ED staff.”",,,,2025-11-18 15:58:37.915615

Matt Morgan, R-Richmond, surveys a map of proposed new congressional districts in Texas, as Democratic lawmakers, who left the state to deny Republicans the opportunity to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts, began returning to the Texas Capitol in Austin on Aug. 20, 2025. REUTERS/Sergio FloresTexas cannot use its new congressional map for the 2026 election and will instead need to stick with the lines passed in 2021, a three-judge panel ruled Tuesday.
“The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics,” U.S. Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote in the ruling. “To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.”
Brown ordered that the 2026 congressional election “shall proceed under the map that the Texas Legislature enacted in 2021.” The case will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but time is short: Candidates only have until Dec. 8 to file for the upcoming election.
The decision is a major blow for Republicans, in Texas and nationally, who pushed through this unusual mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump. They were hoping the new map would yield control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts — up from the 25 they currently hold — and help protect the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House.
The map cleared the GOP-controlled Legislature in August and was quickly signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. Several advocacy groups sued over the new district lines, saying lawmakers intentionally diluted the voting power of Black and Hispanic Texans and drew racially gerrymandered maps. Over the course of a nine-day hearing in El Paso earlier this month, they aimed to convince the judges that it was in voters’ best interest to shelve the new map until a full trial could be held.
It was not immediately clear if the state still has a legal path to restoring the new map in time for 2026. Unlike most federal lawsuits, which are heard by a single district judge and then appealed to a circuit court, voting rights lawsuits are initially heard by two district judges and one circuit judge, and their ruling can only be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The decision comes 10 days into the monthlong period when candidates can sign up for the March primary. The filing deadline is Dec. 8.
This is just the opening gambit in what promises to be a yearslong legal battle over Texas’ congressional map. A lawsuit over the state’s 2021 redistricting — including its state legislative and education board seats — went to trial earlier this summer and remains pending before the same three-judge panel. The judges have indicated they may want to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a major voting rights case before issuing their full ruling on Texas’ maps.
But for Trump, and many of his Republican supporters in Texas, the short-term goal of having this map for the 2026 election was as important as the long game.
“I’m convinced that if Texas does not take this action, there is an extreme risk that [the] Republican majority will be lost,” Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford, said on the floor of the state Senate before the new map passed. “If it does, the next two years after the midterm, there will be nothing but inquisitions and impeachments and humiliation for our country.”

“The biggest drivers of poor health outcomes appear to be education, employment and income, particularly for low income communities and those with lower educational attainment,” said Karley Abramson, a health policy research associate for the Citizen’s Research Council. 
The report centers on social determinants of health, which is a very broad term to describe the “structural, cultural, environmental, financial, and political limitations that impact a person’s health behaviors and health outcomes,” the report explains. 
Michigan ranks below average in just about every major metric of health, the report explains. That includes life expectancy, infant mortality, and prevalence of diseases like cancer and diabetes. The state also has sharp racial disparities in some of these metrics — life expectancy for Black Michiganders is 5.5 years shorter than that for white residents, one of the highest differences in the country. 
Abramson explained that one main goal of the report was to explain how policies that may not generally be considered related to health — issues like education and employment — have distinct impacts on health outcomes for the state. 
“This was meant to provide a grounding for policymakers on how to zoom out, to get them to focus on how public health is much more than health policy,” she said. “While health policy is very necessary for better health outcomes, health outcomes are largely driven by other things.”
Financial Resources as Pathways to Health Outcomes | Citizens Research Council of Michigan
For example, Abramson explained, if someone gets sick and requires medication, they generally have to go to the doctor to get that medication. That requires paying for the doctor’s visit, which usually requires health insurance, and for most people, that insurance comes from their employer. Beyond that, access to reliable transportation to get to the doctor at all is required, as is social support — for example, someone reminding you to take your medication. All of these things are not explicitly questions of health policy, but they all impact someone’s ability to get the medication that they need. 
“We’re trying to tackle the sickest populations, and how huge those health disparities are,” she said. “To make the people who are most in need healthier and then making them more able to contribute to a more prosperous state, that feedback loop, then a prosperous state is what is needed to improve health outcomes across the board.”
“There’s an inherent value of a healthy population to the state,” Abramson noted, adding that the feedback loop serves to benefit the state by attracting new residents and boosting the economy.
The other “fundamental resources” outside of financial considerations that the report examines are health care, food and nutrition, safety, and social support. But the report concludes that financial resources are central to all of the rest of those social determinants of health because it sets the foundation for the other resources. 
Abramson also urged lawmakers to avoid “disconnected and piecemeal attempts at policy aimed at addressing social determinants of health,” and to instead look for long-term solutions to the underlying problems. 
“We don’t always get back to the root of why all those barriers exist, which many times is this access to financial resources,” she said.

There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty right now in Vermont’s public education system. I’ve been reporting on the effects of the state’s new education reform bill, Act 73, since it was signed into law in July.
When people don’t have access to solid, fact-based reporting, decisions get made behind closed doors. I report on Vermont’s schools so that doesn’t happen. So you can see what’s coming and why it matters.

Act 73 set big changes in motion, but there’s (literally) no map on the table as the legislative session approaches. Our job is to explain what’s at stake clearly so Vermonters can form their own opinions about what should come next.
Whatever lawmakers decide could have an enormous impact on teachers, school district employees, and students and their families. We’ve been doing deep dives into how this law is already affecting school districts throughout the state. But there is sure to be even more debate in the Statehouse when the legislative session begins.
Your donation will help support us as we shine a light on that debate and on how those changes will impact schools and students throughout Vermont.

This image of Mattivi is from an Oct. 1, 2025, news conference with Attorney General Kris Kobach. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Bureau of Investigation tracked down and placed in custody of federal immigration officers 10 people in Kansas found guilty of criminal offenses, including a Somalian refugee convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a Garden City traffic accident.
The individuals without U.S. citizenship, who were from Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, Ethiopia and Somalia, were located by the KBI between Oct. 24 and Nov. 14 as agents worked in Hutchinson, Newton, Garden City and Dodge City.
The KBI said each was transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for proceedings that could result in their deportation.
In February, KBI entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that created opportunities for state law enforcement officers to receive ICE training in execution of warrants for alleged violation of federal immigration law. The KBI roundup was tied to the ICE partnership.
“Each of these offenders had been tried and convicted of a sex offense, a drug offense or a violent offense,” said Tony Mattivi, director of the KBI. “Anyone without citizenship who commits serious crimes against Kansans should not be allowed to stay in our communities.”
Attorney General Kris Kobach, who has administrative jurisdiction over the KBI, said immigration enforcement activities performed by the KBI were allowed under 287(g) authority, a section of federal law that enables state or local law enforcement agencies to collaborate with ICE.
“Had my office not obtained 287(g) authority and investigated these cases, these dangerous illegal aliens would have continued to live in Kansas communities hiding in plain sight,” Kobach said.
The roster of individuals placed into custody included Bashir Omar, a refugee from Somalia, who was charged in Garden City with driving under the influence and other offenses in October 2017. The vehicle Omar was driving struck the motorcycle driven by Robert Becker, 67, of Garden City. Becker died at the scene of injuries sustained when Omar’s Jeep hit the motorcycle from behind.
A plea bargain led to Omar’s conviction for involuntary manslaughter and failure to stop at the scene of an accident resulting in a fatality. The statement from Kobach and Mattivi mistakenly indicated Omar had been found guilty of “second-degree intentional murder.”
Omar was incarcerated in custody of the Kansas Department of Corrections until February 2022, state records show. Three of Becker’s children said in a post to change.org the four-year sentence received by Omar was insufficient because “Bashir murdered our dad.”
Six of the 10 individuals taken into custody by the KBI were from Mexico. They were: Jose Luis Gomez Sr., distribution of narcotics; Alonzo Mendez, indecent liberties with a child; Diego Nevarez, intent to distribute heroin; Jose Rivera-Avila, aggravated assault and criminal discharge of firearm; Jose Eduardo Garcia-Peralta, distribution of narcotics; and Ramiro Erik Flores-Hernandez, cultivation and distribution of controlled substances.
In addition to Omar, the KBI detained Gilberto Taracena Monte of Guatemala for molestation of a child, Nigisti Geberemedehni Beyene of Ethiopia for aggravated battery and Yuliesky Hernandez-Padron of Cuba for aggravated robbery.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010242-1024x866.jpg,,,2025-11-18 13:57:48.213603

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Islanders anxiously awaiting confirmation of a deal to save Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital from closing will have to keep waiting after a hearing in federal bankruptcy court in Dallas Tuesday morning.
But time is running out.
A cost-sharing agreement between Prospect Medical Holdings, the hospitals’ bankrupt owner, and the state attorney general’s office guaranteed funding for Roger Williams and Fatima to stay open through November — less than two weeks away. 
The parties are working to extend the funding split through December with the expectation a new buyer will take over, said Thomas Califano, an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP representing Prospect.
“Hopefully, it will be resolved early in the month, but we just want to make sure we have that stipulation to have that extra time,” Califano said.
Firmer details on the financing extension, along with more substantive updates on a hospital buyer, will be shared next week at another hearing before Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday. 
Prospect, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, signaled its desire to close the facilities by the end of the year amid delays in the sale to new owners. 
Faced with the threat of closure, Neronha agreed to put up half of the $6 million cost to keep the facilities operating in November, using money from a state-controlled escrow account funded by the hospitals’ former owner, private equity firm Leonard Green. 
The remainder of hospitals’ November costs were to be put up by Prospect’s legal bankruptcy estate. However, the new buyer is expected to replenish Prospect’s estate and the state escrow account for the money spent once a deal closes.
Two suitors, The Centurion Foundation and Prime Healthcare, are on the table in different stages of commitment.
Centurion, an Atlanta nonprofit, secured conditional approval from Rhode Island regulators to buy the hospitals in June 2024, but has struggled to find investors to back the bonds needed to close the deal. Prime, which owns Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket among 50 other hospitals nationwide, recently entered the picture at the request of state officials, but has not made an offer yet — nor had it been accepted by state regulators. 
Providers and elected officials warn that closing the hospitals would have catastrophic consequences for the state’s fragile health care system. 
The hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They took in 50,000 emergency room visits last year, while employing 2,400 people. Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
Despite the ticking clock, the mood was optimistic in Jernigan’s Dallas courtroom Tuesday.
Referring to Prime as “the buyer that has been disclosed in the press but I don’t have authority to mention,” Califano said the California hospital operator is still reviewing a potential acquisition, with a “somewhat positive response.” 
Centurion has shifted attention from the bond market to a short-term loan from Bank of America, which its attorneys said could complete the financing picture by early or mid-December.
Two hospitals that went for years without any interested buyers might ultimately end with two offers ready to choose from, said Andrew Troop, a New York bankruptcy lawyer hired by the AG’s office to represent the state in bankruptcy proceedings.
Prime and Centurion did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday.

(Photo courtesy of South Bow)The operator of the Keystone Pipeline says a crack along a weld caused an oil leak in southeast North Dakota earlier this year. 
South Bow temporarily shut down the Keystone Pipeline on April 8 after a drop in pressure. South Bow later estimated that about 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons, of oil spilled in a farm field near Fort Ransom. The spill was contained to the farm field.
The 30-inch pipeline was back in service in mid-April. 
The company said the release of the independent analysis of the cause has been impacted by the U.S. federal government shutdown. The report would be released by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
The agency had issued a corrective action order shortly after the leak, including reducing the  pressure in parts of the pipeline.
The leaking section of pipe was excavated and replaced, according to PHMSA. 
South Bow’s findings showed the pipe and the welds conformed to industry standards.
The leak resulted from a crack along the pipe’s manufactured longseam weld.
The company said it is trying to improve its pipeline inspection system. 
Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager for the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, said Tuesday that cleanup at the spill site had been completed. 
The Keystone Pipeline carries Canadian oil through the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba then south through the Midwest.
South Bow estimated the spill cost the company $55 million. The company said it hopes to recover the cost of the leak through insurance policies. As of Sept. 30, South Bow has received about $16 million in insurance claims.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Over the next four decades, Utah’s population is on track to rise from about 3.6 million residents today to more than 5.6 million — an increase of 2 million people, or roughly the size of Idaho’s current population. 
That’s according to a new report published Tuesday by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. The report is the state’s latest long-term economic and demographic projections, meant to help guide policy decisions for years to come.

“Utah’s demographic and economic future will be marked by significant growth and change,” the report says, attributing “record levels of net in-migration, declining natural change (births minus deaths), an aging population, and continuing urbanization” to the growth. 
By the end of 2065, “Utah’s population will be larger, older, and more urban,” the report says, predicting a “service-oriented economy that remains well-diversified.” Researchers wrote that health care, professional services, finance and construction will play a vital role and lead growth through the next 40 years. 
Here are some key takeaways listed in the report: 



Population: Utah’s population is expected to continue to grow, projected to hit 5.6 million in 2065. 
Employment: An estimated 1.2 million jobs will be added in that time frame, with the largest increases expected in health care, social assistance, professional, scientific and technical services, along with finance and insurance. 
Migration: Net migration will continue to drive population growth across the state — except for eight years in the 2030s. “Economic growth, combined with declining fertility and an aging population, drive this trend,” the report says. 
Household growth: Across the state, projected population growth coincides with substantial household growth, from 1.2 million in 2025 to 2.3 million in 2065. 
Smaller household sizes: Household sizes are projected to continue to decrease, driven by an aging population. A typical Utah household is expected to decrease from three people in 2025 to 2.3 in 2065. 
Aging: Utah’s median age is projected to increase from 32.8 in 2025 to 45.3 in 2065, as a result of declining fertility rates and an aging population. Those ages 65 and older will increase from 1 in 8 residents to nearly 1 in 4 Utahns by 2065. 
Most populated counties: The state’s most populated county is expected to continue to be Salt Lake County with 1.6 million in 2065, but Utah County (at 1.5 million) is expected to trail close behind. 
Job growth in urban counties: Even though employment growth is projected to be the largest in Salt Lake County (with 600,000 new jobs), Utah County is expected to see the fastest growth (60%) followed closely by Summit and Iron counties with 58.6%.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)Health care isn’t something that always can be scheduled during regular business hours.
There’s an effort underway in the Florida Legislature to make sure the managed care companies that receive billions of dollars to provide care to the poor, sick, and elderly remain open between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. Monday through Friday and on the weekends.
Specifically, the bill would amend Medicaid statutes to require that at least 50% of a managed care plan’s primary care provider network offer availability to Medicaid enrollees during off hours.
The Senate Health Policy Committee on Tuesday passed SB 40,  offered by Sen. Barbara Sharief, D-Miramar.
“The goal is simple: It’s just to ensure Medicaid enrollees can see providers outside of regular business hours when families may need the care,” Sharief said Tuesday in presenting her bill. “As you know, many Medicaid recipients, especially working parents and caregivers, struggle to get appointments after 5 p.m. weekdays or on weekends, and the lack of access pushes them into the emergency room, into our more expensive modes of treatment. ”
Contractual requirements
The 50% requirement is higher than what plans contractually agreed to offer earlier this year when they signed new Medicaid managed care contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
Those contracts require all managed care plans statewide to require at least 40% of their participating primary care providers to offer after-hour appointments by Sept. 30, 2026.
The percentage of providers accepting after-hour appointments increases to at least 50% effective Sept. 30, 2027, for a large swath of the state — from Northwest Florida east to Jacksonville, through the so-called Florida Heartland north and west of Lake Okeechobee, and south to the Florida Keys.
Managed care plans in Medicaid Regions C and D, which includes Pasco, Hillsborough, Manatee, Polk, Hardy, and Highlands counties, would be required to have 45% of their primary care providers offer after-hours access to care by Sept. 30, 2027.
The requirement doesn’t change for Medicaid managed care plans operating in Region F, which includes Sarasota, DeSoto, Charlotte, Glades Lee, Hendry, and Collier counties. After-hour access requirements for managed care plans now are negotiated through contractual agreements between the Agency for Health Care Administration and the managed care plans.
The bill is supported by the Florida Association of Nurse Practitioners as well as AARP Florida.
Before the vote, committee member Sen. Rosalind Osgood, D-Fort Lauderdale, thanked Sharief for her efforts.
“In my other job, I work with a lot of individuals that fall into this category, and a lot of times they’re working so they can’t meet the regular doctor ‘s scheduled hours. So, having opportunities to access medical care and nontraditional hours would be very beneficial,” she said.
HB 163 is the companion measure sponsored by Miami Gardens Democratic Rep. Felicia Robinson. That bill has been referred to the House Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee; the House  Health Care Budget Subcommittee; and the House Health & Human Services Committee. It has yet to be placed on any agenda.

Free.,Members of Democratic caucus press ICE for answers on detainment of pregnant women,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-democratic-caucus-press-ice-answers-detainment-pregnant-women,,"WASHINGTON — More than 60 members of the congressional Democratic Women’s Caucus Tuesday sent a letter to the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raising “extreme concerns” about the treatment of pregnant immigrants in detention. “The health and safety of pregnant women should not be threatened as a result of the administration choosing not to adhere to Federal regulations,” the 61 Democratic lawmakers wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons. “That is why we urge the administration to fully comply with the existing regulations and immediately correct the violations.”They specifically cited concerns at ICE facilities in Lumpkin, Georgia; Basile, Louisiana; and Broadview, Illinois. “At the detention centers, it was reported that pregnant women were being shackled, locked in restraints, or placed in solitary confinement,” they wrote, citing American Civil Liberties Union reports. The women have also been deprived of proper prenatal, postpartum, lactation and miscarriage care, they said.The letter argues that ICE’s own regulations do not require pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants to be detained and detainment should only occur if the release is “prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist.”“By detaining vulnerable women in appalling conditions while pregnant, you are subjecting both the pregnant individual and the unborn child to significant risks and possible death,” according to the letter. “We urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE to follow its own rules and regulations on detention of pregnant women and demand their humane treatment.”Lawmakers are asking for ICE to immediately release any detained immigrants who are pregnant. They are also pushing for ICE to answer several questions, including the number of pregnant immigrants in detention; the number of births or still births that took place in detention; the number of medical incidents experienced by pregnant detainees; and how many pregnant immigrants have been shackled by ICE. Lawmakers asked ICE for a response within 45 days. ICE officials did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment. House lawmakers who signed the letter include:Robin Kelly of IllinoisDelia Ramirez of IllinoisSydney Kamlager-Dove of CaliforniaSylvia Garcia of TexasTeresa Leger Fernández of New MexicoJoyce Beatty of OhioJasmine Crockett of TexasLaMonica McIver of New JerseyEmily Randall of Washington stateSheila Cherfilus-McCormick of FloridaDeborah Ross of North CarolinaNikema Williams of GeorgiaJulie Johnson of TexasPramila Jayapal of Washington stateNorma Torres of CaliforniaMelanie Stansbury of New MexicoAndrea Salinas of OregonLois Frankel of FloridaLucy McBath of GeorgiaJudy Chu of CaliforniaKelly Morrison of MinnesotaLateefah Simon of CaliforniaValerie P.

Legislative debates over reproductive rights generally attract lobbying interests from groups such as Planned Parenthood, the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the ACLU. But debate over HB 289, which would expand Florida’s Wrongful Death Act, has also drawn lobbying interest from groups that don’t usually get involved in the issue.
A review of lobbying records shows those following the bill include the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents some of the largest hospitals across the state; The Doctors Company, a national physician-owned medical liability carrier; and the Florida Justice Reform Institute, a Florida Chamber of Commerce-supported organization fighting “wasteful civil litigation through legislation.”
Lobbyists for those organizations all waived their right to speak against the bill before the Civil Justice and Claims Subcommittee on Tuesday, merely registering opposition for the record.
Indeed, most of the public debate on the bill came from Democrats on the subcommittee who pressed St. Augustine Republican and bill sponsor Rep. Sam Greco about unintended consequences women could face if the bill passes. St. Petersburg Democrat Rep. Michele Rayner, an attorney, voiced multiple concerns with the bill, not least that it could allow abusive ex-partners to sue over abortions or miscarriages.
Rep. Michele Rayner (Photo/Florida House of Representatives.)
“This bill is couched as a measure for a fetus, but it’s actually another measure that shows up that the state of Florida does not value women, does not value rape victims, and just like what happened in a botched prosecution of the Epstein victims in human trafficking ring,” Rayner said.
She continued: “We always talk about bad actors. And to me, this bill, as a woman, as a Black woman, opens this wide up for rapists and abusers to be fully empowered. So, I will be voting no on this bill. “
Before voting to pass HB 289, members of the subcommittee tagged on an amendment to narrow language that protects the mother of the “unborn child” and health care providers, including assistance reproductive technology providers, from being sued. 
The amendment tightened the exemption by requiring that the health care being delivered not only be lawful but also is “provided in compliance with the applicable standard of care.”
The amendment brings the House’s version of the bill closer in line with the Senate’s proposal, SB 164, offered by Fort Pierce Republican Sen. Erin Grall. That bill passed the Senate Senate Committee on Judiciary 5-4 and heads to the Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice and Rules committees next.
Senate judiciary panel OKs fetal wrongful death bill

HB 289, meanwhile, heads next to its second, and last, committee of reference, the Judiciary Committee.
While the bills aren’t identically drafted, they now are substantively the same.
 The way it is and would be

Under existing law, damages for the death of an unborn child are not recoverable under the state’s Wrongful Death Act, which allows for recovery of medical or funeral bills and future pain and suffering. However, per a 1997 Florida Supreme Court ruling, damages may be recoverable for a “negligent stillbirth” under common law. Those damages are limited to mental pain and anguish and medical expenses incurred incident to the pregnancy.
Common law refers a body of law developed through judicial decisions and precedents, not by statute. 
The legislation would allow parents to file wrongful death suits, which allows damages for mental pain and loss of support, meaning jurors could determine the salary the fetus could have earned over its life as part of the damages to which parents could be entitled.

The Montana Public Service Commission needs to investigate NorthWestern Energy’s actions in relation to data centers to protect existing consumers, says a complaint announced Tuesday by Earthjustice.
The complaint alleges NorthWestern Energy’s plan to supply electricity to data centers before the Public Service Commission determines that doing so won’t hurt other customers is against the law, and regulators need to investigate the monopoly utility.
Earthjustice filed the complaint Monday with the Public Service Commission on behalf of a coalition of groups representing conservation, Indigenous, senior citizen, faith, and social justice interests.
NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility, has entered letters of intent to provide as much as 1,400 megawatts of electricity to three data center developers in Montana, roughly double its current average, said the complaint.
“To serve this extreme demand, NorthWestern would need to make transmission upgrades and likely obtain new sources of electricity generation, which would likely lead to further increases in utility bills for NorthWestern’s other customers,” Earthjustice said in its announcement.
NorthWestern Energy has said it will not serve data center customers before “a specific contract for electric service” with that customer is approved by the commission.
But the complaint said NorthWestern has asserted it will not seek review by the Public Service Commission until after it has executed electricity supply contracts with data centers, “which directly contradicts the plain language” of the law.
As such, the groups are asking the Public Service Commission to inform NorthWestern that it “shall not” provide electricity to large load customers until regulators determine the service will not hurt other customers over the long run.
To make the determination, the groups ask the Public Service Commission to set a hearing to investigate the issues outlined in the complaint.



In the complaint, Earthjustice represents Big Sky 55+, Butte Watchdogs for Social and Environmental Justice, Climate Smart Missoula, Golden Triangle Resource Council, Helena Interfaith Climate Advocates, Honor the Earth, Montana Environmental Information Center, Montana Public Interest Research Group, and NW Energy Coalition.
“Montana’s seniors, many on fixed incomes, should not be forced to subsidize artificial intelligence data centers,” said Terry Minow, chair of Big Sky 55+, in a statement provided by Earthjustice. “We ask the PSC to require large load data centers to pay their fair share of utility costs. Otherwise, Montanans will be left struggling with the burden of even higher utility costs while big, out-of-state businesses take home the profits.”

Instead of annual totals, the department historically responded to public records requests with partial counts, cobbled together from multiple sources. News outlets and researchers unknowingly reported the incorrect numbers to the public: Did 125 incarcerated people die in 2023? Or 134? Maybe 137?
“Deaths are reported as they occur,” DOC Communications Director Karen Pojmann wrote in an email to The Marshall Project – St. Louis in October. “At no point during the year is the department required to present a total/comprehensive tally to any outside agency or other organization.” 

This article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project – St. Louis, a nonprofit news team covering Missouri’s criminal justice systems. Subscribe to their email list, and follow The Marshall Project on Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.

The department is required to report each death to the federal government, but those records are also flawed and missing multiple Missouri deaths, a Marshall Project investigation found. Missouri’s Department of Public Safety collects death records from the prison system, but a DPS spokesman said those are closed to the public. According to its website, DPS “does not review, compile, evaluate or analyze the submitted reports.”
Some states, like Illinois, share annual reports on prison deaths openly. But in Missouri, the prison system isn’t required to report year-end totals to anyone. 
The numerous discrepancies underscore how easily people in prison can disappear from the record — and how little residents, researchers and policymakers actually know about who dies in prison and how. Experts say withholding details and aggregate data from the public makes it harder to identify trends, and easier for the system to evade accountability for deaths that could have been prevented. 
The lack of year-end death data is “extremely concerning,” said Dr. Roger Mitchell Jr., co-author of the book “Death in Custody” and president of the National Medical Association. “There should be mortality reviews so that we review those cases, not just to hold people accountable for things that weren’t done correctly, but so that if things can improve — we improve those things.”
In early 2024, the DOC updated its data collection method, automatically pulling each death from its “offender management system” into a single document and updating it weekly. But the new process wasn’t applied retroactively, meaning death records prior to 2024 were incomplete.
However, in response to repeated questions from The Marshall Project – St. Louis about discrepancies in previously provided death records, the department’s research team generated a new report. This report includes every death recorded by the DOC from 2018 to 2024, and marks the first time comprehensive prison death totals have been made publicly available. 

A total of 844 people died over the seven-year period, according to the new report, more than has previously been reported. The department’s pattern of inconsistent record-keeping — which mirrors national trends — highlights the need for skepticism toward any death in custody data, experts say.  
Even the newest data released by the state provides an incomplete picture of deaths in prison. It does not include age, race, gender or the cause and circumstances of a death. The missing details make it impossible to spot patterns or use the data to better understand why people are dying. 
Sometimes, coroner records can fill in the gaps. In April, The Marshall Project – St. Louis obtained access to seven years of death investigations at South Central Correctional Center, a prison in Licking, Missouri. The archival records from the county coroner cover deaths from 2018 to 2024 and offer a critical window into the facility’s struggle to adequately address drug use and chronic health conditions behind bars. 
According to its new record-keeping system, and confirmed by coroner records, the department recorded 18 deaths at South Central in 2024 — the second-highest count of any Missouri facility. South Central also had the second–highest rate of deaths per 100 people incarcerated in the state’s facilities last year, according to data from the prison.

“People [in prison] are calling South Central ‘death row,’” said Déna Notz, a former corrections officer at the prison who left after a year and became a prison reform advocate. “Because of how many people end up dying there, and how many people end up getting to the point where they could have died.”
Drug overdose was the top cause of death at South Central from 2018 to 2024, the coroner records show, revealing the scale of the drug problem inside the prison. The overdoses, most often from fentanyl, represent roughly a third of deaths in 2024. Complications from chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes made up another third of the deaths that year. Outside prison walls, these conditions can be more readily monitored and treated. 

The records also reveal discrepancies in the manner of death: the broad categories used on death certificates to describe how someone died. In two cases, deaths with causes that were listed as “unknown” in the DOC’s records were ruled by the coroner to be homicides. 
Pojmann, the DOC’s communications director, said the in-custody death rate for Missouri is “average among corrections systems” in the U.S. and lower than that of six of the nine bordering states. The death rate also continues to decline, she said. 
While the department has pointed to an aging population as one of the primary reasons for prison deaths, more than half of the people who died at South Central were 55 years old or younger. 
The life expectancy for men in Missouri is ranked 40th in the country, at slightly over 71 years. At South Central last year, men died on average just shy of 53 years old.

A coroner’s death investigation can include everything from the autopsy and toxicology reports to medical records and the prison’s own notes about a death. These reports sometimes reveal the circumstances surrounding a person’s death, such as when they were found, who notified prison officials and whether the person was alone. 
In the absence of details from the prison, coroner records can be illuminating. On occasion, coroner investigations can clarify, or complicate, the often sparse narratives offered by the prison. For example, the DOC reported that a man died in January 2020 from an accident at South Central, with few other details mentioned in the death log besides his name. Coroner records reveal that the man was found out of his cell, dead in a janitor’s closet from a drug overdose and soaked in an unknown liquid. (The coroner’s report reads: “urine?”) 
Later that year, a 46-year-old Haitian man suffered a sudden heart attack at the prison during breakfast, and was pronounced dead that afternoon. The prison’s investigation reported “no major health history,” according to the autopsy report, despite a well-documented history in his medical records of heart disease and high cholesterol, and a previous heart attack at the prison in 2011.
The DOC reported that a man died of natural causes at South Central in December 2022. His autopsy report, included in coroner records, identified an untreated tooth infection as the contributing factor in his death. 
And in September 2023, the DOC reported that a man died by suicide, again with little information besides his name. The coroner’s investigation found that the man had a known history of mental health challenges, and hung himself in his cell two months after the prison system stopped providing proper medication for his depression. 
Experts say preventing future deaths across the prison system hinges on recording information about deaths in their totality, rather than one by one.
“You need the [total] number, and not just the number,” said Mitchell. “It’s the cause, it’s the circumstances, it’s the level of treatment. It’s full reviews of those deaths.”
Nationally, researchers have called for an overhaul of record-keeping for deaths in custody. Some states have medical review boards that investigate deaths behind bars and recommend changes correctional and medical staff must make to prevent similar deaths in the future. 
But spotting trends isn’t possible without robust historical death data. And inadequate record-keeping presents a challenge not only for policymakers, but also for grieving families who must fight for answers about how their loved ones died. For some elected officials in Missouri, the lack of reporting requirements and external oversight is a sign that the DOC is overdue for reform. 
“There should be some level of documentation and there should be some kind of scrutiny,” said state Rep. Gregg Bush, a Jefferson City Democrat who is a nurse by training.
“It’s just so unconscionable to me,” Bush said, that families of the deceased are “having to piece these things together, contextualizing the death of somebody who’s in our custody, who we’re responsible for their wellbeing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rose_Wong_STL-PRISON-DEATHS-DATA_header-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-11-18 13:00:14.301619

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) One of the first casualties of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s planned crackdown in the capital city was Raleigh’s new City Hall.
The $260 million building, which will be 17 stories when it’s complete, is being built on the site of the city’s former police station. Normally the site is buzzing with activity. On Tuesday morning, hours after word of the immigration raids spread, work was at a standstill. Heavy equipment was parked. Workers were scarce.
“Usually you have at least about 200 people on the site,” Bob Johnson, one of the few construction workers on the site, told NC Newsline.
Only a handful of workers were on site Tuesday. Even the operators of the food truck stayed away.
He acknowledged that his co-workers were worried about ICE agents.
“There’s a lot that can’t be done. I mean, you have framing, electrical, you have guys working painting, you know, precast,” said Johnson. “There’s a lot of trades that are not here because of that situation.”
Johnson said the fear that the announced immigration raids generated was definitely holding up the work planned for this week.
“Well, we’re talking about losing profit. The project itself will be behind schedule because it can cause a chain of events when it comes to other workers and other trades as well,” he said.
While federal agents have said the raids are designed to target criminals, Johnson said most of the people he works with on the city hall project are here because they want a better opportunity until they can become legal.
“I definitely don’t shun them at all. They’re very helpful. They make up half of our workforce. This is a dying trade.”
CBP’s immigration raids not only affected the massive construction project, but the small food truck that normally provides drinks and meals for the workers. Johnson noted even they stayed away rather than venture into downtown Raleigh.
“And I just feel bad for the families that are dependent on the guys to work the hours,” Johnson said.
“You’re talking about fathers and brothers being the prime breadwinner for their home.”
Johnson said while he supports the overall goal of improving public safety, he would like to see a less disruptive approach, especially in a profession where immigrant workers are needed.
“Heck, if Americans won’t or can’t do [the work], why not give it to those that’s coming in? They’re doing a job for us.”
The immigration enforcement surge in the Charlotte area has resulted in the arrest of over 130 immigrants in two days. The Department of Homeland Security released a statement listing several detainees it describe as “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.”
As the Border Patrol expands its enforcement efforts to Raleigh, Siembra NC said that there was little evidence that the operation conducted in Charlotte was targeting individuals with criminal records.
“Safety is created by community members looking out for each other and standing up for each other, not by masked federal agents who are here to create chaos and bring fear,” said Nikki Marín Baena, co-director of Siembra NC, in a prepared statement.

Rosa DeLauro said the Italian American Congressional Delegation will send a letter urging the administration to pause proposed tariffs.,"The city’s pastificios are boiling over the Trump administration’s proposal to impose a 107 percent tariff on their favorite Italian imports — including boxes of pasta, which a Wooster Square importer warned would double in price from $3 to $6.
Local importers and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro gathered at Vinnie’s Italia Importing Company on Monday to slam the Trump administration for threatening new duties on Italian imports. DeLauro also announced that the bipartisan Italian American Congressional Delegation will send a letter on Wednesday urging the administration to pause the proposed tariffs.
“It’s crazy,” lamented Mike DiVirgilio, the owner of Vinnie’s. He said he’s already had to raise prices on his customers, which include Adriana’s, Goodfellas, Consiglio’s, Portofino, and 50 other restaurants throughout Southern Connecticut.
The pasta makers affected include Barilla, Rummo, La Molisana, and Garofalo.
Whether pasta is $3 or $6, families “still gotta use” it for dinner, said DiVirgilio. But as tariffs continue to push prices higher, customers have started cutting back on steak and other meats, impairing Vinnie’s economics. According to DiVirgilio, the price of Dutch veal — a popular choice for holiday dinners — has climbed from $9 to $12.50 per pound due to tariffs.
“We’re losing money,” said DiVirgilio. When asked what he would say to the Trump administration, he opted to say nothing, citing fear of being “arrested.”
Francesca Liuzzi Fiorillo and Nadia Liuzzi, part-owners of North Haven’s Liuzzi Gourmet Food Market, said they’ve watched customers “struggling to pay” the higher prices, especially on imported staples like canned tomatoes and olive oil.
We “couldn’t really prepare” for the tariffs, said Liuzzi Fiorillo, since over 90 percent of their goods are imported.
The family chooses to import for the better quality, she added. Pasta from Italy is made without preservatives, chemicals, or dyes, while much of what’s produced in the U.S. contains those additives, Fiorillo said. They manufacture in the U.S. when they can, like with cheese.
For the Liuzzi family, pasta is a centerpiece to family gatherings. “It’s a Sunday thing,” said Liuzzi. “Our grandma and grandpa would make it” for the whole family.
Their favorites are malfaldine — a thin lasagna noodle — and mezzi rigatoni — a short, small version of rigatoni.
“I definitely don’t agree” with Italian-American support for Trump, said Liuzzi Fiorillo, but added that, as a business owner, she prefers to stay mostly “neutral.”
On Monday, DeLauro described the cultural importance of pasta to Italian-American families like her own.
“Pasta is the most important staple in our house,” said DeLauro. She told the Independent that her favorite pasta shapes are linguine and macaroni, and she ate spaghetti with clams last night for dinner.
For her, pasta can be a way to “connect to a broader sense of self and broader history.” And, she said, with food prices having already risen by 25 percent over the last four years, a rising proportion of families living paycheck to paycheck, and the Trump administration dragging their heels on disbursing November’s food stamp payments, the new tariffs will only intensify the affordability crisis for American families.
“This is not like dealing with China,” argued DeLauro. Tariffs as high as what the Trump administration has proposed could stir the pot, impairing the long-standing relationship between U.S. and Italy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 16:37:48+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA seeks to limit scope of clean water law to reduce wetlands covered,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/epa-clean-water-rollback-wotus/,"The proposal is among dozens of environmental regulations being rolled back in an effort to accelerate economic prosperity, EPA said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday it is redefining the scope of the nation’s bedrock clean water law to significantly limit the wetlands it covers, building on a Supreme Court decision two years ago that removed federal protections for vast areas.
When finalized, the new “Waters of the United States” rule will ensure that federal jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act is focused on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water, such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes, along with wetlands that are directly connected to such bodies of water, the EPA said.
The proposal is among dozens of environmental regulations being rolled back by the Trump administration as part of what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin says is a concerted effort to accelerate economic prosperity while putting ” a dagger through the heart of climate change religion.” Critics call the water rule a giveaway to ranchers and industry.
At a news conference at agency headquarters, Zeldin said the new rule will fully implement the direction provided by the Supreme Court in a case known as Sackett v. EPA. The 2023 ruling sharply limited the federal government’s authority to police water pollution into certain wetlands, and boosted property rights over concerns about clean water in a ruling in favor of Michael and Chantell Sackett, an Idaho couple who sought to build a house near a lake.
Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who has led a drive to roll back regulations perceived as climate-friendly, said Democratic administrations had long “weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners and families.” Still, he said the proposed rule change was not motivated by ideology or partisanship, but instead was intended to be a “clear, simple, prescriptive rule that will stand the test of time.”
Asked why he is confident the rule will be sustained after decades of partisan back-and-forth over water regulation, Zeldin offered a one-word answer: “Sackett.”
“That’s one of the big differences from the past, is that you have the Supreme Court weighing in, and we’re following Sackett very closely,” Zeldin said. “We’re treating it with respect. The words are being interpreted strictly. We are sticking to the prescriptive language of the Supreme Court decision. And that is a very significant difference from the past.”
The rule, which faces at least 45 days of public comment, will cut red tape and provide clarity for farmers, ranchers, industry and other private landowners, Zeldin said. The proposal will also protect water quality by striking a balance between federal and state authority, he said, adding that any lands that are removed from federal jurisdiction will still face regulation from states and tribes.
Environmentalists slammed the proposal as a giveaway to industry by President Donald Trump.
“The Trump EPA’s shortsighted push to encourage industries to plow over more wetlands and streams will destroy thousands of miles of waterways critical to wildlife across the United States,” said J.W. Glass, a policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group. “This political gift from Trump to the polluters that support him will wipe out life-sustaining waterways in every corner of the nation, and it will destroy countless natural areas that protect us from increasingly destructive storm surges driven by the climate crisis.”
“By gutting protections for wetlands and streams, EPA is trying to disown its legal obligation to protect our drinking water and our communities,” added Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, another environmental group. “Wetlands are nature’s safeguard against flooding, and stripping away protections for them puts millions of people in harm’s way.”
But Zeldin, who has traveled to all 50 states since taking office earlier this year, said complaints about the invasive nature of the water rule have emerged in every state. The Trump administration has listened to concerns from farmers and other groups worried about federal interference in how they use their land, he said, and has moved to set limited, predictable and lasting rules defining which waterways the Clean Water Act protects.
“If you want to really appreciate the impact of the WOTUS rule — past, present and future — I would encourage you to speak to all of those impacted stakeholders, all those impacted landowners,” Zeldin said.
Testimony that affected him the most came from “some small farmer who’s struggling to make ends meet, and they have no idea whether or not the water on their property is a water of the United States or not,” Zeldin said. “Their frustration skyrockets when something on their property being interpreted as a water of the United States doesn’t make any sense. Then their advocacy and passion really starts coming out.”
Trump sought to shrink the water law’s reach in his first term, while Democratic administrations have expanded federal power to regulate the nation’s lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and oceans. The change in administrations has created drastic swings in how the water law is interpreted and applied.
The Supreme Court ruling in the Sackett case largely agreed with the Trump administration’s limited approach and led the Biden administration to rewrite protections to comply with the ruling. Some conservative groups have complained that the revised rule still protected too many wetlands and improperly limited private property rights.
Damien Schiff, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation who represented the Sacketts in court, said the latest proposal “represents a meaningful step toward relief for property owners still burdened by unjustified and illegal Clean Water Act regulations.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25321806840597-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:58:14.540262

Thomas Massie speaks with reporters inside the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)After Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie led the charge for months to release federal investigation files about sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, U.S. House members are expected to vote on the motion Tuesday afternoon. 
“We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president, to get this win,” Massie said during a Tuesday morning press conference. “But they’re on our side today, though, so let’s give them some credit as well. They’re finally on the side of justice.”
President Donald Trump, who has blasted Massie and even recruited a Republican opponent to run against him, abruptly reversed his opposition to releasing the Epstein files as it became clear the Republican-controlled House would vote for releasing the investigation records. 
In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump said that House Republicans “should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’”
Massie filed a discharge petition to release the files in September, much to Trump’s ire. The president went so far as to endorse a primary challenger against Massie in Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District, former Navy SEAL Ed Gallrein. 
Massie was poised to gain the 218th signature needed to bring the petition forward after the election of Democratic U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva. However, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed her swearing-in amid the government shutdown until last week. 
Ahead of the expected vote, Massie joined survivors of Epstein along with California Democratic U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna and Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for a Tuesday morning press conference in Washington, D.C. Massie thanked the survivors for sharing their stories and encouraged senators to vote in favor of releasing the files once they receive the discharge petition. 
Survivors of Epstein’s abuse publicly told their stories in September aiming to encourage members of Congress to vote in favor of releasing the federal investigation files. They described emotional manipulation and physical coercion, beginning as early as age 14 in some cases, at the hands of Epstein and convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.
Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. His death was ruled a suicide. 
Trump had campaigned on releasing the Epstein files, but backed off releasing the files after he became president earlier this year. 
In his criticism of Massie and the discharge petition, the president has issued personal attacks against the congressman. On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social about Massie’s announcement of his second marriage to Carolyn Grace Moffa, a former staffer for U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. Massie’s late wife, Rhonda Massie, died unexpectedly last year. 
“Anyway, have a great life Thomas and (?),” the president wrote. “His wife will soon find out that she’s stuck with a LOSER!”
The primary opponent Trump endorsed against Massie, Gallrein, said online Saturday in response to one of the congressman’s posts on X: “You’ve voted so often with radical Dems that all you’ve got left is howling ‘Epstein.’” 
Gallrein’s campaign did not immediately return an emailed request for comment Tuesday after Trump’s position on the files changed.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/massiesept32025-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:58:14.540262

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Washington state’s paid leave program is facing a shortfall of $350 million after years of error-prone forecasting.
Among the program’s flaws in Washington: They plan for the future by looking backward, using the past as a baseline for calculating future needs, thereby ignoring potential demographic shifts and economic forecasts.
And, yet, Washington state lawmakers are once again determined to fill the account.
Why? Because it’s a wildly popular benefit.
Minnesota state officials and the 350 workers who will be rolling out the state’s new paid leave benefit are trying to learn from mistakes in Washington and the nearly dozen other states with paid leave — all while under the microscope of election year politics.
Minnesota’s paid leave program will launch on Jan. 1, ushering in a new system for Minnesota workers that grants up to 12 weeks of family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave per year, capped at 20 weeks in a single year. Employers and workers will pay into a fund, with the payout determined by a wage-based formula, capped at $1,423 per week. The program also includes job protections.
The stakes couldn’t be higher, for the businesses and workers affected, but also for Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers. Paid leave was a signature accomplishment during the 2023 DFL trifecta. Walz often cites paid leave when he argues that Minnesota is among the best states to raise a family.
But now they’ve got to make it work, and if they don’t they can expect to pay the consequences. Walz is seeking an unprecedented third, four-year term in 2026; voters will also determine control of the narrowly divided Legislature.
Risks for the Walz administration include the potential for fraud that has beset other Minnesota public programs. Then there’s foreboding technology glitches, like the 2017 revamp of the Minnesota Licensing and Registration System that caused massive headaches for thousands of drivers trying to get their licenses and registration tabs renewed.
To ensure a smooth rollout, Walz recruited an out-of-state paid leave director who helped launch Massachusetts’ paid leave program.
Massachusetts was the eighth state with paid leave; Greg Norfleet helped raise the curtain in 2021 despite interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Norfleet said his team is learning from others. For example, Minnesota employers will be more engaged in the application process — the state will notify bosses if one of their workers applies for leave. In other states, employers have been blindsided by their workers, who would only notify their bosses after the state signed off on their leave, Norfleet said in a Reformer interview.
When he was asked if there’s anything that’s keeping him up at night about Minnesota’s rollout, Norfleet said no.
“I’m sleeping pretty well,” Norfleet said.

The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, however, thinks he should be tossing and turning a bit more.
The Chamber — which opposed the paid leave bill at the Legislature, citing the burdens of higher taxes and finding replacement workers — said in a statement to the Reformer that they’ve been conducting outreach efforts to help members comply with the new law, but they remain concerned: “It’s clear there are still significant awareness gaps and plenty of implementation questions, particularly for small businesses, many of whom thought they were exempt from the law.”
“As employers of all sizes are trying to figure out how to coordinate with this new mandate, we are increasingly concerned about readiness,” the Chamber statement reads.
Norfleet says the agency is well-staffed and has hosted many engagement sessions with businesses and Minnesotans to answer questions.
“That foundation that we’ve built gives me a lot of confidence of where we are and how we’re going to be able to meet the moment for Minnesotans,” Norfleet said.
How it works
Minnesota’s paid leave program is partnered with the state’s unemployment insurance system, from which the Department of Employment and Economic Development has gathered data to avoid redundant reporting requirements from businesses.
The state is also ahead of the game in another respect: In most states with paid leave, a payroll tax goes into effect about a year before the program rolls out to build up enough funds for the benefits. This means employees pay a tax without reaping any rewards.
Minnesota lawmakers in 2023 allocated $668 million in initial funding for the paid leave account and $122 million for administrative costs, paid for with an $18 billion budget surplus.
In Minnesota, a 0.88% payroll tax will go into effect in January, split between employers and their employees. Most employees will pay half, or 44 cents for every $100 in taxable wages. (Small businesses — those that employ 30 or fewer people — pay a reduced rate of 0.66%.)
Paid leave may boost wages for women
California implemented paid family leave in 2004. In the decades since, numerous studies have shown that access to paid leave to care for newborns and children have positive health impacts on parents and children alike.
Surveys of people who’ve taken paid leave say they have boosted morale, better job security and economic stability. Paid leave, when offered with job protections, can also help states that have a dire need for elder care, as people can afford to take time off to be family caregivers after a fall or illness, for example.
According to the left-leaning Center for American Progress, workers lose $22.5 billion in wages each year because of a lack of paid leave.
Women who take paid leave are also more likely to return to work after their child’s birth compared to those who don’t take leave,and paid leave is associated with higher wages among mothers.
Research on paid leave’s effect on businesses is mixed. While it’s associated with less employee turnover and higher productivity, the cost of employees taking family leave can hurt small businesses that struggle to absorb short-term losses.
A Center for Economic and Policy Research study of the Connecticut paid leave program’s impact on businesses found that most employers reported a modest impact or no impact on their costs or business operations. About a year-and-a-half after the law’s implementation, about 75% of 251 Connecticut employers said they support the paid leave law.
Jessica Mason, a senior policy analyst with the National Partnership for Women & Families, said the program is a net win for families, especially during uncertain budget times.
“These days, folks are really watching our dollars, so it’s important to feel like everything we’re making investments in is really worth it — and the evidence is really clear that paid leave is one of those things,” Mason said.
Local government, school districts concerned about cost
Minnesota’s paid leave law applies to nearly every employer, not just businesses, and many are anxious about the new program.
Given already tight budgets, a new payroll tax may lead cities to raise property taxes to pay higher personnel costs, said Lisa Schaefer, the League of Minnesota Cities’ human resources director.
Schaefer said city governments confront many unknowns. Among the conundrums unique to government entities: If an elected official is unable to serve for 90 days, a vacancy can be declared under state law. It’s unclear how the paid leave law would apply in that situation, Schaefer said.
Many cities also have unionized employees who have paid leave negotiated in their contracts, so cities and unions will have to renegotiate new terms, she said.
Minnesota school districts’ main concern about paid leave is the prospect of losing important educators. Schools are already facing substitute teacher shortages, and weeks-long absences for paid leave will exacerbate the issue, said Tiffany Gustin, director of management and insurance trust services with the Minnesota School Boards Association.
Gustin said the issue with paid leave boils down to “the responsibility that school districts have to still provide an education to its students.” Many districts will also have to renegotiate their union contracts if they include paid leave, Gustin said.
The ‘baby bump’
Almost every state with paid leave has encountered what Norfleet said in the paid leave world is known as the “baby bump,” meaning an influx of applications from parents who welcomed a child into their home a year prior to paid leave rolling out.
Minnesota parents who welcomed a child into their home this year can claim the state’s paid leave benefit in 2026, even if they’ve already taken leave through their employer.
Norfleet said paid leave for parents who had a kid in 2025 is the most-called about question, and Minnesota is ready to meet the moment.
Mason, the policy analyst, said that states have struggled to predict the number of applications that will come in on day one and don’t hire enough people to handle the abundance of claims.
Norfleet said DEED is hiring temporary workers to help with an anticipated 17,000 to 20,000 applications for leave in the first month — including between 5,000 to 7,000 “baby bump” applications.
Walz and the DFL architects of the program hope that by allowing parents to spend time nurturing the youngest Minnesotans, they’ll feel more secure having more babies. The children, meanwhile, will enjoy lifelong benefits of stable and attentive parenting, at least for 12 weeks, or perhaps 24 if parents decide to take the leave back-to-back instead of together.
Norfleet explained his mission with a line that could fit on a Hallmark card: “Paid leave is really about making time for moments that matter,” Norfleet said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/P1139698-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:58:14.540262

(File photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)South Carolina’s Grand Strand sees among the highest rates of opioid overdoses in the state, but those who seek treatment tend to drop out early. Meanwhile, the Midlands’ most populous county sees more overdose deaths but posts the lowest diagnosis rate for addiction statewide.
Those are among the findings of researchers with the S.C. Center of Excellence in Addiction, who are dissecting the data to help cities and counties come up with potential solutions.
A finding for Georgetown County, for example, is that people seeking help could stay in treatment if they had transportation to get there. And patients in Richland County could benefit from more doctors and first responders being trained in recognizing the signs of addiction and knowing who to call.
The center isn’t actually a place. It’s a partnership between the state agencies for public health and addiction services and South Carolina’s three research universities: the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, and the Medical University of South Carolina.
The group acts as the state’s information clearinghouse in the battle against the national opioid crisis, according to its director Jodi Manz.
It was created by an agreement signed three years ago as the state began collecting millions of dollars annually from South Carolina’s eventual $750 million share of legal settlements with the makers and distributors of opioid medications. The goal of the research center is to help local governments receiving money decide how to best spend it to save lives.
USC researchers began by gathering and analyzing public data from the state’s Medicaid rolls and uninsured patients. The state doesn’t require private insurance companies to report.
The team at Clemson steps in next, helping counties and cities form plans and track effectiveness once they establish programs. The idea is to use the data to expand successful approaches and correct those that aren’t.
“It’s about monitoring data over time because that’s what everyone wants to see is how is this working,” said Sara Goldsby, director of the state Office of Substance Use Services.
South Carolina to receive nearly $73 million from national opioid settlement

“Our core purpose is to maximize those dollars,” she told the SC Daily Gazette.
Rather than hiring an out-of-state consultant, the center means South Carolina is doing this prep work in house and at a lower cost, she said.
And MUSC gives these city and county employees, who dole out the funds but often don’t have a background in addiction treatment, ongoing training and a monthly virtual meeting space to talk with other administrators about their progress, Manz said.
The settlement money, coming in installments over two decades, began arriving in 2022, when the Legislature passed a law creating a nine-member board to oversee the distribution.
In 2023, the Legislature provided $2 million through the state budget to officially open and ramp up the center.
It’s also received grants from the settlement pool — $1 million each of the last two years. The board recently approved a third round, Manz said.
In addition to helping cities and counties, the center also helps doctors directly.
It operates a hotline that medical personnel can call during regular working hours, connecting them to a specialist in treating addiction.
SC Chief Justice talks caseloads, magistrate system changes in first ‘State of the Judiciary’

A general practitioner might have a patient come into their office with the flu but also admit they’re addicted to painkillers. Those doctors may know how to treat a wide swath of common diseases, Manz said, but don’t specialize in treating addiction.
Or an emergency room nurse can administer naloxone to an overdose victim or tell when someone is going through signs of withdrawal, but they might not always know what to do next. The larger hospital systems, such as Prisma Health, have specialized teams in-house. But small, rural emergency departments often don’t, Goldsby said.
The hotline option gives health care workers the option to phone an expert for a consultation.
Building up in-hospital teams is also one way many counties and cities are choosing to spend their own opioid funds, according to records on the opioid board’s website.
Goldsby said the opioid dollars also have brought programs into South Carolina not previously available in the state.
A big one is efforts to set up medication treatment programs in county jails. These programs provide medicines, such as methadone, to opioid-addicted inmates. The medicine brings down cravings gradually so a person doesn’t go into withdrawal, which often comes with nausea, vomiting, anxiety and insomnia — symptoms that can cause problems in a jail population.
Manz also highlighted a program set up by the Mount Pleasant Police Department that sends people to treatment instead of jail.
If an officer is about to arrest someone for a minor drug crime, they’re trained to bring in a treatment specialist first. The specialist tries to get that person medical help for an addiction they can’t control rather than involving them in the criminal justice system.
Care for opioid-addicted mothers and infants is one way SC is spending opioid settlement dollars

Goldsby said jails were among the first to start making use of opioid settlement dollars. These programs didn’t exist before the settlement, she said, because jails weren’t eligible for any of her agency’s federal grant money.
“Cities and counties had been asking for resources for a very long time,” she said. “Federal money can’t be used behind the walls.”
A mobile treatment unit run by Prisma Health marks another success story — this one in bringing treatment to more rural areas, Manz said. Instead of addiction patients coming into the doctors office for a refill on a methadone prescription, the hospital system’s team takes transport vans out to meet patients in their homes.
As far as what comes next in the effort to battle the opioid crisis in the Palmetto State, Manz said she expects the center and counties to enter into a new evolution.
The first two years were about finding out what the needs were and standing up programs. This third year marks a shift, she said, as data starts to pour in on what’s working and what is not.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/opioid-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:01:06.781003

(Joshua Bowling/Source New Mexico)New Mexico’s Legislative Finance Committee director on Monday told state lawmakers that social services such as the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are receiving all of their federal funds under the government’s Nov. 12 reopening.
Federal interruptions to SNAP, in particular, led to confusion over whether such a program—which is considered a “mandatory program” exempt from cuts, along with other social services such as unemployment insurance, veteran’s benefits and Medicaid— could be targeted in the first place. The federal cuts sparked alarm among New Mexico’s lawmakers, who convened a special session in November and committed $162.5 million of state funds to cover statewide food assistance into early 2026, if needed.
Approximately 460,000 state residents receive SNAP benefits.
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee at Monday’s hearing told state lawmakers that SNAP, in particular, is a “mandatory program” and its federal funding should not be threatened in the future.
“We learned something new with this latest government shutdown: the mandatory outlays are the ones that are kind of on autopilot—Congress has set up a funding mechanism as well as an allocation mechanism for things like Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security benefits,” Sallee said.. “There are different legal interpretations over whether the administration legally turned off that funding or if it should’ve continued to flow.”
SNAP funding was disrupted over the federal government’s determination that it didn’t have enough contingency funds to cover November’s expense of $8 billion. Several states filed lawsuits protesting the decision and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in late October authorized $30 million of emergency spending to counteract any interruptions to federal funding.
The New Mexico Health Care Authority spent $250,000 to upgrade its IT system and distribute the state funds, Sallee said. SNAP benefits in New Mexico usually cost $81 million per month. The ratio of statewide SNAP cases to each case worker have steadily declined since 2022, according to LFC documents.
Programs that should not be affected by cuts, Sallee said, include SNAP, as well as Social Security, veteran’s benefits, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, unemployment insurance and Supplemental Security Income. Cuts to Medicare are capped at 4%, he said.
Sallee, however, warned lawmakers about the possibility of future cuts to non-mandatory programs, known as “Pay-As-You-Go” or PAYGO. These include Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting programs, Promoting Safe and Stable Families programs and federal mineral leasing. New Mexico, in particular, receives a huge portion of revenue from federal mineral leasing. In 2024, the federal government paid out nearly $4.3 billion from federal mining permits — $2.8 million went to New Mexico, Sallee said.
“I raised alarms on a provision called PAYGO… if Congress increases the deficit, they have to figure out a way to pay for it. And if they don’t, there would be cuts enacted,” Sallee said. “That would mean that a whole bunch of those other programs would have, frankly, needed to have been eliminated for that entire year. What was concerning for us was there hadn’t been much discussion about it in all the talk in D.C. I was concerned it was lost in the shuffle.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6460-1-1024x499.jpg,,,2025-11-18 11:01:06.781003

Oletha Faust-Goudeau, a Wichita Democrat, hears testimony Feb. 26, 2025, at the Senate Local Government, Transparency and Ethics Committee. (Grace Hills/ Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas Senate bill would let inmates seek resentencing after a set period of time based on their age during the offense — an effort to reduce excessive prison time, especially for young offenders. 
SB 255, the “Second Look Act,” would allow inmates to petition for resentencing 10 years after their sentencing if the inmate was younger than 25 or older than 50 when the offense was committed and 15 years after if they were between 25 and 50 years old. 
The bill would also allow petitions 10 years after sentencing if prisoners’ veteran status was not considered, or if they’ve completed all rehabilitative programming required. They could also petition on the effective date of a law that would have shortened their sentence had it been applied retroactively. 
Scott Schultz, the executive director for the Kansas Sentencing Commission, said that if the law was enacted, roughly 4,000 prisoners could petition for resentencing.
  (Graphic by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
He said there are currently 2,831 inmates who have served more than 10 years and were younger than 25 years old at the time of the offense. There are 90 inmates who have served more than 10 years and were more than 50 years old at the time of the offense, and there are 884 inmates who have served more than 15 years and were between 25 and 49 years old at the time of the offense. 
The bill was introduced by Wichita Democrat Sen. Oletha Faust Goudeau. The Joint Committee on Corrections and Juvenile Justice Oversight heard testimony Friday, Nov. 7. 
Goudeau said she heard from the parents of a prisoner in her district who was sentenced at a young age. She said the parents wanted to see their son before they died. 
A yearning to see family was echoed across testimonies from both prisoners who wrote in and and a mother of a prisoner. 
“My youngest, and only son Robert was sentenced at just 23 years of age to a 38-year sentence,” Dania Long testified. “He has now served over 10 of those years. I am not here to say he’s innocent. He made mistakes, as so many young people do. He was immature. His brain was still developing, and he was impulsive. However, the young man who went into prison at 23 is not the same person who sits there today.”
She continued: “Robert has grown, he has matured, and he has reflected deeply on his choices and the harm they caused. He is taking responsibility. He just needs the opportunity.” 
Robert Long and two other young co-defendants were charged with robbery and battery in 2016. 
“A second chance would give me an opportunity to amend the wrongs I have done in my life,” wrote Dean Bolen Jr., who is currently serving a 25-years-to-life sentence in a child sex case. 
He’s 47 now, went to prison at 30, and could be released at age 56 at the earliest. 
  (Graphic by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
Bolen Jr. and the eight other prisoners who wrote testimony outlined the steps they’ve taken to better themselves, with most pointing to a strong religious influence. Some reflected on their childhoods. 
Ronald Beard was 21 when he was charged with murder. He’s 38 now. He wrote about being homeless, stealing food and getting jumped. He felt like his whole world was his friends: “We shared the same hurt, and brokenness.” 
“Yes I was a gang member. Due to abandonment issues of my dad going to prison. I was hurt as a child, and I didn’t know how to talk about my hurt,” he wrote. 
Curtis Coleman also wrote about his upbringing. He was convicted when he was 15 years old and has spent 27 years in prison for the murder of a 10-year-old girl. 
“Growing up in Kansas City, Kansas there were so many outlets for a young person trying to find his/her way. But for me, those outlets were already chosen for me,” Coleman wrote. “My father was a well known street dude in every sense of the words, my mother young with 3 kids and a fourth on the way while she was blindly committed to a man that wasn’t ready to be a father nor committed to anything other than himself.” 
Recent investigations have left some convinced Coleman’s conviction was the result of corruption. Coleman’s case is entangled with disgraced 1990s Kansas City, Kansas, police detective Roger Golubski — who was accused of misconduct, including forcing confessions from young Black men. Golubski died by suicide the day his trail was to begin. 
Coleman didn’t address the corruption in his letter. Instead, he asked for a second chance. 
“If given a second chance, (I would be) continuing to be part of the solution, and do my best to help change the direction of many misguided and traumatized people,” Coleman wrote. 
Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, supported the Second Look Act. Daniel Landsman, the nonprofit’s vice president of policy, testified that the Second Look Act in D.C. is the “best second look act mechanism in the nation.”

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Weeks after a pro-marijuana group sued the DeSantis administration in the Florida Supreme Court for allegedly slow-walking the process to put an amendment on the ballot, Florida election officials announced that they have taken that step.
Attorney General James Uthmeier asked the court in a brief Tuesday to dismiss the case because, a day earlier, Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews completed the step that Smart & Safe Florida sued the state over in late October.
This involved issuing a letter acknowledging that the organization had enough support to advance its proposal to legalize recreational marijuana.
“The sole relief sought by Smart & Safe’s petition is an order ‘compelling Respondents to issue the … letter, thus advancing the [Initiative] Petition,'” the state’s response petition reads. “Respondents have now sent the demanded … letter to Smart & Safe and submitted the initiative petition to the Attorney General.”
This is the second lawsuit Smart & Safe had filed against the DeSantis administration over its proposal, and came months after the pro-marijuana group nearly legalized recreational use of the drug during the 2024 election cycle. Although the initiative garnered 56% support from Floridians, it fell short of the 60% threshold needed to become part of the state Constitution.
That failure came on the heels of a massive and expensive statewide campaign by Gov. Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey DeSantis, and other top officials who were vehemently opposed to legalizing weed, alleging in a slew of press conferences that everything from the smell to corporate greed would damage the state.
Uthmeier, the governor’s former chief of staff, came under fire after his political committee to defeat the amendment received millions that originated from a Medicaid settlement doled out to Casey DeSantis’ charity, Hope Florida.
A grand jury is now reportedly investigating the DeSantis administration’s role in defeating the 2024 measure and Hope Florida’s financials.
What happened?
In Smart & Safe’s Oct. 31 lawsuit against the state, the organization claimed it had notified Matthews and Secretary of State Cord Byrd in August that the proposal had secured more than three times the number of verified petitions (more than 660,000) needed to make it to the ballot.
Smart & Safe had asked the officials to take the next step in the ballot initiative process, which would be to send Smart & Safe a letter acknowledging that its petition had enough signatures, so that the state could submit the proposal to the attorney general, who then would forward the initiative for Supreme Court review. The organization needs 880,000 signatures total to win a ballot space.
But that didn’t happen.
Smart & Safe, in its petition demanding the Florida Supreme Court force the state to send the letter, alleged that Florida was purposely roadblocking the marijuana amendment by attempting to stall out Smart & Safe’s proposal, the Phoenix previously reported.
That referred to Byrd’s Oct. 3 order to county supervisors that they trash as many as 200,000 signatures — nearly one-quarter of what’s needed to qualify for next year’s ballot — because organizers failed to provide the entire amendment to people it reached out to by mail.
This was the basis of Smart & Safe’s Oct. 19 suit against the administration in circuit court.

In north Jackson and rural areas of Hinds and Madison Counties, some residents can vote in a runoff for the Senate District 26 seat, vacated by former state Sen. John Horhn when he became mayor of Jackson in July. 
The candidates in that runoff election are Canton municipal judge Kamesha Mumford and attorney Letitia Johnson, who received 39% and 28%, respectively, in a special election earlier this month. 
Mumford, who also owns a small business, has described herself as a “quality of life“ candidate who will advocate for improvements to infrastructure, public safety and education.  
Johnson, a former Jackson Public Schools board member, has pledged to advocate for Mississippi’s public education system, calling it her “largest priority” in the face of legislation to divert state funds to private schools. 
In portions of Leflore, Panola and Tallahatchie counties, voters can participate in the runoff for the Senate District 24 seat, vacated by former state Sen. David Jordan when he retired from the Legislature in July. 
The candidates are Curressia Brown, a retired college educator and administrator, and Justin Pope, a corporate deputy with Progressive Health Group. 
Brown on social media says she advocates expanding Medicaid access to the working poor, funding education fully and strengthening the public employee pension system. 
Pope on social media says that, if elected, he would bring accountability, responsibility and transparency to his legislative district and work to ensure the district has a “ strong voice in Jackson.”
Voters in Hinds County can also participate in the special runoff election for county coroner between Jeramiah Howard and Stephanie Meachum. Howard is the county’s current interim coroner. Meachum is the office’s former manager and currently runs the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics.

That lack of movement on Assembly Bill 4, which would authorize the state’s largest ever public subsidy and massively expand the state’s transferable tax credit  program, was not unexpected. Procedural rules in the Senate, where the bill currently sits, made it so lawmakers could not vote on the bill Monday without first voting to declare the bill an emergency measure — a motion that would require two-thirds approval.
A vote by the Senate could come as soon as 11 a.m. on Tuesday. The bill only needs a simple majority of the chamber’s 21 members to pass.
At least two state senators are confirmed as having physically left the Legislative Building and rumors abound that additional senators have obligations in the upcoming days. It’s unclear if they might return for the vote or vote remotely as done in the Assembly, where the 22-20 vote included two members permitted by Speaker Steve Yeager to vote remotely.

(Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)A group of Democratic secretaries of state in a letter to top Trump administration officials say they’re concerned the administration misled them about how it would use voter data collected from their states.
The letter, dated Tuesday, is addressed to Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, and Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Justice, overseen by Bondi, in recent months has demanded voter information from numerous states. The information would allow the DOJ to evaluate state compliance with federal voting laws, department officials had said.
But federal officials later acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens as a way to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
The secretaries in their letter express “immense concern” about how the information is being shared, and they “seek clarity on whether DOJ and DHS actively misled election officials regarding the uses of voter data.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter is signed by Colorado’s Jena Griswold as well as Adrian Fontes of Arizona, Shirley Weber of California, Shenna Bellows of Maine, Steve Simon of Minnesota, Francisco Aguilar of Nevada, Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico, Tobias Read of Oregon, Sarah Copeland Hanzas of Vermont, and Steve Hobbs of Washington.
The secretaries fear Trump officials could misuse the information.
“Is the administration collecting in an unprecedented way mass voter data and dumping it into an untested, unverified federal system to spread voter disinformation — disinformation to undermine our elections?” Griswold said in an interview with Newsline.
DHS operates Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, which can identify the citizenship status of a person. The system can be prone to errors.
“We would like to know what the Trump administration is doing with voter data, and I am proud to stand with nine other secretaries of state to demand answers and accountability,” Griswold said. “We ultimately would like to know what the Trump administration is doing and whether they’re taking appropriate steps required under the law to protect voter information.”
The secretaries of state met with senior DOJ and DHS officials twice, on Aug. 28 and Sept. 11, according to the letter. A DOJ official during the first meeting told the secretaries the department intended to use voter data “to assess compliance with the voter list maintenance provisions of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).”
On Sept. 11, Heather Honey, an election conspiracist who is a Homeland Security “election integrity” official, told the secretaries the department had not requested voter data and had no intention of using it, the letter says.
“The same day, DHS publicly contradicted her representation and confirmed that they had received this data and would input it into the unproven and potentially insecure citizenship-check system, SAVE,” the letter says.
The secretaries request details on the sharing of voter data between federal agencies, the security of the information, and contradictory statements by federal officials. They request a response by Dec. 1.
Sweeping requests for information
The DOJ has sent requests for voter data to at least 40 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The request to Colorado in May was among the most sweeping — it sought “all records” related to the 2024 election, among other information.
In response, Griswold’s office supplied two copies of the state’s master voter list — one from 2022 and one from May — and one copy of the master voter history list dating from after the election in November 2024. The data includes the names of voters, their residential addresses, birth year, and, if provided by the voter, phone numbers — all public information. It does not include a voter’s social security number, driver’s license number, month and day of birth, signature or email address.
Other states, including Maine, refused to hand over any information. New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state David Scanlan, citing a state prohibition, said he wasn’t authorized to provide the DOJ with his state’s voter roll.
Voters in Colorado are less vulnerable to misuse of their information than those in some other states, from which federal officials specifically requested sensitive information such as driver’s licenses and social security numbers, Griswold said. But the voter data requests are just one of many ways the Trump administration has “made our elections less secure,” she said.
In March, Trump issued an executive order that, though a court has blocked key parts of it, would disenfranchise millions of Americans if it were implemented, according to voter advocates. The administration has dismantled federal entities that had worked to support election security or counter foreign election disinformation. It is attempting to eliminate mail-in ballots, which are used by virtually every voter in Colorado. It is trying to free Tina Peters, the election-denying former Mesa County clerk who is serving a prison term for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment. 
“I do think it’s very important for elected officials to stand up whenever they can,” Griswold said. “It’s all these small situations that grow on top of each other, and we can’t ignore what’s happening at large. And in this situation, I’m proud that 10 of us are coming together and saying we demand answers from Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem to shine light on whatever the Trump administration is doing with this data.”

David Nelson will not run for re-election to the state House district covering Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Government Hill, he confirmed in a Monday phone call.
Nelson initially announced his decision on social media, saying that his choice was driven by his upcoming marriage.
“Next summer, Breanna and I will be getting married,” he wrote in the statement, “and together we’ll be focusing on the life we are building. We’ve been best friends since we met as students at UAA and have unwaveringly supported and encouraged each other as we built our careers.”
By phone, Nelson said the wedding will take place in Palmer in August.
In recent years, Nelson and Anchorage Democrat Cliff Groh have traded the state House seat that covers JBER. Nelson defeated Rep. Gabrielle LeDoux, R-Anchorage, in 2020 and served until he was defeated by Groh in 2022. Nelson defeated Groh in 2024, and Groh has already signed up to run for the seat again in 2026.
If Groh were to win the seat, it would give Democrats an additional vote in the Alaska House of Representatives, increasing the odds that a coalition majority would continue to control the House. 
A coalition of independents, Democrats and moderate Republicans has controlled the House since the 2024 election, and Nelson has been a member of the House’s 19-person Republican minority caucus. 
In the House, Nelson has been a reliable supporter of the U.S. military and has both sponsored and voted for bills intended to ease the return of veterans into civilian life. 
This year, he also sponsored a bill intended to legalize sports gambling by cellphone in Alaska. That proposal has not yet advanced.

This photo was taken Nov. 10 (Wiley Price/St. Louis American).
On May 16, a ruthless tornado tore through parts of St. Louis city, county and the Metro East. In less than 30 minutes, the storm carved a 20-mile scar across north St. Louis, flattening blocks in Fountain Park, Penrose, the Ville and Kingshighway West. Nearly 5,000 homes, churches and businesses were destroyed, with damage estimates topping $1.6 billion.
Six months later, the city is still in the midst of healing — physically and emotionally. The most powerful storm to hit in nearly a century left some neighborhoods unrecognizable. Yet amid the devastation, St. Louisans have shown remarkable strength and generosity, with thousands pitching in to deliver food, clear debris and comfort neighbors where official help lagged.
Across north St. Louis, recovery remains slow and uncertain. But stories of resilience and community continue to define the city’s long road home.
 Faith, loss and rebuilding

When the tornado struck, DeMarco Davidson, executive director of Metropolitan Congregations United, was inside Centennial Christian Church in Fountain Park. The storm reduced it to rubble, killing beloved church member Patricia Ann Penelton.
“It’s hard to believe it’s been six months,” Davidson said. “Sometimes it feels like a year ago; other times, like yesterday.”
He’s still recovering from back and hip injuries. “I was the last person to see Mrs. Pat alive,” he said. “That connection will always stay with me.”
Nine members from his home church, St. John’s UCC, dug him out of the rubble. “God is community,” Davidson said. “When I saw how people showed up, I knew I had to keep doing the work.”
That work now includes organizing food networks and faith partnerships to support families still struggling — what he calls his “survivor’s responsibility.”
A few blocks away, Larry Gray was sitting in his truck when the storm hit.
“I laid down in my truck. It only seemed to last two minutes, but when I looked up, almost everything was destroyed,” he said.
His rented home was spared demolition but suffered heavy roof damage. “If they’d gone inside, they probably would have condemned it,” he said.
The next morning, Gray fired up his grill to cook for neighbors. What began as an act of kindness became a community ritual. On cold mornings, he’s still outside with a blackened half-barrel smoker, flipping burgers and handing out free clothes and household goods.
“It wasn’t a plan,” he said. “It started with me feeding my neighbors. People started bringing more food, and it grew.”
Now, cars pull up for hot meals or to drop off donations. “It feels nice when someone comes along who doesn’t have a coat and you can give them one,” Gray said. “God put this in my hands.”
A few miles away, contractor Erion “Prop Man” Johnson launched a tiny home initiative to teach teens construction skills while building temporary housing for displaced residents.
“It showed we can do things that seem impossible,” Johnson said. “North and West St. Louis can come from this — we’re going to do it together.”
 ‘Pretty much on me’

When the tornado hit, Rochel Starling was away on a women’s retreat in Kentucky. She had an international trip planned immediately after, keeping her away for two more weeks. By the time she returned, her house was unrecognizable.
“My chimney had fallen, splitting my den in half,” she said. “My roof was gone, two trees were uprooted, every ceiling on the second floor except one had fallen in — and all the ceilings on the first floor except for two.”
Without insurance — her policy lapsed two years earlier — Starling was left to rebuild alone. “All the companies helping people, I missed them,” she said. “When I came back, it was pretty much on me.”
Her late grandfather had restored the home “room by room.” Losing it meant losing a piece of him. “The only thing to survive was his dining room table.”
ˆ
Starling scraped together what funds she could: $1,000 from her employer, $600 from the Red Cross, $1,000 from Veterans Affairs and $35,000 from FEMA. She even withdrew $25,000 from her 401(k). A family friend and contractor, Rusty Watts, helped her rebuild one room at a time — just like her grandfather did.
“He understands I’m on a budget, so we’re taking it one room at a time,” she said. “The roof is finally done, and the den is patched.”
Today, she’s staying with her grandmother, mother and daughter — four generations under one roof.
“I still can’t go to my house,” Starling said. “It’s going to be a long-term recovery, but without my parents and sister, I don’t think I would’ve survived. When I saw devastation, they saw opportunity — and reminded me it was fixable.”
Still, she worries about others. “I still see people staying in tents next to their houses,” she said. “We need to figure out somewhere for them to go before winter.”
 Filling the gap

In the storm’s aftermath, city officials urged residents not to self-deploy. Local nonprofits mobilized on their own.
Aaron Williams, president of 4theVille, was leaving Sumner High School’s graduation when the tornado struck. “I had just pulled away from our storefront on MLK 10 minutes before it hit,” he said.
By morning, the 4theVille storefront had become a command center. “I came back with a chainsaw,” Williams said. “That turned into a call for help, then people showing up asking what they could do.”
Working with Invest STL, Dream Builders for Equity, Action St. Louis and others, Williams helped distribute supplies and coordinate volunteers to stabilize homes.
“The major programs hadn’t been mobilized yet,” he said. “What was being offered was what we created — ‘we’ being the community-based and advocacy organizations.”
 The people’s response

Action St. Louis was among the first groups on the scene. Executive Director Kayla Reed said her team knew government relief would be slow.
“We knew folks would immediately need food, water, hygiene products — and help cleaning up,” she said.
Action St. Louis and ForTheCultureSTL helped compile “The People’s Response Impact Report,” documenting how residents “self-deployed” while government systems caught up. Created with the University of Missouri’s Community Innovation and Action Center, the report found nearly 90% of renters and 67% of homeowners in the hardest-hit neighborhoods were uninsured. Between May 16 and June 28, more than 10,000 volunteers cleared debris, distributed 8,000 supply packages and served 21,000 meals.
“North St. Louis is our North Star,” the report declared. “Black families deserve stability, safety and the resources to thrive.”
 Six months later

Some homes are rebuilt; many remain in ruins. In The Ville, 86-year-old Rita Henderson’s historic home — once owned by civil rights advocate Homer G. Phillips — still stands roofless, wrapped in tarp.
Her daughter, Bernetta Thornton, looks down their block on Cottage Avenue. “The neighborhood still looks the same,” she said. “But we’re hopeful. This block ain’t going anywhere.”
City leaders have committed millions of dollars in recovery aid, but rollout has been slow. Thornton worries that recovery north of Delmar Boulevard lags behind wealthier areas.
“The Central West End is back up,” she said. “Their neighborhoods don’t look raggedy like ours.”
Still, Henderson finds faith in her neighbors. “When the kids came around handing out water and saying, ‘It’s gonna be alright,’” she said, tears welling, “we had to believe them.”
As winter approaches, North St. Louis continues to rebuild — one block, one home and one heart at a time.

Though it doesn’t sound like a big deal that Culver City changed the minimum number of staircases apartment buildings must have, this obscure tweak could supercharge urban housing construction in California, supporters say.
As CalMatters’ Ben Christopher explains, nearly every other city in the U.S. requires buildings taller than three stories to have at least two staircases that are connected by a corridor. But in September, the Los Angeles County city passed an ordinance that allows complexes up to six stories tall, under certain conditions, to have only one staircase.
Some pro-housing advocates welcome the shift, arguing it not only could boost city housing construction, but it could also encourage building more attractive units that have more windows and are better lit.

Bubba Fish, the Culver City councilmember who introduced the single-stair ordinance: “This is bigger than a staircase. The vast majority of the world builds apartments this way. We are an outlier. It touches on the housing crisis, the affordability crisis.”

But despite data that found that single-stair buildings and other residential structures have both low and equal fatality rates, critics say the rule change is dangerous because it gives occupants one fewer means of escape during a fire or other emergency.

Sean DeCrane, with the International Association of Fire Fighters union: “What if something happens and that one stairwell is blocked?”

Regardless of the concerns, Culver City is moving ahead with its new standard. It will also likely be the last California city to do so for some time: Legislators passed a law this summer to freeze changes to local building codes through at least 2031. The city passed its ordinance before the law went into effect, giving itself six years to show California how effective this new policy could be.

Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks to the press after California voters passed Proposition 50 at the California Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento on Nov. 4, 2025. Photo by Jungho Kim for CalMatters




From CalMatters visual editor Miguel Gutierrez Jr.:
The visuals team at CalMatters understands the power that photography brings to our reporting. This week, we’re highlighting five photos that show exactly why. 
In the photo above by Jungho Kim, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s profile is illuminated by a distant light, as he addresses supporters after the passage of Proposition 50. The frame is clean and simple and the governor is the focus of this victory lap.
In the first photo below, Jules Hotz captures the intimacy and privacy of voting. She places herself low and uses the empty voting booths to layer the frame. The focus is solely on the voter and their right to cast a secret ballot, a core value of the U.S. 
Next, photographer Fred Greaves takes us underwater for a rare glimpse of the invasive golden mussel. The mussels are clustered on a submerged object and a distorted reflection is visible above. 
In the third photo, taken by me, former Newsom aide Dana Williamson is surrounded by the press as she leaves the federal courthouse in Sacramento. The image captures the frenzy of the moment, as Williamson walks to a waiting vehicle.
Lastly, National Guard troops sort produce at an L.A. County food bank. The slightly tilted image gives a sense of motion and urgency. The red bell peppers stand out against the muted browns of the boxes and the troops’ uniforms.

UC, union still at odds

The union representing 37,000 custodians, hospital technicians, food service workers and other staff at the University of California are wrapping up their two-day strike today.
After 16 months of negotiations, AFSCME Local 3299 is striking for higher wages, better staffing management and housing benefits. Locations for the walkoff include nine universities across the state and nine UC medical centers.
The university system said in a statement that the union has not “presented any substantive counterproposals since April 2025,” and that the UC in June began implementing some provisions of its most recent offer, including a $25 hourly minimum wage.
Union members from the California Nurses Association and the University Professional and Technical Employees were expected to also strike Monday with AFSCME, but both unions reached tentative agreements with the UC last week. As a result, the university system averted a much larger strike that would have totaled more than 80,000 workers. 



And lastly: Sober housing and HOA fines

Newsom vetoed a bill in October that would have let cities and counties spend up to 10% of state homelessness funds on recovery housing, where people live in a sober environment. CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on why he rejected the proposal as part of our partnership with PBS SoCal. Watch it here.
And check out another video based on reporting by CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan about a bill that did pass — a new state law that caps homeowners association fines at $100. Watch it here.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-18 13:34:12+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Solidarity among groups more crucial than ever amid changed landscape on race,Lydia Edwards and Leverett Wing,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/solidarity-among-groups-more-crucial-than-ever-amid-changed-landscape-on-race/,"Since post-Civil War Reconstruction, history is replete with moments of racial progress followed by backlash and retrenchment led by those benefiting from the status quo.","WHEN GEORGE FLOYD was murdered by former police officer Derek Chauvin just over five years ago, it appeared a seminal moment in racial equity was upon us. His murder, not long after the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, sparked nationwide protests. Millions of Americans marched in communities across the country while diverse leaders from across sectors turned their attention and influence towards issues of racial inequality. 
Support for the Black Lives Matter movement was at an all-time high as Black, Latino, and Asian American communities marked a period of significant progress. In Massachusetts, the Legislature passed a version of police reform, while the City of Boston declared racism a public health crisis and incorporated fair housing standards into city planning. Meanwhile, a diverse cross-section of corporate leaders founded the New Commonwealth Fund, raising nearly $50 million for frontline nonprofits. 
It appeared that the country was on the cusp of lasting change when it comes to race relations. 
Five years later, however, the landscape is starkly different. The share of Americans who express support for the Black Lives Matter movement has lessened across all demographics, dropping by an average of 15 percentage points within the Asian and Latino communities. 
Even before President Trump signed an executive order eliminating DEI policies in the federal government, commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts had begun to be scaled back. The teaching of critical race theory in schools has been undermined under pressure from the federal government, while voter suppression measures, which disproportionately affect minority voters, have been passed in states like Georgia and North Carolina. These federal policies, and numerous others, have erased many of our communities’ gains from the past five years. 
Additionally, the cruelty of the Trump administration and its insistence on separating families, hunting people, criminalizing their existence, and mass detention of immigrants has been reserved for immigrants of color — reminiscent of Jim Crow’s cruelty and legal structure. To add insult to injury, the Trump administration’s granting of refugee status to White Afrikaaners underscored its disdain for our communities. 
Sadly, this is not surprising. Since post-Civil War Reconstruction, history is patterned with this type of racial progress followed by backlash and retrenchment led by those benefiting from the status quo. 
While disheartening, this moment offers our diverse communities an invaluable opportunity to work together to maintain, and if possible, regain progress that was made in the aftermath of what was considered a pivotal event. Diverse communities have a long history of allyship to advance social change. 
From the alliance between Latino and Filipino farmworkers during the farmworkers strike of 1965 to cross-community solidarity during the Civil Rights Movement, many of the victories we have won, from voting rights to education, have been a result of our shared campaigns. 
Building on these while sustaining authentic coalitions, however, is an ongoing challenge. Discord between our communities often arises from lack of education, resulting in a lack of empathy regarding our shared historical experiences, hindering trust and cooperation. Additionally, even well-intentioned communities and organizations often slip into a scarcity, siloed mentality, particularly during times of crisis, 
Recent events have highlighted these potential divisions. 
While the majority of communities of color voted for Kamala Harris, the support for Donald Trump by a large percentage of the Latino community left many in the Black community, especially Black women, feeling betrayed. The Supreme Court ruling in Students for Fair Admission v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, which effectively prohibits the consideration of race and ethnicity as factors in college admissions, was organized by conservative activist Edward Blum, who recruited and enlisted Asian American students and parents as part of his decades-long efforts to overturn affirmative action. 
To be accurate, recent polls and studies have shown that Asian Americans, Blacks, and Latinx communities are very much aligned in their views towards affirmative action, diversity efforts, and even police reform. However, the optics surrounding each of those issues has reopened long-simmering perceptions that our communities are often on opposite sides of issues of diversity and racial justice, and that our goals and interests are often not in allyship with each other. 
If our communities do not approach this moment of crisis with a sense of unity, these issues have the potential to create irreparable schisms between us. We need to recruit, educate, and empower allies across all demographic lines as we work to preserve, protect, and grow our multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracy. 
Massachusetts, in particular, has demonstrated this potential time and again. During COVID-19, we witnessed unprecedented collaboration as diverse communities allied with health care workers, labor unions, public officials, small business owners, and corporate leaders to save lives. Innovative funding mechanisms were spawned, including the Asian Community Fund and the Coalition for an Equitable Economy, both of which mobilized millions of dollars in funding and grants for small businesses and community organizations. 
More recently, a multi-ethnic coalition of non-profit organizations, educators, health care professionals, and legislators helped pass legislation calling for data disaggregation to collect data broken down into specific ethnic subgroups within our diverse communities, helping policymakers, community organizations and businesses better understand our needs and challenges. The Dorchester Not for Sale effort brought a multi-racial, multi-generational, and multi-organizational allyship together in an effort to prevent gentrification and change that neighborhood’s development process. 
We should continue to utilize these collaborative, community-led, multi-sector models to develop solutions that address wealth inequality, protect democracy, and expand opportunity. 
This fight for equality will be ongoing and intergenerational. Thus, much of our effort must also focus on our next generation of leaders to give them the knowledge, funding, and tools required to move these efforts forward. Equity in educational opportunities will offer level playing fields and more thorough historical perspectives. 
The movement for educational equity offers a special opportunity for multi-generational and cross-racial organizing, both in K-12 and higher education. Passing legislation similar to Minnesota’s ethnic studies mandate as a model can help ensure all Massachusetts elementary and secondary school students learn about our shared histories of successes, struggles, and losses. 
In higher education, the movement to end legacy preferences unites unions, students of all colors, and working-class white students. Legacy admissions is a practice originating in the 1920s that grants preferential treatment to applicants based on the fact that an applicant’s parents, grandparents, or siblings attended the same college or university – a practice that disproportionately impacts non-white communities negatively.  
Getting rid of legacy admissions is widely supported across the country by both Democrats and Republicans, and by three-quarters of all Americans. Colorado and California have both banned the use of legacy preferences by public universities. It’s time Massachusetts took it a step further to ban this practice at both private and public institutions by passing “An Act Relative to Equitable Higher Education Admission Policies”. 
We can also accelerate pipelines for future community leaders by promoting and investing in programs similar to The Coalition for Anti-Racism and Equity’s and Commonwealth Seminar’s “Leadership Next Gen” initiative, which provides paid fellowships and a program offering classroom training and real-life experience in community-based organizations and legislative offices.  
We must empower our next generation of entrepreneurs and investors by creating new funding streams prioritizing investments in diverse communities. Partnering with community development financial institutions like Boston Impact Initiative, alongside diverse venture capital firms like BLCK VC, A2C-Boston, and Visible Hands, will ensure that catalytic capital flows to our start-ups and entrepreneurs. 
Now more than ever, embracing intersectional, multi-racial solidarity is essential because all our interests are interconnected. Our current state of affairs offers an invaluable opportunity for people in the Black, Indigenous, Asian, and Latino (often referred to as BIPOC) communities to engage in dialogue, allyships, and creative, intersectional action to ensure more diverse pipelines to academic, professional, and economic resources and to build and strengthen relationships between our communities. 
We need to champion an abundance mindset and one that is rooted in collaboration and empowering our next generation of leaders as we double down in our efforts to protect and fearlessly advance diversity, equity, and inclusion as a vital tool to build the equitable society we envision.

Anonymous sources told NBC News a “growing frustration with the pace of daily arrests” among President Donald Trump’s top aids has prompted the internal shakeup. 
Once complete, Border Patrol’s power grab of its sister agency will likely mark a dramatic shift in how immigration agents conduct enforcement operations.  Don’t expect improvements.
People who live in California’s southern borderlands have experienced decades of the Border Patrol’s unaccountable antics. Californians should be concerned that this culture of impunity and wide scale fascination with cruelty will drive a new phase of immigration raids.
Los Angeles and surrounding Southern California counties have endured a relentless onslaught of Border Patrol raids. Agents have indiscriminately targeted working people at car washes, home improvement store parking lots and bus stops, where arrest warrants are not required.  
Community members are documenting daily incidents on social media of pervasive violations of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  But Border Patrol agents leading the most egregious enforcement actions often are misidentified as ICE officials.
ICE and Border Patrol, different yet similar
Both ICE and Border Patrol immigration raids have been ruthless. Though not always the case, ICE officials rely on investigations to target people for arrest. They have warrants guiding their operations. 
Border Patrol agents, on the other hand, capitalize on dubious interpretations of “articulable facts” to racially profile people, and sometimes this means targeting a lot of people at once.
The Supreme Court now agrees with this misguided logic — so if you fit a racial profile, consider yourself a target. 
Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, has worked to hold the parent agency of Border Patrol — Customs and Border Protection —  accountable. She is concerned about the possible leadership change.
 “The gap between what Border Patrol does and what is humane, safe and effective law enforcement is so vast that it is unfathomable that the most abusive, unaccountable agency would be asked to step up and lead another, she said.  
Border Patrol’s violence is part of the international record. In a landmark case decided in April, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held the United States responsible for the 2010 extrajudicial torture and killing of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, a longtime San Diego resident who emigrated from Mexico. 
Hernandez Rojas was a construction worker and father of five who immigration agents were transporting to the border. The commission found that more than a dozen Border Patrol and ICE agents assaulted Hernandez Rojas, tasering him multiple times, punching and kicking him while he was restrained, in view of dozens of border crossers. He arrived at a hospital brain dead. 
Later the Border Patrol used a “shadow unit” to alter, conceal and destroy evidence of the encounter.
In June Congress confirmed Rodney Scott as Customs and Border Protection’s newest commissioner. Scott had a senior supervisorial role for the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector in 2010.
At the confirmation hearing, Scott implicated himself in the attempted cover-up of Hernandez Rojas’ death by admitting he signed an administrative subpoena to acquire Hernandez Rojas’ medical records. It is unlawful to intrude into an active investigation, but Scott said he wanted to gather evidence on Hernandez Rojas and this was “standard procedure.”
Hernandez Rojas had hoped for a better future for his children, said his widow, Maria Puga. She believes that Border Patrol officials commanding ICE agents will lead to more aggressive arrests. 
“My family is forever devastated by what they did to Anastasio, and I am worried about our families and our loved ones,” she said. “And just like what happened to my husband, when Border Patrol uses violence, there are never charges against them; there is only impunity.”

Puga is correct in her assessment. Despite hundreds of documented cases of serious abusive practices, not a single Border Patrol agent has been charged for criminal wrongdoing while on duty.
Trump classified Customs and Border Protection as a “security agency” during his first term, allowing  Border Patrol agents to enjoy greater protection from public disclosures should they be involved in malfeasance or misconduct. 
Hundreds of deaths, no prosecutions
A group of nonprofits called the Southern Border Communities Coalition has compiled 351 incidents since 2010 where Border Patrol and other Customs and Border Protection components were involved in fatal, violent encounters, with no accountability. 
These include when Border Patrol agents fatally shot a child multiple times in the back —the child was in Mexico— and when an agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, a mother, in Chula Vista, and when agents intentionally rammed their patrol vessel into a boat, causing a migrant woman to drown off the coast of Encinitas, in San Diego County. 
More recently, Border Patrol agents chased 52-year-old Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés of Guatemala from a Home Depot parking lot in Monrovia on August 14. He was struck by a vehicle and died.
The Border Patrol’s militaristic approach to enforcement has been endemic to border communities. The agents revel in the infrastructure of militarization, from the 30-foot-high border walls to the razor sharp, concertina wire that once was characterized as  “a new way of thinking about border security in San Diego.”
Militarizing interior communities — or the “borderfication” of the country, as Guerrero calls it — is what Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino has been doing in Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities.
Bovino is the face of Trump’s violent raids, and he’s one of the persons charged with overhauling the ICE district offices, which will include San Diego and Los Angeles. He did not respond to requests for comment about enforcement strategies of Border Patrol agents.
Unprofessional and undisciplined
A former Customs and Border Protection commissioner was more forthcoming. Gil Kerlikowske, who was the commissioner from 2014 to 2017, expressed misgivings about Border Patrol’s ability to operate in urban settings, especially as more people protest their presence. 
He suggested Border Patrol agents under Bovino are undisciplined and unprofessional, and that Bovino encourages excessive force against protesters.
“The Border Patrol agents under his leadership come out in a ragtag ambling fashion,” Kerlikowske told a WBEZ reporter in Chicago, referring to Bovino’s leadership. “The direction to the agents at one point was, ‘Light them up,’ meaning they could strike people with pepper balls. I also saw agents picking people up, body slamming them to the concrete and walking away.”
A new study found Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector under Bovino had a higher ratio of use of force incidents to assaults on agents than any other Border Patrol Sector, from fiscal 2022 to 2025, according to the Project on Government Oversight and American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop.
With more than $170 billion dollars designated for immigration and border projects in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill signed in July, including $45 billion for detention and nearly $30 billion to augment ICE activities, we can expect an expansion of egregious abuses —  and a lack of accountability, opaqueness, and zero oversight.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/060524-Mexico-California-Border-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo from Kevin Steele for CFO website)Pasco County Republican House member Kevin Steele announced Tuesday that he is running for Florida chief financial officer (CFO), setting up a contested Republican primary election against incumbent Blaise Ingoglia next year.
In a press release, Steele said he hopes to address the affordability crisis afflicting Floridians and “the pressing need to reign in spending and reduce waste across all levels of government.”
“Florida families deserve a CFO who will run our state like a winning business — smart, tough, and with zero tolerance for waste and corruption,” he said.
“As CFO, I will fight to safeguard every hard-earned tax dollar, protect consumers, and hold state government accountable to the people. I’ve spent my career building companies from the ground up, fixing broken systems, and getting results. I’ll bring that same America First, results-driven mindset to protect taxpayers and make Florida more affordable and stronger than ever.”
Florida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is endorsing Steele.
“Kevin Steele is a proven leader and a true conservative who knows how to get results,” Scott said in the same press release announcing Steele’s candidacy.
Steele is the wealthiest man in the Florida Legislature. First elected in 2022 and re-elected last year, he reported his net worth at more than $307 million in his 2024 financial disclosure forms. Steele founded the Tampa software company DataLink Software in 2001 and retired from the company in 2022.
Among the bills he has filed for this legislative session is a measure (HB 113) that would require all state university and Florida College System institution board of trustees to rename specific roads or portions of roads after Charlie Kirk. If those institutions decline to do so, Steele’s bill calls for state funds to be withheld.
He’s also filed a resolution for a constitutional amendment (HJR 201) that would eliminate property taxes on homesteaded property.
Divided party?
In taking on Ingoglia, appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to succeed Jimmy Patronis as CFO in July, Steele’s candidacy has the potential of dividing the Republican Party of Florida. When Ingoglia was appointed in the summer, he was expected to run against Florida Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters, who had already been endorsed by President Donald Trump. Early polls showed Gruters crushing Ingoglia in a one-on-one contest.
However, Gruters dropped out in August after he was selected to lead the Republican National Committee.
Ingoglia, meanwhile, has received media attention as he travels around the state accusing local governments of engaging in “wasteful and excessive spending,” in a low-level campaign for a proposed constitutional amendment on property taxes in 2026 that has yet to be written.
There has been speculation that Trump will endorse Steele, but that remains to be seen.
No Democrat has filed to run in the contest, according to the Florida Division of Elections website.

For the 2024-25 school year, overall English Language Arts (ELA) proficiency was 56.18%, up from 52.8% in 2023-24. Overall math proficiency for last school year was 33.37%, up over  the 31.15% in 2023-24.
Black and Hispanic students saw increases in these subjects as well.
In ELA, the percentage of Hispanic students graded proficient increased from 40.56% in the 2023-24 year to 44.18% for the 2024-25 academic year. Black students saw their proficiency increase from 36.59% to 40.17% in the same time frame.
In math, 16.34% of Black students were proficient in the 2024-25 year, up from 14.47% in 2023-24. Hispanic students’ proficiency improved from 20.67% to 23.75%
Orr credited the gains to the Literacy Act, passed in 2019, and the Numeracy Act, passed in 2022. Both laws create additional resources for reading and math instruction in elementary school grades. 
“We put in hard stops with the fifth grade for math and third grade for literacy, which brought a whole lot of attention on the early grades in elementary school to help support these students and get them where they need to be in making the additional investments we’ve concentrated on pull-out sessions after school hours,” he said.
Science proficiency saw a slight decrease in the 2024-25 school year sitting at 38.91%. In the 2023-24 academic year, the overall proficiency was 39.04%.
Black students’ proficiency in science increased slightly in the subject going from 20.11% in the 2023-24 school year to 20.34% in the 2024-25 school year. Hispanic students saw a larger increase in proficiency, going from 26.13% to 27.12%.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, called the decrease “flat” in a phone interview Monday and said there was improvement in other areas.
“So certainly there’ll be an area of focus going forward, but we’re pleased with the continuous progress we’re seeing in the federal scores,” he said.
Proficiency is measured by taking data from the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment Program (ACAP). Students are placed into four levels, level one being the lowest and level four being the highest. In order to be considered proficient, students have to rank in level three or four.
On ELA, the state saw 120,173 students in level three (32%) and 90,791 students in level four (24.18%). In level three, 34,057 were Black students and 12,783 were Hispanic. In level four, 13,885 students were Black and 6,609 were Hispanic.
Math and science saw fewer  students ranking as proficient. Only 90,921 of students (23.98%) placed in level three for math and 50,246 students (31.20%) placed in that same level for science. 153,403 (40.46%) students ranked in level two for math and 65,360 (40.59%) ranked in level two for science.
Garrett said legislation including the RAISE Act, which gives additional funding to public K-12 schools to students’ address educational needs; TEAMS Act, which offers eligible math and science teachers up to $20,000 for teaching math and science if eligible.
“We should see continued improvement in those areas of student need, but the goal is, you know, to get everybody proficient. But there’s four levels of proficiency, and rarely do you go from level four to level one, but you work your way up. And that’s what we’re seeing,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo: Nevada Immigrant Coalition)Federal immigration enforcement in Nevada wasn’t an issue listed on Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s formal proclamation announcing a special session last week. But the issue made its way to one legislative chamber anyway, in the form of an initiative from Democratic Assembly leaders that was unequivocally rejected by their Democratic colleagues in the Latino Legislative Caucus.
Assembly Concurrent Resolution 5 would order a legislative study on immigration enforcement operations in the state. It is not expected to be heard or passed, and behind the scenes became a flashpoint for advocates and lawmakers who wanted to see more done to safeguard immigrant families in the wake of large-scale immigration sweeps.
Resolutions are non-binding and do not require the governor’s signature for approval.
Members of the Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus said the resolution was proposed by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) and Majority Leader Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) as a compromise solution without input from the caucus.
“We let them know that we’re not going to be supporting it if it makes it to the floor,” said Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett (D-Las Vegas). “The Latino Legislative Caucus is not supportive of any policy that’s gonna do nothing.”
The Latino Legislative Caucus introduced several bills during the 2025 regular session that could provide immigrant communities some sense of security, including Assembly Bill 217 which would have limited the access of immigration officials to school grounds and records without a court order or warrant. That bill was vetoed by Lombardo.
“The Latino Legislative Caucus has consistently been saying that we need to do something that impacts immigrant families, especially with what’s going on in our state and across the country,” Torres-Fossett said.
Advocates echoed those concerns. Noé Orosco with the Nevada Immigrant Coalition argued a study “would not produce anything that is not already known now, which is that our families are being terrorized.”
Orosco said the coalition reached out to Yeager and Jauregui to emphasize their top priorities, which did not include a study. 
The coalition urged lawmakers to instead ban U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from wearing face coverings, limit ICE enforcement in sensitive locations such as schools, and prohibit state and local agencies from sharing personal data with ICE.
On Sunday, Yeager said the Assembly no longer planned to hold a hearing for the resolution, which was referred to the Assembly Committee on Health and Wellness on the first day of the special session.
“Advocates didn’t want it,” Yeager said.
“It’s a slap in the face of the immigrant community, ” said Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore (D-Las Vegas) of the resolution. “We do not need to study immigration issues. We need to act.”
Dissatisfaction over the lack of safeguards in Nevada for immigrant communities carried over to Lombardo’s signature crime bill. The crime bill passed the Assembly Sunday on a 31-11 vote – six fewer votes than when it was first considered during the 2025 regular session. 
Several Democrats who peeled away cited the lack of safeguards for immigrants in the bill as a major factor for the switch. Reuben D’Silva (D-Las Vegas), who voted for the previous version of the bill, said he was concerned punitive measures in the bill could put a bigger target on immigrants in the state.
“Just seeing the aggressive nature of the federal government going after immigrants, I think this could have opened up an avenue for folks to get caught up in the system and get deported,” D’Silva said. “I’m a formally undocumented person. I represent a district that is heavily immigrant and I just could not morally come to a yes vote again.”
Lawmakers and advocates repeatedly called for the inclusion of two amendments submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada to the crime bill. The amendments would have required the investigation of individuals acting as law enforcement who detain, remove, or restrain people without identifying themselves and prevented the construction of immigration detention centers without legislative approval.
“It’s not just an immigration issue, it’s a public safety issue,” said Moore, who supported the amendments on the Assembly floor.
“I don’t think it’s too much to ask. They were reasonable, and I just feel like it was a missed opportunity to provide more guardrails for our community as a whole,” Moore said. 
Independent of that, Torres-Fossett spearheaded an amendment that would require the consulate to be notified of an arrest. The amendment was adopted but later withdrawn.
Torres-Fossett said she pulled it because she needed more time to work on the language and plans on bringing back the issue during the next regular session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04179-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Despite recent predictions that lawmakers could be facing a $1.5 billion budget deficit when they convene Jan. 14 for the 2026 General Assembly, a new report says Maryland must invest in reading instruction.
The report, released Tuesday by the nonprofit organization Maryland READS, expands on an April report by the same group that called on state lawmakers, business and community leaders to come together to improve literacy.
Despite the state’s ongoing budget difficulties, funding literacy programs is worth the investment, said Trish Brennan-Gac, executive director of Maryland READS, or Reading Education Aligned to Data and Science.
“In a budget deficit, we’ve got to look really hard look at investing in things that work [and] that are going to get us results,” Brennan-Gac said in an interview Monday. “The more that our high school graduates can leave high school with the ability to read proficiently, it’s a better educated workforce that’s available to businesses in our state. Reading impacts a lot of other things.”
The new report, “What are the Stories Behind the Scores?” includes data from test results students took this spring from the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program. While that program saw a third straight year of language arts increases, test results showed that significant gaps remain between demographic groups.
The report highlights one major stat, that more than 94,000 students in fourth, eighth and 10th grades were not reading at a proficient level in the latest round of testing.
“Clearly, maintaining the status quo is not an option,” the report said.
Maryland schools make slight gains on annual report card, but rating system could be changed

The report does highlight three school districts – Charles, Dorchester and Howard counties – that saw some of the biggest improvements in MCAP literacy scores in the state. Summaries are noted on what they did to boost student achievement.
A more detailed explanation of how they did it will be provided by officials from each of those three districts at the Maryland READS third annual convening at Maple Springs Baptist Church in Prince George’s County on Dec. 8. The state’s two top school officials – State Superintendent Carey Wright and state Board of Education President Joshua Michael – are scheduled to attend that meeting, along with Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), a legislative leader on early childhood education.
The Maryland READS report recommends three strategies to improve literacy: greater transparency; funding for a “coaching program” that was approved as part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act this year; and ensuring universities properly train future teachers to be “prepared to deliver effective reading instruction from day one.”
The report also notes improvements in average daily attendance and chronic absenteeism at community schools — those schools with high numbers of students who receive free and reduced-price meals, among various other services. State Department of Education data show 617 schools received that designation in the 2024-25 school year, compared to 453 schools two years ago.
The report said average daily attendance in community schools improved from 91% in the 2020-21 school year to about 96% in the 2023-24 school year. At other schools in the state during that same time period, daily attendance fell from 95% to 93%.
Chronic absenteeism in community schools fell, the report said, from about 30% in 2020-21 to around 25% in 2023-24. During that same timeframe in the other schools, absenteeism rose from about 15% to 25%. The state defines chronic absenteeism as when a student misses at least 10%, or about 18 days during a school year.
The state wants to decrease chronic absenteeism in all schools to 15% during this school year.
Community schools are part of the 10-year Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan. On the last day of this year’s session, the legislature approved a trim to the Blueprint plan that preserved funding for community schools.
“It shows that the community schools, with this Blueprint investment, have made progress in the area of attendance,” Brennan-Gac said. “The idea is that the more kids are in school, they’re going to learn. If they’re not in school, they’re not going to learn.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-18 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Not how funding decisions are supposed to be made’: Mississippi opioid settlement council members favor own organizations for grants,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/18/mississippi-opioid-settlement-council-members-favor-own-organizations-for-grants/,"Of the roughly $142 million requested from applications scored in the top two tiers, over $94 million was sought by organizations with representatives who serve on the council.","In a rectangle of desks outlined by some of the most powerful Mississippians, Andy Taggart took control of the conversation.
The former candidate for state attorney general is a member of the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council, and he speaks frequently at meetings. The group will recommend how lawmakers should spend hundreds of millions of lawsuit settlement dollars earmarked for preventing more drug overdose deaths. 
On that November afternoon in the Mississippi Supreme Court building, as the group discussed how the state should spend up to roughly $100 million, Taggart preemptively asked for forgiveness for monopolizing the conversation. But he had a question for Dr. Dan Edney, head of the Mississippi State Department of Health. 
Edney, a co-chair of the council, sat across the room from Taggart. The Health Department submitted one of 126 applications requesting money, which were reviewed by one of the council’s eight subcommittees.

“I was on the prevention and treatment subcommittee that gave a very high score to the Department of Health project,” Taggart told the council members. The agency asked for about $5 million to expand addiction treatment in rural areas. 
Taggart and his subcommittee colleagues scored the application one tier below the proposals most highly recommended to be funded. He seemed surprised to learn it wasn’t in the highest category.
“Maybe it is Tier 2,” Taggart said. “I gave you a high score, Dr. Edney.” 
“Thank you,” Edney responded as other council members burst into laughter – the type of jesting common among people who work closely together. Knowing that the tiers and project recommendations were yet to be finalized, Taggart continued. 
“My question is, can you help us better understand it?” he asked Edney. “I was impressed, because I knew the heart of what was intended. But I don’t know the mechanics of what was intended.”
Edney obliged, and went into further details about the project. 
The opportunity to explain his application demonstrates one of the advantages of being an opioid settlement council member who represents an organization requesting part of the settlement money. 
Just one floor below where the state’s most difficult legal questions are argued in front of state Supreme Court justices, multiple council members who represent opioid settlement applicants used time to further explain why proposals they closely work with deserved funding.

Those opportunities weren’t extended to applicants who didn’t have council representation, at least at the Nov. 3 meeting. 
“That’s problematic,” Greg Spore, a state public defender and opioid settlement council member, said after the meeting. “Who’s lobbying for them?” 
Of the roughly $142 million requested from applications scored in the top two tiers, over $94 million was sought by organizations with representatives who serve on the council. 
When asked after the meeting about his back-and-forth with Taggart, Edney said he was not and will not be involved in scoring his department’s opioid settlement applications. 
“I was answering questions that were posed to me,” he told Mississippi Today. 
Taggart, who has for decades been involved in state Republican politics, said he deferred all public comments related to the council to its chair and vice-chairs — Attorney General Lynn Fitch, Department of Mental Health Executive Director Wendy Bailey, and Edney. Fitch’s office declined to speak on behalf of Taggart, and Edney and Bailey didn’t respond to Taggart’s email. 

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

The council, only a few months old, adopted a rule over the summer that prevents its members from voting on applications they’re closely associated with. But Matthew Steffey, a Mississippi College School of Law professor, said members have other avenues to lobby for projects they consider important. 
Adopting rules that prohibit applicants from voting on their own applications is the absolute minimum ethical standard, Steffey said. It would be stronger, he said, to require applicants to leave the room whenever their applications are being discussed by the council.
“Most of the persuasion happens before the vote,” Steffey said. 
Michelle Williams, Fitch’s chief of staff, said in an email to Mississippi Today that the council is made up of leaders from a variety of backgrounds related to addressing substance use disorder. 
“These are also the people who may be best able to use the funds to continue their work responding to the opioid crisis for Mississippi and it would disadvantage the State’s response to prohibit them from applying,” Williams wrote.

She added that many council members sought clarification from applicants throughout the review process, but she did not provide examples. Neither Fitch nor Williams answered Mississippi Today’s question asking whether the attorney general believes the council needs stronger rules on ethics. 
Edney said he can’t speak to whether the process has been fair to applicants who don’t have council representation. Bailey echoed Williams’ sentiment in an email, saying it was always likely that council members would also be applicants. 
Two of the Department of Mental Health’s three opioid settlement applications received the highest grades of the 126 proposals. Bailey said she is always open to reviewing and strengthening procedures to improve the council’s fairness and public confidence.
“We all share the same commitment to accountability and integrity in how these funds are allocated,” she said.

The council is set to meet again on Dec. 2, and members are expected to further discuss the applications ranked in the top two tiers and other applications the council flagged at the last meeting. The group is required by state law to finalize recommendations for the Legislature by Dec. 7 — 30 days before the start of 2026 regular legislative session. 
Spore, the public defender, said he wishes many applicants ranked in lower tiers could further explain their proposals to the council so they could share why their aims are important and unique. 
One of them was Grace House in Jackson, which offers affordable sober living as women recover from addictions. Spore said when he worked for the Hinds County Public Defender’s Office, one of his clients entered the program as a condition of receiving probation. 
“She completed the program there, and she was thriving,” he said. 
Grace House applied for $600,000 to create more treatment options for women who’ve recently finished intensive addiction rehabilitation. Stacey Howard, its executive director, said many Jackson-area programs that provided these services have shuttered in recent years because of funding challenges.
The council scored Grace House’s application in the third tier, and the proposal is unlikely to be discussed at the next meeting. Howard said she has received no information about why her organization received the grade it did. 
Because the secondary program was aimed at people without health insurance, she thinks a rejected grant proposal would be a loss for the most financially vulnerable Mississippians.
“If you’ve got money, then you can afford to go places, even out of state if you need to, to get treatment,” Howard said.
Brittany Denson, the sober living home’s operations coordinator and former Grace House participant, said on-the-ground organizations like hers have important knowledge on the prevention, treatment and recovery needs — information the Department of Mental Health has said the state doesn’t have a comprehensive handle on. The settlement money could be an opportunity to further act on that knowledge.

But she hasn’t seen Mississippi fund these types of efforts in the past, which makes her skeptical of the council’s aims. 
“Of course, it’s unfair,” she said. “But that’s expected.”
‘We all have to have well-established practice’
Last spring, the Legislature instructed the settlement council to establish its members, solicit and review grant proposals and recommend to lawmakers which applications should be funded – all in the span of eight months. After multiple delays this summer, ranging from missing application materials to a cybersecurity hack, the committee released its application in August. 
Groups had six weeks to read grant materials, develop an idea and fill out the application. Stacey Riley, chief executive officer for the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence, said the timeline felt rushed. 
The center has a vending machine for naloxone, the opioid overdose-reversing medication, and works to address addiction among survivors of domestic violence. The application Riley submitted proposed a partnership between her organization and four others that serve South Mississippi communities — one that would expand trauma-informed addiction treatment, address other basic needs of those struggling with substance use disorder and work to address community stigma about drug use. 
The application had a typo that resulted in final miscalculations of annual costs and total requests. But the two lines above the final calculation show the correct cost amount, according to a Mississippi Today review. 
When the council released application grades a few hours before the Nov. 3 meeting, Riley found her proposal listed under “Incomplete Proposals.” The council’s document said the application had “facial deficiencies in the project budget.”
In a recent email to the council members, Fitch’s office said the application’s miscalculated budget figures is the reason why the Gulf Coast Center’s is listed as incomplete. 
Riley said that if she had the opportunity to ask the committee questions about the review of her application, she would have. But the center doesn’t have a representative on the council. 
The Administrative Office of Courts, however, did have a representative who could clarify its request for roughly $61 million to provide more financial assistance for its drug courts — the most money any applicant asked for. Fitch, Bailey and Edney reviewed that application and scored it in the second-highest tier, recommending only partial funding.
Early in the first November meeting, Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice and council member Michael Randolph said he and the other judges didn’t score the Administrative Office of Courts’ application.

But he told the other members he was concerned about that application being scored below other applicants. He said he thought nearly no other applicants had as much hands-on time addressing substance use disorder as drug court employees.
“And yet they’re in Tier 2,” he said.
Minutes later, Taggart said he would like to see the courts’ application moved to the highest tier. Shortly after, Randolph called on the courts office’s director of intervention and treatment courts, Pam Holmes, from the audience to clarify council members’ questions. 
“That’s not how funding decisions are supposed to be made,” Riley said when asked about the interaction. “We all have to have well-established practices that we do not engage in anything that even looks like a conflict of interest.”
After the meeting, Randolph told Mississippi Today that making sure these funds are spent appropriately is important to him, and it’s hard to know whether that will happen years down the line if private nonprofits get money. He said that won’t happen with the drug court application because of strict judicial oversight. 
He also cited a pamphlet produced by the state judiciary office that says such courts have saved Mississippi taxpayers nearly $1.8 billion over 20 years, mostly by diverting people from prisons and jails. 
“Any money that runs through the drug court is accounted for because we control it,” Randolph said. 
Randolph also said not every council member pitched their proposal. Hattiesburg recovery advocate James Moore, whose son Jeffery died of an overdose, worked on a roughly $86,000 application to help fund and improve the weekly bike rides he hosts for those in addiction recovery. It scored in the second-lowest tier. 
After the meeting, Moore said his application was so far down the list that he didn’t know whether bringing it up would have made a difference. But he also said it didn’t feel right to make an argument for his project when other organizations in similar situations didn’t have that opportunity.

That decision could be costly. Moore said the account that funds his recovery rides and other efforts to prevent overdoses in the Pine Belt region, named in Jeffery’s honor, doesn’t have enough money to do much in the immediate future. 
“I was asking for such a very small percentage of what’s available compared to what some of the other grants were seeking,” he said. “That was a little bit disheartening.”
Because Fitch allowed 30% of Mississippi opioid settlement funds to be spent on any public purpose, all of the national opioid settlement money the council oversees must be spent on one of the strategies the lawsuits list as addressing addiction. But unlike the applications from Moore, Grace House and Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence, some proposals that will be further considered may not qualify. 
Two proposals in the top two tiers seek funds for automated electronic defibrillators, purchases that aren’t very effective at responding to opioid overdoses because overdoses impact the respiratory system rather than the cardiovascular system. California’s state government has said AED purchases aren’t allowed by the settlements, and Pennsylvania’s says AEDs are not considered opioid remediation except in particular circumstances.
The Yazoo County Sheriff’s Department requested around $225,000 for license plate readers, tasers and two tablets. While the settlements’ lists mention some permitted uses for law enforcement, they’re focused on officer education and connecting people to treatment. 
Fitch did not answer a question about whether she worried about Mississippi violating terms of the opioid settlement agreements. Williams reiterated that money the Legislature controls that isn’t overseen by the council can be spent on any public purpose.
In a recent email, Fitch’s office told council members that some projects that don’t qualify as addressing addiction “may be funded by the Legislature through a portion of the Fund.” But state law says money the Legislature oversees that doesn’t have to be used for addiction will be spent without recommendations from the council. 
‘Once in a multi-generation opportunity’
Nabarun Dasgupta, a University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health senior scientist and recent MacArthur “Genius Grant” fellow, has used some of his state’s opioid settlement dollars to continue his lab’s work of determining what drugs are on the street and quickly getting that information to those most at risk of overdoses.

While that work is crucial, Dasgupta said it’s just as important to make sure the communities most impacted by the opioid epidemic — many of whom staff some of the small nonprofit organizations applying for dollars — get an opportunity to use this money. Those groups of people scarred by the epidemic will often be better positioned to make strides in ending the overdose crisis than the people in suits on Mississippi’s council, Dasgupta said.
“We sitting in offices and labs aren’t going to be the ones who do the last-mile outreach to get services where they need to go,” he said.
Without hearing from and investing in these last-mile providers, Dasgupta said he worries the money will be wasted — a disservice to those who’ve been suffering.
“This is a once in a multi-generation opportunity to address a longstanding social problem,” he said.
Denson, the Grace House operations coordinator, said the accountability she learned as a resident of the sober living home was crucial for her long-term recovery. She learned to cook for herself, got a job and felt like she became a productive member of society.

Organizations like Grace House have operated without opioid settlement funding for years, and Denson said she hopes that will continue even if the Legislature doesn’t invest in them. But she thinks discounting them for politically connected groups is a missed opportunity to end the public health crisis that has permanently taken many of her friends away.

,California,2025-11-18 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Dana Williamson’s indictment reveals a hidden world of political operatives,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/dana-williamsons-indictment-political-operatives/,"Newsom's former chief of staff is accused of misusing campaign money, lying to get a COVID loan and calling personal purchases, like designer goods and a luxurious vacation, business expenses.","Most Californians probably see the Capitol as a place where governors, legislators and other state officials gather to do the public’s business. That’s true, at least superficially. 
Elected officeholders come and go, but the Capitol has a permanent substructure of men and women who do the real, if often hidden, business of retail politics. Those in the “community,” as some dub it, constantly circulate among its three pillars — staff on the public payroll, lobbyists for interest groups, and managers of political campaigns.
It’s not uncommon for someone to have portfolios in all three. And as the revolving door opens and closes, it’s difficult to discern when and where one role ends and another begins, or even whether there is, in fact, a difference.
Dana Williamson typifies the species. And her arrest last week on federal criminal charges opens a window into the secretive world of California’s professional political operatives.
The 23-count indictment alleges Williamson — who had been Gov. Gavin Newsom’s chief of staff until her abrupt resignation a year ago — conspired with two other figures to siphon money from a dormant political campaign fund maintained by Xavier Becerra, a former congressman, state attorney general and Biden administration cabinet member.
Williamson is also charged with falsifying documents to justify a COVID-era federal business loan, lying to FBI agents and falsely claiming income tax deductions as business expenses — for a lavish vacation and purchases of expensive designer goods.
The two men who were charged with Williamson, Sean McCluskie, Becerra’s former chief deputy in the California Department of Justice, and lobbyist Greg Campbell, have pleaded guilty. But Williamson insists that she is innocent.
It’s the juiciest scandal to hit the Capitol since the FBI’s undercover bribery investigation, dubbed “Shrimpgate,” erupted 37 years ago and sent some legislators and lobbyists to prison.
Among the Capitol’s power players, Williamson has stood near the top, working for three governors, lobbying for various interest groups and running ballot measure campaigns. She is known for a profanity-laced, take-no-prisoners style.
After Williamson was arrested, the question for many Capitol denizens was whether the case would adversely affect Becerra, who is running for governor, and Newsom, who is obviously, if not officially, running for president.
Becerra is a victim but may face questions about his judgment, since he was apparently being fleeced by those he hired.
Newsom’s office says Williamson resigned a year ago after telling him she was under investigation. At the time, he praised her as a dedicated public servant.
If there is something in the case that could harm Newsom, or at least give political rivals some ammunition, it is what happened shortly after Williamson became the governor’s top aide in 2023. According to the indictment, she used the position to intercede in a pending state discrimination suit against one of her lobbying clients, Activision Blizzard, a Santa Monica video game company, and then lied to FBI agents about the case.
In 2022 Janette Wipper, chief counsel of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which brought the case against Activision, was fired. Her assistant, Melanie Proctor, resigned in protest, citing pressure from the governor’s office to settle the case.
Proctor wrote in a public memo that the governor’s office “repeatedly demanded advance notice of litigation strategy and next steps in the litigation” in the case, and the interference “mimicked the interests of Activision’s counsel.”
The Williamson scandal could be a one-and-done incident if her attorney negotiates a plea agreement. Or it could drag out if she insists on a trial and the dirty linen is displayed for all to see, perhaps revealing even more politically embarrassing episodes of backroom maneuvers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091225_End-Of-Session_FG_CM_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)The mostly Black and Latino residents of Windsor Park may be getting closer to relocation into a geologically sound neighborhood, following the final passage of legislation Monday.
Windsor Park was among the “unfinished business” included by Gov. Joe Lombardo in the proclamation for the Nevada State Legislature’s 36th Special Session, which began Thursday.
Senate Bill 6 largely resurrects language from a bill sponsored by state Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) during this year’s regular legislative session.
The regular session bill fell victim to 11th hour theatrics over unrelated proposals. It had passed both chambers, but the Senate was unable to concur on an amendment before it was forced to adjourn because of the state’s 120-day limit to legislative sessions.
SB6 passed the Legislature Monday with overwhelming bipartisan support, receiving a unanimous 38-0 vote of all members present in the Assembly and 19-2 in the Senate. It now heads to Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
State senator lambastes North Las Vegas over sinking homes, personal attacks

Neal described the bill in hearings as legislation that clarifies the intent of the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which lawmakers passed in 2023. The changes include clarifying the boundaries of the neighborhood and revising the eligibility criteria for residents in order to capture all of the 93 homes originally identified for relocation assistance.
The bill also appropriates to the project an additional $25 million on top of the $37 million appropriated in 2023.
Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus (R-Wellington) and state Sen. Jeff Stone (R-Henderson) cast the lone votes in opposition of the bill.
Titus called it a “fiscal boondoggle.” She said she had sympathy for the families of Windsor Park but also thought about the people who lost their homes in the Great Recession.
“Sometimes we make tough decisions, and I represent all Nevadans,” she said. “I have to stand up for all families.”
Neal responded to those comments with an impassioned speech about the history of Windsor Park and the state’s responsibility to correct it, saying she refused to have the story of the neighborhood and its residents “diminished, denigrated or told in a way that is revisionist to the truth and facts.”
Black families were redlined into Windsor Park in the 1960s. Their homes began sinking in the late 1980s after the City of North Las Vegas siphoned water out of the ground underneath them, creating subsidence. The city later passed an ordinance saying they were not allowed to repair their homes. Those were circumstances beyond their control.
“The streets cracked, the walls separated from their properties, the sidewalks broke. And they remained in the property,” she said.
Some residents accepted relocation assistance in the 1990s and were moved into homes that turned out to be substandard, said Neal. That neighborhood of homes is referred to as “Baby Windsor.”
Neal contrasted the Windsor Park bill to the Summerlin Studios bill, which is still snaking its way through the Legislature. The Windsor Park bill passed the Senate the same day the Assembly passed the film bill, which is expected to be the state’s largest ever public subsidy, benefitting Howard Hughes Holdings, Sony Entertainment, Warner Bros Discovery and whatever corporations buy the transferable tax credits made available through the bill.
“We’re arguing over whether or not we gonna help some Black families who couldn’t help themselves, and Latino families who didn’t even know the story” of the homes they’d purchased, said Neal. “We just watched a $1.5 billion deal leave the Assembly for special interests, and you have the audacity to tell me who is deserving? My special interest happens to reside in my district.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windsor-park-with-strip-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo via Rep. Jared Golden)After months of delay by GOP leadership, a bipartisan bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine to nullify President Donald Trump’s executive order stripping union rights from about two-thirds of the federal workforce is expected to come up for a vote in the House. 
In July, Golden, a Democrat, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York introduced a discharge petition, a mechanism that would force a vote on the bill if enough representatives sign on. Before the petition to release the Epstein files, such maneuvers have  rarely been successful. 
But on Monday the 218 signature threshold was reached, with Republican Reps. Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler of New York putting it over the finish line. 
“America never voted to eliminate workers’ union rights,” Golden said in a statement Monday night, “and the strong bipartisan support for my bill shows that Congress will not stand idly by while President Trump nullifies federal workers’ collective bargaining agreements and rolls back generations of labor law.” 
Trump’s executive order on March 27 banned collective bargaining agreements at government agencies with “national security interests.” These include the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Environmental Protection Agency, among numerous others, overall impacting more than 1 million workers. 
The White House said in a fact sheet that accompanied the order that “certain federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda” and that the order was necessary to safeguard American interests. 
The Protect America’s Workforce Act, introduced by Golden and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania in April, is co-sponsored by 222 members of Congress, including seven Republicans. Five of the seven signed the discharge petition. 
But, that doesn’t mean the bill will pass. 
“I’m calling on Speaker Mike Johnson to schedule a clean, up-or-down vote on this bill,” Golden said.
As House and then Senate action awaits, a wide range of unions are voicing their support for the legislation, including the Maine American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. 
“It is unconscionable that the Trump administration has illegally stripped thousands of federal employees of their right to bargain for fair wages and safe working conditions,” Cynthia Phinney, president of the Maine AFL-CIO, said in a statement. “The President’s executive order is a lawless attack on federal public servants providing crucial services to our nation, from servicing Navy submarines and caring for our veterans to providing Social Security benefits to older Mainers, surviving families and people with disabilities.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Golden-Jeffries-Protect-Americas-Workforce-Act-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Photo by Adam Gray/Getty Images)They say sunshine makes a great disinfectant. President Donald Trump told us so back in 2020.
While we know women didn’t ruin the workplace, a la that much mocked New York Times opinion piece, it might just turn out that some women are ruining POTUS’s workplace. Of course by “ruin” I mean shining a giant spotlight on Trump’s name in the more than 20,000 pages of documents, including emails mentioning him by name, turned over by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
Honestly, women were doing a lot last Wednesday.
Arizona Rep. Adelita Grijalva, finally sworn in after waiting 50 days, kicked things off by signing the discharge petition to force a vote to compel the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files. Incidentally, did you know that women who fought in the Mexican Revolution were often called “adelitas?” Grijalva represents 800,000 constituents and is the state’s first Chicana representative in Congress.
Meanwhile, Trump called Rep. Lauren Boebart, R-Colorado, to the White House to convince her to break with Democrats voting to release files on Jeffrey Epstein. Boebart wasn’t the only Republican woman getting attention from POTUS’s camp today. Reportedly, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace were contacted as well.
Nevada’s three Democratic representatives, Dina Titus, Stephen Horsford, and Susie Lee, were among the 218 signatures required on the discharge petition which will compel a vote. (What a relief after getting sold out by Democrat Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen on the government shutdown.)
Trump has wilted under pressure, announcing over the weekend that he would release the Epstein files. This is a potent reminder that bullies hate to be mocked. No doubt the escalating tension with not just Democrats in Congress but an increasing pack of Republicans defecting from his camp played a part. Or maybe it was the Bubba memes.
It‘s important to not lose sight of the real winners in all this. With the release of Epstein’s emails, this is a big moment for survivors of sexual violence, too.
As a rape survivor, I know firsthand how difficult it is to get justice. Most of us will never get our day in court, whether it’s the court of law or the court of public opinion. But all of us carry not only the trauma of our experiences but the societal weight of being disbelieved and shamed. This is why every time the light of truth shines on what perpetrators want to hide, it feels like a bell rings for justice. This time they can’t scurry away like roaches in the dark.
Today I am reminded of Gisèle Pelicot, the 72-year-old French woman who won her court case last year against the more than 50 men who raped her, including her husband. She stood on the court steps and said, “When you’re raped there is shame, and it’s not for us to have shame, it’s for them.”
I am reminded of E. Jean Carroll, who won her case against Trump in 2023 in which the court found him liable for sexual abuse when he defamed her while talking about her allegation that he assaulted her in a dressing room. This ruling, and judgement for Trump to pay Carroll $5 million, was upheld in appeals court. Last week, he asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. Much like his relentless fight against paying SNAP benefits, Trump won’t stop trying to get out of paying Carroll what she’s due.
Most of all, I’m reminded of the press conferences and numerous interviews with Jeffrey Epstein’s victims. The great machine that has conspired for decades to cover up Epstein’s villainy is unraveling now. Trump can’t surreptitiously schedule another military flyover of these 20,000 pages of documents. He can’t stop the memes on social media quoting Epstein agreeing with Kathy Ruemmler saying Trump is “so gross” and Epstein responding “worse in real life and upclose [sic].”
I think it’s hilarious that these historic villains so often make fun of Trump in these emails. The best jokes punch up, not down. To paraphrase Pelicot, these emails are powerful evidence that Trump deserves the shame, not Epstein’s victims.
The thing about being a survivor of sexual assault is that we are often not present in the stories about the crimes that happened to us. Partly, this is because victims get anonymity in court and in the media. This is important for the safety and welfare of victims, of course. Unfortunately, it does have the unintended consequence that we become invisible in our own narrative. The thing that rightly protects us, also alienates us from people’s empathy. People respond to people, not “Victim Number One.” However inconvenient this truth, we have to remember that the reason these emails and files and votes matter is people. The victims are very real people.
Epstein’s victims deserve justice. It is because of their incredible bravery that this whole house of cards may finally topple. I, for one, can’t wait for these victims — many of them women — to ruin this particular workplace.
I love the idea that after everything Trump and his clown car of grifters has done it’s not the 34 convictions, the payouts to porn stars, the insurrection, the plague deaths, the full-bodied fight against feeding children or anything else that gets him — it’s the women, stupid! Even better, it’s the survivors.
Like I used to say for years on my old blog, The Sin City Siren, survivors are warriors. Someone(s) tried to annihilate us — and we survived. We are still here. And there are so many of us that you are almost never in a room without (at least) one of us. If we were to stand up all at once, the ground would quake beneath our feet. Survivors are legion.
If Trump is ever to be ruined, I hope like hell it’s by one of us.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246588156-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

The Middlebury Chapel has played an important role in helping me become the person I am. I write in support of the name change from Mead Memorial Chapel to Middlebury Chapel.
The issue of naming and naming rights can be a complex one, but it is not so here as this case makes its way to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
The name change is a reaction to Gov. John A. Mead’s support of the eugenics movement. While his descendants can avail themselves of distinguished counsel, the very nature of the eugenics movement means there could never have been any descendants of the movement’s victims. The fight is thus an unequal one. It also in the present demonstrates the harm the movement did and continues to do.

I am pleased the Supreme Court is hearing the case.
I know that some of the support for the college’s position relates to the far broader issue of naming rights, but the specific reasons for this name change are in support of righting a horrible wrong. We must never forget that Hitler took strength from the eugenics movement in his endeavors.

Does the seat have a partisan lean?
District 38 is solidly Republican. Wood won in 2022 with almost 90% of votes against Libertarian Charles Temm Jr. She won with about 70% of votes in 2018 against Democrat Brian McGee.
What happens after Tuesday?
The Republican nominee will face Democratic nominee Hazel Floyd, 21, in a general election on Feb. 3. Floyd is campaigning on boosting business development beyond Valley city limits, strengthening public education funding and supporting farmers.
Will the results alter control of the Legislature?
No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May, including Wood. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24.

Costs have outpaced what most families can manage, especially during pregnancy and a baby’s first year, when financial stress hits hardest. Many new parents are forced to return to work within weeks and go without essentials simply to stay afloat.
Despite our state’s prosperity, there are disparities in birth outcomes and mental health among low-income, Indigenous, and Black families. Washington now has the second-lowest fertility rate in the country and is seeing its lowest birth rates in decades, underscoring the financial and caregiving barriers families weigh when considering having a child.
A statewide direct cash-transfer pilot for pregnant people and new parents will help ensure that those who do choose to grow their families can do so with stability, dignity, and support. The earliest months of life shape everything that follows.
Michigan just showed the country what’s possible. In Flint, the Rx Kids program delivered unconditional cash during pregnancy and babies’ first year and saw an 18% drop in preterm births, a 27% reduction in low birthweights, and roughly a 29% decline in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admissions. That reduction alone prevented nearly 60 costly hospitalizations a year and generated an estimated $6.2 million in healthcare savings. Families also reported dramatic financial and mental-health gains, including a 91% reduction in evictions and fewer positive screens for postpartum depression.
We’ve also tested guaranteed income locally.
In Tacoma, the Growing Resilience in Tacoma, or GRIT, pilot provided $500 a month for 13 months to 110 single parents in the city’s highest-need ZIP codes. Funded in part by Mayors for a Guaranteed Income in partnership with the city of Tacoma, the pilot showed families became more financially resilient and improved their employment opportunities. 
Building on that success, a second phase launched with $1.9 million in state funding, expanding support to additional Tacoma neighborhoods and nearby Parkland and Spanaway. Betty Ann, a Tacoma mother, used her payments to repair her car and keep her job and family on track.
Another privately funded program is supporting a cohort of families starting in pregnancy. The Nest, run by Hummingbird Indigenous Family Services, pairs no-strings cash with Indigenous-centered care such as doulas, home visits, and cultural programming.
One hundred fifty Native and Pacific Islander parents in King and Pierce Counties and on the Tulalip Reservation receive $1,250 a month through their child’s third birthday, up to $45,000 total. Nest funding helped Hj-lynn Hiteuo in Federal Way stay home with her newborn for several months instead of rushing back to work.
We write this as community partners who didn’t wait for someone else to act. When we first learned about Flint’s approach, our immediate reaction was: this is exactly the kind of support Washington’s families deserve. A predictable check brings down the temperature at home: enough gas to get to prenatal appointments, a repair so mom can keep her job, a few weeks of breathing room.
Washington needs a statewide direct-cash pilot now for new parents and families expecting children. Philanthropy has a critical role to play, and more partners must step up. Perigee Fund has already contributed $50,000 to the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services to develop a proposal and bring agencies, community partners, and parents together to scale this proven model. Lawmakers could match that leadership by committing resources in the upcoming session to a statewide pilot.
Some argue we can’t afford it. But Washington’s future depends on investing in families at the very beginning of life. Supporting parents in the earliest months is not only the right thing to do, it is the foundation for healthier children and stronger communities.
We’ve seen how direct cash gives parents breathing room and saves millions in avoidable costs. The choice is clear: invest now or pay more later for preventable crises. Let’s choose families and a stronger future for Washington.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1253306537-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Getty Images)Indiana has a transparency and misinformation “problem” when it comes to data centers, Hoosier energy leaders heard Wednesday.
“This stuff is generating astronomical amounts of money for localities,” data center developer Tom Dakich said. “We do a bad job of bringing the transparency of those numbers, and the numbers are staggering.”
Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroads data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.
The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.
The Strategic Energy Growth Task Force met for the second time on Nov. 17, 2025. (Screenshot of livestream)
He blamed opaque processes and bad information for fostering massive backlash among residents — prompting local officials to pull their support and tank projects years into development.
That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”
Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.
Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.
“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.
Soliday, who chairs the Indiana House’s energy committee, said no clapping, booing or signage is allowed during his meetings — and critiqued chaotic local gatherings.
“What we’ve got to do is, (if) somebody goes after an elected official’s wife at the beauty parlor, put them in jail,” he said. “Because we are becoming, quickly devolving into, mob rule.”
Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s secretary of energy and natural resources, said data centers and other big energy users could help pay for needed electricity infrastructure.

“Why would we not have them build that?” Jaworowski asked. “Because we need that generation in the state and having a third party pay for it, rather than having our ratepayers pay for it, is just a great opportunity.”
The task force also heard from representatives of other big users, like Steel Dynamics, a member of Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers.
 Indiana Manufacturers Association also presented, maintaining that its members are “ready to invest, hire and build” — but only with guaranteed access to reliable and affordable power.
Soliday rebuffed energy supply fears throughout the meeting, calling such comments “disingenuous” and himself “really weary of this.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As a pediatrician and researcher, I’ve had the privilege of providing care for thousands of young patients at Hennepin Healthcare for more than three decades. I’ve also had a front-row seat to study and observe how policy decisions affect child and caregiver health.
Very soon, the enhanced premium tax credits of the Affordable Care Act — which lower health care premiums, in turn helping families to afford health insurance — will be taken away from families. I am alarmed by this development, because I know it puts the health of children and families across Minnesota at risk.
Last month, more than 90,000 Minnesotans who use MNsure for their insurance, including patients I serve, started to receive letters notifying them that their premiums for next year will increase dramatically. For example, premiums for a family of four making $66,000 per year will rise from $1,452 to an estimated $4,477. That’s a 300% increase in one year. No family can afford that.
With high costs of living and stagnating wages, these premium hikes will put health care out of reach for many families. My research with Children’s HealthWatch has shown that forgoing preventive care leads to more expensive emergency room care down the road. 
The persistent, large-scale strain on the health care system from millions of people suddenly losing coverage will, in turn, increase health care costs for everyone, not just those with MinnesotaCare or Medicaid.
These price shocks are paired with uncertainty surrounding many programs my patients rely on to meet their basic needs, including nutritional assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, as well as programs that help cover the costs of utilities, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Losing access to these vital supports strains household budgets, forcing families into toxic choices between going to the doctor, paying for prescriptions, skipping meals or forgoing other basic needs like rent, utilities or car payments.
In our clinics and emergency departments, we see how health care is so tightly related to other needs. I am already hearing from my patients, who are anxious about how they will buy groceries with the impending cuts to SNAP benefits passed by Congress this summer, which will cause some families to lose access to the program entirely. When SNAP is disrupted — even in the short term — families are significantly more likely to face food insecurity, and parents and children are more likely to be in poor health.
There is no “pause” button for health care access in the lives of infants and toddlers. The costs of the expiring tax credits will not wait, and they will not be abstract. They will be borne by the bodies and futures of my patients — our youngest Minnesotans.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5806-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

Made available in advance of a formal announcement planned for Thursday, the one-minute, 42-second video on opens with a 10-second parody of a syrupy, platitude-laden campaign commercial that Stewart interrupts.
“Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. We are not doing that this way. No political BS, just real talk,” Stewart says. “I’m Erin Stewart. I’m running for governor because the clowns in Hartford have run our state into the ground.”
Stewart, 38, who left office last week after 12 years as mayor of New Britain, is competing with state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich for the GOP nomination to oppose the likely Democratic nominee, Gov. Ned Lamont.
She begins with money in the bank and a head start towards qualifying for public financing: As of last month, Stewart had raised nearly $360,000 through an exploratory committee opened in January and had about $290,000 cash on hand. 
Lamont is expected to self-fund his reelection and opt out of the state’s voluntary Citizens’ Election Program, which imposes spending limits in return for public financing: $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for the general election. Lamont spent $15.1 million on his 2018 campaign and $25.7 million on his 2022 reelection.
Unless a new deep-pocketed contender jumps into the race, Republicans are assured of a nominee with experience in elective office for the first first time since Gov. M. Jodi Rell led the ticket 20 years ago. Both Stewart and Fazio will be seeking public financing.
Two wealthy businessmen, Thomas Foley and Bob Stefanowski, were the GOP nominees for open seats in 2010 and 2018, and again in rematches four years later with the Democrats who beat them: Foley facing Dannel P. Malloy; Stefanowski challenging Lamont.
“Connecticut’s been run by the same insiders for decades. It’s the same wealthy, out-of-touch politicians who just manage our decline. It’s not good enough,” Stewart says in the video. “I’m Erin Stewart. I’m a working mom who grew up working class. My neighbors made me their Republican mayor in a Democrat city, and I delivered results in New Britain.”
The video features pictures of Stewart visiting and shaking hands with President Donald Trump in the White House, reflecting the efforts by both Stewart and Fazio to get past their recent histories as Republicans who kept their distance from Trump.
Anticipating her announcement, an independent expenditure group supportive of Fazio sent a mailing last week to selected Republican activists that attacked Stewart’s record as a mayor and member of the Board of Regents for Higher Education and described her as “anti-Trump.”
It used a portion of a quote from Stewart during Trump’s first term, when she was dismissing the ability of Democrats using the president against her: “I have no ties to them, and I’ve been pretty outspoken about not supporting Trump and about not supporting or being in favor of a lot of what he’s done and his approach.”
The mailer was sent by Hands Off Our Schools, a political action committee that spent more than $75,000 last year, most of it on advertising criticizing Fazio’s opponent in his campaign for reelection, Democrat Nick Simmons. The expenditure on the anti-Stewart mailing was modest, said Darren Bruno, chair of the group.
He said he was uncertain of how big a role it would play in 2026. One of its recent donors was Sean Fieler, a wealthy finance executive and conservative Catholic philanthropist who spent about $900,000 on independent expenditures opposing Lamont’s reelection in 2022. Fieler declined comment on his contribution plans for 2026.
Stewart is opening her formal campaign with a rebuttal of the narrative Lamont used last week in beginning his campaign for a third term: On his watch, Connecticut has stabilized its finances, cutting income taxes and using budget surpluses to fill a rainy day fund and pay down an unfunded pension liability.
“When I started as mayor of New Britain, the state and the city were struggling, and now New Britain is back on its feet. Our state is not,” Stewart says. “Connecticut is third in the nation for high taxes. Highest energy prices in New England. Jobs are hard to come by. But U-Hauls and moving companies? They’re in high demand.”
After a burst of in-migration during the COVID-19 pandemic, U-Haul reported that people leaving Connecticut made up about 52% of one-way trips in 2024, compared to 48% moving in. Stewart is correct in describing the high cost of living in Connecticut, though it preceded Lamont’s time in office.
Connecticut’s economic growth of 2.6% in 2024 ranked it 23rd among all states. Its growth of 4.6% in the second quarter of 2025 was 10th-best in the country. The state’s jobless rate is lower than the national average.
“We revived New Britain. We can revive Connecticut. This is not as good as it gets. We can demand better,” she says in the video. “Let’s try something different, and that starts with a different kind of government.”
Her description of New Britain’s revival is certain to be debated during the 2026 campaign. After an initial increase, she largely has held the line on property taxes and presided over a cut in the tax rate after revaluation. The city carries significant debt, though the outlook of bond rating agencies for New Britain has been either stable or positive. 
Like other cities, New Britain is the beneficiary of considerable state aid: $151 million over the two years of the state’s current fiscal biennium. The city’s annual budget is about $273 million.
Stewart proved unbeatable in New Britain, winning every two years despite a Democratic advantage in voter registration. She did not seek reelection this month. Stewart was succeeded by a Democrat, Bobby Sanchez.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/erinstewart-1024x727.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

Specifically, the fight has centered on a Nazi sympathizer who keeps finding his way into the orbit of influential conservatives: Nick Fuentes.
Fuentes, a far-right activist and Holocaust denier, has summed up his political worldview as “hating women, being racist, being antisemitic.” He once proclaimed that Jews “are responsible for every war in the world. It’s not even debatable at this point.”
Yet that repugnant belief system hasn’t blocked his access to a who’s who of the conservative movement — including Donald Trump, who dined with Fuentes and fellow anti-semite Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago in 2022.
More recently, Fuentes appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show for a two-hour softball interview that featured a call for a “pro-white” movement to oppose the “organized Jewry” Fuentes believes is undermining American cohesion. Carlson’s interview elevated Fuentes’ profile, giving his extremist views an audience far beyond his usual following.
The interview also roiled the American right, setting off an ugly debate about who should be allowed inside the tent of the conservative movement. Among those warning against the mainstreaming of Fuentes was Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.
“Listen, this is America. He can have whatever views he wants,” Hawley told Jewish Insider. “But the question for us as conservatives is: Are those views going to define who we are? And I think we need to say, ‘No, they’re not. No. Just no, no, no.’”
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went even further, saying: “If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very, very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you are a coward and you are complicit in that evil.”
The public condemnation of Fuentes and his beliefs from Hawley and other high-profile Republicans stands in stark contrast to Missouri’s other U.S. senator, Eric Schmitt.
Schmitt has yet to make any public comments about Fuentes, and his office did not respond to requests for comment.
There’s certainly no obligation for elected officials to speak out on every controversy, but Schmitt’s silence in particular is raising eyebrows.
First, he has never hesitated to attack antisemitism when it emanates from the left. Why the sudden reticence when it comes from the right?
Second, Schmitt is only a few weeks removed from a speech at the National Conservatism Conference where he argued the United States is not a nation built on ideas but on the legacy of “settlers and their descendants.” Critics heard echoes in Schmitt’s speech of the old “blood and soil” nationalism that underpinned European fascist movements.
And third, over the summer Schmitt hired a staffer who was previously fired from Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign for circulating a video featuring Nazi imagery. That same staffer previously praised Fuentes’ influence on young men, though he later apologized.
Silence doesn’t equal agreement, and Schmitt’s defenders might argue he shouldn’t dignify Fuentes with attention. Why give an extremist more oxygen?
That might be a persuasive if Schmitt had not already brushed shoulders with the ideological world Fuentes inhabits. Once those lines blur, clarity becomes a duty, not an option. Avoiding the issue allows extremists to imagine their views are tolerated within mainstream conservatism.
When the loudest message a leader sends is silence, it can be heard as permission.
Or maybe it’s just cowardice.

This Sept. 10 protest against the plan has grown into a campaign to put it before voters on a statewide ballot (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Voters across Missouri late last week received a text message urging them to take their names off petitions they may have “accidentally signed.”
The message, labeled as the work of the Republican National Committee, dropped the name of Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, saying he had “declared TENS OF THOUSANDS of petition signatures IMPROPERLY COLLECTED.” The text, from a number in southwest Virginia, gave a number to call in southwest Missouri to withdraw a signature.
The number, when called, goes straight to a voice mail system and promises people who leave a number that they will be called.
The mass text was the latest maneuver in the fight over Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting map, which is drawing millions in donations from dark money groups on the right and left — including $2 million over the weekend from a pair of Republican nonprofits. The deadline is approaching for opponents of the map to submit signatures to force a referendum while the question of which signatures to count and whether a referendum is even possible remains mired in state and federal courtrooms.
This text message was sent to Missourians during the second week of November (photo submitted). 
The text messages refer to a statement Hoskins made Oct. 15 that signatures gathered before he approved the form of a referendum petition would not count and gathering them before the approval “constitutes a misdemeanor election offense.”
“We did not coordinate with the RNC with this and it was a surprise to us,” Rachael Dunn, spokeswoman for Hoskins, said in an email to The Independent.
Dunn said she was one of the Missourians who received the text. The number listed is not an official number, she said, and referred other questions to the Republican National Committee.
The Republican National Committee did not respond to a message seeking comment.
 7-1 map

In September, Republicans in the General Assembly muscled through a new congressional redistricting plan intended to give the GOP an edge in seven of Missouri’s eight districts. Republicans currently hold six of the seats and want to flip the 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City since 2005.
President Donald Trump made it a test of loyalty for Missouri to follow Texas in the effort to shore up the GOP’s thin majority in the U.S. House. After a call from Trump, state Senate Republicans changed the rules to limit Democratic efforts to stall the debate.
A PAC called People Not Politicians announced soon after the map was passed by the legislature that it would seek a referendum, which needs about 110,000 signatures distributed across six congressional districts by Dec. 11 to force the plan to a statewide vote.If the petitions are submitted, the map would be prevented from taking effect until the vote.
In federal court, Hoskins is suing People Not Politicians and arguing that a redistricting plan is off-limits to a state referendum because the federal Constitution precludes it.
That legal position has not been heard in a trial and Dunn said petitions will be processed like any other initiative if they are received in time.
It is possible to remove a name from a petition, Dunn said. A voter wishing to do so should contact the secretary of state’s elections office directly, she said, and use an affidavit form provided by the office.
Missouri Republican Party Chairman Peter Kinder, who is also a member of the national committee, said he didn’t know anything about the text campaign when contacted Monday.
“The RNC is very interested in the events going on here,” Kinder said. “They have been following this very closely in Missouri and are interested in it. Whatever they want to do along these lines is fine with me.”
 Money flowing

Almost $7 million has been raised by the two campaign committees preparing for a referendum, almost all of it from outside the state. 
People Not Politicians has raised almost $5 million, including $3.1 million since Sept. 30, with several large checks coming from national groups that also donated to the 2024 campaign to legalize abortion.
The largest donors are American Opportunity Action, which gave $1.4 million and was incorporated and staffed last year by longtime Democratic operatives; the Health Forward Foundation of Kansas City, which gave $750,000; the Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, which provided $500,000; and the George Soros-financed Open Society Action Fund, which gave $450,000.
Put Missouri First, formed on the last day of October, has taken in $2.1 million, with $1 million on Friday from each of two donors, the American Action Network, which aired ads blaming Democrats and Soros for the government shutdown; and Securing American Greatness, formed last year by long-time Trump advisor Taylor Budowich, who recently resigned as White House deputy chief of staff.
 In court

The next two important court dates come next week on Monday and Tuesday.
On Monday, a Jackson County judge will consider consolidating — and perhaps dismissing — two lawsuits challenging the redistricting plan, including one that argues the bill establishing the map is flawed because it places the same Kansas City precinct in two districts.
And on Tuesday, a federal judge in St. Louis will hear arguments over whether the federal Constitution’s directive that legislatures establish congressional districts means no referendum can be held on the plan.
A decision that could come as early as Friday may help decide if a referendum is even needed. Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh heard arguments Wednesday on the constitutionality of the redistricting plan.
Limbaugh also now has the case raising the question of when a referendum campaign can begin. He was assigned the case after two previous trial dates were canceled — once because the original judge was sick that day and again last week after Put Missouri First intervened and asked for a delay.
Chuck Hatfield, attorney for People Not Politicians, said he intends to be in court Tuesday morning to ask Limbaugh to set the trial date as soon as possible. He and attorney Marc Ellinger, who represents Put Missouri First, clashed over the need for a delay when the second trial date was canceled.
Ellinger could not be reached for comment on what he will ask Limbaugh to do. Hecould oppose the motion, saying he needs more time to prepare. In election cases with looming deadlines, Hatfield said, parties are often eager to get a decision.
That may not be the case, he noted.
“I don’t know,” Hatfield said, “if we’re in an agreeable mood with everybody right now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-18 07:57:12.993203

After a brief procedural meeting at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy in Plainfield the pending case against Kleinhelter is tentatively on track for lengthy evidentiary hearings in April.
The Indiana Law Enforcement Training Board’s decertification subcommittee will weigh the charges, and the full board will ultimately decide whether Kleinhelter should be stripped of his law enforcement credentials.
Kleinhelter appeared Monday alongside his lawyer, Jim Voyles; general counsel Raquel Ramirez represented the train board. Subcommittee chairman David Wantz led the four-minute meeting.
The parties agreed to exchange initial discovery by Dec. 30, with additional discovery due by the end of January and a two-day evidentiary hearing tentatively scheduled sometime between April 25–28.
Indiana law enforcement training board to weigh request to decertify Dubois County sheriff

Following the hearing, neither Kleinhelter nor Voyles responded to media questions.
The decertification request was initiated by  the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy and its executive director, Tim Horty, following a monthslong Indiana State Police investigation into allegations of misconduct by Kleinhelter. Although a special prosecutor ultimately decided not to file criminal charges against Kleinhelter, the training board voted in August to move forward with administrative charges of fraud, perjury, false informing and criminal misconduct.
The board pointed to two separate allegations of fraud in the charging documents.
In one instance, Kleinhelter was accused of purchasing employee gifts and directing the jail matron to falsely list the expenses as “training” in commissary records. The sheriff is also alleged to have reimbursed the jail commissary with more than $16,000 following a state audit, but then sought to recoup the money by filing a reimbursement request with the county auditor that falsely listed a State Board of Accounts employee’s name to suggest its approval.
The board also accused Kleinhelter of perjury, alleging that the sheriff signed a nepotism compliance form months after he approved his wife as a special deputy. The training board claimed that could be a violation of the county’s policy around “hiring and supervising relatives.”
Kleinhelter is further accused of false informing for telling state police investigators he received an airline “e-credit” for a canceled work trip — although the airline confirmed he was actually issued a direct refund.
ILEA’s training board noted in the charging document that Kleinhelter’s alleged actions occurred while he was serving in his official capacity as sheriff and could qualify as official misconduct.
Although decertification would bar Kleinhelter from serving as a certified law-enforcement officer, it would not prevent him from holding the elected office of sheriff under the state constitution.

Sara Rodriguez speaks during a Wisconsin Technology Council forum featuring Democratic and Republican hopefuls in the 2026 governor's race Nov. 6, 2025. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The longest ever federal government shutdown that ended last week revolved around a top issue for Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez as she campaigns to be Wisconsin’s next governor: health and health care.
A registered nurse by training and former official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rodriguez has been deeply involved in health care policy, first in her single term as a member of the Wisconsin Assembly and then, since 2023, as the No. 2 official in the state’s executive branch.
And, she says, it motivated her to declare her intention to succeed Gov. Tony Evers after Evers decided to stand down from the 2026 election.
“One of the reasons why I wanted to run is to make sure that we have somebody in a leadership position that, No. 1, understands health care, and No. 2, really gets how unaffordable and broken it is,” Rodriguez told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview Monday.
She also sees a shift in the federal government away from established public health principles, forcing states to take the lead on setting public health standards. In the governor’s office, she said, her professional background would equip her to tackle  those issues.
As  a state representative, Rodriguez proposed a bill in the 2021-22 legislative term to accept the expansion of Medicaid — BadgerCare in Wisconsin — through the Affordable Care Act. Expansion would allow the state to enroll people with incomes between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty guidelines in Medicaid, with the federal government paying 90% of the additional cost.
When the ACA took effect, Gov. Scott Walker was in office and refused throughout his two terms as governor to accept the federal support and expand the program.
Evers defeated Walker in 2018 and promised to accept the federal expansion, but in the lame-duck session before he was sworn in, the Republican majority in the Legislature passed a bill that Walker signed, requiring the Legislature’s approval for expansion.
Since then, repeated attempts by Democrats to expand Medicaid, including the bill Rodriguez authored four years ago, have failed with Republican majorities in both houses of the Legislature.
Another form of Medicaid expansion — covering mothers for a year after they give birth — has the support of bipartisan majorities in the Senate and the Assembly, but Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has opposed bringing it to the floor. 
“We are one of two states that have not done that — us and Arkansas,” Rodriguez said. “And I think Arkansas may be working on it. So we may be the only one left at the end of the day.”
Rodriguez’s political career started with her Assembly race in 2020, flipping a Republican seat in the Milwaukee suburbs. She followed that with her race for lieutenant governor in 2022 and now her  campaign for the Democratic nomination to run for governor in 2026.
Throughout her political life, she said, she has been supported by 314 Action, a political organizing group seeking to elect more scientists and people in science-related professions, including health care.
During the recent federal government shutdown, Democrats in the U.S. Senate insisted that any resolution to fund the government also extend federal subsidies for health insurance under the ACA. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of this year will cause health insurance premiums to double, on average, participants in the ACA marketplace. 
Ultimately, a handful of Democratic senators voted with the Republicans to advance a GOP-authored spending bill that ended the shutdown without addressing the looming health insurance cost spike.
But the issue won’t go away, Rodriguez said.
“We’re looking at a doubling of premiums,” she said. “A 60-year-old couple are looking $1,500 to $2,000 more a month to be able to pay for their health insurance. That is absolutely unaffordable for most Wisconsinites.”
The problem extends beyond just people who buy their insurance through the federal marketplace, she warned.
“The larger amount of people who are uninsured in the state, the higher our health care costs are going to get, because they’re going to wait, they’re going to delay care, they’re going to be sicker when they get into care, and it’s going to cost hospital systems more in terms of uncompensated care,” Rodriguez said.
“If people will go uninsured, it’s going to raise costs,” she added. “And continuing to talk about it, continuing to let people know how that works, is something that I’m uniquely equipped to do as a nurse, as somebody who’s worked within the health care system. And it’s one of the reasons why I’m running for governor.”
Rodriguez said she has seen the benefits that the ACA has brought in the last decade and a half.
Before it was in place, “people delayed care,” she said. “They came in sicker to my emergency department and it cost a whole lot more dollars to be able to treat them and they were out of work because they had to be treated within a hospital system as opposed to going to their regular doctor and being able to get the care that they needed and be able to take care of their diabetes, to take care of their hypertension. Those are the kind of things that the Affordable Care Act has allowed us to do.”
She said she’s heard from small business owners who were able to start a business because they could get health insurance thanks to the ACA.
“Do we need to fix it? Absolutely. Do we need to get it better? Absolutely,” Rodriguez said. “But to get rid of it is going to have devastating effects on health care in Wisconsin.”
Rodriguez said she also brings the perspective of health and health care to other policy topics.
“The medicine we give you, the procedures that we do — it’s such a tiny fraction of how healthy we are,” she said.
Food, housing and “a good-paying job to put a roof over our heads and to pay for the food we eat and to pay for the medications we’re prescribed” are health issues, too, Rodriguez said. That’s why housing affordability, for example, is part of her platform, she said. 
“Tom Tiffany in the governor’s seat [is] not going to put a priority on lowering costs for Wisconsinites,” she said.
She also predicted that, if elected, Tiffany would sign laws restricting abortion in Wisconsin — “and that is going to be extraordinarily dangerous for people.”
Rodriguez views her science background as a strong selling point. “I think we want somebody who’s going to use data and science to make decisions,” she said.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump’s secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, has been “using conspiracy theories as his underlying belief system, and that hurts real people,” Rodriguez said.
She cited surging measles cases in Wisconsin and nationally and the deaths of children in some states after the federal government weakened its support for vaccination.
“That hasn’t happened in a decade, and they’re continuing to feed this anti-science rhetoric that is going to harm our kids here in Wisconsin,” Rodriguez said. “I’ve been clear, I think RFK Jr. should resign. I don’t think he’s qualified for the job that he has and he’s actually a danger to public health across the country.”

Uinta County sheriff said his jail would be used to hold criminals caught by ICE. But relatives and attorney say man’s detention has shattered a family, not removed a threat.
The post Wyoming jails hold father detained in controversial Idaho ICE operation, now suing for his freedom appeared first on WyoFile .","When the raid began, she was tending to her baby in the parking lot of a local horse track.
She looked out her car window and saw that people who’d been watching the race were now fleeing into nearby fields.
Then she heard the helicopters. 
She stepped out of her car. She saw patrol vehicles, SUVs and armed officers descending on the track outside Wilder, Idaho. The horse race was popular with the local Hispanic community, and she was witnessing the beginning of an Oct. 19 operation conducted by more than 200 federal and local officers.
She and her four siblings are U.S. citizens. But as the agents descended on the track, her thoughts went immediately to their father, an immigrant who was present elsewhere in the facility. The woman agreed to share her story with WyoFile on the condition of anonymity for her and her family members, because she feared retaliation or harassment from both federal authorities and people with anti-immigrant sentiments. 
“Oh my God, my dad,” she said, recounting the raid. “He is not coming home with us today.”
She was right. Her father was one of more than 100 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the track, according to Idaho news accounts. 
Her father today sits in the Sweetwater County Detention Center in Rock Springs, after a weeks-long stay in the Uinta County jail in Evanston. He is challenging his imprisonment as unconstitutional in federal court. Last week, his lawyer asked U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl to order the man’s release or conduct a bond hearing, saying he should be allowed to return home to his family, which depends on his financial support, while his immigration case is adjudicated. 
The case, held at the federal courthouse in Casper, is one example of how the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement plays out in Wyoming, even for cases that might originate hundreds of miles away.
No allegations of local crimes
The man has no criminal record in the United States and has not returned to his native Mexico in two decades, his attorney Jacob Rourk said at the Nov. 12 court hearing. The government is advocating for the man’s indefinite detention “without care or attention paid to whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community,” Rourk said. “He is neither of those things.”
Rourk’s assertion, which was not challenged by the government in open court, would mean Uinta and now Sweetwater counties are holding a man whose only crime is entering the country illegally. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have said they are targeting “the worst of the worst” for deportation, and also seeking to remove people who entered the country during a surge of illegal immigration under the administration of then-President Joe Biden. This man appears to fall into neither category. 
ICE arrest data also indicates that nationally, more than 70% of people detained under the Trump administration did not have criminal convictions, according to immigration researchers. 
In June, when Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp announced he’d be lending his jail space to ICE, he said he was doing so to raise revenue to cover salary raises to retain his underpaid deputies, as property tax reductions passed by the Wyoming Legislature cut into county budgets. 
The detainees Kopp’s jail would hold for the federal government “are all ICE inmates with criminal records that are picked up elsewhere… they’re dropped off here and they go on from here, no more than 72 hours later,” Kopp said, according to a transcript of the June 25 meeting of the Uinta County Commission, which was compiled by the Uinta County Herald.

But the Idaho detainee’s family and attorney say that in this case, the jail has been holding a father of five detained amid mass arrests, scooped up in a dragnet — someone who came to the United States and worked, without running afoul of local law enforcement, for two decades to provide a better life for his children.
“He has always said he works his butt off for us, and we can pay him back by becoming who we want to be in life,” his daughter told WyoFile. 
Kopp declined to speak to WyoFile about the case, other than to note the man had been transferred to Sweetwater County on Monday.
Kopp is a defendant in the man’s petition for release and the sheriff appeared in court, where he was represented by an Uinta County attorney. But Kopp is named purely because in a habeas corpus petition, as the motion is called, the person petitioning for his or her freedom names as a defendant the supervisor of the facility in which they are held. Kopp and his attorney did not contribute to the hearing, which featured arguments between Rourk and Levi Martin, an attorney for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Wyoming who argued the federal government’s case. 
Skavdahl has, for now, blocked ICE from moving the detainee out of Wyoming while he considers whether to grant the request for release or a bond hearing. Rourk asked for that order out of concern that ICE may otherwise ship his client between detention facilities around the country, as the agency has reportedly been doing with many detainees, making it more difficult for his lawyer and family to stay in contact with him. It’s unclear why authorities moved the man between the two county jails in Wyoming this week. 
Rourk also asked Skavdahl to keep the case in his court, and if he chooses to order a bond hearing, that he adjudicate the matter himself and not move the case into immigration court. Those courts and judges are not part of the independent federal judiciary branch — immigration judges work under the authority of the executive branch.

Amid the Trump administration’s sprawling and aggressive deportation drive, immigration judges are ignoring rules that allow some people to return to their homes and communities, instead leaving them in detention for months, Rourk argued.
Skavdahl appeared taken aback by the request. “So I should presume that (immigration judges) won’t follow the law?” he asked. Rourk pointed to a case out of Washington state, where immigration attorneys in the Seattle area have accused immigration judges of ignoring a U.S. District Court order that they provide opportunities for bonds.  
Martin, the government lawyer, disagreed. An immigration judge, not a U.S. District Court judge like Skavdahl, should decide whether the man receives bond, Martin argued, if such a hearing is held at all. Martin did not dispute Rourk’s claims that his client had no criminal record, but he questioned the father’s character — accusing him of taking “minors to an illegal gambling operation where he was detained.” 
But the daughter described it as a social event, centered around a horse race. 
Controversial operation
Federal officials have said ICE accompanied the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the horse track operation, which officials described as an illegal betting ring. The track owner and four others face felony gambling charges, according to reports in the Idaho Statesman.
The horse race itself appears to have been a licensed event, and ICE descended on the track on the last day of the 2025 racing season, according to the Statesman.
Federal agents initially detained more than 400 people during the operation and made 105 arrests on immigration grounds. 
The raid sparked controversy in Idaho, where officers have been criticized for aggressive tactics against minors and families and for targeting an event they knew they would find plenty of candidates for deportation. Some attendees are considering a lawsuit against the government for injuries and trauma suffered during the raid. 
Like many of the hundreds of attendees at the event, the woman interviewed by WyoFile said her sisters and two younger brothers, ages 15 and 11, were handcuffed with tight plastic zip ties and spent hours waiting for a chance to prove their lawful presence in the country. In initial statements, the Federal Bureau of Investigation denied using zip ties on children. Federal officials moderated that statement, however, after being confronted with photographs of a handcuffed minor. 
The family of the man now jailed in Wyoming were handcuffed for close to four hours, minus the daughter, who said officers left her hands free so she could care for her baby, she told WyoFile. During the initial roundup of attendees, she and her siblings were not with their father. When they caught sight of him again, it was through the plastic windows of a tent they were being held in. 
Once federal authorities established someone was a citizen or lawfully present, they put a green band on the person’s wrist, the woman said. When she saw her father through the window, he wore a red wristband marking him for immigration detention, she said. 
She and her siblings pleaded with officers to allow them to say goodbye to their father and were allowed to, despite some resistance, she said. 
As their lawyer argues for her father’s release, the family is struggling, she said. The raid traumatized her young brothers. 
“They’re still in shock and they haven’t fully understood what happened,” she said. The other day, she caught the 11-year-old hiding his head under a pillow as he cried. 
“He didn’t want anyone to see it,” she said.

UW will honor its most gifted athlete Saturday when it retires the jersey number worn by the Buffalo Bills’ quarterback, columnist Kerry Drake writes.
The post Josh Allen may be a Californian, but Wyoming has adopted him appeared first on WyoFile .","Josh Allen was born in California, but the Golden State holds no claim over the superstar Buffalo Bills quarterback. He honed his skills at the University of Wyoming, the only NCAA Division 1 school that offered him a football scholarship after a season playing for a junior college.
Fans at UW’s Saturday game will get to see Allen in person again when he makes his first appearance at War Memorial Stadium since graduating in 2017. He’ll be in Laramie to be honored as the first UW player to ever have his jersey number retired by the football program. But he continues to wear No. 17 for the Bills.

Opinion

Did his birth state pay $2 million for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial this year to celebrate Allen being named the NFL’s 2024 most valuable player? 
It did not. UW used its special projects reserve fund to air the spot in 25 markets around the country, where it was seen by an estimated 10 million people.
That’s a lot of exposure to UW’s underlying message: “This is where underdogs come to shine, and where real MVPs are made.”
Allen has become Wyoming’s most well-known export. He’s an unofficial ambassador for the Cowboy State who often cites his appreciation for the university giving him a chance to show what he can do.
Allen turned in a masterful performance Sunday in a 44-32 win over Tampa Bay, despite awkwardly heaving the ball right into the arms of a Buccaneers’ defender during the team’s first possession. He more than made up for it by throwing for three touchdowns and running for three more touchdowns, only the second time in NFL history anyone has accomplished that feat.
Who was responsible for the other monster performance by a quarterback? Allen, of course, last December against the Los Angeles Rams.
I tried to interview Allen for this column, but breaking through the wall of defense put up by the Bills’ communications department proved much tougher than I imagined. I’d probably have a better chance of talking to President Donald Trump.
So I switched to Plan B and tried to find the biggest Josh Allen fan in Wyoming. That’s how I learned about Trent Weitzel, a Laramie entrepreneur who drives his Weitzel Wings food truck — aka Double Dub’s Wings — thousands of miles from Laramie to many Bills games, in Buffalo and when the team is on the road.


Weitzel made such treks eight times last year and will do it again later this season. He met Allen after a UW game when the quarterback visited his food truck outside the stadium. Soon, Allen was a regular customer who declared Double Dub’s fried wings the best he’s ever eaten. His favorite? The spicy bleu wings.
Allen’s presence attracted much attention, including from the owner’s grandmother, Audra Weitzel. “She’d always conveniently appear whenever Josh showed up, and talk his ears off,” her grandson said, laughing.
Weitzel tried to enter the annual National Buffalo Wings Festival, but was turned down because he had a food truck, not a brick-and-mortar restaurant. His friend Allen helped him become an official contestant, and Double Dub’s sauces have won the “Festival Favorite” trophy four years in a row. It’s like the Super Bowl of chicken wings.
Weitzel said fans in Buffalo, known as the “Bills Mafia,” treat everyone from Wyoming who travels to the games like long-lost friends. “We’re looking at buying a second house there,” he said. “It just feels like home.”
Weitzel said Allen’s fame prevents him from showing up and helping his crew serve wings, like he did in 2019. “But we always get an order to him on game day, whenever and wherever he wants,” he said.
Why have so many Wyomingites fallen in love with Allen? It might be because he remains a down-to-earth, pretty humble guy they can relate to. Allen grew up on his family’s cotton farm near Firebaugh, California, so he understands what it’s like to live in a rural area.
I also think it’s the way Allen dedicates himself to being the best player he can be and motivating his team by example. Spectacular touchdown passes and runs are what draw us to him, but even his failures show his character. 
Two weeks ago, when Miami upset the Bills, Allen tried to mount a furious comeback with a play that defined for me what a competitor he is. He burst up the middle for a first down, and fought for every inch of ground he could before the ball was ripped from his hands. His face was anguished, but he didn’t give up.
Wyoming fans know no one on the field wants to win more than Allen. They saw it first in Laramie.
As a die-hard Denver Broncos fan since 1969, I never rooted for any other team before the Bills made Allen their first-round draft pick in 2018. Now I watch every Buffalo game I can. If my two teams are playing at the same time, I flip between channels. Whenever they go head-to-head, I root for Denver. Though, as an Allen fan, I hate myself for it.
Talking to people outside of Wyoming, I’ve discovered there are three things they associate with our state: Yellowstone National Park, the murder of gay UW student Matthew Shepard, and former Vice President Dick Cheney. It’s an odd trio that needs a fourth member.
The majestic first national park naturally tops the list. Extensive media coverage about the remaining pair accounts for their presence. Shepard’s brutal death helped galvanize the LGBTQ+ community’s fight for equal rights. Cheney’s recent death showed the incongruities of his career as a respected Wyoming congressman and the most polarizing politician ever to hold the nation’s second-highest office.
Allen is a welcome addition to this list. UW has many gifted athletes in its Hall of Fame, including football’s Jim Kiick and basketball’s Kenny Sailors. But it’s never retired an athlete’s number before.
Allen will set more records on his way to the NFL’s Hall of Fame. A solid high school football, baseball and basketball player, he dreamed of making the nearby Fresno State football team, but — like the rest of Division 1 colleges — it never recruited him.
UW wasn’t interested until it went to Reedley, a California junior college, to recruit another potential transfer player. Former Fresno State assistant coach Dave Brown, who was familiar with Allen, had just joined UW’s staff and urged that he be recruited.
So even though the Fresno State Bulldogs snubbed him, this connection paved the way for Allen’s success at UW, which turned into his shot at NFL fame.
Thanks, Coach Brown! If it wasn’t for you and the best recommendation you ever made, the man who has united so many Wyomingites in an almost magical way wouldn’t be a part of our lives.

(Anteia McCollum/Idaho Capital Sun)A North Idaho hospital and a major Idaho health insurer are struggling to renegotiate a contract to keep the hospital in network. 
Kootenai Health and Regence BlueShield of Idaho are “at an impasse” to renegotiate the provider care contract, state officials recently said. 
If a deal isn’t struck by Jan. 1, the Coeur d’Alene hospital could become out-of-network for Regence, which runs the health insurance plan for state government employees and several other plans. The contract ending could raise health care costs at the hospital for around 11,000 Idahoans. 
Regence and Kootenai Health say the struggle to strike a deal has revolved around setting fair rates for the hospital.
Regence Blue Shield of Idaho’s vice president of network management, Ryan Pharis, said negotiations are still underway.
“Many of these negotiations go unnoticed by the public because the two parties are able to reach that mutually agreeable, common ground at the end,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Friday. “… Negotiations are tending to get more complex as we see health care seemingly becoming more and more complex all the time.”
Kootenai Health’s communications and marketing director, Kim Anderson, said the hospital and insurer hope to reach a deal soon.
“Kootenai Health is working closely with Regence BlueShield to renew our contract and ensure continued in-network access for Regence members,” she said in a statement. “Our shared goal is to reach a favorable agreement before the end of the year — one that supports both organizations and protects access to high-quality, local care for our community.”

 Who would be affected if the contract ends?

The negotiation “affects all of Regence’s book of business with Kootenai Health,” officials with the Idaho Office of Group Insurance told North Idaho enrollees in the state employee’s insurance plan in a letter Nov. 10.  
About 11,000 Idahoans across commercial plans and less than 200 people on Medicare Advantage plans could be affected, Pharis said. About 1,000 members of the state’s insurance plan, which insures state employees and their family members, could be affected, said Idaho Department of Administration spokesperson Kim Rau.
State officials said Regence will on Nov. 24 start notifying enrollees who received care from the Coeur d’Alene Hospital via letters. People with questions should call Regence’s customer service at 1-800-854-5585.
 What services would be affected?

Coverage for non-emergency services at the hospital — including inpatient and outpatient surgeries and services — would be affected by the contract’s end, Kootenai Health says.

Some people could continue seeing their providers at in-network rates for 90-days after the contract’s potential end date, if they qualify for continuity of care under federal law, the Idaho Office of Group Insurance explained. That applies for pregnant women, people who are already getting treatment or have some severe health issues, and people who have scheduled surgeries or procedures that aren’t elective. 
Emergency care will continue to be covered at in-network rates, because of the federal law called the No Surprises Act, state officials say.
Regence updated its records about which providers are in network and out of network, Rau said. 
“We encourage Regence members to log into their Regence portal, visit the provider search tool at Regence.com, or call customer service on the back of their ID card, to determine which providers and facilities might be a good option,” she said. “Options for care will likely include options in the Spokane area, which may be in-network.”
 Why the health insurance contract negotiations are struggling

In a blog post dated Nov. 6, Regence said that “Kootenai Health’s leadership issued a termination notice” unless Regence “agree(s) to a double-digit increase that would raise the annual cost of health care in the state by an estimated $15 million.”
While the insurer said it was negotiating in good faith, it was also bracing to be removed from the hospital’s network.
“Over the course of two months, we have made multiple attempts to reach a fair and sustainable agreement with Kootenai Health’s leadership. They have declined all offers and continue to insist on unsustainable increases in what we pay them to care for our members,” Regence said.
Pharis, with Regence, wouldn’t offer specifics on the rates under negotiation. 
“The ask on the table from Kootenai Health right now is larger than what they have agreed to in past years,” he said in an interview. “… We have provided data, much of which is from their own transparency data sources that are available to the public, that supports our position and the offers that we have put forth to Kootenai Health.”
On the hospital’s website, Kootenai Health said it was hopeful negotiations would resolve. But in another, also undated, post, the hospital portrayed the contract negotiations as having already failed, saying “Kootenai will no longer be part of the Regence network of hospitals.”
Pharis said the hospital’s statements that said the contract was ending came first, before the hospital softened messaging to say negotiations are still underway. 
Kootenai Health’s website notice portraying negotiations as failed says parties couldn’t agree on rates “that are sustainable” for the hospital. “Despite the hospital’s good faith efforts, Kootenai and Regence BlueShield were unable to agree upon mutually acceptable contract terms and rates that are sustainable for Kootenai Health,” the hospital’s website says.
On that frequently asked question page, Kootenai Health said: “We worked hard to reach an agreement with Regence, but their requirements were outside what we could accept in good conscience. In the end, we determined that accepting contract terms with rates below market value is risky, unsustainable for Kootenai Health, and would not be a responsible choice for our hospital.”

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Republican U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo joined a bi-partisan group of U.S. senators to ask for additional seasonal worker visas. 
More than 30 senators signed the Nov. 13 letter to heads of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of Labor to ask that they release the additional H-2B visas, which allow qualifying employers to hire temporary, non-agricultural workers from other countries. There is a separate program for seasonal agriculture workers, under H-2A. 
“We write on behalf of the seasonal businesses in our states who lack sufficient employees to
support their operations and sustain their businesses,” senators wrote to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. 
Congress has set a cap of 66,000 per year, split evenly between the first and second halves of the fiscal year. The federal lawmakers asked that the agencies use authority provided to release additional supplemental visas, which are largely reserved for returning workers, according to the letter. 
“These visas will allow employers to supplement their U.S. workforce to keep their businesses open, as well as provide additional certainty regarding their workforce planning decisions in the coming months,” the letter said. 
Under the H-2B program, employers must first make a concerted effort to hire American workers and can use guest workers when the local workforce is insufficient. The letter cited a 2020 Government Accountability Office report that found “counties with H-2B employers generally had lower unemployment rates and higher average weekly wages than counties that do not have any H-2B employers.”
In Idaho, many applications for these types of guest workers were for forestry workers, as well as construction laborers, landscaping and packers, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. 
As of the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, there were more than 3,500 H-2B workers certified in the state. The most workers were employed by Idaho forestry companies. More than 4,000 visas were requested in Idaho. 
U.S. Sens. Angus King, I-Maine, and Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, spearheaded the letter, according to King’s office. The letter was also signed by Democrats from Oregon and Washington and Republicans from Montana and Wyoming.  
Risch and Crapo’s offices could not be reached for comment.

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)It’s been a hallmark of most of the noteworthy political movements that have emerged and risen to power in modern times that their leaders aspired to use government power to improve society. Plenty of these movements were deeply flawed or downright fraudulent, but virtually all – even some of the worst authoritarian parties and leaders –have at least professed to have a plan for using the levers of power in an intentional way to make life better for average people.
Here in the U.S., until recently, even archconservatives who opposed many social welfare programs were still committed to strengthening the national defense in order to help defend the nation and its allies against foreign adversaries, and to boosting basic components of societal infrastructure that they saw as aiding in that effort — like public education, transportation and public health.
Weirdly and disturbingly, however, this is not the case with the MAGA movement. While it’s true that Donald Trump regularly dispenses absurd and delusional promises to magically solve every societal ill – promises that not even his most ardent supporters take seriously – when it comes to fashioning a real agenda for getting things done, the modern right is consistently and harmfully silent.
Indeed, save for their efforts to: a) enhance state police power vis a vis immigrant communities and women seeking to control their own reproduction, and b) strengthen their own capacity to remain in power through gerrymandering and election-rigging tactics, it’s clear that the main objective of MAGA conservatives when it comes to public structures is tearing things down.
Nowhere is this better exemplified than in North Carolina where, after a decade and a half of conservative Republican dominance in state government, it’s virtually impossible to identify any public system or structure – public and higher education, public health, environmental protection, transportation, courts and corrections — in which things are demonstrably better than they were at the start of GOP rule.
And nowhere is this sad pattern better exemplified today in North Carolina than in the current destructive budget stalemate between conservative leaders at the General Assembly.
North Carolina is now almost five months into the 2025-26 fiscal year, and it continues to operate without a new state budget. As a result, numerous core public structures and systems – perhaps most notably, its already fragile and dramatically under-resourced Medicaid health insurance program – are operating under old law and old, inadequate appropriations.
Mind you, this is not – as an outsider might superficially surmise – the result of a conflict between the state’s Republican-controlled legislature and its Democratic governor.  
No, in this case, GOP legislative leaders never even passed a comprehensive budget bill for Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to consider. Instead, the state is being held hostage to their internal disputes over how drastically and rapidly to further eviscerate the state’s regressive and inadequate income tax structure, as well as a series of other mostly petty matters – like Senate Leader Phil Berger’s need to appear sufficiently reactionary as he tries to fend off a far-right Republican primary challenger in 2026.
Gov. Stein has done his best to break the logjam and direct public attention to the destructive impact the stalemate is having – particularly on the Medicaid program, where the lack of funding certainty has forced his Health and Human Services department to slash reimbursements to providers to maintain program solvency. Earlier this month, he took the extraordinary step of calling lawmakers to Raleigh for a special legislative session to address the rapidly metastasizing problem that is likely to soon lead to preventable deaths of people no longer able to access health care. 
It was precisely the kind of strong and common-sense leadership that North Carolinians undoubtedly expected when they elected Stein by a wide margin last November. The session was supposed to have commenced on Monday.
Unfortunately, legislative leaders were unmoved. Much like the Republicans in Washington who, despite their control of both Congress and the White House, allowed their own internal conflicts to translate into a record-breaking federal government shutdown and huge new health insurance rate hikes for millions of Americans, state Senate and House leaders have simply ignored Stein’s directive and, in true Trumpian fashion, tried to disavow blame for the Medicaid crisis that their own failure to act has created.
And so, it appears that, absent a hard-to-imagine political 180, Republican leaders will stick to their plan to hold no further votes during the on-again, off-again 2025 legislative session, thereby allowing the Medicaid program – and dozens of other vitally important public structures and services — to wither on the vine while thousands of North Carolinians needlessly suffer.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Congressman Riley Moore said he’d introduce legislation Monday with the goal of growing a training center for border patrol agents in Harpers Ferry.
The bill would authorize a land transfer between U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the National Park Service to expand Customs and Border Protection’s Advanced Training Center. It would transfer 25 acres of National Park Service land to U.S. Customs in exchange for 72 acres of Custom’s land.
A news release Monday from Moore’s office said it was “the final barrier” to expanding the training center to accommodate increased border patrol training needs under President Donald Trump’s immigration and border policies. 
“With more than 18,000 new border patrol agents authorized under the One Big Beautiful Bill, this expansion to the Advanced Training Center in Harpers Ferry is essential,” said Moore, R-W.Va.
He continued, “This land swap solution strengthens our border, bolsters national security, and brings additional opportunity to West Virginia. Harpers Ferry plays a vital role in preparing the brave men and women who safeguard our nation every day. I am proud to introduce legislation that finally allows this important expansion to move forward.”
The bill was not available on Congress’ website as of Monday afternoon.
Moore’s office said that both the Biden and Trump administrations supported expanding the Harpers Ferry Advanced Training Center, but existing land boundaries prevented such progress. 
“The new influx of federal agents has made the need even more urgent,” the release said. “ … The newly authorized expansion will accommodate increased personnel, enhance operational readiness and training requirements and support the Trump Administration’s expanded border security mandates.”
Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said the legislation authorizing the expansion was “critical to ensuring our agents [were] equipped with the training and tools necessary to perform their duties effectively.”
“This land transfer will enable CBP to enhance and modernize its training operations so they can continue meeting the demands of their mission,” she said in a statement. 
Rep. Mike Simpson, R-ID, serves as Chairman of the House Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.
“Authorizing this land transfer will provide the brave Border Patrol agents with the necessary training resources to keep our homeland safe,” Simpson wrote. “I am also pleased that this bill will help preserve a section of the historic Battle of Harpers Ferry battlefield, ensuring that future generations can enjoy the land and history of the site.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has partnered with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement to support Trump’s immigration crackdown. The state is participating in ICE’s 287(g) program that allows specially-trained local and state police and National Guard members to perform specific enforcement duties of ICE agents. The governor announced last month that the partnership resulted in the arrests of 60 undocumented immigrants. 
ICE is also paying some West Virginia jails $90 for each day it holds immigrant detainees. Three of the jails working with ICE were over capacity, according to the latest data shared with state lawmakers.

The state is the custodian of roughly $140 million to $150 millions of dollars in abandoned funds, by Unclaimed Property Division Director Susan Sommerfeld’s estimate.
Money can become unclaimed properly if it sits untouched for a certain period of time — like if someone fails to cash a check or forgets about a bank account, for example. If the business holding the money cannot get in touch with the owner, it must turn the funds over to the state.
The state hangs onto the unclaimed property in hopes that it can eventually return it to its rightful owner. So far the state has returned more than $128 million in unclaimed property, according to the division. 
Usually, the owner has to file a claim to get their money back and provide enough information to prove it’s theirs.
But under a recent amendment to state law, the Department of Trust Lands’ Unclaimed Property Division now has more authority to waive that requirement. 
This has enabled the division to test out a new program to return some money by mailing checks to owners.
“It used to be too doggone hard for people to get their money back,” Sommerfeld said. “But it’s not anymore.”
This simplified approach is only available in certain circumstances, Sommerfeld said.
For one, the division has to make 100% sure it’s certain it’s sending the money to the right person and the right address, she said. The agency uses databases to verify this information.
At this time, the state is also only mailing checks for unclaimed property valued between $50 and $1,000.
“We wanted to make it enough so that people would want to cash that check, but not so much that it looks fake,” she said.
The division has already sent out letters to its first set of owners notifying them that they have unclaimed property and to be on the look out for money coming via check in early December.
Even for those ineligible to receive a check in the mail, these days it’s generally fairly easy to get money back, Sommerfeld said. 
“When I started in this unclaimed property world, every single claim that we had had to be on paper, and it had to be notarized,” she said.
North Dakotans can check if they have unclaimed property and file claims at unclaimedproperty.nd.gov.
In instances where a claim is required, owners may need to provide additional information. Depending on the situation, that could include ID, proof of their address, a Social Security number and potentially proof that they did business with the company that previously held their money, Sommerfeld said.
While in the hands of the state, the money is invested in the Common Schools Trust Fund, which funds K-12 schools.

(Photo by Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)When we found out we were expecting, we did what so many parents do. We thought about names, we dreamed about who our baby might become, and we started preparing our home for the little boy we were so eager to meet.
At 20 weeks, we walked into a routine exam and our lives changed forever. We discovered that my body had begun moving toward labor far too early. It wasn’t anyone’s fault; it was simply my body’s way of protecting itself from something that was going wrong.
Idaho is losing OB-GYNs. Doctors who remain are trying to shoulder the extra burdens.

Our doctors compassionately explained that the recommended course of action to preserve my future fertility, and perhaps my life, was to deliver early. It was a terrible diagnosis knowing that Remy — the name we’d chosen for our son — would not be able to survive.
In most places, and even in Idaho just a few years ago, that heartbreaking decision would have stayed between us, our family, and our doctors. The anxiety of making life-changing decisions would have been eased slightly by grieving quietly in our room or even going home to process together.
But in Idaho, a new abortion ban criminalizes doctors for providing care in situations like mine. Instead of being able to deliver the treatment they recommended, they worked rapidly to organize a way for me to fly to a hospital out of state.
I was thunder jacketed into a gurney and rolled onto a plane — terrified of what could happen along the journey or before my husband arrived to meet me in Salt Lake. The compassion from the medical team is something I’ll never forget. Staff lined the hallway, holding out their hands and whispering encouragement as I passed, knowing it was likely one of the scariest and most emotional days of my life.
The worst day of our lives was made even harder because politicians inserted themselves into what should have been a private moment of grief and personal decision-making for our family. No family should ever have to choose between waiting until it’s almost too late.
After losing Remy, we tried to make sense of what happened. We met with lawmakers, hoping to explain the real, unintended repercussions of Idaho’s abortion ban. Instead, we were told our experiences weren’t real. To have lived through such trauma and then be dismissed by those in power — by those who are here to serve the people of Idaho — it was devastating. But it also made one thing clear: Our politicians aren’t listening to Idaho families.
Before this experience, we had no idea the degree to which Idaho’s current abortion ban prevents doctors from providing the care their patients need. But our current law clearly criminalizes care. That moment of crisis can affect anyone at any time. And I hope no one else is caught unaware.
To honor Remy’s memory, we took our grief and turned it to action. Since lawmakers refused to listen, we got involved with Idahoans United for Women and Families. They are using the citizen-led ballot initiative process to write our own law, restoring us to the standard of reproductive healthcare access Idahoans had for nearly 50 years.
We, and Idahoans United for Women and Families, believe that personal, private medical decisions should be left between a woman, her family, and her doctor. That’s why the organization is working to collect signatures to place the Reproductive Freedom and Privacy Act on the ballot.
Thanks to the rapid response of the St. Luke’s team, my fertility was preserved. Because of that, we recently welcomed a baby girl to our family. We dream of her future and all that she’ll become. We dream of an Idaho that considers her — that values her health and her life. We want her to grow up in a state where she can build a family on her own terms, with safety and dignity. That’s the Idaho we’re fighting for.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer-Focht/Tennessee Lookout) The federal government has entered into contracts worth millions of dollars to purchase food and lodging for the Tennessee National Guard in Memphis, new court filings say. 
Hotel contracts to house the troops have a current balance of $5,178,816, while contracts for meals have a $1,123,875 balance, according to a declaration by Lieut. Col. Dallas Clements, deputy director of military support for the Tennessee National Guard.
The declaration did not detail the length of the contracts or describe what payments to vendors, if any, the federal government has already made.
Clements’ declaration was filed Friday as part of the state’s defense in an ongoing legal challenge to the presence of the Tennessee National Guard in Memphis. Late Monday, Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal issued a temporary injunction blocking the deployment of the Guard to Memphis. The injunction was sought by a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who allege that Gov. Bill Lee lacks the legal authority to do so under state law and the Tennessee Constitution.
Hundreds more National Guard headed to Memphis even as judge weighs request for temporary injunction

Lawyers defending the state submitted Clements’ declaration in support of their request that the elected officials post an $8 million bond in the case. Bonds are typically sought as a form of insurance to reimburse a party who incurs economic losses during a case but ultimately prevails. On Monday, Moskal ordered a $50,000 bond.
Lee, who commands the Guard, agreed to send troops to Memphis as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by an executive order from President Donald Trump.
As of Friday, there were 719 National Guard supporting the work of the task force, according to Clements. 
That number is significantly higher than Guard personnel reported by the Memphis Police Department last week. A police department spokesperson said Thursday she estimated the total presence stood at 140-180 and would soon increase to 350.
The Guard is among hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers currently in the city, issuing traffic tickets, serving warrants and making immigration arrests. 
The total cost for pay, allowances and benefits for activating up to 1,000 members of Tennessee National Guard in Memphis through Sept. 30, 2026 is estimated at $226 million, according to a Sept. 18 memo issued by Elbridge Colby, Under Secretary of War for Policy included in the request for bond.
“I don’t feel safe”: Black Memphis residents report harassment by Trump’s police task force

Clements also noted there are 1653 National Guard assigned to Memphis-area duties that predate the task force, requesting that, if the court issues a temporary injunction, it is tailored so it does not interfere with these Guard members ongoing duties.  They have ongoing assignments with the 164th Airlift Wing that supports “global air mobility” on an ongoing basis. The nearby Millington Armory has long been home to a military police academy. And the Tennessee National Guard has had a storefront recruitment center in nearby Cordova.
The judge’s order on Monday specifically enjoins only the Guard members activated in accordance with the president’s memorandum establishing the Memphis Safe Task Force.
“It is vital that any orders connected to this lawsuit be tailored to address only National Guard support to the Memphis Safe task force,” he wrote.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS –Nurse practitioner Kelly Baquet says she is tired of diagnosing patients with HIV.
“We have so many tools to prevent HIV now,” she said. “I want to be a part of ending the epidemic.”
Baquet, a former nurse practitioner at the New Orleans Planned Parenthood health center, started The Clinic NOLA earlier this month with two other former colleagues, Pat Thomas and Dominique Berryhill, in order to help fill the gap in the region’s sexual and reproductive health care left by the recent closure of Planned Parenthood following federal funding cuts in President Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill passed this year.
The South accounts for the biggest share of HIV diagnoses in the country — in 2023, Louisiana ranked fourth in HIV diagnoses, according to the CDC — but lags other regions in use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs for HIV prevention. Louisiana also recently ranked number one in the country for chlamydia cases, followed by number two for gonorrhea, according to the CDC.
The state also has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. One third of parishes lack a single OB/GYN, according to a 2022 March of Dimes analysis.

The Clinic NOLA, which opened on Nov. 1, offers STI testing and treatment, birth control, breast exams, PrEP and well-woman exams. Baquet said she is open to discussing a variety of family planning options. In the future, Baquet said she hopes to expand the clinic’s services to include prenatal care, such as ultrasound testing, miscarriage management and care for other pregnancy complications up to 12 weeks.
“The main goal of The Clinic NOLA is to break down the barrier to access to care,” she said. “We want to provide same day or next day services to the people of New Orleans or the Gulf Coast.”
Baquet said the space is intentionally designed to be warm and inviting, with wood paneling and comfy chairs, unlike a typical doctor’s office. For Gulf Coast patients who miss the short appointment wait times and wide range of services that were available at Planned Parenthood — which closed down its two Louisiana health centers on Sept. 30 — The Clinic NOLA aims to offer a comparable experience.
“The services that we provide are very similar,” Baquet said. “My motto is ‘this is a place of choice.’”

To address the issue of women feeling forced to cancel long-awaited doctor’s appointments because they could not find childcare, Baquet said she encourages patients to bring their children to the clinic, where there is a coloring table set up in the hallway.
“We don’t want it to feel like you’re coming to a doctor’s office. We want it to feel like you’re coming into our home,” she said.
The clinic accepts patients ages 10 and older for reproductive healthcare and patients ages 18 and older for hormone replacement therapy. Baquet said she currently has the capacity to see 20 to 30 patients a day and expects to hire more staff as the clinic’s patient base grows.
Baquet said the clinic has already seen a patient from out of state and a patient who drove from three hours away across Louisiana. The clinic offers telehealth services and is open on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to noon to help serve patients who work full-time during the week.
The Clinic NOLA is located Uptown at 1534 Aline Street near Touro Hospital in an unmarked building. Baquet said she gave the clinic a discreet name to help patients feel more comfortable and safe.
“When I hear people talk about going to the doctor’s office, they don’t often like to say the name of the place,” she said. “They’ll say ‘I’m going to the clinic,’ and so that’s where that came from.”
Pat Thomas worked as a medical assistant at Planned Parenthood in New Orleans for 20 years, up until its closure in September. She said she was more than happy to get on board when Baquet asked her if she wanted to help launch The Clinic NOLA.
Thomas said she predicts an influx of new patients ahead of the holiday season.
“At family gatherings you get to talking about medical care,” she said. “‘You know, ‘it’s time for my mammogram, it’s time for my pap smear. Oh, I haven’t had an STI screening. I need treatment.’”
The clinic accepts all major health insurance plans including Medicaid. For patients without insurance or those who choose not to use their insurance, the clinic also offers a self-pay scale to inform patients of the total cost of services before they receive care.
The Clinic NOLA is not a federally qualified health center, meaning it does not receive federal funding or offer a sliding scale payment system, which would allow patients to pay for services based on their income.
The Clinic NOLA plans not to turn away any patients, regardless of insurance status. Thomas said after a long career in providing reproductive healthcare, she looks forward to continuing work alongside Baquet, whose treatment of patients she calls “wonderful.”
“I think it’s awesome to be able to offer the care that so many need,” Thomas said. “I have a love for people and I just love to see people happy.”

“I don’t think we’re approving too many charters,” Bruce Friend, chair of the board, told NC Newsline Thursday. “Our goal is to make sure we’re approving the right charter applicants. When you’re sitting in that chair and acting as the authorizer, you want to be sure you’re doing your due diligence — that the schools that are ready get approved and the ones that aren’t ready don’t.”
Friend’s comments come after Triad International Studies Academy, a Guilford County charter school that opened in August, shut down just two months later. The school enrolled just 45 students, far below its projection of 144 and short of the state’s minimum requirement of 80.
The closure left families scrambling for alternatives and prompted board members and state officials to reexamine how new charters are evaluated before opening.
“Those parents are very upset, as they should be,” Friend said at the board’s recent meeting. “But they should be upset at the board members of that school. They’re the ones who put your child in that situation, not us.”
The closure was the second in two years for a new North Carolina charter school that failed to make it through its first school year. State data show that only about 26% of new charter schools in the past five years met or exceeded their enrollment projections, and more than half of those that missed the mark are now closed or never opened.
Even so, the review board and its predecessor have granted final authorization to 28 of 34 schools that made it through the review process over the last five years. Final authorization comes after a yearlong “Ready to Open” period in which applicants must demonstrate financial stability, governance capacity and sufficient demand.
Friend pushed back on concerns that the high approval rate reflects a lax process. “It’s hard to put a percentage on how many should get approved every year. I don’t look at it through that lens. I look at it through making sure the schools with strong boards and solid plans are the ones that move forward.”
In 2023, the Republican-led General Assembly passed House Bill 618, shifting charter oversight away from the former Charter School Advisory Board, which had been in existence since 2013 under the Democratic-led State Board of Education, to a newly created Charter Schools Review Board, appointed by Republican lawmakers, that had far greater authority than its predecessor.
The CSRB was granted final power to approve, deny, renew, and revoke charter applications, a role that previously belonged ultimately to the State Board of Education. Under the 2023 law, the State Board of Education retained some key functions, including rulemaking, charter funding, and hearing appeals from CSRB denials, but it no longer made the final decision on most charter applications.
At the time, critics of the change argued the new structure would reduce accountability and could lead to the approval of too many charter schools that were not fully prepared to open.
NC Newsline reached out to both the chair and vice chair of the state board of education but has not heard back.
In the most recent application cycle, 14 new charter school applications were submitted statewide. Of those, one applicant withdrew, six were approved, and six were denied. Another is awaiting approval.
“We do all of our homework and due diligence to hopefully make that happen whenever we’re approving the schools that come before us, the applicants that come before us,” Friend said.
The review board is now weighing changes to the Ready to Open process, following recommendations from the Office of Charter Schools. Proposed revisions would require two appearances before the board — one in May and another in June — and could impose automatic one-year delays for schools that miss new enrollment or budget benchmarks.
“This is about sustainability,” said Ashley Logue, the office’s executive director. “If it’s not grounded in data and being realistic about how hard it is to open a school, it can lead to a lot of problems.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bRUCEfRIEND.jpg,,,2025-11-18 08:56:23.028229

(Courtesy of CPW)With the third winter “release season” in Colorado’s gray wolf reintroduction plan just weeks away, state wildlife officials are scrambling to find a source for additional relocated wolves.
A deal to source up to 15 animals from British Columbia is in doubt after the federal government, under pressure from livestock groups and conservative activists, ordered Colorado Parks and Wildlife not to import Canadian wolves. Officials in the Republican-controlled states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, home to large and well-established wolf populations, have made it clear that they won’t help Colorado’s restoration efforts.
And one of CPW’s few remaining options was taken off the table Saturday when its request to capture and relocate wolves from Washington was rejected by wildlife commissioners there.
“I certainly heard loud and clear from Washingtonians this morning, (on) all different sides of the aisle, saying it’s just not the time for us to support this,” said Lorna Smith, a conservation advocate and member of the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission.

Colorado’s restoration plan calls for annual releases of 10 to 15 relocated wolves for the program’s first three to five years, with an initial target population of 50 individuals. CPW captured and relocated 10 wolves from Oregon in December 2023 and another 15 from Canada in January 2025.
In an Oct. 28 letter to Washington wildlife officials, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis wrote that while the state’s goal is to secure up to 15 wolves again this winter, “even 5-7 would be extremely helpful towards successful species recovery.” CPW Director Jeff Davis, speaking to the commission in Washington on Saturday, reiterated that Colorado would cover the costs of capture and relocation operations, which could take place at any point through the end of February.
Washington’s reported wolf population declined in 2024 for the first time since confirmed wolf packs were reestablished in the state in 2008. Kelly Susewind, director of the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, told commissioners that the decision was up to them.
“We’ve assessed this with our staff — we feel that biologically, we can accommodate the request, should you choose to go that way, without interfering with our recovery effort,” said Susewind.
But on a motion from Smith, who cited the “cautionary message” of Washington’s declining 2024 wolf count, the commission voted 8-1 to deny Colorado’s request.
“I myself am really torn on this issue, because of course I’d love to see wolves recovered across the Rocky Mountain range, including Colorado,” Smith said. “But Washington’s wolves, I don’t believe are in a position to assist with that at this point in time.”
Federal intervention
After two years of winter releases, Colorado currently has a population of around 20 adult or yearling gray wolves, with an unknown number of new pups born to four confirmed breeding packs in 2025. Survival rates for relocated wolves have been lower in Colorado than in previous reintroduction efforts in the northern Rockies, but CPW officials say their efforts are on the right track.
Livestock groups — who opposed the 2020 voter-approved ballot measure requiring wolf restoration and have sought to delay or pause its implementation ever since — scored their biggest victory to date in the fight against the program last month, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ordered CPW to halt any efforts to source wolves from outside a specified area in the northern Rockies, including Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and eastern portions of Washington and Oregon.
The USFWS letter claims that sourcing wolves from outside the northern Rockies is “violative” of the permit the agency issued for Colorado’s experimental wolf population under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act. But while the state’s 10(j) permit, issued in 2023, identifies northern Rockies wolves as a “preferred donor population,” it does not contain any such requirement or limitation on relocation operations.
“The 10(j) rule does not mandate that Colorado’s wolves come from specific states, period,” Thomas Delehanty, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement at the time.
While Polis wrote in his letter to Washington officials that the state “disagree(s) with the legal basis for (the USFWS) analysis,” Davis said at last week’s meeting of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission that CPW is “working very diligently to be consistent with the letter.”
As it has for every year of the reintroduction program’s operation, a coalition of livestock groups and rural county commissioners has submitted a petition to pause additional wolf releases until at least November 2026.
In a brief statement Monday, CPW spokesperson Luke Perkins said the agency “continues to evaluate all options to support this year’s gray wolf releases in alignment with the approved Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan and the 10(j) Rule.”

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson) (Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The U.S. Department of Agriculture is “crunching numbers” as it considers potential relief for farmers from tariff-related losses, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen A. Vaden said Monday.
President Donald Trump’s administration previously hinted that it might devote up to $12 billion to aid payments for farmers who were hurt by tariff policies this year, Politico reported in late October.
“This department only woke back up on Thursday of last week,” Vaden said, referencing the Nov. 12 conclusion of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. “Lots of things changed during (the government shutdown),” including trade agreements with China, Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Japan, he added.
“Those have resulted in major commitments to buy American commodities and USDA now needs to take into account the effect that those commodity purchases will have on the market … going into 2026,” Vaden said.
TN Soybean farmers face ‘desperate situation’ amid inflation, weather extremes and tariffs

China is a top consumer of U.S. soybean exports, the largest agricultural export in the U.S. China froze purchases of U.S. soybeans this year while battling with Trump over tariffs, leaving U.S. soybean farmers without orders from their largest customer for months.
The White House announced a trade agreement with China in October in which China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of 2025, and at least 25 million metric tons each year through 2028.
But USDA data logging sales activity from Oct. 2 through Nov. 12 shows China made only two soybean purchases from the U.S. totaling 232,000 metric tons. Just 45 days remain until Jan. 1, 2026.
Asked what would happen if China does not meet the 12 million metric ton agreement by the Jan. 1 deadline, a USDA spokesperson wrote that the “farm economy is in a difficult situation” and Trump is “utilizing all the tools available to ensure farmers have what they need to continue their farming operations.”
The USDA will “continue to assess the farm economy and explore the need for further assistance, however, there is nothing new to share at this time,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to the Lookout.
Vaden’s remarks came during a Monday news conference announcing the second round of  federal disaster assistance for farmers through the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
The department is “busy crunching those (trade agreement) numbers now and we’ll let you know when we have an announcement, but we would have had an announcement much earlier if we’d been open over the past 45 days, and unfortunately now, thanks to the minority in Congress, we’re playing catch-up,” he said.

Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) on the right.A pro-democracy donor group that has committed to invest $14 million during the 2026 election cycle has given endorsement nods to two Michigan Democratic candidates in a pair of 2026 U.S. House races.
Defend The Vote, which focuses on supporting candidates who will stand up to corruption and protect the right to vote, on Tuesday endorsed Matt Maasdam and state Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who are seeking the party’s nominations in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District and 4th Congressional District races, respectively.
In an announcement published Tuesday, Defend The Vote said the pair will take on the cost of corruption in Washington, D.C. to make life more affordable for working people.
“Mchigan families are fed up with rising costs and a broken government that ignores them,” said Brian Lemke, executive director of Defend The Vote. “Matt Maasdam and Sean McCann know that building an economy that lowers prices and creates real opportunity requires bold changes to crack down on corruption and hold politicians accountable. We’re excited to endorse them and look forward to helping them win next year.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The organization said both candidates are running on platforms committed to cracking down on corruption so Americans can live with lower costs, have greater access to health care, and ensure democracy works for the people – not just corporate lobbyists and billionaire donors. 
Defend The Vote also believes voters should choose Maasdam and McCann in their respective races because they will also protect the right to vote, and oppose any attempt to block eligible American citizens from the ballot box.
“It has never been more important to clean up the corruption that’s driving up costs for families   and to stand up for our voting rights so everyone’s voice is heard,” McCann said in a statement.
Maasdam, a retired Navy SEAL, said in a statement that defending the Constitution was his duty, both in and out of uniform.
“I’m running for Congress to continue the mission of protecting our democracy from the kind of corruption that throws working Michiganders under the bus so billionaire donors and corporate special interests can come out ahead,” Maasdam added.
Both said they were grateful for Defend The Vote’s endorsements, which could also bring in some monetary and logistical support down the stretch of their respective campaigns.
Defend The Vote and its action fund launched a $14 million campaign cycle plan earlier this year to support electing pro-democracy candidates. Meanwhile, the action fund is focusing on pro-democracy issue advocacy.
The support will come in the form of direct donations, fundraising, support from the Defend The Vote donor network, independent expenditures, issue briefings, messaging guidance and research. That includes on the ground and in-state support.
Josh Cowen drops out of Michigan 7th Congressional District race, endorses Bridget Brink

At least 108 candidates were assisted by Defend The Vote in the last campaign cycle, or about 75% of the candidates the organization endorsed.
With Maasdam and McCann now in their rotation, both candidates could see interesting boosts to their primary campaigns in the coming year.
Aside from Maasdam, the Michigan 7th Congressional District race includes former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, Elyon Badger, William Lawrence, Alexandra Prieditis and Muhammad Salman Rais. Michigan State University professor Josh Cowen was in the race before dropping out to endorse Brink.
The winner there will move on to face incumbent U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte).
McCann’s competition in the Democratic primary for the 4th Congressional District race are candidates Richard Aaron, Diop Harris and Jessica Swartz.
The winner in that race will square off with incumbent U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland).",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1005-1024x483.jpg,,,2025-11-18 05:56:34.885059

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)President Donald Trump wants Americans to believe “affordability” can be measured in terms of turkey and stuffing. On his social media platform he recently wrote: “2025 Thanksgiving dinner under Trump is 25% lower than 2024 Thanksgiving dinner under Biden, according to Walmart. My cost (sic) are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats’ ‘affordability’ issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!”
At a White House event the next day, Trump doubled down: “They came out and they said Trump’s Thanksgiving dinner — same things — is 25% less than Biden’s. … We are the ones that have done a great job on affordability, not the Democrats,” he said, calling Democrats’ focus on living costs a “con job.”
Here’s the problem: Trump’s claim isn’t based on federal data, independent analysis or even a consistent measure of prices. It’s based on a Walmart holiday promotion that changes every year. And because the lists aren’t remotely comparable, the claim doesn’t tell us much about affordability. So, in the name of “science” (and more than a little bit of curiosity), I decided to conduct a little experiment at the Walmart Supercenter off West New Circle Road in Lexington to see what was going on in the real world.
Talking turkey about prices
To be fair to the president, Walmart did announce that its 2025 Thanksgiving basket is “25% cheaper” than last year’s. As many outlets have pointed out, however, the two lists are nowhere near the same. This year’s basket includes 15 products, six fewer than the 21 in 2024. Count each item individually, and it’s 22 this year versus 29 last year. The pecan pie? Gone. Sweet potatoes? Gone. Two cans of cream of mushroom soup were cut to one. Fresh onions, celery and corn muffin mix? Also gone. In their place, there were sometimes substitutes, and three boxes of macaroni appear on the 2025 list but not the 2024 list.
Both the 2024 and 2025 Walmart Thanksgiving lists have been scrutinized and critiqued by journalists, who noted that their contents shift from year to year, making direct comparisons unreliable. Yet no one I could find has conducted an apples-to-apples comparison using the same 2024 basket of goods and pricing those identical items for 2025 — a method more aligned with how economists measure inflation. In fact, that’s exactly how the Consumer Price Index (CPI) works: It tracks the cost of the same fixed basket of goods over time to determine how prices have truly changed.
(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
So that’s exactly what I did. Armed with last year’s Walmart Thanksgiving list, I went to the New Circle Road Walmart to find every item: same size turkey, same bag of potatoes, same cans of green beans and same cream of mushroom soup. Think of me as part bargain hunter, part social scientist. I prowled the aisles with the tenacity of someone who’s seen one too many “rollback” signs, even prompting a couple of Walmart employees to ask what I was up to.
What I found told a very different story than the one being shared by the president. Pricing last year’s exact basket in 2025 came to $59.37 or roughly $7.42 per person, about 6% higher than the cost of the same meal in 2024. (All food items were priced on Nov. 11.) 
The turkey alone rose from 88 cents per pound to 97 cents per pound (around a 10% increase), and staples like onions, potatoes and gravy mix may have ticked up as well. Some canned goods may have held steady, but nothing meaningfully dropped. The exact per-unit prices in 2024 are unknown, though Walmart stated the meal “… serves eight people for less than $7 per person.” For anyone shopping with a list and a calculator rather than a campaign slogan, the verdict is clear: Thanksgiving isn’t getting cheaper, no matter how many exclamation points you put after a sentence.
Facts over fanfare
Recreating last year’s full Walmart Thanksgiving basket in 2025 showed the truth: The same meal is about 6% more expensive — not 25% cheaper as claimed. Prices are still rising, even if the pace is a bit slower than the peak of inflation during the Biden administration.
I’ll admit this wasn’t a formal experiment conducted with all the rigor of a trained economist. I didn’t control for every variable or run multiple trials at multiple Walmart locations. But even a simple apples-to-apples comparison is far better than making bold statements without any data. Late night “truths” might grab headlines, but they are a poor gauge of affordability. 
A sale on turkey or taters doesn’t capture the costs Kentucky families and families across the nation face every day like rent, gas, health care, child care and other essentials. Using a limited, ever-changing basket of groceries to claim that “Thanksgiving is cheaper” misrepresents what affordability looks like for real households.
If we care about honest debates on the economy and what affordability looks like, we need reliable, consistent data, not marketing gimmicks or “truths” based on a retail promotion. Tools like the Consumer Price Index, produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, exist for a reason: They track real changes in prices over time so policymakers, the Federal Reserve, and citizens alike can make informed decisions about the economy. 
Plus, Kentucky families, who know the difference between a real deal and a “bless your heart” kind of deal, deserve an honest assessment of what’s getting more affordable and what’s not. And Kentucky families, who can stretch a dollar further than a Frankfort politician can stretch a mile of the Mountain Parkway, understand that true affordability isn’t determined by a catchy retail promotion; it’s measured with facts, not fanfare. When it comes to an honest assessment of affordability, leave the stuffing in the turkey, not in your economic analysis.

(Photo by Evan Houk/Maine Morning Star)Utility regulators are expected to decide Tuesday whether to throw out a plan from one of Maine’s major power companies that would increase rates over the next five years. 
The Maine Public Utilities Commission is slated to make its final decision on whether to move forward with a five-year plan from Central Maine Power to raise electricity rates that it argues are needed to make reliability and resiliency improvements, as well as enhance the customer experience. Since the plan was officially submitted in mid-September, the state energy office and public advocate have asked the commission to dismiss the case. 
On Nov. 7, commission staff recommended rejecting the state’s request to dismiss the proposal  so it can continue to move through the process before a final decision is made. However, the recommendation is not the final decision. That is slated to come from the meeting Tuesday.
Expanded customer service operations, tree-trimming and changes to storm cost recovery were named by CMP as the main drivers of the requested cost increase. 
If ultimately approved, the plan could increase rates for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. About half of that increase, or $17, would be felt as soon as October 2026. The proposal has drawn pushback from ratepayers and advocates who say Mainers, especially seniors and low-income households, can’t afford another increase when the cost of living is already so high.
“Maine’s grid needs investment, but CMP’s rate hike is too much, too fast, without accountability, and giving too much profit to shareholders at a time when Maine ratepayers can least afford it,” said Rebecca Schultz, climate and clean energy senior advocate for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. 
The average CMP residential customer paid roughly $155 in August, up from $140 this time last year. Customers in Versant’s Bangor Hydro District saw their bills go up just over $20 this past year, from $148 to $169, while the average Versant Maine Public District consumer saw their bill increase from about $144 to $162.
In her request to dismiss the case, Public Advocate Heather Sanborn specifically asked the commission to reject the proposed rate increases beyond 2026 because they rely on long-term forecasts based on speculation. Rather, she suggests they seek a more typical one-year rate increase using data from 2024.
The Department of Energy Resources objects to the proposal because it argues CMP can’t prove the proposed rates are “just and reasonable” without first seeing the 10-year integrated grid plan the power company is supposed to file with the commission in January. 
In comments submitted to the commission, Central Maine Power said nothing in the statute mandating the integrated grid plan prevents it from trying to increase rates before completing that process. Rather, it argued that allowing the rate plan to be “litigated on the merits is the best path to achieve a multi-year rate plan that will provide just and reasonable rates for customers and the company.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6166-scaled-e1696447794861-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 05:56:34.885059

She is kicking off her transition into the governor’s mansion with three appointments to co-chair the energy policy team: Josephus Allmond, Will Cleveland and Angela Navarro.
With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Josephus Allmond is a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, where he has worked for five years. Allmond is currently part of the Commission Electric Utility Regulation and is on the Utility Planning subcommittee. There have been recent discussions about the methodology of Integrated Resource Plans, which utilities have to file with the State Corporation Commission.
Allmond has also represented the advocacy group Appalachian Voices in some rate cases, namely the proposed rate increase by Appalachian Power Company in 2024. He has weighed in on the Dominion Energy shared solar SCC case for the same group. He is a staunch opponent of gas plants such as the forthcoming Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center and the proposed gas plant in Fluvanna.
Will Cleveland is an energy and environmental lawyer through Lighthouse Policy & Law and was registered as a lobbyist for Google. He previously worked as a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, and is a board member of the Virginia Conservation Network. 
Cleveland also has been a member of the Clean Energy Advisory Board that worked on a pilot program to dole out loans for solar panels for low-income households, a program that has now gone defunct due to federal changes in funding. He has commented on energy efficiency and demand response playing major roles in achieving the goals of the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
Notably, Cleveland is involved in Dominion’s rate case that would create a new class for high load customers, such as data centers. His testimony for the case stated that Google isn’t opposed to a special rate class proposal, but a different plan created by a group of data center companies would be more “balanced” than Dominion’s. The SCC has not yet ruled on that case or determined if they would accept the data center companies’ plan.
Angela Navarro is no stranger to the executive branch of the commonwealth. She was a SCC commissioner for one year and managed the regulation of the state utilities. She also served as a deputy secretary of natural resources and commerce and trade under two separate democratic governors, Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam. Her focus in those roles was on the impacts of climate change, environmental protections and energy policy. 
Like her co-chairs, Navarro also served as a staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center earlier in her career.
For the last two years she has been the president of Energy Align Advisors that gives guidance to energy and tech companies about state regulations and policies. Her deep knowledge of Virginia energy regulations will help Spanberger navigate any potential reforms.
These selections point towards serious regulatory reform concerning renewable energy projects. The state has seen some challenges when it comes to local boards of supervisors considering such projects, like solar farms and battery storage.
With the continued expansion of data centers and the energy infrastructure needed to power them, having past regulators and a member deeply involved with the data center industry sends a message that Spanberger is bringing industry to the table when it comes to potential changes.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

Before she was elected Virginia’s first female governor, Spanberger signaled that she has fresh plans for the state’s energy landscape that start with an accounting of what works, what doesn’t and what needs tweaking.
“I think (we need) an evaluation of where we have had successes, but also, importantly in some places, where have technologies changed? Battery storage technology has improved significantly and has a much greater utility than it even did five years ago,” Spanberger said in August. “And so I think, certainly with the same goals, (we should be) determining … where we should perhaps recalibrate or some places where we can look towards more aggressive forward leaning.”
She also laid out a comprehensive energy plan this summer. 
With a dominant Democratic hold on the House, Senate, and executive branch of state government, it’s likely that bills to expand or assist the VCEA will be a priority. House Democrats have already filed bills for the January legislative session that focus on energy efficiency, especially in low-income households. The General Assembly will convene on Jan. 14.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The Trump administration has made deep cuts to the main federal agency focused on fighting opioid addiction, potentially jeopardizing the nation’s recent progress on reducing overdose deaths, some public health officials and providers say.
Created in 1992, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, known as SAMHSA, hands out billions in grants for mental health and addiction services. The agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, had a budget of about $7.5 billion last year.
Since January, the Trump administration has reduced the agency’s staff by more than half, scrapped $1.7 billion in block grants for state health departments and eliminated roughly $350 million in addiction and overdose prevention funding, according to a recent analysis by STAT, a health news website. The agency is currently without an administrator and is missing 12 of its 17 senior leaders.
Dr. Yngvild Olsen, the former director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA, said almost all of SAMHSA’s substance misuse funding flows to state and local health departments, nonprofits and behavioral health providers on the front lines of the fight against addiction. She noted that the agency has worked with state and local partners to make sure naloxone, the overdose-reversal medication, is “in the hands of every person who needs it.”
“I’m not sure that a very reduced SAMHSA is going to really be able to continue that focus,” said Olsen, now an adviser to the consulting firm Manatt.
The ‘hard, slow work’ of reducing overdose deaths is having an effect

But Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Health and Human Services Department, said the Trump administration is “committed to tackling addiction with compassion and accountability, ensuring taxpayer dollars fund programs that lead to real recovery.”
“SAMHSA is prioritizing treatment, prevention and long-term recovery while ensuring all federally funded programs comply with the law,” Nixon said in an email.
In March, the administration announced that as part of a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, it planned to fold SAMHSA and four other agencies into a new Administration for a Healthy America. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said the reorganization would reduce “bureaucratic sprawl.”
“We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a statement.
In July, a federal judge in Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the planned reorganization.
The cuts come at a time of steady progress in the fight against opioid addiction.
Overdose deaths have fallen consistently since 2023. As of April, the latest figures available, there were 76,500 deaths over the previous 12 months — the lowest year-over-year tally since March 2020. The pandemic drove the number as high as nearly 113,000 in the summer of 2023, according to federal statistics.
A more timely indicator of overdoses — nonfatal suspected overdose patients in hospital emergency departments — was down 7% this year through August compared with 2024, according to a recent Stateline analysis of statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Only a few states and the District of Columbia saw a rise in nonfatal overdoses for the year. The largest increases were 17% in the district, 16% in Rhode Island, 15% in Delaware, 11% in Connecticut and 10% in New Mexico, with smaller increases in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah, New Jersey and Minnesota.
Sara Goldsby, director of the South Carolina Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, said the SAMHSA cuts come at a time when her state is making “good progress, like other states are, to get a handle on the drug crisis.” But Goldsby cautioned that “constant surveillance of the trends” is essential.
Many Black, Latino people can’t get opioid addiction med. Medicaid cuts may make it harder.

In New York, the staff cuts at SAMHSA have created uncertainty, according to Jihoon Kim, president and CEO of the Albany-based InUnity Alliance, which advocates for mental health and substance use organizations across the state. Federal grants account for about half of his members’ funding, he said.
“As the Trump administration has been dismantling SAMHSA and other agencies, the points of contact for a lot of my members have just vanished,” Kim said in an interview.
“We have a lot of providers who have no information — they just do not know what’s happening with their contract renewals. They continue to deliver services, and at some point they will be delivering services without the resources to do so from the federal government.”
COVID-era grants
Some of the SAMHSA grants the administration terminated earlier this year were COVID-era expenditures scheduled to expire in September. Since the pandemic is over, HHS argued, there was no need for money to continue to flow.
Some state health officials Stateline contacted, including in California, Idaho, Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia, said the early cutoff hadn’t had much of an impact, either because they had already spent the money they were promised or resisted spending it on ongoing services.
But health officials and providers in other states told a different story.
Texas was counting on SAMHSA to provide about 77% of the agency’s annual budget for substance use programs, Thomas Vazquez, assistant press officer at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, wrote in an email. The early cancellation of the COVID-era money deprived the state of more than $24.7 million it planned to use to combat substance misuse.
Telemedicine patients with opioid use disorder struggle to fill prescriptions

In South Carolina, Wendy Hughes, president and CEO of the Lexington/Richland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council, said her organization didn’t have enough money before the pandemic. So the loss of the extra money, combined with inflation, “feels like a major cut.”
“The cuts had a very significant impact on my organization in particular, as well as the others throughout the state,” Hughes said. “What it meant was a fairly significant cut to a lot of our outpatient services. We also got a cut to our inpatient services, or detox. And for us, what that meant was we ended up eliminating some of our positions.”
Hughes said her organization secured some additional state funding to mitigate some of the losses and has tried to preserve what it views as the most essential services, such as drug treatment for pregnant women and new mothers.
Uncertain future
Some public health officials and providers of addiction services worry this year’s SAMHSA grant cuts are only the beginning.
The Biden administration strongly supported efforts to make drug use less dangerous, such as increasing the availability of naloxone kits and training on how to use them. But President Donald Trump in July signed an executive order stating that SAMHSA grants will no longer “fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called ‘harm reduction’ or ‘safe consumption’ efforts that only facilitate drug use and its attendant harm.”











States have now become very anxious and nervous about the use of any federal funds for any part of their harm reduction organization.


– Dr. Yngvild Olsen, former director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA



In addition to making naloxone more widely available, harm reduction measures include needle exchanges, overdose prevention sites, fentanyl tests and wound care. Olsen, the former director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA, said Trump’s order has created widespread confusion.
“States have now become very anxious and nervous about the use of any federal funds for any part of their harm reduction organization, including staff that may have been involved in handing out naloxone,” Olsen said. “Because of the wording of some of the messages and some of the guidance from SAMHSA, it’s just very unclear as to what it is that they’re really allowed to do versus not allowed to do, with respect to harm reduction.”
Meanwhile, the Medicaid changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July, including new work requirements and more than $900 billion in spending cuts over the next decade, will result in many people with substance use disorder losing their health care coverage and, potentially, their access to treatment.
The Medicaid changes in the law will decrease the number of people with health insurance by about 7.5 million people by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Medicaid, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states, pays for a significant portion of mental health and substance use care in the United States.
“States were already struggling to meet the demand for treatment,” said Hanna Sharif-Kazemi, a policy manager at the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for health care instead of punishment for drug users.
“While the Trump administration says that they are trying to do these federal funding cuts as a way to get rid of duplicate funding streams, what they’re actually doing is removing … tools in our tool belt. And this is not the time for us to be getting rid of tools. We actually needed more tools and more funding in our tool belt to begin with. So it is really disappointing.”

(Photo courtesy of the Department of Corrections, graphic by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Corrections has made little discernible progress in fixing an aging wastewater plant that regularly violates its federal water permit, public records show.
The department missed a 2024 deadline for completing repairs to the Cummins-Varner Wastewater Treatment Plant and returning the facility to compliance with its wastewater permit. Despite an extension of the deadline to 2027, the corrections department has yet to move beyond the early planning stages on an expansion of the plant’s capacity.
The wastewater plant serves two of the state’s largest prisons and has been under a consent administrative order from the state’s environmental agency since 2022. Consent administrative orders (CAOs) are legally binding, voluntary agreements between the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality and those who have violated or are believed to have violated state or federal environmental regulations. The orders outline steps to return to compliance and monetary penalties, and violators do not have to admit fault by signing one.
While DEQ technically levied an $8,400 penalty against DOC for the violations in 2021, the corrections department will only have to pay it if DEQ determines it isn’t in compliance with the consent order.
The plant treats waste from the Cummins and Varner Units in Lincoln County and is at least 50 years old, according to a report filed with DEQ in 2021. It hasn’t had any significant upgrades since 2001, the corrections department said last year.
The plant is designed to treat 800,000 gallons of wastewater per day, but public records show that for over a decade it’s been exceeding that amount. In 2021, amid 12 months of pollution violations, an analysis by DOC contractor McClellan Engineering Consultants concluded the plant had “significantly exceeded” its treatment capacity, with an average of 1.2 million gallons of waste passing through the plant every day.
The excess flow contributed to the plant discharging wastewater that hadn’t been fully treated and exceeded permit limits.
Despite the 2024 compliance deadline, the corrections department spent years deciding whether to build a new, larger plant or expand the existing one. It asked the Division of Environmental Quality for a deadline extension, citing a search for funding, even as it hadn’t settled on a course of action.
It’s unclear if the delay has harmed the environment.
“Permit limits are developed to be protective of aquatic life, water quality, and human health,” DEQ spokesperson Melony Martinez said in an email. “Violations of the permitted limits over a period of time may contribute to an impairment of the receiving waterbody or downstream waterbody.”
The Advocate’s analysis of the plant’s permit violations is based on a review of public records and discharge data reported to the Division of Environmental Quality.
Despite multiple requests, a Department of Corrections spokesperson did not provide answers to questions about the agency’s plans to address the permit violations at the plant or when the fixes would be funded. Instead, the spokesperson provided a written statement from Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace.
“The Cummins/Varner Wastewater Treatment Plan expansion continues to be a priority for the Board of Corrections and the Department of Corrections as it strives to ensure both compliance and production from the facility,” Wallace said in the statement. “The complexity of the project and changes in [construction] contingencies have required re-evaluation from different administrations, Corrections Secretaries and Maintenance Directors to ensure the scope of the project and the solutions are adequate for the changing needs of the units.”
The Cummins and Varner Units hold just over 4,000 incarcerated people.



Timeline

Pre-2013: Cummins WWTP begins receiving more waste than it was designed to treat, according to McClellan engineers
2017-2019: The Cummins WWTP begins seeing more limit exceedances during this period.
2019: DOC tells DEQ that multiple components of the Cummin WWTP’s treatment process had failed “within a four month period,” but that the plant was undergoing rehabilitation.
2021: The Cummins WWTP breaches its permit limits 106 times. DOC submits compliance plan to DEQ saying it plans to construct a new, 3.25 MGD treatment plant to replace the existing plant.
2022: DEQ and DOC enter into the original consent order.
2023: The number of permit limit exceedances drop to the lowest point since 2018. DOC asks for an extension of the consent order’s compliance deadline.
2024: It receives a deadline extension from DEQ to 2027. Meanwhile, the plant’s condition continues to deteriorate.
2025: DOC pivots to building an expansion of the existing WWTP, a cheaper option. Meanwhile, the plant breached its permit limits more times between January and August than it did the entirety of 2024.




 Blown deadlines 
Tim LaPara, a professor of civil, environmental and geo-engineering at the University of Minnesota who researches wastewater treatment, said wastewater plants have a lifespan of 10 to 25 years before they need to be replaced or upgraded.
In 2021, the Cummins plant exceeded permit limits 106 times — though the severity ranged wildly — mostly due to equipment breakdowns. In April 2021, it discharged partially-treated waste containing average fecal coliform concentrations (an indicator for potentially harmful E. coli bacteria) over 20 times higher than permitted.
A visit by McClellan’s engineers in August 2021 found much of the plant deteriorated or nonfunctional.
“They had a whole bunch of problems in 2021,” said Ellen Carpenter, a former DEQ water division chief and environmental lawyer who reviewed the plant’s discharge data and other documentation at the Advocate’s request.


In 2021, the DOC’s engineering consultant initially said the department would construct a 3.25 MGD replacement plant to permanently fix the issues by the 2024 deadline. But the deadline grew closer, then passed, with little reported progress as the department explored other options for remedying the plant violations. In August last year, DEQ extended the compliance deadline to the end of 2027.
But the corrections department’s most recent progress report indicated it won’t be in compliance until 2028. Other documents obtained from the DOC put the projected compliance date as late as mid-2030 — three years after the revised compliance deadline and six past the original.
Meanwhile, the department is already missing milestones outlined in a revised compliance plan created after the deadline extension. The design should have been finished in May, but it still hasn’t been completed, based on quarterly progress reports the DOC provides the environmental agency.
The corrections department said last year it could not obtain funds for the project until its design was complete, and DOC documents indicate it must begin obtaining money for the project by May 2026 to be in compliance by 2030.
The Legislature’s fiscal session, where budget decisions for state agencies are made, begins in April.
With the design deadline missed, the department probably won’t meet the 2027 deadline, said Carpenter, the former DEQ water quality supervisor.
“They’re already putting the [division] on notice that they aren’t going to meet that deadline” through the progress reports, Carpenter said.
DEQ’s Martinez told the Advocate that extending the consent order again may be necessary if the revised deadline can’t be met, but did not say whether that was likely.



Options considered by DOC
Based on the records it was provided, the Advocate identified five options that the Department of Corrections considered to address the Cummins plant’s permit violations. It is not known if other alternatives not listed here were considered.

New, 3.25 MGD treatment plant. Cost: $26 million.
New, 2 MGD plant plus upgrading existing 0.8 plant. Cost: $31.8 million.
Upgrade and expand the existing plant to 2 MGD. Quoted costs have varied from $9.5 million to $20.6 million.
Reduce the amount of wastewater entering the plant through a water conservation project at the Cummins and Varner Units. Cost: $10.6 million.
Do nothing and pay for whatever fines or legal actions DEQ or the EPA levies.




 Fast flow, slow solutions 
Despite delays to the permanent fix for Cummins’ treatment troubles, the corrections department has taken some action. Equipment repairs in 2022 coincided with fewer pollution limit violations. DOC’s plans for a secondary waste disinfection method will likely help prevent violations as well, Carpenter said.
But the plant struggled to comply with its permit in 2024 and 2025 as the half-century-old facility continued to deteriorate despite the improvements, department documents and discharge data show.
The plant’s capacity is a major contributor to its ongoing treatment problems.

When the plant is overburdened, waste can move too quickly through the system to be fully treated, LaPara said. This is especially true if the flow of waste remains significantly above capacity for long periods, which is known to happen at Cummins.
Three years after submitting its initial compliance plan to environmental regulators, the corrections department changed its mind about building a new, larger plant, opting instead to expand the existing plant’s capacity to 2 million gallons per day (MGD) — much less than either of the new plant options the agency considered.
McClellan engineers said the expansion would be more than adequate, writing last year that the it “is the preferred alternative that will meet the overall goals that include increased treatment capacity, reliable permit compliance, and cost effectiveness.”
But a corrections department employee expressed concern in written notes dated Sept. 12, 2024, weeks after the consent order deadline was extended.
The plant “needs to handle more than 2 MGD,” Jim Flannery, the DOC’s water and wastewater coordinator wrote in the notes, which were emailed to other department officials after he reviewed a preliminary engineering report McClellan sent earlier that month.
“What worries me about this is I only see an increase in flow design to 2.0 MGD when we are not positive that the plant flow only reaches 2.0 MGD,” Flannery wrote.
The meter that measures how much waste runs through the Cummins plant maxes out at 2 MGD, according to Flannery’s notes, leaving it unclear how much waste passes through the plant when the flow exceeds that volume.

Other records show the plant’s flow meter has maxed out for 12 to 18 hours at a time, causing “lots of problems” for plant treatment equipment.
Having an accurate picture of how much waste goes through a plant is necessary to inform decisions about capacity expansion, said LaPara, the Minnesota engineering professor. Given the flow meter’s limitations, LaPara said the expansion’s lower capacity was “troubling,” barring “some rationale” to explain the decision.
“If they’re designing for a certain capacity and they actually need more than that, the new facility won’t work,” LaPara said.
He stressed, however, that other factors of the plant’s design would also influence treatment performance, and that he could not predict what the exact consequences of the lower capacity would be.
 Increasing costs 
Cost estimates have gone up since the Department of Corrections settled on expanding the current plant.
Drafts and final versions of the 2024 preliminary engineering report indicate the plant expansion would cost either $9.5 million or $12.3 million. But documents from 2025 indicate costs now range from $16.8 million to $20.6 million — not accounting for tariffs.
The Advocate requested clarification from the department regarding which estimate for the expansion was the most accurate, but did not receive an answer.
In an April 2, 2025, email to McClelland staff, DOC’s Flannery said he was “quite sure” the price tag for the upgrades “will have to be revisited.”
Adam Triche, a professional engineer with McClellan, asked if Flannery wanted to adjust short-term cost projections contained in the department’s 20-year wastewater spending plan, then pegged at $16.8 million. Flannery responded that planning ahead would be “smart thinking.” Explanations would be demanded if they had to increase the price later down the line, he said.
“I expect RPGs to be launched (questions) from every direction on why,” Flannery wrote.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design1-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-18 05:56:34.885059

(Photo by Kaitlyn Hills/For the New Hampshire Bulletin)The idea started with a question, posed by the Alton and Barnstead school boards to a candidate for superintendent. The two Lakes Region towns had seen a steady drop in student enrollment in recent years. What would he, as superintendent, do to address that?
Sitting across the table for that 2019 interview, Timothy Broadrick considered the usual menu of responses a district might choose. The district could consolidate with other school districts, and pool resources. It could pursue tuition agreements to get students and money from surrounding districts.
It took years to arrive at the answer. Alton and Barnstead would take advantage of an obscure 2009 law and make its high school, Prospect Mountain, an open enrollment school, allowing parents across the state to send their children there. Those families’ resident districts would pay Alton and Barnstead tuition. And Prospect Mountain would completely redesign its student programming to make itself attractive. 
“The cost of doing nothing looked much greater than the cost of failure,” Broadrick said in an interview.  
Three years after Prospect Mountain High School adopted that program, the school has brought in about 30 kids from outside the district, a boost to its ranks and its budget. And its decision has kicked off a series of high-profile legal battles with “sending” school districts, who argue they should not have to pay. 
But now that the state Supreme Court has upheld Prospect Mountain’s right to collect tuition from other school districts, the significance — and seriousness — of the open enrollment approach is clear. 
And observers are wondering which school district might be next.
New Hampshire schools have had the ability to designate their schools as open enrollment schools since 2009, when Gov. John Lynch signed the law allowing school boards to opt in to the designation. But only two districts have adopted the policy, Prospect Mountain and Franklin, and only Prospect Mountain has fully put it to use. 
Now, following the court decision, at least one district, Concord, is expressing interest in the approach. The Franklin School Board voted to update its existing policy Monday and allow up to five out-of-district students per grade from grades 5-12. And the idea has percolated to school boards across the state this year, said Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association.
Still, the discussion is hardly a groundswell. Republican lawmakers are pushing to pass a bill to make open enrollment universal for all school districts. But absent such a mandate, few boards are rushing to do so voluntarily.
“I’m not at all surprised that there’s just a general inertia here,” said Drew Cline, chairman of the State Board of Education and a supporter of the open enrollment law. “I think these things take just a long time to change — these sort of institutional culture changes.” 
Fighting the spiral
To Broadrick, the draw of open enrollment should be obvious. Districts everywhere are losing enrollment due to entrenched demographic changes: Younger adults are having fewer children and New Hampshire births are lagging behind deaths. Without action taken, districts might be faced with budget cuts, school closures, and consolidation plans.
“I’ve referred to it in the past as a spiral of decline,” Broadrick said. “Because as you lose students, you have to eliminate staff, you lose funding. That results in losing public confidence in the quality of the school. More people leave, pull their kids out to seek other options, which then reinforces the original problem, and then you have more budget cuts.” 
The open enrollment law gives those districts a chance to fight back, Broadrick says. 
“We know what it looks like when you slip into that smaller, more at-risk category of schools,” he said. “So we’re trying to maintain what we have. That’s why we did this.” 
Back in 2021, the approach was almost unheard of. “I called our school lawyer and said, ‘I understand there’s a school choice law in New Hampshire,” Broadrick said. “And he said, ‘No there isn’t.’ And I said ‘Well hold on, it’s called (RSA) 194-D.’” 
The plan soon took root. “I rolled (it) out to the school board and said, ‘Look, there’s this law, this open enrollment law. Nobody knows exactly what it means, because nobody’s ever done it right, and if you want to try it, here’s what we have to do.’” 
At Prospect Mountain, to set itself apart, the school crafted a “pathways” program. Teachers  work with freshman students to craft a course plan for their four years that aligns with that student’s career or college goals. The district used a recent “innovation schools” law that allows school districts to request exemptions from state regulations to the State Board of Education 
After that overhaul, 11 students left the Pittsfield School District to attend classes at Prospect Mountain. Soon, a dispute emerged when Pittsfield argued it should not need to pay tuition because it had not approved sending those students to Prospect Mountain. On Oct. 18, the state Supreme Court ruled that the 2009 law is unequivocal: The resident districts of students attending open enrollment public schools must pay tuition, whether they agreed to it or not.
Pittsfield is not the only school district to challenge Prospect Mountain’s tuition demands. Epsom is also disputing that it should pay for its resident students who attend Prospect Mountain. At a State Board of Education hearing Thursday, an attorney from the school district argued that Epsom voters already chose to enter an authorized regional enrollment area (AREA) agreement  to send students to Pembroke, which they said should negate Prospect Mountain’s tuition request. The State Board, led by Cline, appeared skeptical, citing the Supreme Court decision. 
In an interview, Cline said the court ruling allows a straightforward reading of the law and demonstrates the real financial benefit for districts that choose to participate. 
“It’s now clear that this is what the statute says,” he said. “There’s no gray area.” 
That, Cline added, could entice districts. “It could be that local districts have been waiting to go forward with open enrollment, pending the decision here,” he said. 
But Cline acknowledged there are perceived logistical barriers. Districts might feel they need to create a new learning model that they can use to draw in students, as Prospect Mountain did. They may want to determine how much their own classrooms can expand before opening them to doing so. And they may want to develop a plan to market their schools to out-of-district families. 
“It’s a lot of work to start running one of these programs,” Cline said. 
A difficult decision
At least one district is wrestling with the question. Concord School District is considering following Prospect Mountain, according to School Board Chairwoman Pamela Walsh. The school board has consulted with its attorney and will likely explore the option at length when it crafts its next budget in February, Walsh said in an interview. 
But the idea is not certain and Walsh herself says she has not made up her mind about it.
“I think people recognize the value,” Walsh said. “But there’s a lot of unanswered questions that we’re still looking at and grappling with and trying to understand.” 
On the one hand, Concord could benefit from additional students, particularly as it looks to fill a fiscal hole driven in part by an increase in premium prices for its health care. 
“Because of our diverse course offerings and the size of our district, we may do well, right?” Walsh said. “And it may allow us to support additional, higher-level classes and things like that.” 
On the other hand, Walsh is unsure about the effects the move could have on other districts. If Concord embraced open enrollment, could it be hurting less-resourced schools by siphoning away students and forcing them to pay? 
“I think there are a lot of districts that are sort of struggling with trying to understand how it could impact (their) finances,” she said.
In Franklin, the Prospect Mountain decision pushed the board to revisit its policy Monday.
The district technically already used the 2009 law to become an open enrollment district in 2015. But that move was intended to help fix a specific local problem, and not to allow the district to recruit from around the state. 
Residents in the Hill School District had voted to break away from the Franklin school administrative unit and join the Newfound school administrative unit; the open enrollment designation was designed to allow students from Hill attending Franklin High School to finish their high school years there despite the split.
On Monday, the board tweaked its policy to allow five students in each grade from grade 5-12 to enroll in the district. It also moved to keep its policy preventing any of its own students from leaving to other open enrollment districts — a privilege available under the law only to schools that adopt open enrollment themselves. 
To many Franklin school board members, the decision was a defensive move. Given the Supreme Court decision, keeping its open enrollment policy allows Franklin to keep its own resident students in the district, and avoids the costly tuition battles waged by Pittsfield and Epsom.
“I will say that you are going to find other school districts that are going to be declaring open enrollment and setting their limits according to the law because of the most recent interpretation of the law,” said board member Jack Finley during the meeting. 
But Superintendent Dan LeGallo has expressed concerns with the potential effects of expanding open enrollment, particularly on students who can’t afford the transportation costs to go to a wealthier district, or on districts that lose money. 
“I think Franklin’s a district that could potentially lose more kids than it would gain just based on economics, you know, and what we’re able to offer based on our socioeconomic situation,” LeGallo said.
To Broadrick, those qualms ignore a bigger prospect: If school districts do not voluntarily choose to adopt an open enrollment policy now, state lawmakers may vote to force them to later.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 1 into law on March 28 after it quickly passed the House and Senate earlier this year. 
Ohio S.B. 1 went into effect at the end of June, meaning this is the first fall semester under the new law.

The new law creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“The best way to describe it is everything, quite honestly, just seems a little bit more bleak … just the general repression of speech and student expression, whether it’s inside the classroom, outside of the classroom, on campus and the dorms,” said Sabrina Estevez, an Ohio State University senior.
Ohio State banned chalking on campus over the summer and now all dorm decor in the common areas must be Ohio State-specific. 
“Given changes to federal and state policy, the university has been reviewing practices, rules and policies,” Ohio State University spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. 
“We revised the university signage standards in light of continued complaints regarding chalking on campus and the significant amount of administrative time spent evaluating chalking.”
No other public Ohio university has taken those measures though. 
“It feels like the university is over-complying,” said Estevez, who is president of Ohio State’s Ohio Student Association chapter. “It just feels so antithetical to what I believe a learning space should look like.” 
Students said the new law is affecting the quality of education they are receiving. 
Even though Estevez said she never hears her professors use the words “Senate Bill 1” in the classroom, she said “it still kind of lingers over everybody’s head … we don’t know what we can say to each other.”
“I think you need to be able to express things freely and challenge thought, but there’s just not much of that anymore,” she said. 
As a political science major, Miami University sophomore Kali Barcroft said she has noticed her professors change what they are comfortable talking about in the classroom, referring to the controversial issues portion of the new law. 
“It just says ‘controversial’ issues and that’s very up in the air for a lot of people as to what that means,” Barcroft said. “And so in my classes, it’s been a very different environment overall.”
For classroom discussion, the law set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. 
“Not having (those topics) talked about in the classroom is damaging, people aren’t expanding upon what they already know,” Barcroft, who is president of Miami’s Ohio Student Association chapter. 
“People aren’t embracing a new perspective from what they’ve already known and grown up with.” 
She said she has noticed professors being hesitant to talk about certain topics in the classroom, such as abortion or COVID-19 pandemic policies. 
John O’Keefe, an associate history professor at Ohio University’s Chillicothe campus, said there’s a possibility of a chilling effect among faculty because of the new law.
“Our big concerns really are that portions of this bill will affect our ability to teach honestly and effectively in the classroom, and also restrict our competitiveness, so that this will lower the university’s ability to recruit top faculty, both in teaching and in research,” he said. 
O’Keefe said some of the provisions have added more work for faculty. 
“It means that more time is being taken away from the things we really care about — having really strong discussions in the classroom (and) creating environments where students are comfortable,” he said. 
Diversity centers across Ohio’s public universities  — including LGBTQ+ centers, women’s centers, and multicultural centers — have closed because of the new higher education law.
“It was genuinely upsetting to arrive on campus that first day and see what they’ve done to the African American Cultural Resource Center,” said Christian Caffey, a University of Cincinnati senior.
“Even though it’s just changing the words on the building … they wiped me off the building.”
The University of Cincinnati’s African American Cultural Resource Center was renamed the Cultural Center as a result of new law.
“I think students are really bearing the brunt of having to replace the community that’s been lost with the loss of those identity centers,” Estevez said.  
Barcroft said there’s been efforts to try and replace the sense of community from the diversity centers on campus, but said “it just doesn’t have that same feeling.”
Kent State University and the University of Akron are the latest universities to announce eliminating degree programs. 
The University of Toledo announced earlier this year it is suspending nine undergraduate programs and Ohio University is suspending 11 degree programs. 
Kent State is eliminating 24 undergraduate degrees including a bachelor of arts in Earth science, a bachelor of arts in physics, a bachelor of arts in Africana Studies, and a bachelor of arts in chemistry, among others. 
The University of Akron is getting rid of three programs.

(Ohio Capital journal file photo.)Workers from one of the biggest library systems in Ohio are establishing a labor union focused on improvements they say need to happen in areas such as wages and paid time off.
Employees with the Columbus Metropolitan Library have been working to form a union for the better part of a year, according to members participating in the effort, and planning to unionize with the Ohio Federation of Teachers.
For Jude Virostko, an adult services librarian at the library system’s South High branch, growing up in Coshocton meant being a “library kid,” something that fed into her thirst for knowledge and desire to be a librarian.
“I was at my library every chance I got,” Virostko said. “It was a place where I felt safe when that wasn’t necessarily the case in other places.”
She “wanted to be that safe space” after she moved to Columbus and has been in libraries every since.
“Libraries are an essential part of a functioning democracy,” Virostko said, as they face funding challenges on the state and federal level.
But being a librarian has “become a little bit more dangerous,” according to Megan Sheeran, a librarian at the Columbus library’s main location in downtown Columbus.
She has watched as the library has become a place for all people to come and feel welcomed, but also a place where staff are asked to do more than ever before.
“Some have been threatened and assaulted,” Sheehan said. “People are honestly having a really tough time and we’re on the frontlines being asked to help with that.”
About 630 workers are a part of the union’s bargaining unit, and the organizing committee has talked with more than half of union-eligible Columbus Metropolitan Library employees, with about 80% supportive of the efforts.
From left, Luke Avnaim, Megan Sheeran, Jude Virostko and Rahaf Fares stand in front of a union sign. The four are all employees of Columbus Metropolitan Library, and members of an effort to unionize workers at the library. (Photo provided by the Ohio Federation of Teachers.)
Management within the library system have been made aware of the unionizing effort, according to Ohio Federation of Teachers president Melissa Cropper.
The union would include Columbus Metropolitan Library workers with the exception of management, security staff, and certain administrative staff, as dictated by Ohio union laws.
The process to officially file with the State Employment Relations Board hasn’t happened yet, because the Ohio Federation of Teachers wants to make every effort to get to eligible employees.
“We are very adamant that we want conversations to be worker to worker,” Cropper told the Capital Journal. “We have enough support to file, but it’s that wanting to talk to every worker on the ground.”
Both Sheeran and Virostko embrace their work in helping connect Ohioans with the resources they need, but think the labor union is needed to demand their employer not ask too much of them, pushing employees to be the resources themselves.
“Frontline staff are being pushed to act as untrained social workers,” Virostko said. “The social safety net is diminishing, and we’re being pushed on that.”

In an official statement from the union organizers, the group says their “direct, daily experience” with library patrons means they “deserve a voice in the policies that affect us.”
“We’re forming our union to make sure every (Columbus Metropolitan Library) worker, part-time and full-time, is paid fairly and receives vital benefits, like affordable health care and paid time off,” the statement reads.
At the center of the effort is the passion the workers have for their libraries, their profession and their patrons, the statement continues.
“Core values that our library depends on, like intellectual freedom, diversity, equity and inclusion are facing dire threats,” according to the organizers.
“We need to use our collective voice to defend the freedom to read, the freedom to think and the freedom to be yourself.”
For Rahaf Fares, a customer service specialist at the Martin Luther King Jr. branch, the power of the library and the importance it serves for the community is why fighting for a union is vital.
“I feel like library communities are a reflection of statewide issues that the greater community is experiencing,” Fares said.
“If Columbus is experiencing issues with housing and people struggling to find jobs and access to food, they need help connecting to things that might help, and we’re needed even more.”
Luke Avnaim, who sorts and delivers books from the Columbus library system’s operations center in Gahanna, has watched the workload get heavier for him as well, with new drivers being trained and a new route already instituted since he started working there.
With the growing need the workers see at the library, planning a more supportive system for employees with wage, health care and paid time off improvements can only help, and having a union to help see it through is important, Avnaim said.
“We could plan a little bit more for our future,” Avnaim said. “We need all we can get.”
A spokesperson for Columbus Metropolitan Library told the Capital Journal it has not heard from staff members about any efforts to unionize.
He offered no further comment.
The Columbus Metropolitan Library unionization would add it to a list of library workers who have started labor unions.
This includes workers from Worthington, Grandview Heights, Pickerington, Upper Arlington, Athens County and Delaware County.
Worthington and Grandview Heights workers ratified their first union contracts in 2023.
Pickerington’s union contract was ratified in March of this year.
Upper Arlington, Athens County, and Delaware County are all still in contract negotiations, according to the Ohio Federation of Teachers.

(Photo by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)Despite Ohioans overwhelmingly protecting access to abortion, Republican lawmakers are moving to restrict the procedure by ending telehealth prescriptions and mail-order pills.
The sponsors say they aren’t specifically targeting abortion, but the increase in drugs available through the mail.
Ohio Issue 1 passed in November 2023 with 57% of the vote, enshrining reproductive rights into the state constitution.
It says Ohioans have the right to make their own decisions about abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care, and continuing pregnancy. The state is prohibited from interfering with or penalizing someone for exercising this right.
Since 2024, the state’s 13 abortion clinics have been able to prescribe the abortion pill during video visits with patients, and even mail it directly to homes.
At the Northeast Ohio Women’s Center, Dr. David Burkons says two-thirds of his patients have a medication abortion, versus a surgical one.
“People don’t have to say, ‘Well, I have to take off work to go to the clinic. I can get it by mail. I can do this when I want to,’” Burkons said. “It’s on their schedule rather than ours, which obviously has a lot of appeal to people.”
But that form of access could be restricted soon.
“Mail-order medications have become much more commonplace, and this is a good, common-sense, generally applicable bill,” state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, said.
Matthews and state Rep. Meredith Craig, R-Smithville, introduced Ohio House Bill 324, which would prevent mail-order prescriptions and telehealth appointments for medications that cause “severe adverse effects” in more than 5% of users.
Anti-abortion groups that testified in support of the bill cite a study done by a right-wing think tank that lists Mifepristone, the most common abortion medication, as having severe impacts on 10% of patients.
“If these medications are sending any patients to the hospital with sepsis, organ failure at a rate of 1 out of 20 patients, then I think that should be the cause of concern, whatever the medication may be used for,” Mathews said.
Burkons points to plenty of studies, including data from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, that state the meds are safe.
The legislation is unconstitutional, he added.
“They’re letting politics get in the way of health care, and abortion is health care,” Burkons said.
When we questioned, Mathews claimed that this wasn’t meant to target abortion, as it applies to various classes of drugs like antidepressants and opioids.
The Ohio Department of Health would decide which drugs meet that 5% threshold.
“Looking at the Department of Health, insurance claims, and the self-reported studies that a drug manufacturer puts out,” Mathews explained.
This would require in-person appointments at one of the 13 clinics to get the abortion pill, which Burkons said will reinstate barriers to care.
“They’re trying to say, ‘We know more than the women do, we’re going to make it more difficult or impossible for them to access this very, very efficient method of health care,'” the doctor said.
It’s still early in the hearing process, but progressive advocates say they are prepared to sue if this bill goes through.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The turbulent 1960s prepared a generation of K-State students for journalism. The Collegian, where I learned reporting and which I edited, was embroiled in a crusade against using student fees for a new football stadium.
I was a nervous kid with a notebook interviewing an important athletic official after a particularly rough Student Senate meeting. “About your comment —” I began.
“I did not say that,” the official said.
“But we have you recorded on tape,” I said.
He replied: “The tape is wrong,”
It was an early welcome to today’s post-truth world.
Carl Bernstein, of Watergate reporting fame, defined journalism as finding the most accurate version of truth available at the moment. That was always a challenging task.
Finding truth in today’s facts-are-wrong political environment may be impossible unless journalism finds a new way forward.
These are extraordinary times. Corporate broadcast entities relinquish their right to free speech just to gain approval for big business deals. Shari Redstone’s sell-out of CBS to seal a Skydance deal is a prime example, as is NBC’s corporate owner Comcast’s donation to President Trump’s ballroom project.
Corporate-owned news organizations settle frivolous lawsuits instead of defending our vital free press. On the print side, corporate newspaper owners put their balance sheet first, readers second. When nearly seven million people participated in the No Kings protests, it barely made the front page of The New York Times.
The concentration of media and a hodgepodge of regulation have made it much easier for government to blackmail media outlets into airing and printing only what the government wants. New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court case that has been the primary protection for media holding public officials accountable, likely would not have been handed down today.
Journalism educators and journalists have not adapted to this new environment. Speaking truth to power and casting light into darkness has been the motto of the press.
Today, that is no longer enough.
I once heard the publisher of a storied national newspaper claim the press has no stake in elections, no stake in governmental or political debates. He also said reporters should be so neutral as to not vote.
The free press exists only because the First Amendment grants it as a right in a constitutional democracy. When democracy and freedom are attacked, press neutrality equals surrender, threatening the media’s right to exist. Surrender damages every citizen.
Today’s press must fiercely advocate for all freedoms and for democracy itself. This is not a new idea. Early in the 20th Century, an advocacy press pushed cleanup of labor abuses and gave standing to the suffrage movement.
Let’s abandon outdated and unworkable rules. Giving equal time to both sides doesn’t work in our post-truth era. Don’t ask if it’s raining. Look out the window and say so.
Corporate press is fond of the line, “President Trump said, without evidence.” Call a lie what it is — a lie. All positions are not equal. Political reporting fails when politics is treated as a game for the press to total up winners and losers.
Relying on official sources does not work when those official sources don’t tell the truth. Many reporters knew former President Biden’s frail condition and did not report it, resulting in the infamous debate, Biden’s withdrawal from the race and the unusual 2024 election. Today, editors avoid nonsensical elements of President Trump’s speeches and treat them as normal.
Above all, the obligation of fairness should be to news readers and viewers first, sources second.
Democracy is not a partisan issue. It should not be treated as partisan by the news media.
When an administration or any public figure attacks free speech and tries to destroy the government and cultural entities that serve as America’s foundation, the press must speak, act and lead — in aggressive news coverage as well as in editorials. There are not two sides in this.
Marty Baron, former editor of The Washington Post, put it this way: “I think it’s very important that the press explains just how extraordinary this is and how out of the norm it is, and how unconstitutional it is, and how undemocratic it all is.”
Trump and his allies have filed frivolous lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and will continue to do so. The goal is to intimidate the press and to make editors fearful of being sued.
Editors and publishers must push back, as The New York Times did when sued in September: “This lawsuit has no merit. It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists’ First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”
Kansas journalists aggressively pushed back against attacks on free press rights in Marion, winning important victories. The same energy is sorely needed nationally to preserve all our rights.
We need to pay more attention to nonprofit media, free of government and corporate profit constraints. We already have models for that in ProPublica, which revealed ethics lapses of the Supreme Court. Here at home, the Kansas Reflector and its national group of state reporting affiliates have done a great job as statehouse reporting staffs have been hollowed out.
There are new and promising independent sources of news, as established reporters and news influencers flock to Substack, podcasts and video, and find new uses for social media. Legacy media, facing its ongoing legitimacy crisis, would do well to pay attention. The rest of us should encourage the innovation.
These issues affect us all, and the ramifications are local as well as national, with democracy in the balance. Ordinary people in Kansas have been fired from their jobs because of organized intimidation against their speech. Others have been threatened — not just entertainers like Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert.
It falls to every generation to defend our freedoms, and a free press is citizens’ sword in that fight. As Susan Edgerley, member of the Kansas Hall of Fame and formerly of The New York Times, wrote: “For generations we let ourselves off the hook with false equivalency, and what we called balance. Today calls for deeper, harder thinking.”
Our freedom depends on it.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.), on her way to vote at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 17, 2025. (Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)Washington’s most endangered congressional Democrat in next year’s midterms sparred openly with her own party for an hour on the floor of the U.S. House on Monday night.
U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is pushing a resolution to disapprove of actions by outgoing U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois, that resulted in his chief of staff as the only Democrat running to succeed him in 2026. A vote on the resolution is anticipated Tuesday morning.
Gluesenkamp Perez’s Democratic colleagues lined up to oppose her resolution and stand up for Garcia. The Illinois congressman, at one point, spoke in his own defense.
Republicans exited the chamber as the debate unfolded. And no Democrats spoke in support of Gluesenkamp Perez’s move. The southwest Washington congresswoman, now halfway through her second term, was left on her own to defend the resolution.
“If you’re not going to run, you don’t get to choose your successor, no matter how noble the work you have done beforehand,” she said. “That’s what this is about, accountability.”
Garcia said he “wasn’t expecting to stand here to debate my retirement. We should not be distracted by political ploys when our constituents want us to stay focused and deliver for them.”
The 69-year-old congressman was sworn into office in 2019. He lost his daughter in 2023 and said his wife, who has multiple sclerosis, has been the chief caregiver for their daughter’s four children. He said he filed to run then made the “tough decision” to step aside.
“When a colleague chooses his family, that shouldn’t be a moment for division, it should be a moment for understanding and unity,” he said. “One day, you might be the one making that choice, and you shouldn’t have to debate it on the House floor.”
Some Democrats questioned the motives of Gluesenkamp Perez, a centrist known for going her own way in her three years of service. 
“This resolution is nothing more than a cheap political stunt that pulls from the playbook of some of my Republican colleagues,” said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois.
Democrats tried to block the resolution. But House Republicans united behind Gluesenkamp Perez to repel the attempt before heading off the floor.
Gluesenkamp Perez stood alone at the podium, a large chart with the timeline of the congressman’s actions at her side.
The congresswoman said Garcia filed a re-election petition with the necessary signatures. Three days before the filing deadline, she said the congressman signed and helped gather signatures on a petition for his chief of staff to become a candidate. 
Hours before the deadline, the top aide filed to run, Gluesenkamp Perez said during her floor remarks. A day later, when it was clear they were the only two Democratic candidates, Congressman Garcia announced he would be retiring.
Democrats heaped praise on Garcia as they unleashed a torrent of criticism at Gluesenkamp Perez, a centrist known for going her own way.
“I am appalled at the hubris behind all of this,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif. “He is a legend to his district, he is a legend in Congress. This is character assassination. This Democratic intra-party fighting is not what any of us want. And it’s not what the American people deserve.”
Gluesenkamp Perez repeatedly stressed that the resolution she filed Thursday wasn’t personal.
“Nothing validates subverting an election,” she said. “The question is, do you have the right to choose your successor?”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marie-gluesenkamp-perez-2-1024x593.jpg,,,2025-11-18 00:56:26.406509
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Keeping teaching a worthy profession,Christopher E. Trombly,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/keeping-teaching-a-profession-worthy/,The “teacher shortage” is fueled not by  lower numbers of individuals entering the field but by rapidly growing numbers of educators leaving it.,"Much has been written since even before the COVID-19 pandemic about a “teacher shortage” in Connecticut and across the United States. 
From the perspectives of the superintendents and principals responsible for staffing schools, and of the families whose children are assigned to classes with unreasonably high numbers of students, or are taught either by educators working under emergency credentials or by successions of substitute teachers, the growing number of teaching vacancies certainly feels like a shortage. 
What has too often gone overlooked in media accounts and policy discussions, however, is that in Connecticut alone there exist over 10,000 women and men who choose not to work under the active certifications that they hold.
The “teacher shortage” is far more akin to a famine than to a drought, as it stems largely (though unintentionally) from policy and budgetary choices that have been made over the decades by elected officials. While this distinction no doubt feels academic to administrators, teachers, students, and families, it is nevertheless crucial for all of us to recognize if we are to work toward the enactment of policies and crafting of budgets that not only fill existing teaching vacancies in schools but genuinely improve long-term outcomes for all children and adolescents in our state and nation. Equally crucial is that we reject policy solutions that, by attending to short-term staffing needs (e.g., lowering standards for entry into the profession), actually worsen circumstances for young people, families, and educators.


A pair of researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Cornell University recently released a study of Texas’ quarter-century of relaxing teacher training requirements. They found, “On the one hand, the policy changes increased the supply of certified teachers, which reduced schools’ reliance on uncertified teachers. On the other hand, the new policy led to the growth of a large for-profit sector, which produced teachers with lower value-added than those from standard and other alternative programs.” . Such lowering of the standards for entry into teaching is not an option that should be considered for a moment in Connecticut – particularly as our state ranks so low (by some measures, 49th) in racial educational equality.
The research literature makes plain that the “teacher shortage” is fueled not by significantly lower numbers of individuals entering the field but by rapidly growing numbers of educators electing to leave it. Such turnover and attrition are particularly acute in districts serving high numbers of students from families earning low incomes and/or from minoritized backgrounds. Inadequately resourced districts cannot compensate their teachers at the same rates as well-resourced districts can. Consequently, they face persistent turnover that compromises their ability to improve outcomes for students or to sustain the improvements that they do achieve.
Nationwide, according to Farahmandpour and Voelkel (2025), “Teacher attrition is higher than in other careers including pharmacists, engineers, nurses, architects and police officers.”  This is no doubt in part because the “pay gap” between teaching and other professions requiring college degrees has never been higher in the United States. Sylvia Allegretto  explains, “On average, teachers earned 73.1 cents for every dollar relative to the earnings of other similar professionals in 2024 – much less than the 93.9 cents earned in 1996.” The average teacher pay penalty in Connecticut in 2024 was -24.3%. Factoring in the more generous fringe benefits that teachers typically enjoy relative to those in other professions does not cancel out the wage penalty; it only lessens it from a wage gap of -26.9% to an overall compensation gap of -17.1%.
Data from the Connecticut State Department of Education reveal that 3,031 new educator certificates were issued in our state in 2022/2023, with another 3,011 issued in 2023/2024 – figures that exceed the annual average of 2,835 for the last eight years overall. Of those newly certified educators, only 2,359 were subsequently employed in 2022/2023, and 2,110 in 2023/2024 – figures on par with the annual average of 2,117 for the last eight years. 
Why have only three-fourths of newly certified educators sought and gained employment under their hard-earned credentials? To answer this question, we must look to the conditions under which – and the compensation at which – educators in Connecticut work, particularly in districts serving large concentrations of students with significant needs. Appreciating these circumstances will also help us better understand the still more pressing problem of attrition among educators in Connecticut.
Thirty-six of Connecticut’s 169 public school districts are considered “Alliance Districts.” Despite serving 44.4% of the state’s public school students, disproportionately large concentrations of whom present with high needs (e.g., family financial insecurity, food insecurity, housing insecurity, social-emotional concerns, learning challenges – all of which require significant resources to address), Alliance Districts account for only 41.7% of per pupil expenditures and 41.3% of the state’s currently practicing public school educators.
The average per pupil expenditure in Connecticut is $22,054. The average in Alliance Districts is $20,714; the average in non-Alliance districts, $23,122. In New Haven, where I live, just making up the $683 difference between the state average and the district’s current expenditure for each of its 18,817 pupils would amount to $12,852,011 in additional resources to materially improve what the district’s educators could do with and for the students and families whom they serve. (In Bridgeport, that figure would be $62,708,904; in Danbury, $59,230,024; in New Britain, $21,611,814; in Waterbury, $33,571,488.)
Gov. Ned Lamont and the Connecticut General Assembly should take two actions to keep teaching a profession worthy of those who choose to enter it and remain in it – and of the students and families whom those educators serve:
1. In the immediate term, these officials should amend the statute under which the Connecticut Educator Preparation and Certification Board was created, extending by at least one year the date on which many of the regulations governing educator preparation and certification will be repealed; expanding the membership of that body to include appropriate representation from the entities  most familiar with and impacted by the existing regulations (i.e., educator preparation providers and school administrators); and codifying a formal role for expert staff members from the Connecticut State Department of Education to play in the work of the CEPCB. 
The writing or revising of regulations pertaining to the schooling of our state’s children and adolescents, and to the preparation and certification of those who engage in that work, is far too important to be rushed; it requires careful thought and extensive consideration.
2. In the medium term, these officials should do all that they can to ensure that school districts’ funding is commensurate with the needs of the children and adolescents whom the educators in those districts serve, so that those professionals have the resources and support that they need to help students thrive academically, socially, and emotionally, and are compensated at rates reflective of the appropriately high standards that they must meet in order to be certified as teachers. 
This will require that the governor and legislators work to increase revenues, and that they revisit the fiscal guardrails that have so often prevented them from doing so, but Connecticut’s children deserve nothing less than elected officials’ full commitment to their success.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-18 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A consumer voice at PURA as an energy reckoning sweeps the nation,Elin Swanson Katz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/18/a-consumer-voice-at-pura-as-an-energy-reckoning-sweeps-the-nation/,"In Connecticut, it’s no secret that the state’s utilities and their regulator have been at loggerheads for years, leaving consumers caught in the middle.","“What’s going on at PURA?”
The Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has been in the news almost daily over the past year. I’m often asked what’s happening at an agency that, until recently, most people had never heard of.


Much of today’s dialogue around energy policy in our country has become disturbingly adversarial. At the federal level, the Trump administration reversed course on nearly every renewable energy initiative, instead doubling down on fossil fuels and even expressing interest in reviving coal as a major energy source.  President Trump has taken particular umbrage with windmills, calling them  “a con job.”
In Connecticut, it’s no secret that the state’s utilities and their regulator have been at loggerheads for years, leaving consumers caught in the middle. Some see the utilities as self-serving and unaccountable, while others argue they can still help build a fairer, more affordable energy future. Without casting aspersions on any of the parties – I generally assume good intent on the part of the people involved – the constant conflict has distracted from what really matters: delivering reliable, affordable service to the people who pay the bills.
You can’t both bully and persuade. Yes, utilities deserve tough scrutiny when they seek rate hikes or cost recovery. But regulation works best when it protects the public interest and encourages cooperation toward shared goals. If we’re serious about confronting the challenges we face, we need a process that puts consumers first and invites every party to the table.
PURA is entering a period of transition just as a national crisis in energy affordability reaches a tipping point.  In New Jersey, for example, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill just won what has been dubbed the “Electricity Election,” pledging to declare a “state of emergency” on day one to curb utility costs.  Gov. Ned Lamont has appointed a strong slate of commissioners who bring renewed attention to consumers and costs, especially PURA’s new chair, Tom Wiehl.
Wiehl’s experience as Legal and Regulatory Director at the Office of Consumer Counsel ensures that compassion for everyday ratepayers will be central to PURA’s decision-making. His appointment reflects a broader regional shift toward consumer-focused leadership at state utility commissions. In Massachusetts, new Department of Public Utilities Commissioner Liz Anderson previously led ratepayer advocacy at the Attorney General’s Office. In New Hampshire, Commissioner Pradip Chattopadhyay also came from the Office of the Consumer Advocate.  And California Commissioner Matthew Baker previously led the Public Advocates Office.  It’s a worthy and growing trend.
Other appointments will expand the agency’s depth.  PURA Vice Chair David Arconti, appointed in August 2024, brings years of legislative experience as co-chair of the Energy & Technology Committee. New Commissioner Janice Beecher, longtime director of Michigan State University’s Institute of Public Utilities and editor of the Utilities Policy journal, literally wrote the book on regulation. New Commissioner Holly Cheeseman, another Energy & Technology alum, and incoming Commissioner Everett Smith, with expertise in finance, renewables, and telecom infrastructure, round out an impressive and diverse bench. It will be worth watching how they apply their individual strengths in shaping PURA’s future.
Meanwhile, consumers are struggling. According to the federal Energy Information Administration, electricity prices have risen faster than inflation since 2022, a trend that is expected to continue through 2026. However, Connecticut residents and businesses don’t need a federal agency to confirm what they already know: energy bills are straining household budgets.

Consumer ire over energy costs feels like it has easy villains.  There is the monopoly company with the poles and wires and the pipelines to deliver energy to your house, and there is the regulator who oversees rates.  In contrast, when the price of bread goes up, who do you blame?  The farmer who grows the wheat, the baker who makes the loaf, the trucker  that drives the product to market, or the grocer that sells the bread?
However, energy costs are just as much a mash-up of costs and inputs as loaves of bread.  Solutions won’t be easy to craft.  There are too many competing demands, particularly on our electric grid, including  overdue investments for upgrading aging infrastructure like ancient utility poles and wires; costs associated with restoring power and “hardening” the grid against increasingly frequent storms and wildfires; clean energy investments needed to ensure cleaner air and water and address climate change;  cybersecurity measures to protect against cyberattacks by foreign agents; low-income rates to assist those least able to pay their bills; and the impact of competition for electricity and water from the growing proliferation of AI data centers, just to name a few.  The list of critical issues is long, but unfortunately, a “let’s do it all” approach is simply unaffordable.
We are facing tough, sometimes painful, decisions about what we must do, should do, and can’t afford not to do. To navigate these choices, regulators must prioritize transparency, explaining how rates are set, why decisions are made, and what tradeoffs are involved. Consumers deserve to understand what’s on their bills and how their dollars are spent. That also means ongoing public education and engagement.
With an experienced consumer advocate like Chairman Wiehl leading the way, I’m hopeful that future PURA actions will be guided by cost-consciousness, candor, and respect for all stakeholders.  If the new PURA commission can rebuild trust and keep ratepayers at the center of every proceeding, it will not only restore confidence in the regulatory process but also set a new standard for integrating the public’s voice and wallet into its decisions.

Workers are currently removing the steel that once carried Interstate 695 over the bridge, and have begun driving test piles that could support a new longer and higher span. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The cost to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge has ballooned to between $4.3 billion and $5.2 billion, more than double original estimates of just under $2 billion, the Maryland Transportation Authority announced Monday evening.
The agency also said the bridge is not likely to open to traffic before late 2030, two years after the original goal of 2028.
The original estimates were made in the weeks after the March 2024 crash of the container ship Dali into the bridge sent it tumbling into the Patapsco River, killing six workers who were on the bridge at the time.
From the beginning, officials planned for a new bridge that was higher, with a wider shipping channel to accommodate new, larger ships in and out of the Port of Baltimore. The MdTA said the new numbers are based on significantly higher material costs and on federal demands for upgraded protection of the piers that will carry the new span across the Patapsco River, to prevent another accident like the one that destroyed the bridge.
As design work on the bridge progressed, “it became clear that material costs for all aspects of the project have increased drastically since the preliminary estimates were prepared less than two weeks after the initial tragedy,” Acting Transportation Secretary Samantha J. Biddle said in the MdTA statement.
Key Bridge rebuild progresses with first piles driven into the Patapsco riverbed

“The updated cost range and schedule are directly correlated to increased material costs and to a robust pier protection system designed to protect the new Key Bridge and reduce the likelihood of a future ship strike to the bridge’s foundational piers,” said Biddle, who also serves as chair of the MdTA.
Within hours of the bridge’s collapse, then-President Joe Biden promised that the federal government would cover 100% of the cost of replacement. That pledge was later codified into law by Congress.
But President Donald Trump (R) has repeatedly hinted that he does not feel bound by that agreement. In an online spat with Gov. Wes Moore (D) in August, whcn Moore slammed Trump’s suggestion that he might send National Guard troops into Baltimore, the president ended a lengthy social media post by saying he “gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision???”
And U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, while pledging that the federal government is committed to working with the state to deliver a new Key Bridge, has pressed the state for updates on costs and the timeline for the reconstruction.
“Congress granted the Secretary of Transportation important authorities to conduct critical oversight to ensure that Federal highway funds are properly managed, and I take this authority seriously,” Duffy said in a September letter to state officials. “It is my role to guarantee that federally funded projects benefit the entire Nation through every dollar spent.”
In that letter, Duffy also warned that the state’s “reliance on race- or sex-conscious factors in contracting decisions” could threaten the project. It was a reference to the state Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which aims to use state contracts to bolster minority- and women-owned businesses.
Kiewit, the contractor overseeing the bridge project, has committed to a goal of using 26% “disadvantaged business enterprises,” including campanies that are at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more minority individuals.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a statement Monday night, Moore said the state will “continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster.” The higher costs and longer timeline are the result of outside factors, “not discretionary state choices,” he said.
“Just as families across the country are dealing with the reality of increased costs, so is Maryland,” Moore’s statement said. “Trade policies out of Washington, D.C., have raised prices on everything — including essential materials we need in order to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.”
Moore and Biddle stressed that the state continues to seek legal damages from the owners of the Dali, and that any awards will be used to offset the costs of construction. The state will be “advancing upfront construction costs and contributing hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance proceeds toward the rebuilding effort,” the MdTA statement said.
When the Key Bridge collapsed, it shut down the shipping channel to the Port of Baltimore for weeks. It also severed a major roadway used by commuters and by long-haul truckers skirting downtown Baltimore. The bridge, which carried Interstate 695 over the Patapsco, linked Dundalk and Baltimore and served more than 30,000 vehicles a day, generating $56 million in tolls a year.
The new bridge will still follow the same route as the old one, and will still carry two lanes in each direction, although the shoulders are expected to be wider.

But the bridge itself will be much higher – 230 feet above the river at its highest point, compared to 185 feet before. The main span of the bridge will be 1,665 feet, compared to the previous piers that were 1,200 feet apart. The higher and wider span is designed to allow for larger cargo ships now serving the port.
MdTA said its latest estimates show that the “towers needed to accommodate both the length and 230-foot height of the bridge deck add a significantly higher cost than initial assumptions.”
In addition to accommodating “today’s larger marine traffic,” the larger size of the replacement bridge is needed “to comply with current guidelines from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials for new bridges.”
Another increased cost are the protective “fenders” that will be build around the towers to prevent a future crash like the one the brought the bridge down last year. Each of the new protective fenders “are larger than a football field,” said the MdTA statement, which said the extent of the “size and cost of the pier protection … was not accounted for in the preliminary estimate” on the bridge project.
Despite the challenges, state officials said they remain committed to replacing the bridge as quickly as possible.
“We remain committed to rebuilding as safely, quickly, and efficiently as possible,” Moore said. “While the timeline has shifted and is not what we initially hoped for, I have full confidence in our team.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08589-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-18 05:56:34.885059

It also moved to cap payments on the first two drugs on the list, Jardiance and Farxiga.","Medication vials marked for calibration await counting at the Exchange Pharmacy at Joint Base Andrews in Clinton, in this July 2023 file photo. (Photo by Staff Sgt. Jared Duhon/U.S. Air Force)The Prescription Drug Affordability Board determined Monday that name-brand drugs Trulicity and Ozempic are likely unaffordable for Marylanders, adding them to two other drugs being considered for price caps by the state.
The board Monday also took steps toward finally approving caps on what the state would pay for those first two prescription drugs, Jardiance and Farxiga. The price caps have been years in the making, and may not be finalized for months yet, but advocates hailed Monday’s actions.
“It’s a major step forward in making high-cost drugs more affordable for state and local governments,” said Vinny DeMarco, a longtime supporter of the board’s effort and president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition. “It’s very important that this happens as soon as possible to start the clock ticking on when they can make high-cost drugs more affordable for everybody.”
The board ordered staff to draw up language to set a limit on how much state and local governments are willing to pay for Farxiga, a brand name for the drug dapagliflozin, and Jardiance, a brand name for empagliflozin, both of which are used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other conditions.
It’s not a done deal yet, and the board would need to officially approve the upper payment limit in a future board meeting. But the decision signals strong interest in implementing upper payment limits, which would be the board’s first official action to bring down drug costs since it was formed by 2019 legislation.
State board determines two Type 2 diabetes drugs may be unaffordable

The PDAB determined in July that Jardiance and Farxiga were too expensive for Marylanders and could be subject to payment limits.
The board’s work comes as health costs are increasing in Maryland and nationally, with state and federal officials looking for ways to rein in rising prescription drug costs.
Under the Biden administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services negotiated with drug makers to lower the costs of expensive prescription drugs for those on Medicare. Those “maximum fair price” negotiations included Farxiga and Jardiance.
The Maryland board will take a cue from those negotiations to help set an upper payment limit for the two drugs purchased on the state’s health insurance plan.
In setting upper payment limits, the board has several metrics that could help set the ceiling on how much the state is willing to spend on the drugs. The board’s staff determined that modeling the upper payment limit on the maximum fair price negotiations will yield the most savings for Maryland.
For Farxiga, the maximum fair price per unit is $5.95, or $178.50 for a 30-day supply. For Jardiance, it’s $6.57 per unit, or $197 for a 30-day supply.
PDAB staff estimates that setting an upper payment limit based on the maximum fair price for Farxiga would save state and local governments an estimated $4.9 million. That estimate does not reflect any rebates or discounts that the state receives for Farxiga, so true savings are not yet clear.
For Jardiance, staff estimates savings could reach $8 million if the state sets an upper payment limit based on maximum fair price. That number, also, does not consider rebates or discounts that the state receives.
But some health advocates fear that upper payment limits will lead to adverse and unintended consequences. Pharmaceutical industry representatioves are also largely against upper payment limits and PDABs in general, arguing that neither is likely to result in lower out-of-pocket costs for everyday Marylanders.


Targeted drugs
Six drugs were selected for “cost review” by the Prescription Drug Affordability Board address several conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, eczema, Crohn’s disease and more.

Dupixent
Farxiga
Jardiance
Ozempic

Trulicity



George Huntley, CEO of Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, asked the board to look at other options in its effort to bring down drug costs.
“Our concern is that UPLs [upper payment limits] will not actually lower the cost for a patient at the pharmacy counter. And our position is we need to lower the cost for the patient at the pharmacy counter and make sure the pharmacy actually stocks the drugs,” he said.
But supporters of the board want swift action, as a new law would allow the board’s authority to expand out to set upper payment limits on the commercial market, not just for state and local purchases. The board will only gain that authority a year after it has successfully implemented upper payment limits on two drugs.
Created by the General Assembly in 2019, the PDAB was slow to launch due in part to a veto from then-Gov. Larry Hogan (R) amid pandemic-induced economic uncertainty in 2020 that delayed the board’s formation.
After Gov. Wes Moore (D) allocated funding for the board’s operation in 2023, the entity went through lengthy rule-making to create the “cost review” process for targeted drugs.
The board finally picked its first six drugs for cost review in May 2024, starting first with Jardiance and Farxiga. On Monday, it added Ozempic and Trulicity for future cost-saving efforts.
Trulicity, the brand name for dulaglutide, is largely used to treat Type 2 diabetes. Ozempic, the brand name for semaglutide, was also developed for Type 2 diabetes, but has recently gained popularity as a weight-loss drug.
Maryland was the first state to create a board for prescription drug cost reduction, with its 2019 legislation, but other states have gotten ahead in the time Maryland’s board was trying to get off the ground.
In October, Colorado’s Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board set the nation’s first upper payment limit on a drug called Enbrel to treat various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)A Davidson County chancellor on Monday temporarily blocked Gov. Bill Lee from continuing to deploy the Tennessee National Guard in Memphis.
Members of the Guard have been patrolling the streets of Memphis since October under a directive from Lee, as part of a task force convened by the Trump administration in September. How many Guard personnel are currently stationed in Memphis is unclear: Memphis Police said last week there were fewer than 200, but that number would soon double. Recent court filings indicated more than 700 are currently in Memphis.
The Memphis Safe Task Force is composed of hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers working in conjunction with local law enforcement. 
The order issued by Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal states that the plaintiffs “have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the Governor’s actions in calling the National Guard into the active service of the state to support the Memphis Safe Task Force violate the terms and conditions of Tennessee’s Military Code.”
“The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and the Militia is not unfettered,” Moskal wrote. “The Tennessee Constitution and the Military Code establish conditions for calling the National Guard into active service and limit the Governor’s power and authority.”
The order comes as Moskal considers a lawsuit seeking to permanently remove the Guard from Memphis. The lawsuit was filed Oct. 17 by Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, Reps. G.A. Hardaway and Gabby Salinas, state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, Shelby County Commissioners Erika Sugarmon and Henri E. Brooks, and Memphis Councilmember J.B. Smiley, Jr.
The injunction blocking the Guard’s deployment will go into effect five days after the plaintiffs post a $50,000 bond, if the defendants, including Lee, do not file an application for permission to appeal within that period. Lawyers representing the state had requested an $8 million bond.
The lawsuit argues that the Tennessee Constitution allows the Guard to be deployed only in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” and “even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
Attorneys representing Lee and the state contend that deploying the Guard falls within the governor’s authority and that the judiciary has no oversight on the executive decision.
Moskal pointed out in her ruling that the governor did not make an official order but issued a press release about the deployment after President Donald Trump signed a memo. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent Lee a letter saying Guard members would be funded to stay in Memphis through September 2026.
Yet the Tennessee legislature never voted to send Guard personnel to Memphis, as required by law, and Shelby County leaders didn’t request the deployment.
“This ruling is a powerful affirmation that no one — not a president, not a governor — is above the law,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward, a nonprofit law firm representing the plaintiffs. “When leaders use military force to intimidate rather than to protect, they threaten both our safety and our democracy. (Monday’s) decision restores the rule of law in Tennessee and sends a clear message that our service members will not be used as political props.”
The Lookout is seeking comment from the Tennessee Attorney General, who represents the state.

Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), in a February photo, said Monday that the decisions made by PJM Interconnection on how it will handle the expected surge in data centers one of the “most consequential decisions of this decade.” (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)A coalition of state lawmakers from around the 13-state PJM Interconnection grid presented their plan Monday for handling the explosion of data center requests in the region and the tremendous demand for power that comes with them.
The lawmakers’ proposal built on a plan put forward by a number of state governors in the region that would provide incentives for data centers to bring their own power generation to the grid, and would extend a cap on a key PJM auction that partially drives consumer prices, among other attempts at reform.
But the legislators’ plan also says that data centers that don’t bring their own power should be the first to have their power cut off in an emergency, not other power customers, if power demand reaches a point where the system is stressed.
The proposals are in response to a call from grid operator PJM for ways that it can “address the reliability and affordability challenges associated with rapid load growth from large new data center development.” Maryland Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), one of the lawmakers on hand Monday, called PJM’s data center decision one of the “most consequential decisions of this decade.”
PJM predicts that peak load on the electric grid will increase by 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030, with data centers accounting for all but 2 gigawatts of that growth. The resulting electric grid expansion would cost billions, further straining consumer’s pocketbooks as they face already high bills.
Exelon wants to build a power plant in Maryland, reversing decades of deregulation policy

In their proposal, the governors of Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia were joined by the Data Center Coalition, which represents data center companies, and by the Exelon and PPL companies, utilities that serve millions of customers across several states in the PJM region. They called for data centers that bring their own power to be given expedited entry into the electric grid.
The legislators’ proposal said those data centers that don’t bring their own power to the grid should be the first ones cut off when the system is overwhelmed.
“When there’s not enough power to go around, it affects data centers and households alike,” said Claire Lang-Ree, a clean-energy advocate at the National Resources Defense Council, which joined the legislators’ filing. “We really need a proposal that grapples with this reality — even though it’s difficult.”
Lang-Ree said cut-offs would be rare, and would likely only occur when the grid is most overburdened, such as during extremely hot or cold weather. But for ratepayers, the protection could be significant.
“In practice, this may only occur less than one-tenth of 1% of the time, but this action will shield the public from blackout risk and save hundreds of billions of dollars,” Lang-Ree said.
The various plans will be presented Wednesday during a meeting of the PJM Special Members Committee, which will rank the options. The final decision rests with PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers, which has pledged to issue a ruling before the end of this year. The board doesn’t have to select any one proposal, but rather could combine elements from several.
Ultimately, any changes to PJM’s procedures will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In a statement Monday, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields called the data center projections a “generational challenge,” adding that the grid operator has received a dozen different proposals for how to deal with the matter.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Data center proliferation is driving the need to further build out our power grid, while also creating a supply/demand imbalance leading to higher market pricing,” Shields wrote. “As grid operator, PJM is acutely aware of the challenges that these costs pose to people and businesses.”
But legislators said PJM can’t ignore that it is partly to blame for the supply and demand problems with its grid.
“We also need to look back clear-eyed, understanding that a big part of how we ended up here is the past failure of the PJM queue, with its six-plus year wait-time, to connect renewable energy to the grid,”said Delaware General Assembly Sen. Stephanie Hansen (D-10th District).
PJM argues that it has worked to diminish the backlog in its queue, and reform approval procedures that come from a time when a smaller number of large power plants needed to connect to the grid, unlike today’s far higher number of smaller projects, including wind, solar and battery storage facilities scattered around the region. PJM has also created a fast-track for dozens of shovel-ready energy projects.
The idea of interrupting power to data centers was also backed by a group of 60 climate and ratepayer advocacy groups from around PJM territory, in a letter to PJM’s voting members. In Maryland, that includes the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and Third Act Maryland.
Those groups said that incentives that encourage data centers to bring power are not enough.
“You must vote for a solution that — at minimum — does not allow large-load users like data centers to have access to the grid during hours of peak demand until they have brought new generation onto the grid to match their energy usage,” the letter said.

The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, which represents Maryland ratepayers, also backed the idea of interruptible, rather than firm, energy service for data centers that do not bring their own power resources to the grid. It called on PJM to “initiate a process to require data centers to pay the regional and local transmission costs that they cause,” costs that are currently paid by the overall customer base through their monthly electric bills.
The People’s Counsel also identified ways to improve forecasting to ensure data center demand isn’t artificially inflated by proposals that aren’t going to break ground, an idea backed by the legislators’ coalition.
PJM’s Independent Market Monitor called on the regional grid operator to be even more strict, and bar data centers from connecting to the grid if they cannot be served reliably by the system. To do that, PJM would have to create a queue for data centers to apply, and evaluate each proposal to ensure the electric grid can handle it.
“It should not be assumed that PJM is required to allow the interconnection of large loads that cannot be served reliably,” read the market monitor filing. “The result of such a path would be an unreliable system that imposes costs on all the other PJM customers.”
Hester on Monday called the legislators’ plan something of a “logical hybrid between the two” proposals — the governors’, which would merely provide incentives, and that of the independent market monitor.
“They [data centers] can join, if they bring their own supply,” Hester said. “And if not, then they agree to the non-firm capacity market.”
The lawmakers highlighted the fact that their coalition includes lawmakers from seven PJM states and Washington, D.C., mostly Democrats but with a small number of GOP representatives, too.
“It’s just not very often the leaders from a broad number of states like this, in a bipartisan manner, come together in a shared fight,” said D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen. “But it really highlights what’s at stake in the millions and millions of people and businesses that will be harmed if things just keep going as they have been.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC_0145-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-17 21:56:32.329199

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)News that TAC Data Centers released its option to lease land in Great Falls drew some support from conservation advocates, but progress on other data centers in the state elicited recent praise as well — for different reasons.
Data center projects are popping up in Montana. Supporters see them as a tool for economic development, but detractors fear they’ll increase bills for residential power customers and will be a drain on water resources.
In an announcement on Friday, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper said TAC Data Centers had pulled out of its option to lease 569 acres in Great Falls, citing the Great Falls Development Alliance.
In a statement, Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said many of Montana’s river basins are already facing shortages and can’t afford water demands from data centers.
“Montana’s future depends on protecting our water from being drained for external markets,” Alsentzer said in the announcement.
TAC Data Centers could not be reached Monday by phone.
However, representatives with a couple of other data center projects in Montana gave updates during the most recent legislative Energy and Technology Interim Committee meeting, specifically about water use, and one project was met with enthusiasm by at least one legislator.
Beowulf Electricity and Data has the Big Horn Data Hub expansion planned in Hardin, and Sabey Data Centers has a proposed project in Butte.
The Beowulf website and its representative describe the Big Horn Data Hub as adjacent to and supplied by the Hardin Generating Station coal plant and operating for bitcoin mining since 2020, although not currently running. It intends to expand.
The Beowulf representative said the company is awaiting information about how the Public Service Commission will handle data center rates with NorthWestern Energy.
He also told legislators the data center is not currently running because some equipment is being decommissioned.
Sabey has an option to buy land for a controversial data center in a business park in Butte, and it has until Feb. 11 to close the deal, although local commissioners would still need to approve it, according to reporting from the Montana Standard and Nonstop Local.
Data centers can use a substantial amount of water for cooling, but at the meeting, company representatives discussed their use of “closed loop” systems — which one said require a one-time fill but then only minimal water.
In a phone call Monday, Sen. Gayle Lammers, R-Hardin, said the Beowulf data operation planned for Big Horn County holds economic development potential for the area.
“It’s just neat to see some hustle and bustle in little Hardin get going,” Lammers said.
Lammers said Big Horn County is among the poorest in Montana, and the data center will have direct benefits with tax revenue and jobs.
But he also said he hopes it will create a ripple effect and spark interest in other industrial lots.
He said it’s important to see economic development in rural communities, and data centers bring the need for materials and places to eat, among other things.
“I just think it could be a real boon to the economy as long as it’s done right,” Lammers said.
At the meeting, in response to a question from Rep. Bob Carter, D-Missoula, Rob Corbin of Sabey said operations typically bring several thousand employees during the construction phase and 400 or 500 people later.
Corbin said other lease holders in the building typically can bring an additional 60% to 80% more employees as well.
The data centers are also controversial because details about them, including deals for energy supply, have not been available to the public.
NorthWestern Energy has announced plans to provide electricity for data centers, but it has not provided information about them, including letters of interest, requested by the Public Service Commission.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities in Montana.
NorthWestern has argued it should be able to provide the information under a protective order — viewable to commissioners but not the public — because some of the data is proprietary.
In a recent filing with the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern also said it won’t serve data center customers before “a specific contract for electric service” with that customer is approved by the commission.
In another filing, Sabey also argues it should be able to keep its letter of intent protected in part because it contains “trade secrets” and it would hurt its ability to compete.
But in letters to the Public Service Commission, a group of energy watchdogs have alleged NorthWestern Energy is moving forward with electricity contracts for data centers in violation of the law — a charge NorthWestern disputes.
The Public Service Commission plans to schedule an information meeting on data centers in December or early 2026, a spokesperson said Monday; it does not yet have a timeframe to discuss the way charges for data centers should be structured.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-17 21:56:32.329199

(Alaska National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Joseph Moon)Alaska legislators with the state Joint Armed Services Committee are raising concerns that a federal directive to prepare the Alaska National Guard to deploy domestically for civil unrest could divert service members from disaster relief efforts. 
In October, the Pentagon ordered all states to prepare the National Guard to be trained for “civil disturbance operations,” according to an internal directive first reported by the Guardian.
A spokesperson said the Alaska National Guard has received the directive to prepare a 350 member “rapid reaction force” by Jan. 1, but said the state’s National Guard has not begun any specific training outside typical readiness training. 
“This mission requirement does not impact our support to ongoing Typhoon Halong response operations, and we continue to meet all state and federal mission requirements,” said Dana Rosso, a public affairs officer for the Alaska National Guard, via email.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, is co-chair of the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee, and a veteran of the Alaska National Guard. He said he’s concerned about the possibility of a quick response force being used to quell “civil unrest” in Alaska and across the country.  
“The fear is, of course, that when you have a tool, an expensive tool, at your disposal, that you’re going to find a reason to use it. And so I think the fear about having this quick response force locked and loaded is that they could be used when it’s inappropriate to use them,” he said. “Peaceful protest would be the perfect example.”
The federal directive said National Guard members should be training in crowd management and riot control, including the use of batons, body shields, Tasers and pepper spray. 
Lawsuits, protests and federal courts have repeatedly challenged and barred the Trump administration deploying National Guard troops to American cities to assist police and immigration enforcement, asserting it is illegal and an abuse of executive powers. 
Additionally, an estimated 200 Alaska service members are now deployed to assist with disaster relief efforts one month after the devastation of Typhoon Halong, officials said. It’s deemed the largest off-the-road system response by the National Guard in the state’s history.

Gray and committee co-chair Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks, sent a letter expressing concerns to Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, Adjutant General of the Alaska National Guard, who is also Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. 
“The broad and vague nature of this mandate raises serious questions about its intent and implications, particularly regarding the potential use of these forces in domestic law enforcement situations,” the letter said, in part. 
Gray published an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News on Monday saying the committee has yet to receive a response from Maj. Gen. Saxe about the Alaska National Guard’s plans.
Gray served for nine years in the Alaska Army National Guard as a medical provider, and deployed to Kosovo in 2019. He commended the agency’s work and unprecedented disaster relief effort. 
“I don’t want to disregard the enormous amount of stress and pressure on them right now for this particular disaster response,” Gray said. “That may very well be a valid reason why they haven’t been able to meet to discuss this issue. But that would be really good and reassuring information for the public.”
Gray said he’s requested a meeting with the leadership of Alaska National Guard for an update, but so far his questions have not been answered. 
“Most importantly,” he said, “under what circumstances does our leadership in Alaska expect to be utilizing this force?”
Leaders with the Alaska National Guard declined repeated interview requests. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office also did not respond to questions about what circumstances would trigger the deployment of the quick response force, whether in Alaska or nationally, or the concerns raised in the legislators’ letter to Commissioner Saxe. 
In an email, Rosso said that preparing a reaction force is not a new mission for the National Guard. “It has existed for two decades as a rapid-response capability designed to assist civil authorities when requested by a governor. Each state’s NGRF (National Guard Reaction Force) is organized as a temporary task force under state control and can respond quickly to protect lives, property, and critical infrastructure,” he wrote.
Rosso said the Alaska National Guard has not begun any specific training, but that some readiness tasks “such as security operations and initial protective equipment training,” are already part of the National Guard’s ongoing training. He said they are conducting an inventory on equipment and weapons listed in the memo, like Tasers, batons and pepper spray.

“Many units already use authorized protective equipment and training devices as part of their annual readiness training. Before making any new equipment purchases, we are assessing what capabilities already exist,” he wrote. 
Rosso said the Alaska National Guard had no further communication from the Pentagon on the mission of the National Guard response force. “We have not received any official taskings for NGRF support or deployment,” he said. 
The Oct. 8 memo signed by Maj. Gen. Ronald Burkett, the director of operations for the Pentagon’s National Guard Bureau, orders all states to prepare National Guard forces, totaling 23,500 troops nationwide, to be ready within a 24 hour notice. The memo cites Trump’s executive order to address the “crime emergency” in Washington D.C., which has come under intense criticism and legal challenges, which has continued as more troops were mobilized to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago. 
Retired Lt. Colonel Daniel Maurer, a veteran active-duty Army officer and former Judge Advocate General, testified on the topic to the Alaska Joint Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. He is now an associate professor of law at Northern Ohio University. 
But Maurer said none of the Trump administration’s justifications for the order are legally accurate, because he says they’re not based on credible, factual evidence. 
The Trump administration has claimed illegal immigration is a national security threat, and troops are needed in U.S. cities for illegal immigration enforcement, as well as to combat protesters accused of being part of “Antifa” or a “domestic terrorist threat.”  
“As a result, the military is being ordered in situations where they lack sufficient training and sensitivity to the constitutional rights and protections of those civilian protesters,” he said. “It puts soldiers in terribly awkward positions where they must act like police, and police fellow Americans on American civil streets.” 
The remarks were part of a broader discussion at the committee hearing on constitutional concerns and politicization of the U.S. Department of Defense policies and actions in 2025. 
The military is prohibited from enforcing civilian law under the Posse Comitatus Act, unless authorized by Congress or by the U.S. Constitution. Only under the Insurrection Act can the president deploy the military to suppress an insurrection. 
Maurer said there is no evidence of such a need. “It is extreme, especially what is predicated on flat out lies. The triggers that these laws are based on aren’t being triggered. They’re just not happening on the ground. Court after court after court have said it’s not,” he said, adding that troops are being used to intimidate protesters.
“There was no problem to fix with the military,” Maurer said. “It is simply an effort to show force — muscular, robust camouflage, armed force — to show protests, because this president does not like protests.”
Gray said he’s also worried about the National Guard intimidating voters around the 2026 midterm elections, including in Alaska. He pointed to Trump’s criticism of recent elections won by Democrats, and a social media post falsely calling California’s elections approving redistricting by mail-in voting “rigged.”  There’s no evidence the National Guard was involved or used to intimidate voters in recent elections this month, and the memo does not call for such use.

Gray said he’s also concerned that the National Guard would assist in immigration enforcement operations in Alaska like it already has in other parts of the country, especially as the Trump administration has revoked protections and legal status for refugees, like Ukrainians fleeing from war. 
“People are afraid to leave their homes. We’ve heard these stories about folks who have to have food brought to them. You know, they won’t even go to the grocery store because they see things happen, like what happened in Fairbanks with the woman literally going to the grocery store and being picked up off the street by ICE,” he said, referring to a Fairbanks woman and mother of six detained by ICE for two months over her immigration status, and recently released. 
Gray said based on his own National Guard experience, he also questions whether 350 Alaska service members will be available for rapid deployment. He said in 2019 Alaska was not able to coordinate the 220 service members called on to deploy to Kosovo, so he said others were recruited from Wyoming. “So I’m curious about how easy it would be to do 350 at a moment’s notice,” he said. “Without having it have an impact on folks, families, jobs, etc.”
But his main concern is for transparency about where, when and why Alaska service members could be called to respond to civil unrest. 
“Again, we need to be able to ask those questions,” Gray said. “We need to find out what our leaders in Alaska’s interpretation of the use of that quick reaction force is. How will it be used here? How will it not be used here?”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina Supreme Court Justice John Few defended his vote to strike down the state’s 2021 abortion law as he tries to keep his job on the state’s highest court.
Few and his three challengers appeared Monday before the Legislature’s judicial screening panel. The public hearing took an unexpected turn when it was House Speaker Jay Lucas’ turn to be questioned by his former colleagues. The 68-year-old former GOP speaker said he wouldn’t have to retire at age 72 — a surprise interpretation of state law that prompted a 15-minute exchange with Senate Judiciary Chairman Luke Rankin, the panel’s vice chairman.
Two other judges are vying to replace Few as he seeks re-election to another 10-year term: Administrative Law Court Chief Judge Ralph King “Tripp” Anderson, who has been on the bench for more than three decades, and S.C. Court of Appeals Judge Blake Hewitt, who was elected to the state’s second-highest court in 2019.
3 challengers to SC Supreme Court justice include former House speaker

It’s the first time in more than 20 years that a sitting South Carolina Supreme Court justice has faced competition to hold onto a seat. The unusual and crowded challenge comes nearly three years after Few joined two other justices in tossing out South Carolina’s 2021 law to ban abortions once an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, considered a six-week ban.
In the 3-2 ruling on Jan. 5, 2023, each of the five justices wrote separate opinions, but Few joined the majority’s conclusion. GOP leaders blasted the ruling, accusing justices of overstepping their authority.
When Statehouse Republicans successfully sought a re-do, they tailored the rewrite specifically to Few’s concerns. When the new version of the law came back before an all-male court later in 2023, it picked up Few’s vote in the 4-1 ruling.
“Without a doubt, the most recent decisions that you have been a majority vote in have created some political consternation for you,” Rankin said.
The Myrtle Beach Republican used a comment submitted anonymously to the screening panel to bring up the ruling. After reading the lawyer’s opinion that Few got it right the first time, before he flipped, Rankin asked Few to respond.
Few noted how unusual it was for him to rule against the Legislature. Since his 2016 election to the state Supreme Court, justices have issued just eight split decisions on a state law’s constitutionality. The 2021 abortion law was the only one he voted to overturn that wasn’t part of a unanimous ruling.
“That actually shows, I think, a great deal of restraint,” Few said.
In his January 2023 opinion, Few cited conflicting language on women’s right to an “informed choice.” He also indicated he might have upheld a ban “despite a complete invasion of a pregnant woman’s right to privacy” if state law had specifically declared that life begins at conception.
“What the Legislature says about its goals and why it’s trying to achieve this goal is important,” Few told the panel Monday.
To flip Few’s vote, Republicans deleted all references to “informed choice” and inserted a finding that “the State of South Carolina has a compelling interest from the outset of a woman’s pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child.”
Few’s term expires July 31, 2026. His election a decade earlier filled the vacancy left when then-Chief Justice Jean Toal retired from full-time work.
Before joining the Supreme Court, Few was chief judge of the state Court of Appeals and a circuit court judge, giving him a total of 25 years on the bench.
Under state law, the 62-year-old justice is eligible to work for another decade, before he reaches the mandatory retirement age for judges. State law requires judges to retire from full-time work by Dec. 31 after turning 72.
Age limits debated

At least, that’s how the law has been widely interpreted.
Lucas, however, presented a different take.
Rankin began his questioning of the former speaker by saying his candidacy “screams politics,” suggesting the age limit could lessen that, since Lucas could be on the bench for only 3 ½ years.
But Lucas said his reading of the law is that the age limit applies only if he chooses to accept a judicial retirement package — and he doesn’t plan to do that.
“I will suggest to you that you are making news irrespective of your candidacy with what you’ve just said,” Rankin responded.
But Lucas doubled-down on his belief that, if elected, he could stay on the Supreme Court for a full 10-year term, despite his being nearly 80 years old by that time.
Staff members for the judicial screening panel previously informed Lucas they disagreed with that opinion. And Rep. Micah Caskey, who chairs the screening panel, cited a 2022 opinion from the attorney general’s office to the contrary.
If the Legislature ended up electing Lucas to the high court, and he insisted on staying, it could be up to the state Supreme Court to ultimately settle the question.
“If I’m wrong, I’m wrong,” Lucas said.
“I think you’re wrong,” Ranking countered.
Of the five vying for the seat, Lucas is the only candidate who’s previously held elected office and has no judicial experience.
The Republican, who works as an attorney in Hartsville, spent 24 years in the state House and nearly eight years as speaker before leaving office in 2022. He then went on to head government relations for the state’s largest hospital system, Prisma Health.
“If your candidacy is successful, it will mean that a sitting justice has not been re-elected, and that you have been elected to the bench without ever having had served as a judge before,” said Caskey, R-West Columbia, inviting his chamber’s former leader to respond.
Lucas said he believes his position as a practicing lawyer, along with his Statehouse experience, actually give him an advantage.
The election by the Legislature is tentatively set for March 4.
This will mark the first election since a law tweaking how legislators pick judges went into effect July 1.
Among the changes are an increase in the number of candidates forwarded to the General Assembly for an election. Instead of limiting the pool to three, the screening panel can send up to six for a vote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0879-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-17 20:57:08.031817
