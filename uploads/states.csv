At a press conference in Jacksonville where he was joined by First Lady Casey DeSantis, State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris, the governor announced four pediatric hospitals were each receiving $7.5 million grants: Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami; John’s Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in Tampa; Wolfsons Children’s Hospital in Jacksonville; and Nemours Children’s Hospital in Orlando.
The grants are possible because the Legislature agreed to include $30 million in the fiscal year 2025-26 budget for what the DeSantis administration calls a “pediatric cancer incubator.”
A cancer survivor, Casey DeSantis stressed the funding is not a one-time opportunity and that it will be available for the next five years.
“That’s a big deal,” Casey DeSantis said.

The five-year, $30 million funding commitment for pediatric cancer research was heavily lobbied by the DeSantis administration which has pushed increases in the amount of money the state was spending on cancer research following First Lady Casey DeSantis’ 2021 cancer diagnosis. She was later declared cancer-free.
The Legislature in 2022 increased funding for what was then known as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Centers Program, created in 2014 to support cancer research at Florida-domiciled NCI facilities: Moffitt Cancer Center; University of Florida Health Cancer Center; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Lawmakers pumped an additional $37 million into the program and renamed it in honor of the First Lady.
The Legislature in 2024 pumped an additional $27.5 million into the program and agreed to remove the requirement the hospital be domiciled in Florida which opened the door for Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center to begin receiving the funds.
The DeSantis administration tried unsuccessfully in 2025 to convince the Legislature to steer some of the the money away from those four facilities and to a larger group of providers, specifically children’s hospitals.
Another legislative tussle in the works over Florida cancer research funding

The administration submitted a long range cancer funding report to the Legislature earlier this year that noted while Florida has the third largest child population in the United States only 2.6% of the cancer research funding in the state went to pediatric research.
While the Legislature did not agree to redistribute the Casey DeSantis Research Funds away from the NCI facilities and to other hospitals and providers legislators did agree to include $30 million for a five-year pediatric cancer research incubator where facilities could apply for grants.
Dr. Mark Toney, Wolfson’s vice president of medical affairs, said the money will go far to help improve pediatric cancer research in the state.
“Although Florida is the nation’s third-largest state for children, we still lack a top 25 pediatric cancer program. Too many families have to travel out of state for specialized treatment and added burden during an already difficult time. That will change. Today’s investment is a critical step forward.”

Federal emergency fund has enough to cover about half the normal benefits.","PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration said Monday that it will partially fund SNAP after two judges issued rulings requiring it to keep the nation’s largest food aid program running.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, had planned to freeze payments starting Nov. 1 because it said it could no longer keep funding it during the federal government shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. It costs more than $8 billion per month nationally. The government says an emergency fund it will use has $4.65 billion — enough to cover about half the normal benefits.
Exhausting the fund potentially sets the stage for a similar situation in December if the shutdown isn’t resolved by then.
It’s not clear exactly how much beneficiaries will receive, nor how quickly they will see value show up on the debit cards they use to buy groceries. November payments have already been delayed for millions of people.
The administration said it would provide details to states on Monday on calculating the per-household partial benefit. The process of loading the SNAP cards, which involves steps by state and federal government agencies and vendors, can take up to two weeks in some states. But the USDA warned in a court filing that it could take weeks or even months for states to make all the system changes to send out reduced benefits. The average monthly benefit is usually about $190 per person.
The USDA said last month that benefits for November wouldn’t be paid due to the federal government shutdown. That set off a scramble by food banks, state governments and the nearly 42 million Americans who receive the aid to find ways to ensure access to groceries.
Most states have boosted aid to food banks, and some are setting up systems to reload benefit cards with state taxpayer dollars. The threat of a delay also spurred lawsuits.
Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled separately but similarly Friday, telling the government that it was required to use one emergency fund to pay for the program, at least in part. They gave the government the option to use additional money to fully fund the program and a deadline of Monday to decide.
Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary Food Nutrition and Consumer Services for USDA, said in a court filing Monday that the department chose not to tap other emergency funds to ensure there’s not a gap in child nutrition programs for the rest of this fiscal year, which runs through September 2026.
Trump said on social media Friday that he does “NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.” He said he was telling government lawyers to prepare SNAP payments as soon as possible.
Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions. Cities and nonprofits also filed a lawsuit.
Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills. The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards.
Rhode Island officials said Monday that under their program, SNAP beneficiaries who also receive benefits from another federal program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, received payments Saturday equal to one-fourth of what they typically get from SNAP. Officials in Delaware are telling recipients that benefits there won’t be available until at least Nov. 7.
To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a household’s net income after certain expenses can’t exceed the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that’s about $32,000 per year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25304719118315-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 13:05:47.080202

Mike Braun called for last week.","Lawmakers will return to the Statehouse Dec. 1-12 to handle redistricting. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers won’t meet to consider new congressional maps and tax code tweaks until the first two weeks of December, legislative leaders announced Monday — ending months of speculation.
They’ll reconvene from Dec. 1-12, rather than hold the special legislative session in November that Gov. Mike Braun called for last week.
Republican leaders indicated cost was a top factor. The state’s most recent special session, in 2022, lasted two weeks and cost taxpayers about $240,000 in per-diem and travel expenses.
“Adjusting the 2026 legislative calendar is what makes the most sense when we consider member schedules, the logistics of legislative action and – most importantly – the costs to the taxpayer,” Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said in a statement.
“Making this shift allows the legislature to consider the topics presented to us in a thoughtful way without burdening Hoosier taxpayers with the cost of a special session,” he continued.
Indiana governor summons lawmakers for redistricting session amid national GOP pressure

House Speaker Todd Huston said the aim is to “avoid any added session-related costs,” adding, “We will continue to look for ways to save taxpayer dollars as we work through and finalize the schedule.”
They could trim days from the back half of the 2026 calendar to even out the costs.
Democratic caucus leaders condemned the move.
“Let’s call this what it is: a mid-decade scheme to rig the maps, and the only reason this is even on the table is because Trump’s losing — and Governor Braun caved,” Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder said. Her caucus, she said, “will be ready with bills to make housing more affordable, lower health care costs, expand child care, and rein in utility hikes — because that’s what the people of Indiana actually need.”
Her counterpart, House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, said his caucus would focus on the “skyrocketing cost of living.”
“From health care premiums and utility bills to child care costs and property taxes, Hoosiers are struggling to stay afloat and need relief. Redrawing political maps won’t solve any of these problems,” GiaQuinta said. “House Democrats will be offering solutions, and I look forward to hearing from Statehouse Republicans about what their plans to make Indiana more affordable look like.”
The Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, composed mostly of House Democrats, rallied Monday against the prospect of redistricting.
Special or not?
Last week, Braun summoned lawmakers into a special legislative session focused on early, mid-cycle redistricting of the state’s congressional districts — and critical tax code updates.
The Statehouse’s GOP supermajorities used 2020 census data to construct the current 7-2 maps in 2021. The lines aren’t due for updates until after the 2030 census.
But Indiana has come under intense pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration for a redraw of the state’s two blue congressional districts red ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Braun also called on the General Assembly to patch “discrepancies” in Indiana’s tax code, stemming from big changes in Trump’s marquee One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
The governor’s order set the session for Monday, Nov. 3. Lawmakers don’t have to convene the exact day that he suggested — and won’t. The only requirements under Indiana law are that a special session can’t last for more than 30 session days or 40 calendar days. That clock begins Nov. 3 and ends Dec. 13.
But the General Assembly will answer the call differently.

Lawmakers won’t meet for a special session, and instead plan to start the regular 2026 session early.
Typically, they convene for Organization Day — the ceremonial start to the regularly scheduled session — on the third Tuesday in November and then return for business in January. This year, they’ll also work the first two weeks of December.
“The meeting days in December would be part of the 2026 regular session that officially starts on Organization Day on Nov. 18,” Huston said. “Because of this calendar alignment, starting the regular session early would be the most cost effective and efficient way to address the Governor’s call for a special session.”
More details on the December session days will be revealed in the “coming weeks,” he said, with a full calendar expected on Organization Day.
Other groups also slammed the news.
“Today’s announcement that lawmakers won’t return until December only underscores what Hoosiers have been saying for weeks: mid-decade redistricting is a distraction no one wants,” Indiana Conservation Voters said. “Governor Braun said this process needed to be wrapped up by late November. Now we know it won’t even get started until December. Our leaders keep kicking the can down the road because they know this idea is woefully unpopular and unnecessary. Let’s scrap it now.”

Dianne is the executive director of My Brother’s […]","​​ON THE SWELTERING Sunday of July 4th weekend, Dianne Hills called ambulances to provide emergency relief to residents suffering from heat exhaustion.
Dianne is the executive director of My Brother’s Table, a soup kitchen and service agency dedicated to assisting residents in Lynn. Through her work, she has witnessed firsthand the climate impacts that burden the residents of her city. Extreme heat has been one of the worst.
“I’ve been a part of a group working on climate change adaptation and resilience, particularly around responding to extreme heat events in our community,” Hills says. “In Lynn, we have many people who are at high risk for heat-related illnesses because of existing conditions. It doesn’t help that our city’s characteristics—dense housing, inadequate shade, heat-absorbing infrastructure, and lack of access to air conditioning—put residents at additional risk.” 
​​​​​Heatwaves kill more people worldwide than any other weather-related event, and cities across the state are particularly vulnerable. High temperatures are harmful even beyond direct exposure: Heat can worsen air quality by trapping pollution in place, and it can exacerbate a range of health conditions, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and mental health issues. 
Temperatures are only getting more extreme, with several of our cities and towns setting new records this year. The Northeast as a region is warming faster than the rest of the country, even as climate impacts are worsening across the board. In the summer of 2023, one flood in Western Massachusetts wreaked havoc on family farms along the Connecticut River and caused $39 million in damage to local roads and bridges. Last year, wildfires across the state burned thousands of acres of parklands, including over 400 acres of Lynn Woods near Dianne Hills’s community.  
​​​Cities and towns are doing what they can with projects like planting trees, opening cooling centers to help combat heat, upgrading critical infrastructure like culverts, and designing parks to capture flooding from stormwater or sea level rise. But these interventions require money, and a lot of it.  
Historically, the federal government has been a significant source of funding for many climate solutions, providing matching dollars to help boost state or local money. In April of this year, Massachusetts lost more than $90 million in federal funding for climate adaptation with the cancellation of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program. Many of these projects would have helped communities prepare for and reduce damage from coastal and river flooding, while other cancelled grants would have helped cities combat extreme heat. Federal grants are also crucial for mitigation, helping us make the needed shift away from fossil fuels – major contributors to the warming climate. 
Massachusetts was awarded $156 million under the Solar for All grant program, another recent victim of federal funding cuts.  
As a result of federal funding cuts and historic underinvestment, Massachusetts has a major funding shortfall in terms of what is needed to protect communities from climate change and reduce carbon pollution. A forthcoming report commissioned by the state will help shed light on a specific number, but the need is massive. 
The governor’s recent Mass Ready Act — an environmental bond bill proposing $2.9 billion in investments over five years — is a major first step toward funding climate solutions, but we need more. Fortunately, we have solutions. 
Three bills in the state Legislature this session would generate long-term, sustainable revenue. Together, they would fund clean energy initiatives, climate resilience projects, and the production and preservation of climate-resilient affordable housing.  
A diverse group of supporters, including housing organizations, environmental nonprofits, community development corporations, faith groups, and more, have come together around this need for climate funding. A briefing at the State House in June brought all of these groups together, united around the common goal of advancing these bills that will help generate revenue for climate action. 
Now is the time to build on this initial momentum and move these bills forward to fill urgent funding gaps. The climate crisis cuts across all sectors, so its solutions must as well.  
One bill would leverage a small fee on real estate property insurance premiums to generate $90 million per year. This money, generated by the Equitable and Sustainable Climate Funding coalition’s legislation (H.938 / S.572), would fund actions to reduce the pollution that drives climate change and address impacts of extreme weather, with a focus on communities that are vulnerable to risks and have experienced repeated impacts. The bill was designed by a broad coalition representing many perspectives that aimed to put resilience front and center.  
A second bill, the AHEAD Act (H.3194/S.1973), would increase the deeds excise fee applied to real estate sales in Massachusetts, generating more than $300 million each year in support of affordable housing and climate investments. Half of this funding would support new housing vouchers and construction or preservation of thousands of new climate-friendly housing units, and provide flexibility to cover emergency assistance needs. The other half would support large-scale climate mitigation and adaptation projects, such as decarbonization of low- and moderate-income housing and protection of coastal communities, where 193,000 properties are at risk of flooding. 
Finally, the Climate Superfund Bill (H.1014/S.588), championed by the Make Polluters Pay coalition, aims to hold the biggest oil and gas companies accountable and require them to pay their fair share to cover the costs of climate-related damages.
Though climate change is largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels, it’s Massachusetts families and businesses that are footing the bill. Shouldn’t the oil companies — that make billions in profits every year — be asked to share the financial burden in dealing with the consequences of fossil fuel use? Similar bills were passed in Vermont and New York last year, with the New York bill potentially generating $75 billion over the next 25 years. Of the revenue generated, 40 percent will go to the communities hit first and hardest by climate disasters, and projects will be required to use strong labor protections. 
​​​​​​​​​While no single bill is a cure-all, together these would give Massachusetts the resources to prepare for extreme weather and reduce future risks. If we fail to act now, the costs — in dollars and in lives — will only grow. 
No one should have to spend summer days calling ambulances for neighbors collapsing from the heat. Communities across the Commonwealth deserve the funding and tools to keep people safe, healthy, and resilient in an overheating world. The Legislature must make that possible — now.

On a dusty, warm day last October, nearly a month after Hurricane Helene tore across the southeastern United States, Donald Trump stood behind a podium in Swannanoa, North Carolina, to pledge funding and support to survivors of the disaster.
“In the wake of this horrible storm, many Americans in this region felt helpless and abandoned, and left behind by their government,” Trump, still a presidential candidate at the time, said. “And yet in North Carolina’s hour of desperation, the American people answer the call much more so than your federal government.”
Trump was present to, among other things, deliver an update on a GoFundMe set up by his presidential campaign for those impacted by Helene. In three short weeks, the drive had raised $7.7 million from the pockets of ordinary Americans, prominent Republican political operatives, and some of the country’s most influential and wealthiest families.
“My prayers and encouragement goes out to all the victims,” one donor commented on the fundraiser’s public wall roughly a year ago. “I hope you know that we all love you.”
It wasn’t until a few days after money had begun to come in that the crowdfunding effort announced where the contributions were going: Mtn2Sea Ministries, Water Mission, Samaritan’s Purse, and the Clinch Foundation. On October 21, an additional recipient, Sweetwater Mission, was added. Four of the five organizations are faith-based Christian charities. Most of them have close ties to Trump or to prominent supporters of his.

Though political candidates have used GoFundMe to cover campaign costs, campaign finance and philanthropy experts told The Associated Press in October that a presidential candidate had never before used the platform in this way.
GoFundMe has become a central artery of immediate relief for disaster survivors. It raised $130 million in the wake of Helene, and hundreds of millions more for other disasters this year alone. But for all the good it does, critics have long lamented its layers of financial opaqueness. As a private platform, GoFundMe is not subject to public records requests. Anyone can set up a fundraiser, and although the site has an accountability team and lets users flag fraud, scams still happen — including those exploiting disaster victims. The platform has exploded in popularity and raised $30 billion since 2010, with significant growth in the last five years. Still, its lack of a more specific annual fundraising breakdown has prompted calls for further data transparency. The nonprofit’s annual report breaks down how much was raised for individuals and nonprofits, total number of donors, and average donation amounts, among other statistics. It also highlights certain large fundraising moments, such as Helene. But it doesn’t break down total donations by category, nor does it discuss how many campaigns hit their targets or delivered on their promises.
GoFundMe isn’t the only crowdfunding platform out there, either.  There’s Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Fundable, Donorbox, and others, though many work better for small businesses and nonprofits; GoFundMe was ranked by one site as the best for personal fundraisers. Other charities and funding organizations support specific populations, like Baby2Baby, which allows donors to give to parents with young infants, or Direct Relief, which provides medical aid.
A year after Helene, what exactly Trump’s GoFundMe campaign paid for remains unclear. Grist reached out to the recipient organizations asking how much they received, and how it was spent. Several responded to an initial email and offered vague explanations, but none except Mtn2Sea Ministries responded to follow-ups for a more specific breakdown of related expenditures.
Mtn2Sea Ministries, based in St. Simon’s Island, Georgia, publicly announced and provided Grist a clear breakdown of its portion of the funds, which it used to buy $25,000 in gift cards for rural communities in Clinch County.
North Carolina-based Samaritan’s Purse received $5.2 million, which its representatives said went toward Helene aid. South Carolina-based Water Mission would not say how much it received, though it has published updates on its website about its work supporting communities after Helene. Sweetwater Mission, located near Atlanta, did not respond at all to the request. The Clinch Foundation is a small community foundation, so small it doesn’t have a website, social media presence, or tax documents that Grist could find online. Their treasurer, Jeff Brown, eventually confirmed to Grist that the small community foundation based in Homerville, Georgia, received $20,000 from the GoFundMe, which went out to the local Emergency Management Association, a hospital, and residents to help with basic rebuilding needs.

Trump has repeatedly used Helene as a political signal over the past year: It is time to overhaul American disaster relief, he has argued, by shrinking the role of the federal government in preparedness and recovery. If that vision comes to pass, GoFundMe and private entities like these evangelical nonprofits may play a larger role in disaster recovery, making the pathways of disaster aid harder than ever to track. Some historians and philanthropy experts warn it also may make such work — while potentially more expansive — less equitable in terms of who receives help.
Some of the recipients appear to have friendly relationships with Trump, Trump’s political supporters, or prominent Republicans. The GoFundMe campaign’s top donor is Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator from Georgia, who joined Women for Trump at a Sweetwater Mission donation event in the wake of Helene. Trump later named Loeffler to lead the Small Business Administration. She did not respond to a request for comment about her $500,000 donation. The board of Water Mission, a clean water charity, is studded with prominent Christian business owners, some of whom are large Republican donors (for instance, a member of the Cathy family, which owns the restaurant chain Chick-Fil-A).
The crowdfunding campaign’s biggest recipient, Samaritan’s Purse, is run by Franklin Graham, son of famed evangelical leader Billy Graham and a strong, if complex, Trump ally. Graham traveled with Trump to survey storm damage in Georgia last September, less than a week after Helene. He then delivered the invocation at Trump’s inauguration ceremony in January, celebrating the election results with the words, “Look what God has done. We praise him and give him glory.” Four days later, he accompanied Trump on another visit to Swannanoa.
Darren Grem is a historian at the University of Mississippi who studies the ties between the political right, the business world, and American evangelism. To him, the relationships underpinning the GoFundMe campaign reflect a deep-seated political ethic that ties conservative evangelical leaders and right-wing politics together when disaster strikes. “The goal is assuaging suffering to save individuals, not fix systems,” Grem said. In the short term, disaster response is quick and expansive, with faith-based organizations fanning across disaster-impacted regions to repair homes, replace cars, and deliver truckloads of donations. In many cases, faith-based disaster relief groups coordinate with local churches, which serve as ready-made response hubs.
Standing in the gap: How nonprofits and volunteers created a community safety net after Helene

Humanitarian disaster aid is key to the missions of the organizations that received the GoFundMe donations — and all contributed to the recovery after Helene. Mtn2Sea’s aid benefited some of Georgia’s hardest-hit communities. Water Mission provided water purification packets and large containers of potable water to recipients like Asheville City Schools and a church in Vilas, North Carolina (neither responded to requests for comment).
“As a Christian nonprofit organization, we believe we are called by God to serve others, and we remain steadfast in this mission, committed to carrying it out with love, excellence, and integrity while maintaining political neutrality,” Water Mission told Grist by email.
Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson Mark Barber said its $5.2 million share went into the $110-million pot the organization spent on Helene. The group, based in Boone, North Carolina, has embedded itself deeply in hurricane response and has by its own count built about 300 homes and distributed 163 campers. It has also replaced over 200 vehicles, provided household items to more than 2,700 people, and again, by its count, saved 173 souls. The organization also said it used the funds to build housing in western North Carolina and East Tennessee.

Grist contacted several Helene survivors who were helped by Samaritan’s Purse, but only one responded. This person declined an interview, noting that while she disagreed with the nonprofit’s conservative values, it was building her a home and she didn’t want to upset anyone.
Grist also reached out to Meredith O’Rourke, who served as the national finance director for Trump’s presidential campaign and who set up the GoFundMe, to ask why it chose these charities. She did not respond. We also contacted the fundraiser’s top donors —  Ultimate Fighting Championship President and CEO Dana White, billionaire real estate investors and Trump megadonors Steve and Andrea Wynn, New York real estate investor and current Trump Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff — to ask if they had heard how the funds were spent, and why they chose to donate to the GoFundMe rather than, or in addition to, tax-deductible charities. None responded.
But the choices aren’t mysterious to experts who’ve studied the ongoing relationship between the far right and evangelical philanthropy. Both favor smaller government and individual giving over tax-based public relief, said Alison Greene, a religious historian at Emory University.
Before the sweeping economic, social, and political reforms of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal, which were created to dig the United States out of the Great Depression, three-quarters of disaster relief went through private charities, most of which were faith-based, she said.
“Private aid organizations were really concerned with separating the deserving poor from the undeserving poor,” said Greene, who is from Helene-impacted Mitchell County, North Carolina. The Great Depression cut so massive a swath of misery that support for federal relief ballooned. Some faith leaders and right-wing politicians opposed that, and continue to. Billy Graham, father of Samaritan’s Purse, was outspokenly among them, as are his descendants.
“Folks like Franklin Graham,” Greene added, “have this narrative that the state destroyed the work of the church.”

Despite Graham’s opposition to state disaster relief funding, his organization has received hundreds of millions of dollars from USAID and the State Department since 2016. The future of this federal funding — about 5% of the organization’s budget — remains uncertain, however, after USAID was more or less dismantled.
Grem, of the University of Mississippi, said the faith-based relief community’s alliance with Republican political actors has continued to advantage all involved.
“Evangelicals perfected the art of that deal long before anyone considered Donald Trump a viable political means or end,” Grem said.
First Amendment protections allow religious groups to sidestep federal oversight. Sometimes, Grem said, that’s a strength. “Such groups can quickly mobilize to provide immediate aid,” he said. Evangelical organizations also appear more culturally familiar to some of the communities they serve, and their speed is appealing to disaster survivors who just want a return to normalcy.
Without external checks and requirements, though, “they may misjudge local needs, duplicate efforts, or overlook or short-hop services,” Grem added. “The very same shortcomings often get criticized in bureaucracies like FEMA.” Long-term planning doesn’t really factor in, Grem added. Unlike the Federal Emergency Management Agency, religious charities’ work focuses on immediate needs and rebuilding houses, not long-term disaster risk and mitigation.
Though FEMA can be picky in disbursing aid, it must abide by federal civil rights law; private charities do not. Samaritan’s Purse and other religious charities have publicly opposed gay marriage and abortion. So have members of the Cathy family, who sit on the boards of many similar charities. It’s led some Helene victims to worry they might face differential treatment or judgment, or avoid seeking aid from such groups. Renters and undocumented immigrants are chronically overlooked by both public and private relief efforts.
To top it off, cash flow can be tricky in ministry groups — and things get more complicated with unusual circumstances like this GoFundMe. Warren Cole Smith, who directs the Christian aid transparency watchdog Ministry Watch, supports evangelical disaster relief but worries about the potential for financial mismanagement a GoFundMe presents.
“There are many ways to evade transparency and accountability,” he said, adding that some groups avoid filing required 990 tax forms by registering as a church even when they don’t operate like one. While Samaritan’s Purse is a disaster relief group that Smith trusts, a linked group, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, is registered as a church. Franklin Graham runs both organizations, which often deploy together into humanitarian missions.
“We think using a GoFundMe campaign in this way is not a good idea,” Smith said. “If President Trump had simply recommended these organizations, that way the organizations themselves would be direct recipients of the money … [and] individual donors could make up their own minds about which campaigns to support.”
GoFundMe, for its part, told Grist that the fundraising campaign was verified by its trust-and-safety team, a process that requires drives to “be clear who the organizer is, as well as the person, business, or charity they are raising funds for, the organizer’s relationship to the recipient of the funds, and how the funds will be used,” the organization said. If the team feels information is missing, they put the fundraiser on hold.
Since then, FEMA, though diminished, continues to make a point of opening grant opportunities to faith-based organizations and knocking down political barriers to religious influence.
The Helene campaign is closed, but some previously scheduled monthly donations continued to roll in as of July, and new donors were contributing in May. It is unclear where this new money is going, given that the last official spending update came 11 months ago. GoFundMe representatives assured Grist that the funds have all been distributed to the listed recipients.
Among the donors with messages of support was western North Carolina resident Stacie Johnson, who gave the GoFundMe $5, begging the campaign to notice her family’s plight — her father had lost his home and had no flood insurance. The same day Trump’s drive launched, on Sept. 30, 2024, she had started a campaign for her father. But while Trump’s GoFundMe coffers grew, Johnson’s fundraiser brought in only an eighth of what her family needed. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
“I am curious when this money will be distributed,” Johnson wrote on the Trump drive’s page. She detailed her father’s situation before adding, “I pray that someone will see fit to help him rebuild very soon. There’s no other way than kind-hearted souls’ donations at this point.”

FoodShare funding from the federal government will stop Nov. 1 if the federal government shutdown continues. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Milwaukee elected leaders gathered outside the county’s Marcia P. Coggs Health and Human Services Building on Friday, providing updates to residents and praising the community’s resilience amidst the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
“Milwaukee County is strong and resilient, but the health and wellbeing of our residents and families should never be casualties of political fights in Washington,” said Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. “Until this federal shutdown ends, we will do what we always do: look out for our neighbors and step up to help in times of need. I’m grateful to our community partners and encourage every resident who is able to join us in caring for our community.”  
Beginning Saturday Nov. 1, people across the state who depend on the Wisconsin FoodShare assistance program will be at risk of losing that aid, due to the discontinuation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as a result of the government shutdown.
A Milwaukee County press release said that over 230,000 local residents will be left without food assistance “with no clear end in sight”. The release also noted that if the shutdown continues into December, then Section 8 housing benefits will also be on the chopping block. This aspect of the shutdown could lead the Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services to not pay federally mandated portions of rent costs, placing a strain on tenants and small-scale landlords. 
“I have been clear as day: no one wins in a shutdown,” said U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin. “Republicans and Donald Trump need to finally come to the table to end this shutdown and lower health care costs for families…Wisconsin families just want to live a comfortable life where they can put food on the table, afford their health care and monthly bills, and not have Washington politics butting into their life. While Wisconsin’s House Republicans are on day 42 of a paid vacation and President Trump is just coming home from another foreign trip, Wisconsinites are going to wake up tomorrow to find their health care premiums are skyrocketing and food assistance is being taken from them. Enough is enough.”
 
Food drive donations are being accepted at locations across the county including:

Milwaukee City Hall (200 E. Wells St)
Milwaukee County Courthouse (901 N. 9th St)
Zeidler Municipal Building (841 N. Broadway)
Marcia P. Coggs Health & Human Services Center (1230 W. Cherry St)
Hillview (1615 S. 22nd Street)
Fiserv Forum (1111 Vel R. Phillips Avenue)
All Milwaukee public schools 
All Milwaukee library branches
The Mason Temple Church (6058 N. 35th St)


Residents can also donate to NourishMKE or Feeding America if they’d like to provide financial assistance to programs. While republicans blame the shutdown on democrats wanting to protect people living in the country without legal documentation, democrats say they’re attempting to preserve Affordable Healthcare Act health insurance subsidies which, if allowed to expire, would lead to inflated health costs for people across the country, including some 310,000 Wisconsinites, many of whom would see their insurance payments rise between 45 and 800%.
“This hunger crisis did not need to happen,” said Congresswoman Gwen Moore in a statement. “The Trump Administration is purposefully withholding $5 billion in contingency funding, so they can inflict maximum pain and hardship on the American people…Unlike what Republicans claim, this won’t only hurt my district, but their constituents throughout Wisconsin, including rural areas. SNAP is a lifeline, not a political weapon.” 
Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he was grateful that neighbors were uniting “so that hunger does not rule the day.” Johnson said, however that, “donations and food drives are a temporary fix. We need resolution to this shutdown so that the federal government can resume the important work we ask of it.”
As the government shutdown continues, federal employees who work in Milwaukee County are also feeling the pressure. Many have been furloughed from their jobs, or are working without pay. At Mitchell International Airport, federal air traffic and security workers are not getting paid, as are Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) workers. The Veteran Affairs Regional Benefits Office in Milwaukee is closed due to furloughed employees.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Produce-cooler-rescaled-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-03 13:05:47.080202

(Alison Miller/MNS)Hamtramck mayor Amer Ghalib, who has been nominated to be the U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait, told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his confirmation hearing last month that he did not support boycotting Israel, including a resolution passed last year by the Hamtramck City Council officially endorsing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. 
But his testimony in the May 2024 city council meeting when that resolution was passed says the opposite — he explicitly expressed his support for it. 
“Thank you again for bringing this resolution, for discussing it, and I fully support it, and we can move and vote on this resolution,” Ghalib says in a video recording of the council meeting. 
The resolution states that the city “officially endorses the Palestinian call for supporting the BDS movement,” and that the city will “refrain from purchasing goods and services” from any company targeted by the BDS movement. It passed unanimously at the time. 
During his Oct. 23 confirmation hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) asked Ghalib, “During your tenure as mayor, the Hamtramck city council passed a resolution supporting the boycott of Israel, divestment from Israel, and sanctions of Israel. Do you support boycotting Israel?”
“I didn’t support it, I didn’t vote for it, it wasn’t my idea,” Ghalib responded. 
He also noted that he only votes on city council measures in the case of a tie, with Hamtramck’s mayor being an honorary position, and as such he did not formally vote on this resolution. 
Cruz pressed Ghalib on the resolution, to which Ghalib responded, “I didn’t put it in place and I don’t support it.”
Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pennsylvania) also mentioned Ghalib’s stance on the BDS movement in his questioning. 
“As a mayor, you repeatedly targeted American ally Israel through your support of the Boycott Divest and Sanctions movement against Israel,” McCormick said, though Ghalib was cut off before he could fully respond to that statement. 
Ghalib faced other lines of questioning from senators on both sides of the aisle throughout the hearing regarding past social media activity and public statements. 
Ghalib did respond to a request for comment by Michigan Advance by the time of publication, although he previously told The Detroit News, he would not withdraw his name.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Carbon credits are a game changing tool for modern forestry in Alaska. They make money from what forests already do: accumulate carbon molecules in wood. They can offer a management strategy for generating revenue in areas where timber harvests could put high-value fish and wildlife habitat at risk. The coastal forests of Southeast Alaska are particularly well suited for selling carbon credits because the cold and wet climate helps protect them from wildfires, giving buyers higher confidence in the durability of the credits. 
Evaluating the benefits of traditional timber harvest compared to carbon credits requires a thoughtful site-specific process, but a wealth of examples illustrate the potential benefits of selling carbon credits in Alaska. For example, in 2016, Sealaska Corporation put approximately 165,000 acres into a forest carbon project. Sealaska in 2020 reported earnings of more than $100 million from its carbon project, or over $600 per acre. The corporation used $10 million of the proceeds to help establish the Seacoast Trust, which supports ongoing local jobs and economic development throughout southeast Alaska.
Carbon prices and demand for carbon credits are continuing to rise. In 2022, the State of Alaska commissioned a report to assess opportunities for generating carbon credits on State land. The study identified 76,900 acres centered on the Haines State Forest as the best opportunity, with projected revenue of more than $103 million, or $1,351 per acre. By comparison, a timber sale advertised on the same lands in 2015 was expected to earn $300 per acre in one-time royalties to the State, or $400 in today’s dollars. These estimates suggest carbon credits could generate more revenue to the State than traditional timber harvest on the Haines State Forest.
What about broader economic impacts? The timber sale was expected to generate an estimated $2,000 per acre statewide economic impact through job creation and value-added processing. The statewide economic impacts of carbon credits, such as the value to tourism, subsistence hunting and commercial and subsistence fishing have not been formally evaluated, but our analysis suggests the economic benefits would be significant. And unlike what can be short-lived benefits associated with traditional timber harvest — because forests can take decades to regrow — the benefits of an intact forest continue to accrue over time. 
The Haines State Forest supports several important commercial and subsistence fisheries, such as the Chilkat Lake sockeye. According to ADF&G reports from 1976-2007, an annual average of about 85,000 fish was commercially harvested in the Chilkat Lake area. Subsistence harvests from 1990-2004 averaged about 6,700 fish annually. This data suggests over 90,000 sockeye salmon are harvested each year. Using an average weight of 5.2 pounds and ex-vessel price of $1.52 per pound, the Chilkat Lake fishery conservatively generates $711,360 a year, not including job creation, value-added processing, or cultural and health benefits. New road development and forest cover loss associated with traditional timber harvest in this high-value watershed could harm the fishery spawning grounds through degraded water quality. 
About 6,835 acres are zoned for timber harvest around Chilkat Lake. Using the highest multiplier value of $2,000 per acre for traditional timber harvest, this would generate approximately $14 million. The State-commissioned report’s range of $12-22 per carbon credit and a forest carbon model published in 2025 suggests the Chilkat Lake watershed could hold in the neighborhood of $16-29 million in carbon credits—revenue that would be generated without jeopardizing other long-term economic values. The carbon credit revenue is a conservative estimate that accounts for a 50% discount given to these types of projects to ensure the carbon savings are additive.  
Forest carbon credits are a powerful alternative to timber harvest for generating revenue in some of the most productive fish and wildlife habitats without negative impacts to habitat and water quality. The numbers presented in this article are coarse and are meant to illustrate some of the considerations and opportunities for balancing traditional timber harvest with carbon credits to maximize economic returns on the State’s resources. 
The State showed foresight with the 2022 study, and in collaboration with locally affected Tribes and communities should pursue strategic use of carbon credits to maximize benefits for all Alaskans.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/14322972272_04c5f58e2e_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 12:03:57.211276

Krista Milkovics, a Real estate lawyer,  appeared on “A Better Discussion,” a webcast hosted by A Better Delaware to Review the School Tax Reassessment Mess
WILMINGTON, Del. (Nov. 3, 2025) — A real estate attorney who has spent months dissecting New Castle County’s troubled property-tax reassessment laid out a blunt “winners and losers” ledger Monday, arguing the process shifted costs onto homeowners and small businesses while sparing large commercial players — and leaving Gov. Matt Meyer politically exposed.
Krista Milkovics, a Delaware lawyer who focuses on real estate, appeared on “A Better Discussion,” a webcast hosted by A Better Delaware and chaired by former Attorney General Jane Brady. Drawing on county data, legislative hearings and a recent Chancery Court ruling, Milkovics said the reassessment and subsequent “split-rate” fix for school taxes delivered partial relief to homeowners but intensified pressure on non-residential owners — costs likely to flow to tenants.
“The burden was shifted… to the homeowners,” Milkovics said, adding that many residents saw school-tax hikes far above the one-time 10% districts can levy in a reassessment year. “That’s why our school tax bills went up 65%, 80%… not just 10%.”
Brady, who has criticized the county’s rollout, called the cascade of delays, misclassifications and last-minute fixes “a problem that should have been anticipated,” noting that Kent and Sussex counties embedded with the vendor and finished appeals before sending bills. “This is all to buy them time to do it right when they should have done that in the first place,” she said.
Winners (for now)
Large commercial and utility property owners.
Milkovics highlighted marquee examples to argue that big operators benefited from valuation decisions. One logistics site, she said, sold for roughly $393 million in 2022 but was assessed at about $108 million in 2024 — a shift that cut its taxes by about $2.5 million before the split-rate adjustment. The split rate may add back “a couple hundred thousand,” she said, still leaving a sizable net gain.
Kent and Sussex counties.
Process discipline paid off, Brady and Milkovics said. Those counties worked closely with the contractor, completed appeals well before billing, and avoided New Castle County’s cash-flow crunch and public backlash.
Tyler Technologies.
Despite criticism, the contractor’s software now underpins the assessment roll and the five-year reassessment cadence. “It looks as though we are stuck with them,” Milkovics said, citing pricing and system dependence, though Brady argued the state should not assume it has no alternatives.
Partial winners
Owner-occupied homeowners.
The new split-rate authority (HB 242) lets school districts charge lower rates to residential property than to non-residential, softening the spike many homeowners saw on July estimates. Relief is “real but incomplete,” Milkovics said, because the underlying burden shifted off large commercial and utility parcels.
Lawmakers who pushed split-rate relief.
They delivered a visible fix that survived a court challenge last week. But it is a one-year patch that concentrates pain elsewhere.
Losers
Tenants and mobile-home residents.
With higher non-residential school rates, landlords are expected to pass through costs. “That’s going to affect the poorest among us,” Brady said.
Mom-and-pop landlords and small non-residential owners.
Thin operating margins leave little room to absorb higher bills. One small business owner on the call cited a five-figure annual increase.
New Castle County government and affected school districts.
Because bills remain delayed, both are short of normal fall receipts and facing higher mailing and processing costs. “They don’t have money. The schools don’t have money either… the bulk have not paid,” Milkovics said.
Finally, Our Students.  What if all this energy and money had instead been spent on improving the reading program in our schools?
Where Meyer stands
Milkovics’ ledger also hints at the political stakes for Meyer. The county-level process problems — late notices, an appeals window that closed before most July bills arrived, and a reliance on the vendor’s black-box modeling — trace back to his tenure as county executive. Now, as governor, he is the most visible official positioned to steady the system or own further slippage.
Bottom line for the governor: a high-risk mixed bag. If he drives a credible fix — corrected classifications with notice and appeal, a firm billing calendar, and a financing bridge for schools — he could convert exposure into a win. If bills slip again or pass-through costs spike for renters and small businesses, the “losers” column grows, and so does the political liability.
What’s next
Lawmakers are expected to convene a special session Thursday, Nov. 6, to consider extending New Castle County’s due date again beyond Nov. 30, after a Chancery Court decision surfaced misclassified parcels that now require notice and an appeal window. Milkovics warned that could push billing into December or January, and possibly create knock-on issues next summer if schedules collide.
Brady urged scrutiny of vendor accountability ahead of the state’s required five-year reassessment cycle. “I don’t feel like we’re stuck with Tyler,” she said. “We should make that decision in advance so that we don’t end up in another boondoggle.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-839296132-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-03 12:03:57.211276

According to a Facebook post Sunday, Cloutier resigned to take a job as the chief of staff in Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry’s office. Her last day as a legislator was Friday.
“This is a bittersweet transition,” Cloutier wrote. “I am super excited to begin this new chapter, and also sad to be leaving a 25-year career at Bates College and to resign from serving as the State Representative for House District 94 in Lewiston, a position I have cherished since stepping foot in the State House seven years ago.”
Cloutier, who chaired the Legislature’s Taxation Committee this session, also worked with Daughtry to sponsor the legislation that created the state’s paid family and medical leave program. 
Since the Legislature is in the middle of its two-year cycle, a special election will be held to fill Cloutier’s seat for the remainder of her term. Cloutier said she is supporting Lewiston City Council member Scott Harriman to fill her seat. Harriman announced his plans to run Friday evening.
“There is no one more qualified, and no one I trust more to fill this opening with integrity, empathy, and a true desire to serve his constituents,” Cloutier said in her post.

(Photo by Evan Popp/Maine Morning Star)Several people who are incarcerated in Maine’s largest prison said they didn’t receive their absentee ballots from corrections staff until Friday, Oct. 31, though the materials arrived at the facility 11 days before that. 
The delay demonstrates the risk of breakdowns in the distribution system that props up the constitutional right.
The Department of the Secretary of State and the Department of Corrections coordinated over the weekend to ensure the ballots from Maine State Prison will be sent back to municipalities via overnight mail on Monday in order to be counted for Tuesday’s election, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows confirmed. 
“But this is something that shouldn’t be happening,” said Foster Bates, president of the Maine State Prison chapter of the NAACP, whose ballot was among those delayed. “Now, we’re looking at the future, as to if this is going to be something that’s going to persist.”
Maine is one of two states where people retain the right to vote in prison. But, as Maine Morning Star reported, the ability of incarcerated Mainers to exercise that right is largely dependent on voluntary work — the goodwill of government officials, some whose jobs are not supposed to be administering elections, and civil rights groups willing to assist. 
The recent incident puts a finer point on that finding. 
Incarcerated Mainers’ voting access is already challenged, but could become even harder

Staff gave Bates his ballot on Friday, Oct. 31, but it was postmarked as having been received by the facility on Oct. 20, after being sent on Oct. 16 from the town hall in South Portland, where he is registered to vote. Voting in Maine is done on the municipal level, so incarcerated people are registered at their last address and vote via absentee ballot. 
Based on conversations with other residents, Bates estimates this was the case for at least 30 people, some of whom also confirmed the delay to Maine Morning Star.
According to Maine Department of Corrections policy, incoming mail “shall be distributed to residents within 48 hours of its delivery.” That excludes weekends, holidays and government shutdown days. The federal government has now surpassed a monthlong shutdown. That 48-hour window can also vary depending on other factors, such as if a critical incident or emergency situation prevents timely mail distribution. 
The Maine Department of Corrections did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Bates and other incarcerated residents whose ballots were delayed commended the department’s quick response to address the issue but called for a thorough investigation to figure out where the breakdown occurred and prevent it from happening again. 
Another person in Maine State Prison whose ballot was delayed, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from prison staff, said he developed a strong sense of civic duty only after he was incarcerated at 18 years old because of the organizing of the NAACP prison chapter. He worries this incident could undermine some of that work for others.
“It is really hard to get people to believe that our voices matter, that our votes count and that it’s worth participating in any type of voting process,” he said. “So my top of mind concern is that this is one more reason that in the years to come people will point to and be like, ‘Well, what’s the point?’”
Bellows said changes made to the U.S. Postal Service in recent years make the continued collaboration between her office and the Department of Corrections all the more pressing. 
“The Department of Corrections and the Secretary of State’s office — we have a very strong partnership,” Bellows said. “Unfortunately, preventing this from happening in the future is going to depend on the goodwill of those departments because changes have undermined the reliability of on-time mail-in voting.”
The federal government, under President Donald Trump ally Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, made several cost-cutting changes to the U.S. Postal Service that resulted in slowed mail delivery. Given those changes, Bellows said, “The challenge to on-time absentee voting is going to only increase.”
Maine Rep. Nina Azella Milliken (D-Blue Hill), who raised the issue with the Secretary of State’s office after Bates contacted her on Friday, said she intends to question the Department of Corrections and will be encouraging others on the Legislature’s Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee to do the same to get to the bottom of what happened. 
“They have a constitutional right to vote so to deny them that, or to get in the way of that at all, is a huge constitutional rights violation,” Milliken said. 
The Department of Corrections needs more funding, as evidenced by budget hearings earlier this year, and Milliken highlighted that overnighting these ballots to municipalities is an added cost. 
“Even if it’s not a ton of money, it’s money that doesn’t need to be spent,” Milliken said. “There’s some other fix here. I hope there’s some kind of investigation or internal review to ensure that whatever happened this year doesn’t ever happen again.”

Josh Stein said Monday.
Providers will be able to apply to the program to help fund repairs or reconstruction projects that connect residents, businesses and community institutions.
“We are working hard to rebuild western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, and that includes making sure folks have access to high-speed internet services,” Stein said in a statement. “With these investments, western North Carolinians can stay connected and more easily get back on their feet – whether seeking resources, applying for a job online, starting a business, or going to school.”
The grant program uses federal dollars sent to the state through the American Rescue Plan Act. It was formally created as part of an August spending bill.
Immediately after Helene, almost the entirety of western North Carolina was knocked offline. The largest providers struggled to get service back for weeks, and large swaths of the region (and state) remain offline or with limited connection.
Providers seeking to apply for grant funding must do so by Nov. 24.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/broadband-parking-lot.jpg,,,2025-11-03 12:03:57.211276

""Life is cancer and cancer is life” (Suzanne King/The Beacon).Every year, the University of Kansas Cancer Center must file a report with the National Cancer Institute in order to get its annual grant allotment.

This year that typically routine report, known in research jargon as a noncompeting renewal, was repeatedly rewritten. Triggering words targeted by the Trump administration had to be eliminated before a $2.8 million allocation was finally funneled to the cancer center in mid-September, two months later than expected.
“We literally spent days and days and days rereading that report, searching for these banned words and coming up with new language,” said Dr. Roy Jensen, director of the cancer center. “We’re not going to misrepresent (the work) we did or stop talking about it. … But we’re trying to describe what we did and not use words that are now verboten.”
The experience is not unusual. Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, scientific research and the grants that fund it have been under a microscope.
The administration has terminated or frozen thousands of grants without warning. It has moved  to drastically limit what research institutions can spend on facilities and support staff, which could devastate university budgets. It has also proposed slashing future funding to the National Science Foundation (NSF) by 56% and cutting funding to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which includes the National Cancer Institute, by nearly 40%.
“NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health,” the administration wrote in its budget proposal. And the NSF proposed budget, it said, “cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science.”
But top scientists warn that the new priorities mean that rather than unraveling mysteries about devastating diseases and looking for cures, scientists are spending time trying to claw back lost funding, stop future losses and, like the cancer center’s experience, parse words in grant applications to avoid upsetting the bureaucrats in charge.
“This is not productive,” Jensen said during a recent interview in his office on the KU Medical Center campus in Kansas City.
“Most people in my shoes have always operated under the assumption that the people of the United States and the United States government believed that supporting biomedical research and trying to find cures for all of these god-awful, terrible diseases was an important part of this country’s makeup,” he said. “That idea is now being tested.”
 Terminated and frozen grants

According to Grant Witness, a scientist-run project tracking the fate of research grants, 5,464 NIH grants and 1,978 NSF grants have been terminated since Trump returned to office. Of those, 2,860 NIH grants and 617 NSF grants may have been reinstated.
But financial losses are adding up nonetheless. Grant Witness calculates that grants listed as terminated or frozen across both agencies had almost $3 billion in funds committed by the government but not yet spent.
It has tracked 65 NIH or NSF grants in Missouri and Kansas that have been terminated. Of those, five have been reinstated. That amounts to lost grant funding of $30.5 million in Missouri and $7.66 million in Kansas.
In some cases, the Trump administration froze funding for entire institutions, including Harvard University. But scientists across the country — regardless of where they work — have been affected.
In a July report, The Center for American Progress found that the Trump administration had plans to eliminate 4,000 grants — in addition to those terminated or frozen — at more than 600 institutions. The grants, worth some $6.9 billion, were spread across every state.
Grants that fund research on topics the administration finds objectionable, such as gender, race or climate change, have been cut. Others that only appear to be related to one of the banned topics have been caught up in the disruption, too.
Meanwhile, major staffing reductions at the federal grant-making agencies have slowed the flow of money.
As a result, universities and research institutions don’t know what funding to rely on. Some are preemptively cutting staff or reducing the number of graduate students they are admitting. And looming over all of the uncertainty is the ongoing federal government shutdown, and the threat of additional budget cuts to research agencies once Congress finally passes a spending plan.
“It’s an incredibly muddled situation and an enormously disruptive one,” said Noam Ross, a computational researcher who co-founded Grant Witness. “There are a lot of projects that have a very ambiguous state at the moment.”
 Uncertainty across academia

Like many institutions, the KU Cancer Center received word earlier this year about grants that would be terminated. The center counts on the federal government for about half of its $80 million annual budget.
Those notices caused research delays and stress among researchers.
“For the first few months of this administration, it wasn’t quite clear how all of this was going to shake out,” Jensen said. “People were still kind of dumbfounded by a lot of the things that were happening.”
Grant terminations were being sent and later rescinded, like a $2 million NIH grant awarded to Jannette Berkley-Patton, a University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine professor. The grant, which had $688,000 in remaining funds, supports a project attempting to increase COVID-19 testing and treatment by partnering with African American churches.
Other grants were being canceled altogether, like a $1.4 million NIH grant to the University of Missouri-Columbia that funded research into the effect of e-cigarette policies on youth tobacco use. The three-year grant was canceled after one year, with about $600,000 unspent.
Michael Pesko, the professor who oversees the graduate student who won the grant, said his lab scraped together money for the student to continue the research for one more year. After that, he said, the student will have to find another funding source.
“Somewhat paradoxically, maybe from the perspective of the people canceling the grant,” Pesko said, “the work he was doing supported government deregulation and supported that e-cigarettes are overregulated.”
And, as with the cancer center’s grant renewal, many organizations and researchers are experiencing delays in funding. Pesko said the annual allotment for one of his primary grants didn’t come through until four months after the new funding year started.
“It’s obviously really stressful,” he said. “It’s hard to spend money that you don’t know is there or not.”
In addition to existing grants being canceled or delayed, fewer new federal research grants are moving through the pipeline, which experts said will have long-term consequences.
Grant reviews known as study sections — a critical step required before funds are awarded — have at times ground to a halt under the new administration. And other grants that have already been reviewed and rated remain languishing and unfunded.
That’s the case for a grant application submitted by Joan Lewis-Wambi, associate professor of cancer biology at the KU Cancer Center. Lewis-Wambi is studying triple negative breast cancer in African American women, and wants to investigate if a protein more prolific in that population is related to the disease.
Her grant received top marks when it went through the grant review process, which means it is considered research funding that should be prioritized. But the grant is still waiting to be funded.
Any other year, the money would be in place and research would be well underway, Jensen said. The reason for the current delay is unclear. But Jensen can’t help but wonder if it’s been flagged because of the population involved in the research.
“Is that research allowed?” he said. “Unclear.”
 A talent drain

Ultimately the gaps in the grant pipeline will impede progress in treating a host of diseases and answering other scientific questions, said Dr. Elena Fuentes-Afflick, chief scientific officer with the American Association of Medical Colleges.
“We know that it is damaging,” she said, “because that means that good ideas are not being reviewed for funding. … It slows everything down.”
Anywhere near a 40% reduction in NIH funding, as Trump’s budget proposal suggests, would do lasting damage, said Dr. Ronald Chen, a radiology oncologist who works at the University of Kansas but spoke in his capacity as an individual researcher.
“It will definitely impact bringing new treatments to patients,” he said. “It will impact patient survival. It will impact cure rates for patients in the future.”
Chen is leading a national trial of a drug to treat Stage 4 prostate cancer. It will enroll 600 patients across the country and has funding from the National Cancer Institute.
“If this trial were positive,” Chen said, “it will change the standard of care for Stage 4 prostate cancer.”
But if NIH funding were drastically cut, he’s not sure how much the trial would accomplish.
Chen also worries about what federal funding cuts will mean to his students and young researchers, like his son, a senior in high school, who dreams of being an academic researcher.
Scientists just starting out and students looking for a career may see new restrictions and funding reductions as reasons to pursue a different career. Already, many are looking for positions overseas.
Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado, president and chief scientific officer with Kansas City’s Stowers Institute, echoed that concern.
“The broader impact goes well beyond budgets,” he said in an email response to questions. “Scientists, particularly early-career researchers, are feeling the pressure. … There’s a palpable risk of talent drain, with young scientists increasingly exploring opportunities abroad in search of stable support and creative freedom.”

New funding priorities could also reduce the amount of basic research being done, which risks missing out on game-changing breakthroughs. Basic research simply explores, without the goal of creating a treatment or advancing an existing theory. And it can lead to unexpected discoveries and breakthroughs, Sánchez Alvarado said.
But that research will be severely limited if government funding doesn’t support it.
“When early-career scientists feel compelled to adjust their research to survive funding cycles, creative exploration is discouraged,” he said. “The risk is that researchers invest their energy in predictable, incremental projects rather than bold explorations with the potential for game-changing results.”
That’s what happened when scientists undertook work investigating the immune system. Cellular therapeutics, which help the body’s own cells fight cancer, is a recent advance in treatment of certain cancers. Now the therapy, being studied closely at the KU Cancer Center, is treating cancers that would have been deadly before it came along.
“As it turns out,” Jensen said, “that fundamental research has been critical to many of the exciting developments in cancer treatment, particularly over the last 10 years.”
 ‘She didn’t have a chance in hell’

Jensen is well aware of the progress that’s been made understanding and treating cancer over the span of his career.
He will never forget a young patient he saw in 1983, his third year of medical school.
In the late summer, she had a melanoma on her arm that was concerning, but not life threatening. By spring, the aggressive skin cancer had spread throughout her body.
“She didn’t have a chance in hell,” Jensen said.
The prognosis could have been quite different had that patient needed treatment today. Four decades of biomedical research have brought about treatments — and cures — for what used to be some of the most deadly cancer diagnoses.
“I’ve seen patients just like her literally be rescued from the jaws of death and go on to do just fine,” Jensen said. “But back then, she didn’t have any hope whatsoever.”
For Jensen, the memory is a poignant illustration of why the Trump administration’s plans to slash the federal government’s investment in scientific research is a threat to that progress.
“Yes, (taxpayers) have invested significant resources in what we do,” Jensen said. “But we have brought the receipts. And the receipts are, since 1991, cancer mortality has dropped by a third. That’s incredibly impressive. That’s historic. It’s stunning how much improvement there has been.”
Jensen came to KU in 2004, eight years before the university’s cancer center finally gained status as a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center and 18 years before it gained the institute’s comprehensive designation.
Fred Logan, a retired Johnson County lawyer who has been a key supporter of the cancer center from its earliest days, said he doesn’t think people understand what’s at stake when federal dollars are taken away from research institutions.
“Cancer research that’s been done in this country has been so incredibly successful,” he said, “the thought just hadn’t occurred to me that there would be a proposal to cut funding to the National Cancer Institute.”
In the early days of KU’s quest to gain NCI designation, Logan led a campaign to pass a one-eighth-cent county sales tax to help fund the cancer center. That Johnson County Education Research Triangle tax brings in more than $15 million annually that is split between the cancer center, the KU Edwards Campus and Kansas State University’s Johnson County campus.
It passed overwhelmingly in 2008, at the depth of the Great Recession, in large part, Logan believes, because voters wanted to have better cancer care at home.
Too many people had watched loved ones board planes to travel to far-away cancer centers when they got sick. They wanted the Kansas City area to have closer access to clinical trials and cutting-edge treatments.
Perhaps for similar reasons, the cancer center has attracted $467 million in philanthropic support for its research since 2004.
Logan, who recently traveled to Washington, D.C., to ask lawmakers not to cut federal research dollars in the next budget, said he thinks people still support the investment.
“I think voters would be astonished if they fully comprehended the magnitude of the cuts that have been proposed,” Logan said.
Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, who sits on the Senate appropriations committee, said in a statement he remains committed to maintaining “robust federal investments in cancer research.” That means fully funding NIH, he said.
“Because of the dedicated work of KU Cancer Center’s leadership, scientists, doctors and researchers,” Moran’s statement said, “each day we are closer to new treatments, and one day, the cure to cancer.”
In May, the University of Kansas and the KU Health System broke ground on the cancer center’s new $450 million home. The 675,000-square-foot complex, tucked behind the northwest corner of State Line Road and 39th Street, will put all of the research done at the cancer center and the cancer care offered through the health system in one location.
The new facility has been funded so far through federal and state support and private donations, including a $10 million grant from the Bloch Family Foundation and Linda Lyon, and a $100 million gift from the Sunderland Foundation.

In some ways its opening at the end of 2027 will be a manifestation of the progress the cancer center has seen since Jensen first arrived two decades ago. He plans to retire once the new campus is complete.
Jensen is hopeful that Congress will block the Trump administration’s threatened cuts. He believes the worst scenario, a 40% cut, would destroy the future of cancer research and he thinks it will be avoided. But he’s not naive about what has already been lost.
In addition to the billions of grant funding lost, the political intrusion in scientific research will leave a lasting stain, he said.
“They’ve inserted political appointees into the NIH to oversee the work product of study sections to ensure that the grants that scored the highest align with the political priority,” Jensen said. “That’s been done before in some very scary circumstances.
“It’s called fascism.”

He says Congress will be better served with a return to bipartisanship. (Photo by Jill Hummels for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Former U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts fondly recalls personal relationships with U.S. Rep. Kika de la Garza and U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow that moved beyond party labels to shape bipartisan agriculture and food legislation.
Roberts said during an October interview at the U.S. Capitol that the get-the-work-done approach he admired, which brought a stalwart Republican like himself together with dedicated Democrats such as De La Garza and Stabenow, should serve as a salve for partisan wounds inflicted by political champions of division.
Raw partisanship placing Republicans and Democrats in uncompromising conflict has been a feature of the latest government shutdown.
“Somehow we’ve got to get control of this ideology,” Roberts said during an interview for the Kansas Oral History Project. “If you’re talking to somebody who’s an ideologist, they’re going to be right, and you’re wrong, regardless. You just can’t really talk to them, and we have far too much of that. We’re getting to the point of almost a meltdown in what the Senate used to be and the House used to be. That’s a real concern to me. That’s very sad.”
“The first thing you’ve got to learn in politics is to listen, and the second thing is there’s no ‘I’ in politics. It’s a ‘we’ thing,” he said.
Roberts said quality people were exiting Congress because they tired of clashes that inhibited the functioning of government. Some replacements didn’t have benefit of guidance from old-guard lawmakers who understood the value of collaboration, he said.
“I would hope that we could get back to a more bipartisan situation where you got things done,” Roberts said.
He was interviewed for the Kansas Oral History Project by Jackie Cottrell, who was chief of staff to Roberts for 18 years while he was in the Senate, and Mike Seyfert, who was Roberts’ staff director on the Senate Agriculture Committee.
 
‘Always want to listen’
Roberts, the first person to chair both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate agriculture committees, represented the 1st District of Kansas for eight terms in the U.S. House, from 1981 to 1997. When GOP U.S. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum declined to seek reelection in 1996, Roberts was elected to her seat. He served in the U.S. Senate from 1997 to 2021.
The interviewers asked Roberts about his dedication to regular listening tours that involved visits to every county in the Big First of western Kansas while he was a U.S. representative and subsequently each of the state’s 105 counties while serving as a U.S. senator.
In response, Roberts remembered advice given to him by Frank Carlson, who was elected to the Kansas House, became Kansas governor and then served in U.S. House and U.S. Senate.
“First thing you learn, Sen. Carlson told me, ‘You never get hurt by what you don’t say.’ He said, ‘You always want to listen.’ And, that’s what we did,” Roberts said.
Roberts said he was routine for him to stop in the county seat and run into acquaintances. He encountered critics who “would always show up and give me a hard time,” but that came with the job. It helped to hold onto a sense of humor at the public gatherings, he said, even when his views were at odds with recommendations from Kansas.
Roberts was born in Topeka, grew up in Holton, graduated from Kansas State University and served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He worked as a journalist but eventually followed a political career path, first as a congressional staffer and then as an elected official.
 
Ike, Dole connections
His father, Wesley Roberts, was deeply involved with Kansas GOP politics and served as chairman of the Republican National Committee.
While still a teenager, due to his father’s role in the Republican Party, Roberts met Dwight Eisenhower, the war hero who was elected president in 1952.
“Obviously, I was very familiar with politics. Perhaps that gave me the impetus to keep going with it,” Roberts said.
In the interview, Roberts looked back on the difficult process of completing the Eisenhower Memorial on Independence Avenue in Washington, D.C. He was chair of the memorial commission for the final six years. There was a protracted family dispute over the design. The monument features an open-air plaza with statues of Eisenhower as president, general and a child. The backdrop is a steel tapestry depicting the Normandy cliffs in France.
“I am sad that it took so long because we lost a lot of World War II veterans, and they couldn’t come up after looking at the World War II Memorial, which Bob Dole did, and then come up and salute their commander. That was my hope,” he said.
Roberts said he remembered speaking with Dole, the GOP’s unsuccessful nominee for president in 1996 and a retired US. Senator, twice a week when Dole was in his 90s. Dole was a disabled veteran from World War II and died in 2021 at age 98. Roberts recalled an especially poignant conversation with Dole.
“It’s fair for elderly men to say this, but all of a sudden he said, ‘Pat, there’s one thing I want you to understand.’ I said, ‘What’s that, Bob?’ He said, ‘I love you.’ And I said, ‘I love you, too, Bob.’ I teared up the whole day. He was a great man.”
 
The hard parts
Roberts said that in his first campaign for the U.S. House in 1980 he told Kansas voters he would not support a federal tax increase. President Ronald Reagan, however, reached an agreement with Democrats to cut $3 in federal spending for every $1 of federal taxes increased. The Reagan administration pressed Roberts to vote for the agreement.
In a White House meeting, Roberts told Reagan of his campaign promise. He also said some elderly people, including his mother, were concerned about a banking provision in the legislation. He recalled that other Republicans in the meeting looked at Roberts as if he was a leper.
“The president says, ‘Well, Pat, you’re following your convictions and I understand that, but I hope we can change your mind,'” Roberts said. “I arrived back to the office and the staff says, ‘Congressman, you’re invited to go to the White House with your mother at 10:00 in the morning.’ So, I had to call my mom. She (Ruth) says, ‘What kind of trouble have you got me into?'”
Reagan put on a charm offensive despite Ruth Roberts’ confession that she wasn’t an early supporter of Reagan. She had favored George H.W. Bush in the presidential primary. Roberts left the White House that day after affirming to the president he wouldn’t vote for the tax increase.
The White House had former U.S. Rep. Keith Sebelius, who was Roberts’ predecessor, call from a hospital bed to urge Roberts to back Reagan on the bill. In the end, Roberts relented.
In 2003, Roberts served as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. His role was significant because the United States launched an invasion of Iraq in March 2003 based, in part, on a premise Iraq President Saddam Hussein was in control of weapons of mass destruction.
He said leadership at the Department of Defense and CIA were convinced Hussein had WMDs, but the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in a 2004 report that pre-war assessments were unsupported by evidence. The committee’s bipartisan conclusion undercut assertions made by President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to justify war with Iraq.
“That was probably the toughest responsibility that I had was to go to the White House and tell President Bush and Vice President Cheney, ‘Do not endorse your national intelligence estimate. It is flawed. Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.’ That was a tough deal,” Roberts said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pat-Roberts-state-fair-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-11-03 11:04:09.549418

The new map, which redraws U.S. House lines to grant the GOP a greater advantage in the northeastern 1st Congressional District, is already under active litigation. The NC NAACP, Common Cause of NC and two groups of voters have asked federal judges in two separate cases to consider the new district lines as part of ongoing lawsuits.
Their filing Friday asks the federal court to issue a halt on the new map. Candidates can begin filing for office for the 2026 cycle on Dec. 1; the deadline is Dec. 19.
“In light of these upcoming deadlines, and in order to promote clarity and minimize confusion, [we] hereby request the court issue a preliminary injunction enjoining any election from being conducted under the district lines set forth in [the new map],” attorneys for the groups wrote in Friday’s filing.
They also requested that if a block on the map comes after Dec. 19, that the court “modify the candidate filing period.”
Lawyers for Republican leaders in the General Assembly have said they will allow the ongoing suits to be updated with new district lines, and will “defend them on their merits.”
The new GOP-led map flips control of the 1st district, a swing seat currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis. It came in the midst of a mid-decade redistricting spree across the U.S., as President Donald Trump aims to keep Republican control in the House. It would likely result in one additional Republican seat, bringing the state’s representation to 11 Republican seats and three Democratic seats.

(Photo by Daniel O'Connor; graphic by Stephanie McFeeters.)As far as Kelly Smith is aware, there are no transgender athletes competing on sports teams in the Augusta school district. She’s running for the school board to help keep it that way.

This story was originally published by The Maine Monitor, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization. To get regular coverage from The Monitor, sign up for a free Monitor newsletter here.

	On Tuesday, Smith will face incumbent Rita Pello for an at-large seat on the Augusta Board of Education in a race that will determine the direction of the capital city’s school policies. The district’s meetings have been roiled by debate over whether to allow transgender students on sports teams and in bathrooms that match their gender identities, with activists repeatedly protesting the current board’s reluctance to limit protections for transgender students.
Smith’s candidacy was shaped in part by her contact with Parents’ Rights in Education (PRIE) Maine, the Topsham-based chapter of a national nonprofit that helps train and advise school board candidates across the state.
The parents’ rights organization is part of a loose web of overlapping conservative groups pushing to restrict transgender student rights on a statewide and district-by-district basis. Along with the Maine Education Initiative (MEI), a project run by firebrand former Rep. Heidi Sampson (R-Alfred), the group has urged parents across Maine to turn out to their local school board meetings and push for policy changes they see as necessary to protect female students.
So far this year, at least eight school districts have changed their policies regarding transgender students. Activists connected to PRIE and MEI were involved in each decision.
Parents’ Rights in Education offers training for those looking to advocate for greater parental oversight of school policy, with occasional meetings encouraging parents to run for office, and training sessions aimed at helping candidates win their campaigns. It has hosted over a dozen events in Maine in the past year.
The group also scores candidates and elected officials on a 0-100 scale based on questions about trans rights, drag queens and book bans.
Allen Sarvinas, the director of Maine’s PRIE chapter, said he was not certain how many school board members or candidates had attended their meetings this year.
PRIE’s website lists four current candidates in Maine, including Smith, as having taken the group’s policy quiz. Each has a score of 100. Ten current or recent school board members across the state also have published scores on the site, as do several state lawmakers, though the website includes a disclaimer that it does not verify respondents’ identities.
Sarvinas said the group is struggling to keep up with demand.
PRIE’s mission is to train school board candidates on how to win elections and train parents and grandparents on how to speak up for their beliefs at local meetings. Meanwhile, MEI, an offshoot of the conservative think tank, Maine Policy Institute, directs them on how to pass conservative policy on trans rights. In some districts that approved policy changes this year, boards passed resolutions that match the language of a sample policy created by MEI.



Under Maine’s Human Rights Act, schools cannot discriminate against students based on their gender identities. When President Trump returned to the White House this January, one of his first major actions was a push to restrict trans student rights.
His administration released an executive order asserting that Title IX, the landmark law barring sex discrimination, meant transgender girls could not play sports alongside cisgender ones. Citing Maine’s protections for trans students, the administration moved to withhold funds. While the dispute between federal and state law is worked out by the courts, law firms like Drummond Woodsum, which works with many school districts in Maine, have advised against changing policies.
Sarvinas said he believes Drummond Woodsum and other law firms in the state are biased toward the left. PRIE and MEI have pushed districts to seek second legal opinions, or to disregard legal counsel entirely.
At an August training, Sarvinas claimed credit for “flipping” boards in RSU 73 and RSU 24, both of which recently passed anti-trans resolutions.
“Candidates reach out to us,” he told The Maine Monitor in a recent interview. “I personally help them figure out their campaign and how it was going to do and certain things to help.”
Sampson said she advises Maine Girl Dads, a social group led by MSAD 60 school board member Josh Tabor, who has a PRIE score of 100. That group is pushing for a referendum on transgender student rights to land on Maine ballots in 2026. Sampson said that even as she campaigns for a statewide referendum, the school-by-school strategy championed by MEI and PRIE will continue.
Maine towns to weigh in on minimum wage, child care, and public education battles

On a Wednesday evening at the end of summer, around two dozen people streamed into Moss Brook Church in South Paris for a training event hosted by PRIE and MEI. A few were parents of young students; most were grandparents.
In the church’s foyer, concerned citizens grazed on hors d’oeuvres and picked through promotional leaflets from PRIE, Maine Girl Dads and the campaign of Robert Wessels, who is running for the Republican nomination in the race for governor.
After signing in, the crowd was ushered into a windowless meeting room with high ceilings and bright overhead lights. There, Sampson told the group that the key was to act fast and to allow any opposition to burn itself out.
“You have to be super focused because the other side’s going to be like [these] screeching hyenas at you. And they get like that,” she said. “And our side, our allies, need to stay calm, cool, and collected.”
Sampson said the time to push for anti-trans policy in school boards had come. This summer, the state’s Human Rights Commission indicated it had no plans to act against school boards changing their policies. Sampson called that a “green light.”
“We’re on a full court press here, trying to apply the pressure,” she said at the August event. “We are in a really critical time right now… We need to continue to push this forward.”
In October, Augusta’s school board voted 6-2 to revisit its transgender student policies only “if and when” the issue is settled in the courts. If elected, Kelly Smith will join those hoping to revisit the matter sooner.
“It feels like it’s such a priority, because so many people in our community are worried about this issue,” she said. “They’re worried about protecting their spaces and sports for our girls.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The owner of an Anchorage business destroyed during a building fire in March has filed suit against Denali Disposal, owned by Republican gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson, and two other businesses that also used the destroyed building. 
The lawsuit, by auto repair firm 2nd II None LLC, accuses all three defendants of negligence that contributed to the fire and seeks a judgment worth more than $100,000. The exact value is to be proven at trial. 
According to a report by the Anchorage Fire Department, the fire — which destroyed a building owned by Restaurants Northwest, one of the defendants — was aggravated by several factors, including the fact that the building’s sprinkler system had been turned off. 
Seventy-five firefighters, plus ambulance crews and police, responded to the fire, but their work was hampered by a water main break that reduced water pressure to the point that they couldn’t extinguish the blaze before it destroyed the building.
Total losses were estimated at $8 million, the report states.
The case was filed in Anchorage Superior Court on Oct. 23 and has been preliminarily assigned to Judge David Nesbett. 
2nd II None is being represented by attorney William Earnhart, who declined comment on the case when reached by phone. State business records show 2nd II None as being owned by Darien Carter. 
The lawsuit alleges “the fire started in a location under the exclusive control of Denali Disposal” and that “a structure fire ordinarily does not occur absent negligence.”
Wilson, reached by phone, declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing the need to avoid affecting legal proceedings.
The claim that the fire started in Denali Disposal’s rented section of the building does not match the fire department’s report, which states that officials were “unable to determine the exact origin and cause of the fire” but that “the fire originated inside the south half … of the structure.”
The building, at 501 West Potter Drive in Anchorage, was owned by Restaurants Northwest, which is one of the three defendants. State business records list former Anchorage Assemblyman and state Representative Larry Baker as the firm’s owner. Baker did not return a message left at his listed cellphone number.
According to the fire department’s report, the building’s sprinkler system had been disconnected for repairs in fall 2024 after a sprinkler head broke in a part of the building being used by Living Waters Plumbing and Mechanical, the third defendant in the lawsuit.
During a post-fire inspection, investigators found the sprinkler system was still switched to the off position.
State business records list Tim Thomas as Living Waters’ owner. He did not return an email seeking comment. 
The legal complaint filed by 2nd II None states that “Living Waters and/or Restaurants Northwest knew or should have known the water valve was closed … having the water valve closed for no reason was negligent.”
Further proceedings in the case have not yet been scheduled.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC02105-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 09:16:32.356322

Hundreds of Santa Cruz County families scrambling for child care arrangements are serving as a warning for what may come as the ongoing federal government shutdown puts more Head Start centers at risk for closure.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, Encompass Community Services closed all its 11 Head Start centers last week because no staff at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was available to process the nonprofit’s Nov. 1 grant renewal or send money. The centers serve some of the lowest-income families in the Watsonville farmland region and enroll about 300 students.
Though Encompass is partnering with Pajaro Valley Unified School District in Watsonville to temporarily provide child care to families enrolled in Head Start this week, the future of the $9-million-a-year program remains uncertain.
Three more Head Start programs in Los Angeles, the Central Valley and the northern part of California also have Nov. 1 grant deadlines and face imminent closure — likely affecting a total of 1,000 very-low-income children and 270 teachers. Four programs with Dec. 1 deadlines could also close if the shutdown continues. 

Melanee Cottrill, executive director of Head Start California: “Losing a Head Start program has detrimental effects not just on children and families, but also has immense ripple effects on the community. Head Start is far more than a safe place for children to learn and grow — it’s a community hub. … The negative effect on regional employment and the local economy would be felt many times over.”

If Congress reaches an agreement to end the shutdown this week, it could still take up to six weeks for the money to reach Head Start centers. Encompass is currently in talks with state and local agencies for a contingency funding plan.

Kim Morrison, interim executive director of Encompass: “We’re trying to roll with the punches and just focus on serving our families. Head Start is a big, national program. We just can’t imagine a world where it doesn’t exist.”

Should every CA prisoner have their own cell?

As California leaders move to curb prison overcrowding, some state lawmakers and prison officials are pushing for single-person cells that they argue could help prison residents and the public stay safe, writes CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.
California’s 31 prisons are operating at about 120% of their collective design capacity. But the state’s incarcerated population is declining, and four prisons have closed so far under Newsom, with one more closure in the works.
These efforts are rekindling conversations about single-occupancy cells, which can help reduce stress, anxiety and the rate of physical harm among prisoners. San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, for example, is working toward making single-person cells available to all incarcerated people by spring 2026, according to a center spokesperson.
California legislators also considered a bill this session to establish single-occupancy cell pilot programs at four state prisons. Some prison abolitionists groups and incarcerated individuals opposed the bill, however, arguing that providing more single-cell units interferes with the broader goal of closing as many prisons as possible. The measure stalled in the Legislature, but it’s expected to be reintroduced next year.

(File/Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)South Carolina’s Department of Juvenile Justice has added 81 beds in five months for jailed youth who are awaiting trial in the state’s family court system. The agency is working to add 24 more as it continues its struggle with overcrowding, understaffing and the violence that comes with it.
DJJ Director Eden Hendrick says the changes are working.
“Violence has gone down,” she recently told the SC Daily Gazette. “The kids have much more educational time, much more recreational time.”
However, she did not have the data to illustrate those improvements. While DJJ tracks violence at its long-term lockup for sentenced youth, Hendrick said, the agency doesn’t collect that information at detention centers, which are supposed to be for short stays.
The additional space comes from a combination of moves made this past June. First, the agency contracted with a private operator to reopen a youth detention center in Greenville that closed in 2022. DJJ also has rearranged where it holds youth in Columbia, extending capacity to 104.
Before the changes, DJJ’s Columbia detention center regularly housed 120 children as young as 11 in a facility meant for 72, pulling out temporary beds to give the youth a place to sleep.
When renovations to the existing Columbia facilities are complete, the total capacity will rise to 176 between the Greenville and Columbia facilities. It’s unclear when they’ll be finished.

For now, the Columbia center remains beyond capacity.
Even with the removal of about 30 teens to Greenville, the numbers in Columbia have not changed as more children pour in to those vacated spaces, Hendrick said.
Daily population at the Columbia center has averaged 125 youth over the past three months, she said.
Meanwhile, civil rights groups and advocates for children with disabilities are attempting to revive a federal lawsuit to ensure the agency indeed makes changes and meets the rights and needs of jailed youth.
“It very much seems like DJJ wants to have exclusive control over the narrative so they can say things are improving but without ever releasing any data through which the public can test those claims,” said Allen Chaney, who is part of the court challenge as legal director of the South Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Detention grows
When Hendrick took the agency’s helm in fall 2021, understaffing was her biggest problem. There were more vacancies than officers actually working. Her predecessor resigned after months of criticism and employee protests about unsafe conditions, including two dozen workers walking off the job at DJJ’s Broad River Road facility in Columbia.
Overcrowding at the detention center became an escalating problem in 2022, as the average monthly population increased from 91 in January 2022 to 126 by that November.
The number of juveniles held in Columbia soared as closed courtrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic created a backlog of cases, then Greenville County closed its juvenile jail due to understaffing in March 2022, Hendrick said.
Youth also spend more time in detention, which can last anywhere from 24 hours to three years, Hendrick said. The average is about 20 days.
Overcrowding only worsened when Richland County, this summer, closed the juvenile wing of its detention center in the adult side of the jail, which is under investigation by the federal Department of Justice over deaths, claims of understaffing and filthy living conditions.
SC DJJ warns of overcrowding as Richland County looks to close juvenile jail

This left Charleston County as the only county in the state to detain its own youth. The rest rely on the state to do it for them.
The ACLU argues there’s still no excuse for the poor conditions that have persisted for years.
“If South Carolina is going to insist upon arresting and incarcerating this many kids, they have to pay whatever is required to provide those kids with constitutionally compliant facilities,” Chaney said. “If they don’t want to spend the money, then arrest fewer children. You can’t over arrest and then under provide.”
Greenville facility reopened
Despite continued challenges in Columbia, the Greenville arrangement appears to be working well in these early days, Hendrick said.
The contractor the state is paying to operate the facility, RaeKar Residential, has taken in more than 75 youth since June, the company told the Gazette in a statement. About 60% of those children had been staying in the Columbia facility before the state moved them to Greenville to house them closer to family and relieve overcrowding.
Bill requires SC counties pay more to jail teens at DJJ. It could lead to fewer arrests.

The remainder are Upstate youth who police arrested and detained after the initial move.
The Greenville center is now fully staffed, according to the company’s statement.
RaeKar Residential also partners with Greenville County schools, which teaches classes at the center in an effort to keep the students from falling behind at school while they’re jailed. There is a licensed mental health therapist onsite and multiple group therapy sessions weekly.
Hendrick said the smaller population size at the Greenville center, compared to Columbia, is one of the major benefits of the arrangement, in addition to keeping the teens closer to home.
“Any more individualized attention youth can get is always better,” she said. “It’s a smaller facility, so they have opportunities to do different things.”
But the arrangement is also expensive, Hendrick said, costing about $400 per day per child.
“We want to do it because it’s good for those kids, but it’s probably not the most efficient way to do business,” she said.
Still, if it works, Hendrick said she’s not opposed to trying it in other counties.
“We’ll just have to see how it goes,” she said. “I think it’s too early to see.”
A rearrangement
SC children should no longer be locked up for skipping class, acting up, lawmakers say

Hendrick said while the Greenville facility is helpful, what has made a bigger impact are the changes in Columbia.
Next door to DJJ’s Columbia detention center stands a building the agency previously used to house juveniles who had either pleaded guilty or been convicted and were awaiting a judge-ordered evaluation before their sentencing.
Hendrick said the agency has since moved those children to the building where the agency previously housed youth with long-term sentences.
That facility was the target of a 2017 U.S. Department of Justice investigation into violence, riots and use of isolation.
In February 2020, the Justice Department found DJJ had failed to protect children at the facility from harm and used prolonged isolation to punish youth. Two years later, DJJ settled with federal prosecutors, agreed to make operational changes and opened up the facility to monitoring.
Hendrick said the agency has since made improvements, including more security cameras and fencing, to the campus that now holds about 70 youth during the 45 days they may spend waiting for evaluations.
With the evaluation building empty, DJJ began using those beds for detained youth.
“Now we have a lot more room to spread out,” Hendrick said. “We have double the classroom size. We have a gym. We have all of these extra things that were not part of detention before.”
Still, Hendrick admits, the buildings are not ideal and pose their own challenges. They weren’t built for how the agency is using them.
“These kids in detention are charged with everything from runaway to murder,” she said. “We are bringing kids from all over the state — they’re coming off the street — and putting them together in a facility.”

Hendrick said DJJ tries to separate those charged with violent offenses. But when it comes to the girls in particular, there is only one room, increasing chances of youth-on-youth violence.
“Our facilities are not designed for juvenile justice in 2025, so we are just making do with what we can,” she said.
Staffing also remains an issue, Hendrick said, and due to the buildings’ layouts, she doesn’t expect the agency will ever reach the recommended staff-to-youth ratios.
Legal challenges
The South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, Disability Rights South Carolina and Justice 360, with legal aid from the ACLU, want guaranteed improvements. They’re asking federal appeals judges to reinstate a lawsuit the groups filed in April 2022.
The suit, which came within weeks of the DOJ settlement, alleged children were being harmed in DJJ’s other facilities, not just the long-term facility covered by the settlement.
The lawsuit claimed several children, who went unnamed for privacy reasons, endured violent attacks while housed in the DJJ’s detention center and evaluation centers around the state. The suit also alleged educational instruction was nearly non-existent.
Those claims include a 14-year-old with a serious mental illness, who was repeatedly attacked at three different DJJ facilities. One time, the teen was beaten with a “lock in a sock,” requiring staples in his head to seal a wound, according to court filings.
In March 2023, a 16-year-old was stabbed and cut with a shank. During the attack at the Columbia detention center, two staff members locked themselves in another room and waited for security officers to arrive, which took about 30 minutes. After the teen recovered, staff attempted to place him back in the same room with his attackers until his family intervened, according to court filings.

And in February 2023, other youth jumped a child in the middle of the night while he slept on a temporary bed at the Columbia detention center. They assaulted him for 10 minutes before staff arrived, suffering a concussion and fractures to his arm and ribs. After returning to the center from the hospital, staff put him back in the same room with his attackers who assaulted him again, the court filings read.
The lawsuit has drug out in court and those youth were released from detention. DJJ then successfully argued to have the suit dismissed in December 2024, which the organizations have appealed.
Since the dismissal, Chaney said the groups have no way of knowing if things have changed at DJJ but suggested the agency is likely still falling short of what’s required under federal law, based on reports from disability advocates.
“If that’s your defense, that’s fine. Put on evidence; show that things don’t violate the Constitution anymore. I welcome that. I hope that that’s true,” Chaney said. “But that’s never been a part of how they’re defending this case.”
The federal appeals judges heard arguments in the case last month but have yet to rule.
DJJ’s school district aims to give SC youth offenders more opportunities, officials say

What’s next?
With state legislators scheduled to return to the Statehouse in January for the next legislative session, DJJ is preparing to continue its push for a number of measures Hendrick said could help reduce the juvenile detention population.
There’s a bill that would partially walk back South Carolina’s so-called “Raise the Age” law for 16-year-olds accused of violent offenses that carry a possible 30-year sentence and 17-year-olds accused of gun crimes. Instead of starting in the juvenile court system, as the 2019 law required, those youth would go straight to being charged as adults.
House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, announced this week a committee to study what he called a rise in violent crime among juveniles.
Hendrick said DJJ also supports legislative efforts that do away with any jail time for what are known as status offenses, such as skipping school or running away from home. The agency would like to see that expanded to all misdemeanors that carry sentences of 30 days or less, such as disorderly conduct and minor theft and property damage crimes.
“Detention should only be for public safety issues,” Hendrick said. “Is a fight at school really a public safety issue?”
The agency would also like the authority to charge counties more for detaining youth on the county’s behalf. State law sets those charges at $50 per day. A temporary rule in the current budget raised that to $125 for the first 25 days. Hendrick would like to see that amount raised or extended and made permanent law.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_8410-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-03 09:16:32.356322

Gavin Newsom’s team is taking nothing for granted as Election Day arrives.","In summary
While lopsided polling and fundraising have given the Yes on 50 campaign an undeniable advantage, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s team is taking nothing for granted as Election Day arrives. 


A day before voting ends for Proposition 50, California voters appear poised to approve Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts in Democrats’ favor. 
Recent opinion polls show strong support for the Yes side. Newsom’s campaign is flooding the airwaves with star-studded advertisements and drowning out its opponents’ faint final pitch to voters. And the governor has even asked supporters to back off on donations, as the influx of contributions was crashing the state’s campaign finance website.
“You can stop donating now. Thank you,” proclaimed the subject line of an email from Newsom’s campaign to supporters last week. “We have hit our budget goals and raised what we need in order to pass Proposition 50.”
If approved, the measure would temporarily suspend California’s current congressional maps, which were drawn by an independent citizens commission, and replace them through 2030 with districts drawn by Democratic insiders. 
Newsom and his allies say California must counter mid-decade gerrymandering efforts in Republican controlled states such as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina in order to give Democrats a fair chance to win back the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections. Mail-in voting has already been underway for more than four weeks. 
Some of Prop. 50’s major opponents are also privately resigned to the reality that the measure will pass, despite putting on a defiant game face. 
“I don’t run away from a fight,” insisted Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican from Oroville whose district would be dramatically altered under the new maps, at a recent No on 50 press conference.
But just moments before, LaMalfa also conceded that the opposition was “outnumbered two-to-one” when it came to spending in the crucial final days of the campaign.
“We are outgunned on the fundraising side,” he said.
A spokesperson for the No on 50 campaign did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Two of California’s most reputable nonpartisan pollsters last week found that a solid majority of likely voters are supporting, or have already voted for, Prop. 50. 
The Public Policy Institute of California found that 56% of likely voters said they would support the measure, compared to just 43% who said they would oppose it. The survey also found that nearly seven in 10 Californians, regardless of party, said the outcome of the special election was “very important” to them. That’s a record high level of interest in a ballot measure.

“The PPIC survey has not registered such a high level of interest in a ballot proposition since we began measuring it over 20 years ago,” said its survey director, Mark Baldassare. The poll relied on responses from 943 likely voters and had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.
The Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found an even larger gap between Yes and No voters, with a whopping 60% of likely voters saying they’d vote to pass Prop. 50 and just 38% who would vote no. Similarly to PPIC, the IGS poll also found an extraordinarily high level of engagement, with 71% of likely voters saying they had heard “a great deal” about the measure.
“There are a lot of indicators that suggest the Yes side is going to win comfortably,” said Mark DiCamillo, IGS’ director of polling, in an interview. 
The poll interviewed 4,946 Californians who had already voted or were considered likely to vote and had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 2 percentage points. 
DiCamillo noted Prop. 50 was likely defying conventional wisdom on ballot measures, which gives the No side an advantage with undecided voters who want to preserve the status quo, because of the hyperpartisan and nationalized message. 
“The results suggest that Democrats have succeeded in framing the debate surrounding the proposition around support or opposition to President Trump and national Republicans, rather than about voters’ more general preference for nonpartisan redistricting,” said Eric Schickler, co-director of IGS.

UC Berkeley officials won’t divulge security plans but say they are prepared to host the conservative organization Turning Point USA on Nov. 10 after its founder Charlie Kirk was assassinated nearly two months ago at Utah Valley University.


Two months after conservative advocate Charlie Kirk’s assassination during a tour stop at a Utah university, his organization, Turning Point USA, will conclude its “American Comeback Tour” at UC Berkeley on Nov. 10 with heightened security.
Turning Point USA is a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote conservative values on high school and college campuses. It was co-founded by Kirk and his late mentor, Bill Montgomery, in 2012.
The Berkeley stop will be Turning Point USA’s first event at a California college campus since Kirk was fatally shot on Sept. 10. Kirk’s killing has intensified concerns about political violence and renewed debate over how universities balance security and free speech.
The issue has become personal for John Paul Leon, junior and president of Berkeley’s Turning Point USA chapter, which was established in 2019. He began preparing for Kirk’s anticipated visit months before his death.
“(We’ve) been wanting Charlie for a long time,” Leon said. “I’ve been planning this since… June… It’s been a lot of work, but it’s definitely worth it.” 
Leon knew Kirk personally; he had met the conservative activist several times and even had breakfast with him at a Student Action Summit in Tampa Bay, Florida, over the summer, where they talked about “Esptein, Israel and dating.”
He described the day Kirk was killed as “possibly the craziest day of my college experience.” The Berkeley chapter had planned to announce Kirk’s visit to campus that night. 
“As I was spreading the word, I got sent the video of the shooting,” Leon said. “My first reaction was ‘that has to be AI, no way,’… it was just completely tragic to see.”
Leon and his club still gathered that night, but instead of the celebration he had expected to have hours earlier, they held a “last-minute” vigil where conservative leaders spoke in Kirk’s honor.
Since that day, the Berkeley Turning Point USA chapter’s membership has grown significantly, according to Leon. Prior meetings hovered around 30 people, but over 100 attended the vigil. This semester’s smallest meeting had 60 attendees, Leon said.
‘American Comeback Tour’ returns to the road
After a brief pause, the tour has since made nine stops at college campuses across the country, featuring Vice President JD Vance, former Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson, 2024 Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and other prominent conservatives.
The Berkeley event will feature comedian and actor Rob Schneider and Christian apologist speaker Frank Turek at Zellerbach Hall. Both Turek and Schneider were friends of the late conservative activist, with Turek being a longtime mentor to Kirk and present when he was assassinated.
Dan Mogulof, a UC Berkeley spokesperson, said, as of Oct. 14, the Berkeley chapter expected 300 attendees, though the hall has a capacity of nearly 2,000. The chapter has not responded to requests for the number of people registered for the event.

Other campus tour stops have had enhanced security measures. At Virginia Tech on Sept. 24, attendees were required to show identification, were not allowed to bring bags, and had to pass through metal detectors to access the event. The University of Oklahoma Turning Point USA president told the student newspaper, OU Daily, that their chapter paid for increased campus police presence at its Oct. 16 event. The tour has so far occurred without any incidents and with a record turnout.
In a letter sent to all UC chancellors on Sept. 23, UC President James B. Milliken addressed Kirk’s assassination and directed all campuses to “take immediate steps to review existing procedures for hosting events.” He further advised that all campuses consider indoor venue locations, bag checks and ticket scanning, among other precautionary measures, to reduce safety risks for event speakers and attendees. 
“The murder of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University was a reminder that we must always remain vigilant,” Milliken said in the letter. “Universities are places where civil discussion and debate can and should occur, without the fear or threat of harm.”
Mogulof declined to provide any details on how UC Berkeley plans to secure the Nov. 10 event. Mogulof said the university will be following protocols set by the major events policy, which dictates that the University of California Police Department must make security recommendations on a case-by-case basis.
Leon, who helped coordinate Berkeley’s event, said bags will not be allowed into the event, there will be a list of prohibited items and security will be stationed both inside and outside. He declined to provide further details, citing security concerns. He also would not say whether the chapter is pitching in for any costs for additional security. 
According to the major events policy, event organizers are required to reimburse the costs of event security provided by UC Berkeley’s campus police department.
In an email statement, Capt. Sabrina Reich said that the campus police department could not share specific security details, but said that it conducts safety assessments for major events “using best practices and in coordination with campus partners.” She added that UCPD will “take whatever measures are deemed necessary to have a safe and successful event.”
Berkeley law professor Jonathan Simon advised that the university should speak with potential counter-protestors prior to the event to be prepared. 
“You need to be in dialogue well before the protests happen with the groups that are likely to be involved in it,” Simon said. “They’ve got to take responsibility for how they’re going to be organized and the university can support, can encourage, can make the police available to them to do advanced planning if they’re going to be doing a march or things of that nature.” 
Initially, the Turning Point USA visit was supposed to include two events, one in the morning where Kirk would debate students outside in his typical “Prove Me Wrong” format and an evening program with Turek and Schneider. The debate was canceled after Kirk’s death and the program was moved indoors for security reasons, Leon said.
Campus students and faculty have mixed reactions
UC Berkeley is a stronghold for progressive student activism and was the home of the Free Speech Movement in the 1960s. Kirk himself described his campus visits as open forums for debate. Leon credited him as being an advocate for “free expression and exchange of dialogue.”
“(Kirk) said that we need to continue the conversations, because when we stop talking, that’s when violence happens,” Leon said. “I’m going to make sure I’m always a person who’s willing to have a conversation, so that way we would never have the need for violence.” 
On a recent day on UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza, a central site for sit-ins and rallies on campus, students noted a rise in conservative voices since Kirk’s death, primarily on social media, where peers have been more outspoken in posting their views.

Miguel Muñiz, president of the Berkeley College Republicans, said his club members have been more willing to “be public with what they think.”  
“I’ve seen a lot of people that are moving to the right because they’re going back and they’re actually watching this stuff that Charlie did,” Muñiz said. “I originally was very pessimistic, but now, looking at the movement that has started, it’s made me really look forward to what might be able to rise from the ashes.”
Sophomore Jackie Campion said she thinks Turning Point USA is an “unhealthy” ideology for young people, but because of the university’s commitment to free speech, the group has a right to say what they want on campus. She added that she believes open communication is the only way to change minds. 
Other critics deride Kirk’s hardline, controversial stances on social issues. Kirk was often overtly racist and misogynistic, also speaking out against the LGBTQ+ community and migrants. He was frequently quoted as being concerned about “the great replacement theory” and saying women should submit to their husbands, according to an article from The Guardian. 
“You heard that he was, like, this wonderful, like, Johnny Appleseed character that was coming to campuses and talking to students who had apparently never been talked to by people about difficult issues,” law professor Simon said. “If you actually read about the kind of things he said, he was hardly somebody who sort of tried to build a big tent of any kind. He was extremely rejecting of whole groups of people.”
At the University of Minnesota, which hosted the first event after Kirk’s assassination, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported that several professors moved classes online. Some cited Turning Point USA’s “professor watchlist,” which seeks to “expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda,” according to the group’s website.
Several students said that while they aren’t happy about the Turning Point USA event, they recognize Berkeley’s commitment to free speech, which allows speakers like Turek and Schneider to come to campus. 
Leela Mehta-Harwitz, coalitions chair for UC Berkeley’s chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America, said the organization has no plans to protest, attend or otherwise engage with the Turning Point USA event. They made a distinction between the national organization and the campus chapter, saying that the former is extremely harmful and “inflammatory,” and the latter is one they disagree with but see as “colleagues” on campus.
“We don’t feel like it’s worth our energy,” Mehta-Harwitz said. “Turning Point USA is famous for clip farming. They’re well-known for getting inflammatory clips that deliberately paint left-wing activists in a bad light. We’re not interested in being fodder for their social media cycle and being misrepresented.” 
UC Berkeley political science professor Susan Hyde emphasized that all speech, even hate speech, is technically a protected right under the First Amendment. She added that most of the students she’s had in class are open to discussion of alternative viewpoints on campus. 
“We strive to be a campus where people can listen to ideas that they disagree with, they can listen to ideas that they even find offensive, and still understand that this is part of our constitutionally protected rights,” said Hyde. “We can have respectful engagement with lots of different ideas on this campus. I think that’s part of our mission, and part of what the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley has meant.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_Charlie-Kirk_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-03 08:56:22.767650

Potentially volatile cellmates are a fact of life in California prisons. That may change as the state’s incarcerated population declines, freeing up space for single-person quarters.


If you’re serving hard time inside a California prison, you’ll often find yourself stuck in a cramped cell with a complete stranger. You hang a bedsheet to manufacture the semblance of privacy between bed and toilet. Any little thing can erupt into a source of tension and angst – body odor, snoring, lights on or off.
Each moment becomes a test to avoid confrontation or brawling. With no immediate help from officers, the fear and anxiety festers inside you. And day by day, your mental health deteriorates.
“You don’t necessarily know what the capacity of this person is, or like what their crime is,” said Steven Warren, a current resident inside San Quentin Rehabilitation Center. “You’re not told any of that when you’re put in a cell with them.
“I don’t know if this person has the propensity to murder me in my sleep or commit a violent act against me just because they’re feeling some type of way.”
Some California policymakers and prison officials believe it’s time to rethink these potentially harmful housing situations. They contend that offering more single-occupancy cells might serve the best interests of prison residents and public safety.
That’s possible because California’s incarcerated population continues to decline — from its peak of over 173,000 people in 2006 to just under 90,000 today. A handful of prisons have closed, while changes in resentencing and parole eligibility have helped release thousands of individuals.
Under former Gov. Jerry Brown and now Gov. Gavin Newsom, rehabilitation and reentry opportunities remain a growing focal point, too. San Quentin Rehabilitation Center stands at the forefront of the discussion, with an “earned living” housing unit comprised exclusively of single-person cells and plans to similarly repurpose the vacated Death Row buildings. A spokesperson for the prison said it is “working toward” making single-person cells available to all incarcerated people by spring 2026.
A bill advanced in the California Legislature this year aims to establish single-cell units at more prisons. The measure did not make it to Newsom, but it’s expected to return in 2026. 
“We want people to have the opportunity to return back to our community, and we want them to do that in the healthiest manner,” said San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, who helped draft the legislation.
“You can’t do that if you’re in an environment that causes chaos and stress — or you can’t sleep, you’re having confrontations, you’re irritable because you’re sleeping with one eye open.”
Conversations spark change
Jenkins visited San Quentin numerous times over the last two years and spoke with Warren and others. More importantly, she listened.
“One of the conversations that we had inside with a number of the residents was the cellmate on cellmate violence and all of the issues that come with sharing a cell,” said Jenkins.
She reached out to Assemblymember Damon Connolly, the Democrat representing San Rafael. Together, they authored the Assembly bill that proposes establishing single-occupancy cell pilot programs at four California prisons.
“To properly be able to engage in rehabilitative programming,” states the bill’s text. “Incarcerated persons must be able to sleep without fear of physical harm.”

Connolly said that single-cell housing units additionally promote safer work environments for corrections officers and staff. “It fits in, in my view, with the larger objectives that the governor and many of us have pursued.”
The state’s prison union agrees with Connolly and Jenkins. 
The California Correctional Peace Officers Association in general has supported Newsom’s emphasis on rehabilitation for prisoners, and it has begun lobbying in public against further prison closures. 
The 24,500-member union is a player in the Capitol, where it has given $7 million to state lawmakers since 2015, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database. It also kicked in $1.75 million to help Newsom defeat the 2021 recall campaign against him, and another $1 million to back Newsom’s 2024 mental health ballot measure.
“The threat of violence and tension in shared cells… fosters conflicts amongst cellmates, necessitating intervention from correctional officers, who place themselves in jeopardy, thereby escalating the overall risk within the facility for all parties involved,” said the California Correctional Peace Officers Association in a support letter to Connolly.
Warren recalled a 2021 situation of cellmate on cellmate violence that he can’t ever forget.
“A young man beat an older gentleman to death in a cell maybe four or five cells down from me,” he said. “It was crazy. After everything was all said and done, there were so many conversations about how these two people shouldn’t be together — about how one person was having an issue with the other person, but (officers) not giving it full regard of the mental health issues.”
A new era of decarceration
Old prisons, such as San Quentin and Folsom, were originally designed to house one person per cell. In response to mass incarceration and overcrowding in the 1990s and early 2000s, the corrections department threw beds into spaces never intended for housing. They had people sleeping in gyms, hallways, and even stairwells.
And they welded and bolted extra bunk beds into almost every single-person cell.

Decades of prison rights litigation eventually forced the system to address the issue of housing people at 200% design capacity. Two class-action lawsuits, Coleman v. Newsom and Plata v. Newsom, led to federal oversight and a mandated decrease to 137% capacity.
Current housing rates stand at about 120% design capacity, averaged across all 31 state prisons. 
Newsom faces some pressure to close more of them. His administration estimates that shutting down one prison saves about $150 million a year, and it’s the only reliable way to actually bring down corrections spending. He has closed four prisons so far — with one more shutdown in the works.
Some advocacy groups and incarcerated individuals opposed Connoly and Jenkins’ bill to provide more single-cell housing. Known as prison abolitionists, these groups want to see as many prisons close as possible. They believe providing more single-cell units could interfere with that agenda.
Kenthi Porter, an incarcerated resident of Ironwood State Prison, submitted a letter to the Legislature through the abolitionist group Initiate Justice that said single cell policies “may reinforce the infrastructure of mass incarceration… by utilizing current excess bed space and providing a pretext for halting future prison closure or expanding existing prison infrastructure.”
Connolly emphasized that the bill does not attempt to legislate on any prison closure decisions.
“The goal here is not to otherwise keep prisons open that are slated to be closed or to reopen closed prisons,” he said. “I fully understand the goal of reducing incarceration that is aligned with the governor’s goal of closing certain prisons. This is not what that is about.”
Jenkins said that closing prisons to accommodate decreasing prison populations amid fiscal budget considerations may not be the best solution.
“Closing prisons is symbolic,” she said. “I don’t think that it represents a true care for the people who are currently incarcerated. I think we have to think about the conditions that they’re in and not symbolic gestures.”
Incentivizing good behavior
One big roadblock that can derail parole and reentry opportunities is the common prison practice of holding both cellmates accountable for the actions of one. When officers find contraband like narcotics, weapons or cell phones in a cell, they commonly issue a disciplinary rules violation report that holds both occupants responsible for the infraction.
“A write-up could be given to you based on the fact that your cellmate was involved in certain activities,” said Warren. “You have to collectively pay for what this person did because, in here, you’re guilty until proven innocent — and most of the time, they usually find us guilty.”
Disciplinary infractions remain part of an incarcerated individual’s permanent record and affect their chances of parole or resentencing. A mistake or exoneration may get documented, but those reports never completely go away.
Jenkins asked San Quentin administration to provide data on the amount of write-ups that occurred within Donner, its single-cell “earned living” unit for residents who demonstrate disciplinary-free conduct.
“San Quentin had over 3,000 write-ups last year, and out of those 3,000, I believe it was seven that came out of Donner,” said Jenkins. “What you see is that it’s working. It’s effective in that it allows the correctional officers who work in that unit to actually be able to have less stress themselves because they know that these inmates are incentivized to behave.”
Erick Maciel currently resides in Donner and has been there since its inception as an earned living unit in 2023. He said it’s the first and only time he’s had a cell to himself in more than eight years of incarceration.
“Donner feels like I’m on parole,” said Maciel. “It’s the closest thing to almost feeling free in prison because we’re not feeling pressure from correctional officers or anything like that. It’s super important, because now I’m able to just concentrate on myself.”
Staying in Donner requires remaining disciplinary-free, so Maciel and others in the unit act accordingly. 
“I am afraid of the consequences,” he said about potentially getting a write-up and losing his single-cell privileges. “I’m very mindful that I’m following the rules all the time — because I appreciate where I’m at.”

Just over a year later, the local emergency health systems[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Hallie Claflin







MORE THAN A year after Steward Health Care’s bankruptcy shuttered Carney Hospital in Dorchester and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, the communities that depended on them are still trying to process why the state decided to save the other Steward community hospitals and leave theirs to close.  
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporters Jennifer Smith and Hallie Claflin discuss Claflin’s long-read into the fallout for residents and health care providers trying to navigate system strain and longer travel times post-closure. 
Both in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston and the more rural Nashoba Valley region, “the issues in health care that already existed in these communities were really exacerbated,” Claflin said. “They’re really drowning in it. And these hospitals were vital to them. Whether they had a declining patient volume or not, they were really vital to those people.” 
What once was a trip of just a few blocks to the Carney for Jane McInerney, a 69-year-old Dorchester resident who is wheelchair-bound with multiple sclerosis, is now a cross-city voyage. Getting care at multiple facilities across Greater Boston involves scheduling transportation through her insurance days in advance, and that’s after about a year of nailing down her array of new providers. 
“She told me, ‘I think that I’m probably just gonna start going to the doctor less,’” Claflin said. For older adults and those with mobility issues, delaying care can be life-threatening, Claflin noted. 
McInerney took Claflin to the shuttered Carney – doors boarded, trash accumulating. “Walking by a community hospital that served you your entire life and seeing those boards up, it kind of feels like walking by a gaping hole,” one local activist told Claflin. 
One rationale for the closures was lack of demand. But Steward’s reported census numbers excluded outpatient surgeries, medical imaging, and emergency room patients who weren’t admitted. Steward had been pulling staff and resources for months before closure, forcing patient transfers. 
And the system is feeling the pressure, Claflin said. The Carney saw 30,000 annual emergency visits that had to be absorbed somewhere. Boston EMS has seen a 20 percent increase in transport times. The Codman Square community health center now has a five-month wait for new primary care patients. 
Between rural Ayer, which has just two dedicated ambulances, and the surrounding Nashoba Valley region, 17 small municipalities lost their hospital. The strain on EMS has been severe. Fire departments operating with skeleton crews now transport patients one to three hours away instead of 15 minutes to Nashoba Valley.  
“If anything else happens in the town of Ayer, there is no ambulance,” Claflin said. 
Audra Sprague, an emergency room nurse at Nashoba Valley for 17 years, told Claflin the closure weighs on her constantly. “I think about this all the time,” she said. “Where are people going? Are they not going to the emergency room because it’s 40 minutes away?” 
What struck Claflin most was the residents’ sense of betrayal. After all this time, she said, “a lot of people still don’t understand why five hospitals were saved and the other two weren’t.” 
On the episode, Smith and Claflin discuss the immediate aftermath of the closures (10:00), EMS strain in rural communities (13:40), and how communities feel about the state’s lack of action (20:00).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-03 08:56:22.767650

Just a few weeks ago, the two friends from Wisconsin weren’t sure they’d get to see Arches National Park during the federal government shutdown, let alone arrive to find the bathrooms clean and the visitor center open.
“As a visitor, I’m just delighted,” said Maager, 53.
“Go Utah!” said Mueller, 65.

While visitors may not notice a significant impact in the short term, others say the shutdown is holding parks and their staff back from meeting their mission to preserve the land and serve the public. 
At the latest in a series of protests in Moab on Friday, a small group vented their frustration and fears as more than 9,000 National Park Service employees — the majority of its workforce — remain furloughed across the country, and others are working without pay. 
“Bare bones staff picking up trash isn’t meeting the mission, and visitors aren’t having the experience they should have,” said Allyson Mathis, a former park ranger at Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Grand Canyon national parks.
The 1916 law creating the National Park Service set its mission to “preserve unimpaired” its resources “for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.”

But with agency scientists sidelined, Mathis said one key element of preserving the parks — the usual fall monitoring of plants and wildlife — have been paused indefinitely. So have many administrative functions and the most informational talks available to visitors.
Also among the protesters’ concerns: staffing for next year’s busy season. Utah’s parks typically start posting those upcoming seasonal jobs in November and December, but that isn’t likely to happen in the shutdown. 
Mathis compared the mechanics of running a national park to another complex system requiring immense administrative support that’s often unseen.  
“To run a hospital, you need more than just the docs and the nurses on the front line to save lives. You have to have all the techs. You have to have people buying the supplies and the materials and administration,” Mathis said.

At Zion National Park, a nonprofit is stepping in to help. Visitors are using maps and other printouts paid for by the Zion Forever Project, at a cost of $30,000. The group is also chipping $20,000 to staff an information desk during the closure. 
Zion Forever contributes a yearly average of $3.3 million to the park, and the number will likely go up this year since parks aren’t collecting visitor fees while the federal government’s closed, said Natalie Britt, president and CEO. Britt noted October is one of the park’s busiest months.

“When those fees stop coming in, the impact is immediate and far-reaching,” Britt said in an email Friday. 
In Moab, Mali Sanders, 25, joined about 15 other protesters on Main Street Friday, holding a small American flag. 
With fewer park rangers at work, she’s concerned visitors will feel emboldened to leave a mess and that their bad behavior could go unchecked. She saw that happen in Joshua Tree National Park during the 35-day government closure in December 2018.
“I was watching people let their dogs run loose, not pick up dog poop, trashing things,” Sanders said. “It was kind of a disaster. They were treating a national park the way that high schoolers treat a party spot.”
Protesters also raised concerns about the ongoing financial toll on workers going without pay, concerns echoed by Maager and Mueller. The two friends said they want to see the state’s parks and its staff stay in good shape for years to come. 
“They are so emblematic of not only Utah, but the West and America,” Mueller said. “To put them in any kind of peril, any kind of jeopardy, is unthinkable.”

Crews are preparing a site in Thomasville expected to host an initial cohort of 20 women on parole. The facility, known as the Central Alabama Re-Entry (CARE) Center, is expected to open next spring.
“The CARE Center is going to do nothing but cater to women who have come out on parole and probation,” said Cam Ward, director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles (ABPP), in an interview on Wednesday.  “We will provide drug treatment, mental health treatment, and job training.”

The center comes from SB 5, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham and passed in 2023, that directed the bureau to open at least one women’s facility “for the housing of parolees and probationers ordered to serve a period of confinement.”
ABPP currently has a single residential facility that serves men after getting parole The parole board will require some to remain at the Perry County site for 90 days if they believe they are at a higher risk to reoffend.
The Perry County site has generated solid results, according to Ward and administrators of the facility. More than 400 people have completed programs at PREP without a single individual return to prison. ABPP hopes to build on the success of the men’s rehabilitation facility to adapt the model to an entirely different group.
“When we get this center open in Thomasville, you just wait and see,” Coleman-Madison said in an interview on Thursday. “If you think these numbers are outstanding, the women are going to blow it out of the water because all they need is a chance.”
The centers aim to provide some stability and job training to help ensure people do not reoffend.
“This is a multi-layered problem; it is not only one or the other one, but I tend to think that housing is a key first step,” said Pilar Larroulet, an assistant professor at the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers-Newark University. “How will you find a job if you don’t have an address to give? How will you regain custody of your kids if you do not have anywhere to take them? The discussion about housing has become more important.”
The residential facilities also provide mental health treatment and substance abuse counseling to address some of the determinants of recidivism.
“This connection with services is the missing piece many times for successful reintegration,” Larroulet said.
The women’s rehabilitation facility will serve smaller groups of people, at least to start, due in part to logistics and demographics. According to the monthly statistical report from August taken from the Alabama Department of Corrections website, about 2,700 women were in ADOC custody versus almost 26,000 men.
The recidivism rate for women is also less than that for men. According to a study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics published in 2018, about 44% of men who had been incarcerated in prison in 24 states were rearrested after the first year versus 34% of women in a similar situation. After three years, about 31% of men who had been in prison were rearrested versus 29% for women during the same time.
The residential facility, and the services that are offered, are more critical for women than men, according to Stephanie C. Kennedy, policy director at the Council on Criminal Justice, an independent, nonpartisan think tank that focuses on criminal justice issues.
“They don’t have a safe place to land in order to get everything done, so they are going back to an abusive parent, they are going back to an abusive partner, and that complicates everything,” Kennedy said. “Women’s experience of trauma is much more interpersonal, more likely to include sexual violence, intimate partner violence, so when we are thinking about reentry, we need to be using a trauma-informed lens.”
Women who have been incarcerated are more likely to be affected by substance abuse, are less likely to be economically stable and experience higher rates of homelessness, less of a job history and lower rates of education attainment than men incarcerated in prison.
“Women, over two years post release, are five and a half times more likely to have an overdose fatality than women in the community,” she said. “And for men it is 3.3. There is just much higher risk.”
Women are also more likely to be the caregivers than men, whether that be parents or their children.
“When they are leaving confinement, they are having to do all the things that we ask everyone to do, find a job, get an address, but they are also needing to reunify, to work a case plan for child welfare, to navigate the transition back to caretaking from a parent or a sibling, or a friend to get their children back,” Kennedy said.
ABPP will offer about the same services at the women’s rehabilitation facility as men with additional programming to include family reunification and job training tailored to what women would prefer.
“For example, CDL, commercial driver’s license, I would have never known this, but someone explained this to me, it is much more popular among the women than it is among the men,” Ward said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reentry-Cam-Ward-Oct-6-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 08:18:56.925395

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Voters in the east Metro and in Wright County will decide control of the Minnesota Senate Tuesday, as two seats are up for grabs in separate special elections.
GOP Sen. Bruce Anderson of Buffalo unexpectedly died in July, and Democratic-Farmer-Labor Sen. Nicole Mitchell resigned after a lengthy criminal saga that resulted in a first-degree burglary conviction.
Prior to the two vacancies earlier this year, Democrats controlled the Minnesota Senate 34-33.
The party-endorsed candidates in both Senate districts also won their August primaries.
With a Democratic governor and an equally divided House, a Republican-controlled Senate wouldn’t result in significant new laws. And, with the state’s two-year budget already set through June 30, 2027, legislators won’t make major changes to taxes and spending next year.
But control of the chamber still matters. Republican committee chairs could hear favorable bills and hold hearings on favorable issues in an election year. The majority status could also boost Republican fundraising for the 2026 election.
To do it, however, Republicans would need to spark a major upset.
Here’s what you need to know about each race.
Senate District 47
Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger is running as the DFL candidate for Senate District 47, which includes Woodbury and part of Maplewood. This seat was formerly held by Mitchell.
Hemmingsen-Jaeger was first elected to the Minnesota House in 2022. She has a science background, holding degrees in cell biology, genetics and environmental policy. She’s worked for the Departments of Public Safety and Human Services.
Senate District 47 leans blue, but it may be competitive in a low-turnout special election to replace a disgraced Democrat.  
The Republican candidate is Dwight Dorau, an Air Force veteran and a teacher in the Junior ROTC program at Johnson High School in St. Paul. Dorau is a retired colonel, and he served in Afghanistan. In 2022, Dorau lost his bid for the District 47 seat to Mitchell by 18 percentage points.
If Hemmingsen-Jaeger wins this Senate election, Gov. Tim Walz will need to call another special election to replace her in the House.
Senate District 29
Michael Holmstrom Jr. is running as the Republican candidate for Senate District 29, which includes Buffalo, Monticello, Delano and Annandale. This seat was formerly held by Anderson.
Senate District 29 is a safely red district.
Holmstrom is a small business owner from Buffalo and a longtime Wright County GOP volunteer. On his campaign site, Holmstrom said he’s had years of “pro-life activism” and committed to “defending girls’ sports and standing with parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education.”
The Democratic candidate is Louis McNutt, an equipment mechanic for the Minnesota Department of Transportation. McNutt is also a union leader with AFSCME Local 221. He has made cost of living a centerpiece of his campaign for Senate.

Each year, the organization only presents this award if they believe a journalist’s work “ helped to further the public’s understanding of the criminal justice system and the rights to due process and equal protection.”
The honor is for Rubin’s reporting, including most notably her investigation, “The Man Who Unsolved a Murder.” The project found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.
As a companion to her main investigation, Rubin also published a piece summarizing the key takeaways from her investigation: “California is failing to provide a vital safeguard against wrongful convictions.”
“Through rigorous investigation and compelling storytelling, she has brought national attention to the urgent need for reform in public defense. Rubin’s work exemplifies the highest standards of journalistic integrity and advances public understanding of justice, due process, and equal protection,” wrote the organization’s board of directors.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-03 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about expiring ACA subsidies as open enrollment begins,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/03/expiring-aca-subsidies-explained/,Open enrollment is underway. But subsidies that help lower costs for Affordable Care Act plans are set to expire. Here’s what you need to know.,"Subsidies that help lower costs for Affordable Care Act health plans are set to expire at the end of the year, and without congressional action, premiums are expected to rise in 2026.
The enhanced premium subsidies have been in the spotlight in recent weeks as the shutdown of the federal government drags on. 
Democrats are pushing for another extension of the subsidies in order to secure their votes on a bill that would reopen the government and end the monthlong shutdown. But many Republicans see it as government bloat and want to at least address the issue separately from government funding. Premium increases are slated to go into effect next year if the tax credits lapse after Dec. 31.
The uncertainty over the tax credits coincides with the beginning of open enrollment to purchase plans for next year on the state’s insurance exchange, Access Health CT. Open enrollment for plans that take effect at the start of next year began Nov. 1 and runs through Dec. 15. Residents have until Jan. 15 to enroll in plans that begin in February.
Here’s what you need to know:
What are the subsidies and why are they expiring?
The enhanced premium subsidies were created under the American Rescue Plan Act, the 2021 federal legislation that congressional Democrats passed to provide relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Enrollees can qualify for various subsidies to reduce health care costs based on their income. Households earning between 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for getting financial help to afford plans. 
The 2021 bill expanded eligibility to those who make more than 400% of the federal poverty level, capping the cost of a benchmark plan at 8.5% of that household’s annual income.
To qualify for any subsidies, you must be a U.S. citizen or have legal residency. You also need to file taxes jointly if married.
Under the American Rescue Plan, the enhanced subsidies would have sunset one year later in 2022. But Congress was able to extend them for another three years under Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act. That piece of legislation set the expiration of the tax credits for Dec. 31, 2025.
Will I see an increase in my premiums if they expire?
You are likely to see an increase in your premium if Congress takes no action before the end of the year. For those who earn less than 400% of the federal poverty level, you’re likely to get less assistance. But those over the 400% will see their relief go away completely.
Letters recently went out telling people who have plans through Access Health CT how much more they might have to pay when the credits expire.
If the subsidies lapse at the end of December, Connecticut residents could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year — or about $198 a month — according to mid-October estimates provided by Access Health CT. A household of four would see premiums rise by an average of over $10,000 per year.
The state health exchange attributes these premium hikes to the expiration of the enhanced subsidies in addition to overall rate increases for 2026 plans.
Access Health CT said it uses two factors to determine premiums: age and county. For older people, premium rates are usually higher because there’s an expectation health services will be used more often.
Who will be affected in CT?
The expiration of these subsidies would affect those who purchase health plans through Access Health CT. It does not affect those who get coverage through employer-provided plans, Medicare or Medicaid. 
But not everyone will lose out entirely on financial support and other subsidies that help lower costs for people who shop on the state’s insurance marketplace.
About 143,000 enrollees in Connecticut receive some sort of subsidy to help defray the costs of premiums. Of that number, nearly 32,000 enrollees qualify for the enhanced subsidy, and would thus completely lose their financial assistance by next year. The remaining 111,000 will still receive financial support, but it will decrease. 
A total of nearly $105 million each month currently goes toward premium relief for enrollees in the state.
Older Americans and early retirees could experience some of the highest increases in their premiums, according to KFF. Of those in Connecticut at risk of losing all financial help, a little more than one third are between the ages of 55 and 64.
Will Congress extend the subsidies before the end of the year?
Congress is currently locked in a prolonged battle over how and when to address the subsidy expiration, which is at the heart of the shutdown fight.
It is unclear whether Congress will vote to extend them or if they will lapse next month. There’s debate over the length of any renewal — or whether to renew them at all. Some Democrats want to make them permanent. But some Republicans amenable to their renewal only want a temporary extension and income limits.
Democrats want to tackle the extension of the tax credits at the same time as short-term funding, known as a continuing resolution, to keep the government open. In their own version of the funding bill, Democrats are seeking to make the subsidies permanent, among other health care-related provisions related to Medicaid.
Republicans counter that they should be dealt with separately. GOP leadership hasn’t been supportive of extending the subsidies, but some in the party have supported them. There’s a GOP-led bill that would extend them for another year, which has been largely rejected by Democrats.
And because of the uncertainty of what Congress will do and the ongoing shutdown, officials in Connecticut have recommended holding off on immediately enrolling in 2026 plans to see if things resolve.
“If you could, wait a little bit longer,” Access Health CT CEO James Michel said in late October. “Instead of enrolling on Nov. 1, give it more time, because I know there’s conversations going on right now to try to get the subsidies resolved.”

Allen is backing an amendment to the Alabama Constitution that would bar naturalized citizens from holding political office. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s chief elections officer seems to despise democracy.
Wes Allen has spent the vast majority of his public career making voting harder in Alabama. As a state representative, he sponsored a bill outlawing drop boxes, a big help to those with disabilities, and in rural areas.
He also pushed legislation banning private donations for election operations, which made it easier for poor, cash-strapped local governments to help residents vote.
As Alabama Secretary of State, Allen tried to throw the Democratic nominees for president and vice president off the ballot in 2024. He claimed their nominations would come after a hard-and-fast certification deadline, one that was quite a bit looser when Donald Trump ran into the same problem in 2020. (The Legislature overrode Allen last year.)
Allen made a late effort last year to disenfranchise “noncitizens,” who can’t vote to begin with. In the process, he nearly managed to take the vote from naturalized citizens who can. A federal judge blocked him.
The secretary justifies these restrictions by invoking election security. This is not a problem in Alabama. There have been 36 criminal convictions for voter fraud in Alabama over the last 25 years. To put that in context, almost 2.3 million Alabamians voted in last year’s presidential election. And it wasn’t close.
So it’s not surprising that Allen is backing a constitutional amendment to further limit democracy in Alabama.
But pay close attention. Like many of these initiatives, it seems to have a larger target in mind.
SB 21, sponsored by Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, would make natural-born citizenship a requirement for most state offices, as well as sheriff, district attorney and even the largely ceremonial role of constable.
“For the same reasons our founding fathers sought to ensure that our nation’s leader was a natural-born American citizen, we believe the same standard must be required of those operating in the highest levels of our state government,” Allen said in a statement last week.
The Founders’ concern, as far as we can tell, was preventing the military from falling into the hands of a foreign adventurer. The natural-born citizen clause only applies to the chief executive. And no other federal office.
Nor does Allen explain why a natural-born citizen is more qualified to administer government than a naturalized one. Alabama has had one governor born overseas: Robert Lindsey, who served from 1870 to 1872. He was a fumbling, authoritarian racist. Hardly different from most of the other people who held that office.
In one sense, this is the usual pandering to Alabama’s most hateful voters. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution would appear to stand in its way. It reads, in part: “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
If SB 21 passes and gets ratified by state voters, it will almost certainly be challenged in the federal courts. That legal challenge will likely invoke the 14th Amendment.
And that’s why I think there’s another agenda at work here.
Recall that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 struck down federal abortion protections by inventing an interpretation of the 14th Amendment. Justice Samuel Alito claimed that when the amendment was ratified in 1868, most states criminalized abortion. Therefore, he said, a woman’s control over her own body and health decisions was not a “fundamental liberty” and not protected by due process.
This was a glib way to overturn a five-decade precedent. Alito’s history was, to put it charitably, messy.
But it let conservative activists know that the 14th Amendment — a fortress surrounding citizenship and the rule of law — had been breached. Alito was calling for blood-and-soil politicians to rush in.
And they have. The Trump administration is trying to get the high court, with its obedient poodle majority, to ignore the clear language of the amendment and over 120 years of precedent to effectively end birthright citizenship.
It’s not hard to envision Alabama conservatives using the inevitable lawsuit against SB 21 to demand the court further erode due process and equal protection. I’ll be happy to be wrong. But I’ve seen far too many Alabama leaders use the courts to attack the Constitution.
It starts with banning certain U.S. citizens from office. But it won’t stop there. We’ll hear arguments that due process should only apply to certain cases. Or that states should get to determine what the rule of law is. Particularly as applied to minorities.
Will we end up there? I don’t know.
But I know that our chief elections officer likes cutting Alabamians out of their governance. His work points to a vision of society where the wealthy and privileged get to dictate our work, our leisure and our children’s education, free of constitutional restraints and insulated from dissenting voices.
And far too many federal judges charged with defending the Constitution seem to want that, too.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AL_2023_040-scaled-e1673997178836-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 08:18:56.925395

President Donald Trump last week posted on social media that he had ordered the immediate resumption of nuclear weapons testing “because of other countries testing programs.” The announcement stirred concern among nuclear policy experts because of its potential disruption of what has been a more than three-decades-long moratorium of live testing of nuclear explosives. Trump’s move appears to be a response to Russia’s recently publicized test of a nuclear delivery system, but raises questions of whether the president wants to risk spurring a new global race to test nuclear warheads.
What is behind Trump’s sudden announcement on nuclear testing?
Trump posted his message on social media just minutes before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a summit expected to deal with a range of economic and security issues. Although he was about to enter a room with Xi, Trump may have had Russian President Vladimir Putin on his mind when he made the statement. Russia announced on Oct. 26 — in a setting meant for international audiences — that its new nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable cruise missile, Burevestnik/Skyfall, had traveled and maneuvered 7,800 miles. That system is designed to find the weaknesses in air defenses and what Trump hopes to achieve with his planned Golden Dome project, a vast missile defense effort with ground and space-based interceptors.
Trump may have been looking for a countering signal to Putin, not China, yet China would stand to gain the most from any global restart of nuclear testing as it expands and modernizes its own nuclear program. The United States has more data about its nuclear weapons than any other state; new tests around the world could accelerate other states’ nuclear weapons programs.
The president would also be defying an international norm against testing that forms one part of the global non-proliferation regime. More than 187 countries have signed on to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; the United States, Russia, and China are adhering to it. An international standard against testing is in place and the United States’ actions would likely have unintended consequences abroad.



What is involved in testing nuclear weapons?
Testing a nuclear warhead is not the same as testing a nuclear delivery system. The Department of Energy, historically, has been responsible for the former. The department has not conducted live tests of nuclear warheads since 1992. Between 1945 and the 1990s, the U.S. conducted more than one thousand detonations; scientists use the data and computer models from those tests today without causing any radiological contamination on or off the test site. President George H.W. Bush issued a testing moratorium in 1992.
On the other hand, the Department of Defense routinely tests systems that could carry nuclear weapons, like the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California in May.
Every year since 1992, the directors of the national nuclear laboratories certify that the U.S. nuclear stockpile is safe, secure, and effective without live testing. China and Russia also do not conduct explosive testing, although they have sites where they could just as the United States does in Nevada. Russia and China might reciprocate if the United States starts testing again, which could undermine U.S. advantages. Explosive testing, even if only underground and not in the atmosphere, brings the potential for unnecessary radioactive releases at sites in Nevada and abroad that serve no national security purpose for the United States.
What has been the administration’s stated policy on testing?
Trump’s post upends what was de facto administration policy. Until this week, the current administration has echoed the notion that nuclear testing is not necessary. Brandon Williams, in his confirmation testimony [PDF] before becoming under secretary of energy for nuclear security this spring, told Congress that the U.S. nuclear stockpile is safe, secure, and reliable without the need to resume nuclear explosive testing. He said he would support the robust Stockpile Stewardship Program that assures reliability, but he also told Nevada Democratic Sen, Jacky Rosen that “the decision whether to continue […] super critical testing would certainly be above my pay grade.”
Former officials of the first Trump administration recommended a restart of explosive testing. Robert O’Brien, who served as national security advisor from 2019 to 2021, wrote in Foreign Affairs in summer 2024 that the United States should resume the practice and cited the need to “maintain technical and numerical superiority to the combined Chinese and Russian nuclear stockpiles.” But nuclear experts like Jeffrey Lewis counsel the United States “understands how nuclear weapons work much better today than it ever did when it was conducting nuclear explosions.” If the second Trump administration resumes nuclear testing, Lewis wrote in Foreign Affairs, Russia, China, and emerging nuclear weapons states would follow suit, learn from their own testing, and improve their capabilities.
It is worth noting that Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s sweeping blueprint for overhauling the federal government, called for the president to “indicate a willingness to conduct nuclear tests in response to adversary nuclear developments if necessary [and to direct the National Nuclear Security Administration] to move to immediate test readiness to give the administration maximum flexibility in responding to adversary actions.” Like it has other Project 2025 initiatives, the administration could be embracing this nuclear posture.
What should observers look for next on U.S. nuclear testing?
The Departments of Energy and Defense have yet to clarify how changes to nuclear testing may proceed. Under Secretary Williams and other experts will need to weigh in on the president’s statement. If the administration does seek to move forward with explosive testing, how could the national laboratories—currently running low on funds due to the government shutdown—get started on a time and resource-intensive testing program? Secretary of Energy Chris Wright announced furloughs at the National Nuclear Security Administration on October 20.
There are other ways to remind the United States’ adversaries of the strength of U.S. capabilities without explosive testing. If the president intends to signal strength and wants the Department of Defense to do so, military commanders and policy professionals can offer creative solutions without the risk of radiological consequences, without offering an advantage to China’s expanding nuclear program, and without the risk of a new global race to test nuclear weapons.

Temperatures that month were well above average, according to the National Weather Service. It was 90 degrees in Schurz, Nevada that day – 5 degrees hotter than normal for the area – when a lead-acid battery from a Bureau of Indian Affairs building overheated and “kind of blew up,” said Frank.
Fueled by vegetation cooked by record heat and drought in the months prior, the fire quickly spread across 65 acres. It took two days to fully contain, cutting off a portion of the U.S. Route 95 and causing the evacuation of all the tribe’s administrative offices.
“We ended up calling out all the municipalities to help us, just because of how intense it was,” Frank said of the June 20 fire.
Wildfire risk in Schurz is higher than 60% of communities in the U.S., according to data from the U.S. Forest Service. But the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s current water system, built in the 1960s, wasn’t designed to provide the water pressure needed to combat the large wildfires the tribe sees now. 
It’s one of the major infrastructure problems that could be solved with a $20 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded to the tribe last winter. But the funding would never come.
Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe are surrounded on all sides by reminders of their vulnerability to a changing climate.
They see it in the river banks eroded by record floods and the fire scorched landscape. They see it in the wilting pinon trees and waning pine nut harvest. They see it in the infrastructure that can’t keep up and rising power bills they can’t afford.
Those observations have also turned into plans, and those plans into grant applications for projects that would prepare the tribe and residents of Schurz for a more extreme climate.
It all came together last December when the Walker River Paiute Tribe was awarded $20 million in funding from the EPA’s Community Change Grant. The grant was one of hundreds awarded under the Environmental and Climate Justice Program – a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden.
With the funds, the tribe could execute a multi-year climate resiliency plan to deliver water, energy, and food infrastructure to about 1,200 tribal members who live on the Walker River Reservation. 
In total, 150 homes would be weatherized and upgraded for energy efficiency and climate resiliency – about 30% of all existing homes on the reservation. 
Swamp coolers that aren’t designed to work in 100 degree temperatures would be swapped out for central air conditioning. Insulation and windows that fail to keep out rising heat would be replaced. Rooftops would be repaired and covered in solar panels and battery storage that could keep medication and food refrigerated during summer blackouts.
No one would be left out. The funding would also cover the remaining cost of a planned Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub – a fully electric and solar powered building with battery storage to shelter the town’s most vulnerable residents during weather emergencies, like floods and extreme heat waves, while increasing food and medication security. 
The grant would also fund the last leg of a water infrastructure project that would support dozens of new fire hydrants on the reservation and secure reliable clean water for 425 existing homes and over 100 future homes.
But the January inauguration of President Donald Trump brought new priorities, and a White House crusade against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs funded by his predecessor’s 2022 climate law. 
Within five months, on May 1, the $20 million Community Change Grant was officially terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, along with more than 780 other environmental justice grants as part of Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI across the government.
The tribe only used about $70,000 from the grant before losing access to funding that would have helped the rural community adapt to a rapidly changing climate.
Multiple nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the EPA, challenging the legality of abruptly terminating congressionally approved funds, but as the case moves through the court system it’s unclear when – if ever – the funds will be restored.
Fires and floods 
Melenie McFalls, the newly elected chair of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, was a month into the job when the EPA first cut off the tribe’s access to the Community Change Grant on Jan. 29. It was one of several grants the tribe would lose in the wake of Trump’s efforts to slash spending and remake the federal government. 
Hundreds of emails piled up as McFalls contacted every state and congressional leader she could think of to restore the tribe’s funding.
“I was focused solely on funding cuts, everything else was left on the table because we rely on grant funding. We had to fight for that,” McFalls said in her office, the one she had to evacuate during the wildfire last year with the rest of the tribe’s council. 
“We were wondering ‘what else is going to get cut? What’s going to be next? What’s going to happen?’ We had no idea,” McFalls said.

Thirteen years ago, the last time McFalls was chair of the tribe, they didn’t have a climate adaptation plan or an emergency plan for major floods and wildfires. Since then she’s seen the impacts of climate change piling up on the reservation. 
The year before the fire, on May 17, 2023, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) found that flooding on the Walker River caused by record-breaking rain and snowmelt created enough structural damage to the Weber Dam seven miles northwest of Schurz that it “could have potentially progressed into a life-threatening event” for the tribe.
The Walker River flooded for 48 consecutive days between May and June that year, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources. It was partially caused by a sudden mid-to-late May warm up that quickly melted record-breaking snowpack in the Walker Basin. By July, stream flows into the Weber Reservoir were seven times the average for the time of year.
About a month after finding the damage in the dam, the BIA told the tribe during a community meeting that if the dam’s spillway failed they would have to prepare for more than three olympic sized pools worth of flooding a minute until the reservoir leveled out. The whole town of Schurz would need to be evacuated within 24 hours. 
“It just wiped out our riverbanks. Took most of the land around it. Water was going up to some peoples porches. It was kind of scary to see that happen,” McFalls said. 
The Walker River Reservation spans 325,000 square acres across three Nevada counties – Mineral, Churchill, and Lyon – but nearly every home is built along the flood-prone river. That’s because the reservation’s water system depends on a gravity-fed storage tank located at the top of a hill that moves water down to the lowest point in the valley where the river runs.
Before it was terminated, a portion of the Community Change Grant was reserved for a planned water infrastructure project that would allow the tribe to build safer homes at higher elevations further from the river.
Heat and energy
The precipitation that flooded Walker River in 2023 was gone by the next year. Most of Mineral, Lyon, and Churchill counties only received about a quarter of the rain and snow they typically do from April to June, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
It was also the hottest year on record in 2024. When the fire broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June the nearest weather tower (about 25 miles away) recorded average monthly temperatures 5 degrees above normal.
Those conditions are becoming the norm. The past decade has been the hottest in two centuries of record-keeping, NOAA reports. Researchers at NASA recently found that summer heat waves in the U.S. have roughly doubled in number since 1980, increasing from an average of two to four per month. 
Rising temperatures have helped Nevada claim two of the fastest warming cities in the nation – Reno and Las Vegas – but rural areas haven’t escaped the heat.
Since 1950, average temperatures on the Walker River Reservation have increased by three degrees, according to Native Climate, a U.S. Department of Agriculture funded research project to support climate adaptation efforts in Native American communities.
Days over 100 degrees have tripled on the reservation from an average of five days in 1950, to 20 days in 2025. Native Climate researchers projected even more extreme heat days using data from NASA climate models.
Under the worst-case scenario “by the end of the century you’re looking at somewhere close to maybe 70 days over 100 degrees on the Walker River Reservation,” said Maureen McCarthy, a research professor at Desert Research Institute, who led the Native Climate project. 
“The extremes are becoming more extreme, in addition to the average temperatures changing,” McCarthy said. “That’s a big impact. We’re not designed to function at 100 degrees.”

























Ageing infrastructure on the reservation makes adapting to rising temperatures and extreme weather more difficult. The Walker River Housing Department reports that two-thirds of homes on the reservation built before 2000 have older, deteriorating roofs and windows due to harsh weather conditions. About 44% of homes on the reservation also rely on swamp coolers, but temperatures during heat waves are rising beyond what the evaporative-cooling appliance can manage. 
Those factors have increased energy costs for households on the reservation. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data tool, household energy costs are 24% higher on the reservation than the state average. Households on the reservation also spend twice as much of their income on energy costs compared to the state average.
Replacing inefficient appliances that inflate energy costs can also be difficult for lower-income households, including many on the reservation. The median household income for the Walker River Paiute Tribe is about $40,000 – about 53% lower than the median household income for Nevada. Unemployment is about twice as high, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.
Funding from the Community Change Grant could have mitigated many of those costs for the most vulnerable households on the reservation. It would have covered the purchase of heat pumps, water heaters, induction cooktops, electric ovens, and new dryers and refrigerators for 120 homes. 
“We were devastated when we started hearing all of our funding getting cut because we thought we were going to have these programs,” said Genia Williams, the housing director for the Walker River Paiute Tribe. “There was a lot of work put into it from my grant writers, past chairman, past administrators that worked hard to get this.”
The Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank created by state legislation — also worked with the Walker River Paiute Tribe to secure the Community Change Grant. 
Since becoming the housing director a decade ago, Williams said persistent blackouts have also been a challenge for the rural reservation. The reservation sits at the end of an energy grid, and as demands for electricity rise with more intense summer heat blackouts rise too.
A joint survey by the bank and tribe found that 50% of households surveyed reported experiencing blackouts four to nine times per year, while a third reported experiencing blackouts more than 12 times per year. Two-thirds of households reported that power outages generally last between four and eight hours.
Unreliable power is especially hard on tribal elders who have difficulty operating back-up generators, and medically vulnerable residents who rely on ventilators or need to keep medication refrigerated. Funding from the Community Change Grant would have allowed the tribe to install solar power and battery storage in 100 of the most vulnerable homes.
“We’re just going to have to weather the storm and see what we can come up with and keep moving forward on these things,” Williams said.
Saving graces 
The years of planning are not completely lost, and some of the tribe’s multi-year climate resiliency plan will move forward – with or without the $20 million Community Change Grant.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the tribe partial funding in 2022 to build a food distribution center that supports the tribe’s long-term food security and sovereignty plan. 
Without the Community Change Grant it won’t be at the scale of the Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub the tribe envisioned. The solar panels, battery storage, walk-in refrigerators and freezers the grant could have funded won’t be included in the building, but it’ll take the tribe a step closer to their goal.
“We’ve come through a lot of storms. The one thing about our tribe and our community is that we’ve been able to overcome,” Williams said.
In September, the tribe also broke ground on a water looping system that will add a 410,000-gallon water storage tank and nearly 25,000 feet of pipe of water lines to the reservation. The new system will make it possible for 100 new houses to be built on the reservation, allowing the nearly 75 Tribal members currently on the housing waitlist to live on their ancestral land and in their community.
When the EPA revoked the Community Change Grant the tribe had already completed engineering, procurement, and planning for the project. About three- fourths of the total $15.8 million needed for the project was secured from a combination of federal and state funds. 
The EPA grant was the last piece of the puzzle. Without it, the tribe would have to dip into their limited reserves. If they didn’t, their remaining funds for the project would be lost.
“We had till the end of September to break ground,” McFalls, the tribal chair said. “If we didn’t we would lose all that funding.”
“All this time the tribe has been working on this project. It would have been terminated if we didn’t do anything,” she continued.
The project couldn’t wait. The existing water systems were built like a tree with branches leading off to nowhere; water lines were not connecting to facilities, which led to some situations where hydrants failed to provide water during an emergency.
Frank, the volunteer firefighter, recalls how one of the fire hydrants on the reservation didn’t work during the 2024 fire that burned 65-acres of the reservation.
“These improvements are not just numbers on the page. They represent safer homes, stronger emergency readiness and peace of mind for every community member who depends on the system every day,” Frank said.

In 2019, the Indian Health Service also determined that low water pressure and stagnant water on the Walker River Reservation posed a public health threat in the form of cross contamination, bacterial diseases that breed in stagnant water from the ageing infrastructure.
The Walker River Paiute Tribe is deeply affected by persistent drought conditions and has lacked reliable access to domestic water supplies for generations. But the water loop project would allow the community to build long-term resilience to drought by increasing water reserves and improving the distribution system.
A 2022 report by the U.S. Geological Survey showed that drought has caused evaporation of the surface water levels of Walker River down to Walker Lake, limiting the recharge of groundwater levels. Groundwater in the area supplies at least half of the drinking water for the tribe, according to the EPA.
Generations of tribal members have left to pursue education with the goal of coming back and building up their community, but the infrastructure wasn’t there, said Williams.
“This is home for a lot of people. It’s where they grew up, or where their families grew up. Now they can come back,” Williams said.

(Source NM file photo)New Mexico state Democratic lawmakers on Thursday expressed concerns that the process governing a proposal to revamp rules governing oil and gas wastewater has been “tainted” by politics, and chastised state officials for being underprepared for the presentation.
Oilfield wastewater — also known as produced water — often contains radioactive or toxic materials; can be five times saltier than seawater; and include proprietary chemicals that operators consider “trade secrets” and do not have to publicly identify. Advocates for expanding its use, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, say it will help the state conserve fresh water. Critics, including environmental groups, say the science for treatment is underdeveloped.
Critics also say the governor tried to unethically sway the process by instructing her cabinet members to vote in favor of an industry-backed group’s proposed rules to reverse stricter guidelines for the wastewater previously adopted by the state Water Quality Control Commission. That proposed rule is currently under consolidation by the WQCC.
New Mexico governor puts finger on scale in oilfield wastewater vote

Advocates and opponents presented to the Water and Natural Resources committee during its meeting this week in Artesia, including members of the industry group at the center of the controversy: the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance, which represents oil companies and wastewater treatment firms, among others.
But if speakers hoped to tamp down concerns about the wastewater rulemaking process, their presentations appeared to have the opposite effect on some lawmakers.
After opening statements, Committee Chair  Liz Stefanics (D-Cerillos) interrupted New Mexico Environment Department Water Protection Division Deputy Director Kelsey Rader and rebuked her for not preparing a handout or slides to the committee ahead of time.
“This is the first time the department has presented to this committee. I find this whole topic very controversial, and to not have some basic information presented to us so that we can take it and make our own individual decisions, I think is a step back,” Stefanics said, directing Rader to pass along the message to NMED Secretary James Kenney.
Later in the meeting, Chad Unrau, the vice president of reuse at produced water treatment company Aris Water Solutions, presented new data from nearly two years of wastewater treatment that he said proved salt and chemical “unknowns” could be removed to a level “below detection limits and/or safe levels.”
Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho), asked if any of the internal tests on water safety had gone through the peer-review process – a means for scientists to evaluate the results. Unaru said that a manuscript was submitted to journals, but had not been reviewed yet.
Cates responded: “I am not comfortable legislatively unless there is peer-review into that evidence gathering,” on the water’s safety.
But primarily, Democratic lawmakers expressed concern about how politicized the issue had become.
At the end of the meeting, after an exchange with WATR Alliance Vice President Matthias Sayer, Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) said from the outside, it appeared that pressure from the governor’s office undermined public faith in the process.
“It looks like the fix is in,” McQueen said, directing his comments to Sayer.  “It looks like you didn’t get the result you wanted, and somehow the politics changed, and in coordination with NMED and other agencies, there was a push and pressure to approve the new rulemaking.”
In a statement to Source NM Friday, Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, said WATR’s petition will be evaluated through an “established, transparent process,” and disputed any wrongdoing in the process.
“The WQCC operates independently and bases decisions on science, public input, and statutory authority. Claims that the Administration improperly influenced a quasi-judicial process are false,” McGinnis Porter said in a statement. “The Governor appropriately discusses water security priorities with her cabinet—that’s normal governance, not improper interference.”
McQueen said he supported the reuse of produced water, but said the “process of the rulemaking, if it goes forward under the current circumstances, is flawed and that taints it.”
Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla) said the WATR Alliance’s efforts to change the rules process was not “honest or accurate,” and failed to be transparent.
Sayer disputed that characterization, saying in his opinion as a regulatory attorney, there was no legal objection to Lujan Grisham’s actions.
Lara Cadena pushed back: “I certainly haven’t argued they broke the law. That doesn’t make it right.”

Axing the rule would undermine the lands that sustain our wildlife, our communities and our outdoor economy, writes Nat Peterson.
The post Repealing the Public Lands Rule would put Wyoming’s outdoor heritage at risk appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is just different. Our wide-open landscapes, healthy herds and rich outdoor traditions aren’t just what we enjoy; they’re who we are. But they are also under strain. Habitat fragmentation, drought, invasive species and degraded landscapes are all chipping away at what makes Wyoming exceptional. The Bureau of Land Management’s Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, implemented in 2024, sought to maintain and restore these landscapes. 

Opinion

Now, the Bureau of Land Management is proposing to repeal the Public Lands Rule, as it’s colloquially known. This rule is the agency’s policy that helps ensure America’s public lands are managed for long-term health, not short-term exploitation. 
The BLM is mandated to manage public lands for multiple use — balancing conservation, extractive use, recreation and more. Repealing this rule would weaken the very foundation of how we care for the lands that sustain our wildlife, our communities and our outdoor economy. 
The Public Lands Rule doesn’t lock up land or block multiple uses. It simply ensures that conservation is treated as a legitimate use alongside energy, grazing and recreation. It also calls on the agency to maintain intact lands, helping ensure functioning habitats remain connected. 
Conservation may not sound like a “use,” but the purpose of the Public Lands Rule is to identify intact landscapes and to encourage active restoration and mitigation projects. What’s more, these uses don’t impact valid existing rights. 
Under the Public Lands Rule, conservation can be compatible with other uses, but repealing it would unravel that balance, pitting short-term gains against the long-term health of the ecosystems that sustain us all. It would open the door to more poorly planned development, greater habitat fragmentation and diminished access for hunters, anglers and recreationists. 
Wyomingites pride themselves on taking care of what they’ve been given. Ranchers manage grass and water because they know their livelihoods depend on it. Sportsmen and women follow fair chase because they know wildlife deserves respect. Agencies like the Wyoming Game and Fish Department rely on science to manage herds that sustain hunting, fishing and tourism across the state. 
The Public Lands Rule reflects that same philosophy. It gives land managers the tools to restore degraded areas, reconnect wildlife corridors, and prevent invasive species from taking hold. It also encourages local residents to help identify lands that need restoration and where development is most appropriate, allowing communities to plan for the future instead of just reacting to the next boom-and-bust cycle. Repealing it would strip away those tools and put political pressure ahead of science-based management. 
Public lands are the backbone of Wyoming’s economy. The outdoor recreation industry contributes over a billion dollars a year to the state, supporting small businesses from Alpine to Albany and from Dubois to Douglas. These are real livelihoods built on healthy landscapes and thriving wildlife — not abstract numbers on a spreadsheet. 
When we keep our public lands healthy, we also strengthen the communities that depend on them. Clean water means strong fisheries. Connected habitat means safe wildlife crossings and resilient herds. Healthy rangelands mean productive grazing and fewer conflicts. 
Wyomingites know that the best solutions don’t come from Washington, D.C., or from shouting matches on social media. They come from sitting around the table and figuring things out together. The Public Lands Rule emerged from that same principle of collaboration. It was developed with thoughtful input from stakeholders across the West. It reflects decades of on-the-ground experience showing that conservation and multiple use can go hand in hand. 
Repealing it now would not only ignore that hard-won consensus but deepen the very divisions that make it harder to solve real problems. 
This isn’t about ideology. It’s about integrity — doing right by the land, the wildlife and the people who depend on both. We can still choose the path of stewardship. We can still honor the generations who built this heritage and the future stewards. We can keep Wyoming wild, working and worth defending.

This settlement cannot undo the pain the opioid crisis has caused, but it can help us build  something better.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tiffanie Katsuva: Vermont’s opioid settlement should strengthen prevention and the people doing the work.","This commentary is by Tiffanie Katsuva. She lives in Colchester and is currently pursuing a Master of Public Health degree at George Washington University.


Vermont joined the $7.4 billion national opioid settlement with Purdue Pharma, and the state is set to receive about $21.85 million.
This is an important step toward accountability,but the real important question  is how would the fund be used. For this settlement to make an impactful difference  for all Vermont families,  it needs to be invested in prevention and in the  people who do the everyday work of recovery in our communities. 
Every day recovery coaches and small community based programs show up for people who are navigating substance use and recovery. They are the ones answering calls, sitting in ERs and in recovery centers, connecting people to care and walking beside them through relapse and recovery.

These are the people who keep the recovery system alive,yet they are often underpaid, undervalued and overworked. The settlement funds should make sure they are paid fairly, receive proper employment benefits such as health insurance and paid time off, and are supported with the tools and resources they need — including educational programs — to continue their life-saving work. 
The settlement should also focus on prevention, not only on treatment after the harm has happened. Vermont can lead by investing in community programs and education that reflect on all people who live here. That means prevention campaigns and materials that reach everyone in Vermont, Including LGBTQI+ Vermonters, former refugees and immigrants, youth, older adults and people living in rural areas. Addiction affects all of us, but not everyone has equal access to information, language or care. 
We also need to train the people providing care, including nurses, physicians and recovery coaches, to meet people where they are with empathy and understanding. Cultural awareness, trauma-informed care and humanity should be at the heart of every service. When people do not feel seen or understood, they are less likely to ask for help, and that can have devastating consequences.
The settlement funds should also help expand recovery-friendly workforces and include recovery coaches in schools, hospitals, and police departments. These are the places where prevention can start early and where people can find support before things get worse. Imagine every high school in Vermont having a recovery coach students can talk to, or hospitals connecting patients directly to recovery coaches. That is what real prevention looks like. 
Transparency and accountability are also important. The state should make sure Vermonters can see where every dollar is spent. A public website and regular updates on how the funds are used would help build trust and make sure the money reaches the people who need it the most. 
This settlement cannot undo the pain the opioid crisis has caused, but it can help us build  something better. It is a chance to create lasting change instead of another short-term fix.
By investing in prevention, paying recovery coaches fairly and supporting community programs that meet people where they are, Vermont can move closer to a future where recovery is possible for all Vermonters.

Officials are looking at ways to avoid such a scenario. 
Unemployment is relatively low in Washington. But pandemic-era policies and increased usage during the past couple of years have strained the state’s unemployment system, which provides temporary payments to residents who lose their jobs and are looking for new work. 
Next year, employer taxes going into Washington’s unemployment trust fund are expected to total $1.7 billion, while benefit payouts rise to $2.4 billion, according to the latest actuarial analysis released this month. 
At the end of September, the trust fund, which only pays benefits and not administrative costs, had about $3.8 billion, totaling 7.9 months of benefits on hand if collections suddenly stopped. As payroll taxes lag payouts, that’s projected to drop to 7.1 months by the same time next year, and 6.3 in 2027. 
Therein lies the problem. 
Dropping below seven months of benefits on Sept. 30 of a given year triggers a state tax of up to 0.2% on businesses to bring the trust fund back up to a healthy nine months of payments. As unemployment skyrocketed during the pandemic, this metric plummeted, but the state waived this tax from 2021 through 2025. This would’ve been the only time it ever could’ve been levied. 
That possible solvency surcharge in 2028 and 2029 would raise an estimated $350 million each year. It would be applied equally across all employers. 
News of this potential tax comes as Washington businesses begin to shoulder billions of dollars in new and increased taxes passed this year to fill a shortfall in the state’s operating budget. 
James Crandall, who represents the Association of Washington Business on the state’s unemployment insurance advisory committee, said the Employment Security Department, which runs the program, “should be looking at everything it has in its power to mitigate ahead of time.”
“This is really impacting companies’ affordability,” Crandall said. He questioned the trigger for the tax and suggested the way it would be imposed seems “arbitrary.”
The tax could be triggered a year earlier, if that 7.1-month projection next year teeters below seven. Whether that happens is a coin flip. 
Under the current forecast, the tax would likely remain into the 2030s.
The projections are based on relatively stable unemployment that doesn’t exceed 5%. Washington’s unemployment rate has hovered around 4.5% this year, roughly in line with the national rate. 
It is far from a foregone conclusion that tax will be needed. A recession or better-than-expected economic growth would shift the chances of needing the tax.
The long-range projections give the state time to change course. 
One solution could come via the Legislature. Lawmakers could reduce the trigger for the solvency tax below seven months. When the tax was first established in the mid-2000s, six months was the threshold, but within a few years, legislators upped it to seven.
Policymakers could also reduce the threshold for when the solvency tax could end, from the current nine months. 
Or they could extend the years-long waiver on the tax, but that would be a punt rather than a fix. To regain long-term stability, either the economy needs an upswing so the state has to pay fewer unemployment benefits, or tax collections need to jump. 
The source of this problem is two-sided. On one hand, people who qualify have been increasingly likely to seek unemployment, and recipients are more often exhausting their benefits. Applicants can usually get up to 26 weeks of payouts per year.

On the other side, policy decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic have jeopardized the fund’s long-term stability. Washington came into the pandemic with one of the healthiest trust funds in the country. 
That allowed the state to provide roughly $2.5 billion in tax breaks to employers, money that would’ve otherwise gone toward Washington’s unemployment trust fund.
So while many states had to borrow from the federal government to keep unemployment checks flowing, Washington did not. But it also left the fund with much less money.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hiring-unemployment-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 07:16:59.300243

But consider this: car haulers full of Chinese-brand vehicles might someday roll across the Ambassador Bridge and the soon-to-open Gordie Howe Bridge in Detroit from Canada.
That isn’t likely to happen anytime soon. Former President Joseph Biden slapped a 100% tariff last year on Chinese electric vehicles that President Donald Trump has continued. Canada also has in place a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs.
But Canada is rumored to be considering removing that tariff as part of a broader effort to build trade relationships with China and other Asian countries in response to Trump’s foolish trade war against our formerly friendly northern neighbor.

Both Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney were in Asia at the same time recently seeking investments.
Relations between the two countries, already testy, further deteriorated after Ontario produced a U.S.-aimed television ad featuring former President Ronald Regan extolling the virtues of free trade.
The ad ran briefly during the World Series, in which many Americans were rooting for the Toronto Blue Jays to defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Trump was so incensed by the ad that he called off trade negotiations with Canada and said he was slapping an additional 10% tariff on Canadian-made goods coming into the U.S. Trump attacked the ad as “fake” and said in another one of his down-is-up moments that Reagan “loved tariffs.”
Canada is heavily dependent on trade with the U.S. so it’s not surprising Carney is seeking new partners if America no longer wants to play ball.
But Michigan’s economy could be a big loser if Canada succeeds spurning the state for new trading relationships with Asian countries.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Canada is Michigan’s largest trading partner. The state exports more goods, worth in excess of $23 billion a year, to Canada than any other country.
A recent statewide poll conducted for the Detroit Regional Chamber found that nearly 60% of Michigan voters think putting tariffs on Canadian goods is bad for the state’s economy.
“They believe tariffs are increasing their costs, hurting the state’s auto industry, and that placing tariffs on Canada hurts Michigan,” said pollster Rich Czuba, who conducted the survey.
Already, goods-carrying truck traffic on the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest U.S.-Canada crossing, is down by more than a third so far this year from 2024. Truck traffic on the Bluewater Bridge at Port Huron is off by 6.7%.

Retailers and other businesses in the state’s border communities of Detroit, Port Huron and Sault Ste. Marie say they are seeing fewer Canadian customers, who appear to be boycotting U.S. shopping and entertainment venues.
Trump doesn’t seem to care. He has often said that the U.S. doesn’t “need anything” from Canada, including the 1.8 million cars and trucks Canada annually exports to the U.S. Many of those vehicles are built in plants owned by General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis.
The president wants those Detroit automakers to close their Canadian plants and move production to the U.S., part of his plan to cripple the Canadian economy and make it the 51st U.S. state. Canadian leaders bluntly say that will never happen.
Detroit automakers appear to be responding to political pressure by Trump.
GM and Stellantis recently slashed production of several models in Canada, prompting the Canadian government to limit the number of vehicles the two automakers can ship to our northern neighbor tariff free.
That move adds to worries by Detroit automakers that the USMCA free trade agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term and has mightily benefitted Detroit, might not survive. The agreement comes up for review next year and prospects for extending it are unclear.
Maintaining the USMCA “can create an even stronger North American trading bloc, ready to compete with China at every turn,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, which promotes Michigan’s auto industry.
But Canada, facing the potential loss of significant Detroit Three investment, is looking to partner with China to possibly replace it and the more than 100,000 direct auto jobs that investment supports.

Removing the 100% tariff could also allow China, which has massive production overcapacity at home, to export vehicles to Canada before establishing production there.
If Canada drops its tariff on Chinese cars, it could gain a significant advantage over the U.S. and Mexico in giving China an opening to the North American market. Mexico, long seen as the most logical entry point for Chinese cars, is planning to raise its tariffs on Chinese vehicles from 20% to 50%.
Experts and even many auto industry executives say that it’s just a matter of time before American consumers are able to buy Chinese vehicles, particularly EVs where China dominates. And a study released earlier this year by AutoPacific Inc. found that nearly 60% of car-buying Americans under 40 would seriously consider a Chinese vehicle.
Trump’s trade war might result in the unintended consequence of those vehicles entering our market through Canada—an existential threat to tariff-weary Detroit automakers.

(Photo by Nate Pappas for the Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun’s post-election fundraising committees continue to draw major support from Indiana’s business community less than a year into his first term as governor, according to new Federal Election Commission filings.
While the latest reports show limited activity in one as it transitions into a political action committee, another has served as a major fundraising hub, routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts linked to Braun and the Indiana Republican Party.
Team Braun — a joint fundraising committee for Braun’s state and federal campaign activities — reported $432,500 in total contributions so far raised this year, ending September with $77,943 cash on hand and no debt, according to FEC data.
The political action committee, or PAC, acts as a conduit for fundraising events that benefit multiple accounts, including the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, Mike Braun for Indiana and the Indiana Republican State Committee.
Story continues below.

Separately, Braun’s former campaign committee, Mike Braun for Indiana, officially renamed itself the Freedom and Opportunity Fund earlier this year and reported limited activity in the most recent reports. The move allows the governor to continue raising and distributing federal campaign funds in support of other candidates and political efforts now that he’s not running for federal office.
The account reported $18,207 in total receipts — meaning new money that came into the committee — between Jan. 1 and June 30, according to filings covering the first half of 2025. But there were no individual or committee contributions during that period.
Story continues below.

Instead, the committee reported $3,991 in candidate refunds and $12,316 in spending, primarily bank interest and reimbursements from vendors for prior campaign-related expenses.
From June through September, the PAC reported $354,556 in total disbursements, including roughly $350,000 in transfers to affiliated committees, such as Team Braun. Operating expenditures — mainly administrative costs — totaled about $3,457. No independent expenditures, loans or contribution refunds were reported.
The Freedom and Opportunity Fund ended the quarter with $77,943 in cash on hand, and no debts owed to or by the committee.
Joint committee handled most fundraising and transfers
Most of Team Braun’s reported financial activity involved distributing money to its partner committees rather than spending it directly. 
The latest FEC report shows the joint committee raised $70,000 in new contributions during September, bringing its year-to-date total to $432,500 — all from individual donors.
Federal filings detail $351,099 in total transfers, including:

$206,675 to Mike Braun for Indiana
$67,232 to the Freedom and Opportunity Fund
$62,252 to the Indiana Republican State Committee’s federal account
$4,980 to the state-level Indiana Republican State Committee
$9,960 to the Hoosiers for Opportunity, Prosperity and Enterprise Victory Fund, a separate joint fundraising vehicle


Other expenditures were small and technical — about $2,000 in fees to CMDI and Anedot Inc. for credit-card and software services, plus bank fees.
The filings also identify a wave of large donors in recent months, most giving $5,000 or more through Team Braun. Among them:

Viswanath Atluri of Carmel, president of VTSI – $12,500
Amar Venkata Bukkasagaram of Fishers, director at Alithya – $12,500
Jordan Caldwell of Shelbyville, executive at Caldwell’s Inc. – $10,000
Mark Elwood of Columbus, executive at Elwood Staffing – $7,500
John Engelbrecht of Evansville, CEO of South Central Inc. – $5,000
Robert Kersey of Muncie, executive at American Lawn Mower – $10,000
Gary Roberts of New Castle, owner of Roberts Pipeline Inc. – $5,000
Michael Merritt of Bloomington, co-founder and retired executive at Investcorp – $5,000
Herbert Likens of Anderson, partner at Likens Farms, now retired – $2,500

Earlier in the summer, the committee attracted several other high-profile donors, including:

James Cornelius, retired chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb – $50,000
Jeffrey Schwartz, retired executive of Simon Property Group – $20,000
Paul Thrift, president of Thompson Thrift Development – $20,000
Michael Coyle, owner of Coyle Automotive in Jeffersonville – $20,000
Christopher Reid, CEO of CRG Residential – $15,000
Janet Coyle, of Jeffersonville – $20,000
Daniel Fitzpatrick, CEO of Quality Dining in Mishawaka – $10,000

Braun’s growing political network
Neither of Braun’s federal committees reported any loans or outstanding debts, and both listed “$0” in obligations owed to or by the committees.
The Team Braun filings also show the committee as a clearinghouse for joint fundraising events — gatherings where donors can write a single check that’s divided among multiple Republican committees.
Each of the large transfers was described in filings as a “transfer of joint fundraising proceeds.”
The structure mirrors how other sitting governors with federal campaign histories have kept their donor networks active through PACs and joint committees. It also positions Braun to remain a player in Indiana Republican fundraising circles ahead of the 2026 and 2028 election cycles.
Both committees are next due to file quarterly reports with the FEC in January 2026, which will provide a fuller picture of Braun’s post-campaign fundraising and political activity.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Next year in Annapolis, the Exelon Corp., owner of three electric utilities in Maryland, plans to push for legislative approval to build and operate a power plant in the state, company officials say.
That would be a dramatic reversal of a 26-year-old utility deregulation policy that, in part, forced utilities that operate power lines and other transmission infrastructure to get out of the power generation business.
But Exelon seems ready to seize on a unique political moment to overturn the law, with electric customers in Maryland and across the region feeling the pinch of rising prices — in part because of rising demand, but also because of rising power distribution costs charged by utilities.
Critics say that, unlike power generators operating in the state today, Exelon would be able to recover generation costs from ratepayers. But Exelon notes that it would need to go before Maryland regulators for approval to recoup its costs through power bills.
“It’s a guaranteed way to increase electricity supply, which will help bring costs under control,” said Valencia McClure, a senior vice president of governmental, regulatory and external affairs at Exelon. “And then your regulators will have control over the dollars that are spent: The how, where, when, generation will be built.”

Exelon isn’t just looking to build in Maryland, but across its footprint, which also includes ComEd in Illinois and Atlantic City Energy in New Jersey. So Exelon will aim to sway legislators across the region.
“I believe the 2026 legislative sessions are going to be an opportunity for us,” Exelon CEO Calvin Butler told Reuters. “We’re going to be advocating for it.”
That push has plenty of detractors, including ratepayer advocates, who argue that investors should bear the risks of new power development — as opposed to already overburdened consumers. Climate advocates, including the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, are joining the chorus too, as they continue to oppose the development of new natural gas power plants in Maryland.
Not surprisingly, the companies that operate power plants, known as merchant generators, are also opposed. They argue Exelon is unaccustomed to building generation, and therefore poorly suited to enter the fray.
What legislators are saying
Some leading Maryland policymakers are skeptical, too.
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), who helped usher 2025’s energy reform legislation to the finish line, said he worries that Exelon wants to get involved because it sees an opportunity for a windfall — with a reduced risk.
“They have a duty to the ratepayer, but they also have a duty to their stock holders — and that duty is to make more money,” said Wilson, who chairs the House Economic Matters Committee. “Getting involved in generation is not just something that they’re doing out of the kindness of their hearts. They’re doing it because they see a financial benefit.”
At least one leading Republican, Sen. Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said he’s open to the proposal, but only in a limited fashion. Republicans have argued that policies spearheaded in Annapolis by the Democratic majority, including climate change policies, have driven fossil fuel power generators away from Maryland, worsening the state’s energy picture.
“We have to be smart,” Hershey said in a statement. “I’m open to limited regulated generation if it strengthens our reliability, but it must come with strong consumer protections. Utilities should not be allowed to rate-base a project until it is built, operational and delivering power to Maryland customers.”
In the 2025 legislative session, Maryland lawmakers voted to encourage new power generation in Maryland using regulatory “fast-tracks” for new projects. They stopped well short of allowing utilities to get back in on the generation game.
Power generators had until the end of October to submit their “dispatchable” projects to the Maryland Public Service Commission for an expedited review. To meet the criteria, projects have a certain ranking, indicating that they can contribute to the grid during peak times. The PSC will also accept applications for battery storage projects. McClure said that Exelon is watching both efforts closely to see if today’s competitive market can meet Maryland’s demands.
But in the meantime, Exelon is completing feasibility studies on potential new power facilities in Maryland, McClure said. Exelon has three Maryland utilities: Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pepco and Delmarva Power.
The utility is focusing its studies on a potential natural gas-fired power plant, but it is also considering solar arrays and battery energy storage, McClure said.

In a best-case scenario, she said, the company anticipates that building a gas plant could take five to seven years. She said that adds to the urgency for policymakers to act now, and allow transmission companies to add power generation to the grid.
“We don’t have time to continue to wait — to think about: What is the right solution? What is the right plan?” McClure said. “That’s why it’s going to take multiple parties coming to the table to resolve the issue.”
Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, an independent attorney general appointee who works to protect ratepayers from unfair practices and high costs, states his opposition to Exelon’s proposal simply: “We should be looking for less monopoly control, and not more,” he said.
Lapp worries that allowing regulated generation — the term for letting utilities build and operate generation — could see massive cost overruns, in part because utilities wouldn’t have incentives to keep costs low.
That’s because utilities, like Exelon, get a guaranteed return on their infrastructure spending, plus interest. So even if the power infrastructure isn’t needed later, consumers are still on the hook to pay for it over a period of years.
The structure is meant to ensure that the electric and gas systems are continuously maintained. But Lapp argues that some utilities — particularly those owned by publicly traded Exelon — have taken it too far, rapidly spending on infrastructure and swelling customer bills.
Since 2020, the “electricity distribution” rate on BGE bills, which is the cost of delivering power via transmission infrastructure, has increased 30%. Since 2010, the rate has been twice the rate of inflation, according to the Office of People’s Counsel.
Recently, headlines have focused on the supply and demand imbalance, largely fueled by data centers, that has led to skyrocketing auction clearing prices at PJM, the regional power grid operator. But those increases only started hitting customer bills this summer and fall — earlier bill increases came largely from higher distribution rates, Lapp said.
“They [Exelon] want to shift attention away from their high distribution rates that are really driving a lot of the affordability issues we have in Maryland,” Lapp said.
McClure argues that the “supply” charges — fueled in part by PJM’s auction but also by some transmission costs — make up a larger share of customer’s bills than distribution costs.
“You look at the breakout of the bills now, you still see the supply cost is the higher portion of the bill versus distribution. And if we do nothing now, the supply costs will continue to rise,” McClure said.
A battle over ‘institutional knowledge’
To be sure, supply and demand forces are creating more and more problems for customer bills in PJM’s territory. But Lapp says that’s in large part due to sky-high projections for the amount of energy that data centers will use. And most of those energy gobbling facilities won’t be in Maryland.
“Why should Maryland utility customers be on the hook for building generation to supply data centers … most of which are outside of Maryland?” he asked.
Constellation Energy — which owns power facilities across the country, including Maryland’s Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant and the Conowingo Dam — has its own gripes. Constellation was once a subsidiary of Exelon, though it operated separately as a power producer on the competitive market. But in 2022, it was spun off from Exelon, becoming a separate entity.

Mason Emnett, senior vice president for public policy at Constellation, argued that Exelon doesn’t have the experience necessary to navigate the challenges of siting and then building a large facility in Maryland, from community pushback to supply chain delays associated with gas turbines.
“The utilities are going to have to solve all of these same problems, but they don’t have the supply chains. They don’t have the internal people and expertise. They haven’t operated power plants in over a decade — more than that,” Emnett said.
McClure pushed back, arguing that Exelon, at its core, is an “infrastructure company” focused on maintaining reliable equipment. Constructing and operating a power plant is in the same vein, she said.
“We have institutional knowledge regarding regulated generation,” she said. “We’re also poised to be able to work with some of the top developers throughout the country to be able to build generating plants, as well. So we feel very confident that we have the right expertise.”
Technically, Maryland law actually allows the PSC, which regulates power projects, to direct utilities to construct generating stations if the need arises. But Nick Alexopulos, a spokesman for BG&E, said the company is looking for a more ironclad statute, with “legislative guidance on key issues — such as the form or type of generation, how the output may be offered, and the framework for cost recovery.”
How dire are the grid challenges?
A few Maryland legislators, including Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) backed a bill last legislative session that would have removed the requirement for the PSC to authorize utility-owned generation, in an effort to expressly allow the practice. West was joined by two Democrats, Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) and Sen. Ron Watson (D- Prince George’s).
West said he was alarmed by predictions from the regional grid operator, PJM Interconnection, that power challenges could begin as soon as 2027, when periods of peak demand — like hot summer days — could result in a choked grid, and therefore isolated power shut-offs.
“I think the ratepayers would rather pay more money than all of the sudden go dark,” West said.
Analysts have differing opinions about how dire the reliability situation is in Maryland. Lapp, whose office studies PJM’s proposals for affordability concerns, said he believes that transmission projects already in the pipeline will largely alleviate the stress to Maryland’s portion of the grid. That includes a line under construction to accommodate the retirement of the Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant in Anne Arundel County,
Lapp contends that while the PJM grid may need more energy generation to keep up with data centers, there isn’t exactly a need to produce that power inside Maryland’s borders.
“We’ve been importing more energy than we use for decades and decades — and there’s a reason why we import,” Lapp said. “It’s economic. It’s cheaper to import electricity, because it can be cheaper to generate it — to put power plants — in other states.”
Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery), who also opposes Exelon’s push, said she feels Exelon is raising the volume on worries about an electricity crisis, “with the hope that everyone throws their hands up and says: ‘OK, Exelon, go ahead and build generation.’ “",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC09550-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 07:16:59.300243

The organization is accepting letters of interest from those wanting to use its original historic headquarters while also pursuing a FEMA buyout program.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hardwick community nonprofit moving ‘living room on Main Street’ across the road.","Hardwick’s community-building organization The Civic Standard has spent the better part of the past year weighing what to do with its dilapidated headquarters in the oldest building on Main Street. The group has enlisted experts to assess its structure, applied for funding and solicited input from anyone and in any way they could.
In the end, the answer turned out to be right across the street.
In early September, the three-year-old nonprofit, which specializes in “grand and tiny experiments in getting together,” purchased a three-story building at 39 S. Main St. The structure, built in the 1920s, was most recently a flower shop put on the market because the owner needed to move closer to their family, the business owner said in a social media post. Prior, the space had a long life as a grocery store.

The new building not only meets the Civic’s needs, “but allows us the space to dream far beyond them,” the nonprofit wrote in a newsletter announcing the purchase. “We imagine family-style meals at long dining tables, more accessible live music performances, an upstairs café run by local teenagers after school, a year-round costume library, ample studio space for the creation of new shows, and on goes the list of dreams.”
Civic co-founder and Executive Director Rose Friedman said earlier this month that it feels like a big leap for the young organization to make mortgage payments (the building cost $352,000). However, she noted that the community support for the Civic has “made it really clear that there is widespread valuing of what we offer, which is a pretty simple mission to get people together, often with this commitment to low-barrier, accessible programming for all the kinds of people in our community.”
Historically, the organization’s work has included everything from “Hardwick State,” a townwide, weekend-long free pop-up university, to game nights and facilitating the creation of a local skate park. The group also produces theater performances by, for and about Hardwick. This past weekend, the Civic wrapped up five sold-out performances of an “immersive soap opera” which explored the “unspoken tensions” that exist in town through a fictional wedding between a young woman who grew up in Hardwick and a young man from Connecticut who grew up summering on Lake Caspian.
The growing nonprofit, which has received state and national publicity and acclaim for its innovative work in rural community revitalization, took up residence in the then-vacant, longtime Hardwick Gazette building in the spring of 2022 and made it into a “living room on Main Street.” That building was eventually donated to them.

“It was very much not at all suited to any of our needs, but it had the location,” Friedman told VTDigger in March. “In my mind, we took something that wasn’t being used and we tried to get it useful again, both for our purposes and to serve the community’s needs.”
The building slopes wildly toward the Lamoille River and needs, at the very least, its foundation stabilized, exterior painted and roof replaced just to retain insurance. It is also the only building in downtown Hardwick located in the designated floodway, Friedman said, which makes work significantly more complicated and expensive.
When the Civic’s board was facing that “first layer of repairs” this past winter, it started contemplating whether patching up the building was the right move, or if it might cause its mission to drift into the “can of worms” that is preserving an old building, Friedman said.
Then, “literally, within that month,” she said, “the ‘for sale’ sign went up right across the street” at the flower shop.

As Friedman explained, there are not a lot of buildings in town that fit the Civic’s needs. Many have the same structural issues that tend to come with old buildings, and most others are small storefronts that lack space or a commercial kitchen — the key for the Civic’s popular free weekly community suppers. The former flower shop, however, checked the boxes, with more than double the space on the ground floor. 
Friedman and the Civic spent this year pursuing all of the options at once, furthering the building purchase, as well as repair assessments, while continuing the public conversation about what the Civic should do. The organization wrote newsletters soliciting feedback, held public meetings and had “countless conversations with all kinds of neighbors and local experts, from appraisers, to river scientists, to the kids who regularly stop by for popsicles,” said the newsletter about the decision.
“Those conversations have been overwhelmingly towards the move; people have been very supportive and very clear that this was the right thing for our organization,” Friedman said.
That support has been financial as well. Around the time the organization closed on its new building, it had raised just over half of the $400,000 goal for its “New Home Fund,” which Friedman said will cover the cost of the building, as well as some minor repairs. Many have also donated items or volunteered their time to paint the place inside and out.

What happens, then, to the building the Civic is moving out of at 42 S. Main St.?
“Most people have felt a ‘it’ll be what it’s supposed to be,’ kind of thing,” Friedman said. “It’s a beautiful historic building and it’s important to the downtown landscape — and also it might be that the landscape around it has changed enough to make it difficult to be worth saving.”
Earlier this month, the Civic put out a call for letters of interest from anyone who wants to “maintain the building as a cultural and community asset to Hardwick” on a temporary or permanent basis.
Friedman said the organization is open to all kinds of projects that could utilize the building. According to rough assessments — shared on the Civic’s website — the three base repairs that need to be completed to maintain insurance coverage would cost around $140,000.
While the Civic is stepping away from doing that repair work itself, it’s also not condemning the space, Friedman said.
“This doesn’t have to be our decision alone,” she said. “We’ve made the decision that we are not going to save it, that that’s not going to be part of our mission. But that doesn’t mean that somebody else can’t.”
The Civic is accepting letters until Dec. 1, which is also around when the organization hopes to start hosting public events in its new building. If a new owner for the oldest building on Main Street is not found, another option could come into play.
In late February, the Civic entered the structure into the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s buyout program, which would cover the costs of demolishing the structure and returning the property to green space and the floodplain. The organization can back out of the program any time and the current timeline gives them about two years to make a decision.
“We’re just trying to get it either into the next set of hands that’s going to care for it, or into its next life,” Friedman said.
For Friedman, the most meaningful part of the move is that the Civic will continue to hold a position in the heart of town instead of being relegated to an out-of-the-way space, she said.
The “place where you can gather and meet people that you wouldn’t otherwise run into” can be kept “front and center and, say, as important as having a grocery store and a bookstore and a coffeeshop and the places to eat and the places that you need to buy the things you need,” she said.

As the rollout has progressed, a number of sportsbooks have already been jockeying for positioning in the market and will continue to do so up to and past the launch date.
That means prospective gamblers will be able to choose between a variety of sportsbooks that offer different experiences and promotions. Currently, there are nine that have received temporary licenses to offer mobile betting:
• Circa Sports.
• DraftKings.
• FanDuel.
• ESPN BET.
• BetMGM.
• Bet365.
• Caesars Sportsbook.
• Fanatics.
• Underdog.
Customers will be able to start signing up with different sportsbooks beginning Nov. 17, which is also the date the books can start hooking them up with preregistration promotions.
Despite comments from Missouri Gaming Commission chair Jan Zimmerman, Missourians living anywhere in the state can sign up for and bet with any of the nine books.
Here are some common questions you might have when choosing a sportsbook and starting the sports gambling process. To begin, we’ll discuss how we got to this point and then some common numbers and terms you’ll see when placing your first bets.
 How did we get here?

Since a law banning sports gambling in states other than Nevada was struck down in 2018, states slowly began creating policies to legalize it. Missouri was late to the party, becoming the 41st state to legalize it when Amendment 2 was passed in November 2024.
When Kansas passed a bill allowing sports gambling in 2022, it became visibly clear on what market Missouri was missing out. Since then, drivers from Missouri can be seen stopping on off ramps after crossing over the border to place bets.
Pro sports franchises were also growing impatient because they were missing out on an extra revenue stream and a valuable way to target younger demographics. So, a few sports teams, including the Cardinals, with the help of national gambling companies, were able to rally to get the measure onto the November ballot.
After a close vote, it passed. What resulted was a turbulent process of figuring out when the betting would actually begin.
At first, the Missouri Gaming Commission hoped to set up emergency rules to make sports gambling fully functional by March 4, in time for Missourians to bet on March Madness. However, the attempt was nixed by Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who argued there wasn’t an emergency requiring hastened legalization.
That’s where we stand today. A deliberate application process has led to nine sportsbooks and various casinos gearing up for the launch … and bettors patiently waiting to bet on their favorite players and teams.
 What do all of these different types of bets mean?

The most common bets to place are moneyline bets, spread bets and over/under bets.
Moneyline bets are straightforward: You are betting on which team or player will win a game or event.
When you place a moneyline bet, you will see odds that either start with a plus or minus. For example, if the Chiefs are playing the Broncos and the Chiefs are -150, that means they are favorites. In this case, a $150 bet will win you $100 (you get the original $150 back). On the other side of the bet, the Broncos would be underdogs, let’s say at +125, which means that a bet of $100 would win you $125 (plus the original bet).
For bigger or smaller wagers, payouts scale according to the odds. Going back to the Chiefs’ -150 odds, a $15 bet would win $10 and a $450 bet would win $300.
Spread bets operate a little differently. They use a point margin, where the favorite must win by more than the listed number while the underdog can lose by that many points and still cover. For example, if the Chiefs are -3.5 (- implies the favorite) versus the Broncos, KC must win by 4 or more to cash and Denver covers if it loses by 3 points or fewer or if it wins.
Usually, both sides of spread bets feature similar odds, which are normally close to -110 (again, meaning a $110 wager would win $100).
Finally, over/under bets are gambles on whether or not the combined score of a game will be higher or lower than a predetermined amount. In the Chiefs-Broncos contest, let’s say the over/under line is 50.5, and the final score is 30-27. The total would then be 57 (30+27), and the over would win. If the total ends up lower than 50.5, under bettors would rejoice.
Similar to spread bets, the odds on both over and under bets are generally similar and centered around -110.
You may also come across the term “parlay.” This is just a group of bets combined into one that must all win in order for the wager to pay out.
 What are the differences between all of these sportsbooks?

Not all of the nine mobile sportsbooks are created equal. Some focus on catering to customers who are likely to place larger wagers, others feature high-value promotions designed to attract a huge user base, and a handful more are known for a fantasy-sports-driven interface.
• Circa Sports primarily markets itself as a sportsbook for the big guns and high riders. It’s known for its tight moneyline spreads and allowing experienced bettors, or “sharps,” to place large wagers.
• DraftKings and FanDuel, for most intents and purposes, are identical. These two books are by far the biggest players in the nationwide sports betting market, and both offer large promotions in hopes of getting new users to sign up. In total, these two behemoths make up almost 80% of the market, according to Reuters.
• Both books also offer tons of bet types, frequent promotions such as odds boosts and market themselves toward everyday bettors.
• Caesars and Fanatics operate on more of a loyalty platform than others. Sports Illustrated publishes sportsbook reviews and says Caesars has the best rewards program, which includes credits that can be redeemed for stays at some of its hotels. Fanatics, similarly, offers users digital FanCash with every bet, which can be turned into tickets, bonus bets and more.
• Underdog started solely as a daily fantasy sports site but has moved into the traditional sports gambling world as well. It is known for its fantasy draft games like best ball and parlay-style pick ’em.
The rest of the bunch are similar. BetMGM and Bet365 are especially known for the amount of sports that are available to bet on, so if you’re looking for a book to place a wager on Russian pingpong, those might be your best bets.
 What if I want to sports-bet in person?

Good news! Along with the nine mobile licenses that have been approved, the Missouri Gaming Commission also granted eight brick-and-mortar casinos retail licenses to operate onsite sportsbooks.
Those are:
• Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City — Partnered with Fanatics Sportsbook.
• Ameristar Casino Resort and Spa St. Charles — Fanatics Sportsbook.
• Harrah’s Kansas City — Caesars Sportsbook.
• Horseshoe St. Louis — Caesars Sportsbook.
• Hollywood Casino & Hotel in St. Louis — ESPN BET.
• River City Casino & Hotel in St. Louis — ESPN BET.
• Argosy Casino & Hotel in Kansas City — ESPN BET.
• Century Casino & Hotel in Cape Girardeau — BetMGM.
These casinos will open sportsbooks Dec. 1, the same time mobile books will be allowed to begin collecting bets.
What promotions are available, and are there any restrictions?
While companies aren’t allowed to directly offer promotions to draw in Missouri customers until Nov. 17, there are sites that offer projections into what those may be when Nov. 17 comes around. Legal Sports Report is one of them, and here are the offers it thinks customers will be able to grab:
• DraftKings and FanDuel: Bet $5, get $300 in bonus bets on launch.
• Caesars: Bet $1, Double Your Money 20x.
• BetMGM: Up To $1,500 First-Bet Bonus.
• Fanatics: Up To $2,000 in No-Sweat Bets OR Choose Your Offer.
• Bet365: Bet $5 To Get $200 OR Up to $1,000 First Bet Safety Net.
• BetRivers (not yet licensed in Missouri): Second-Chance Bet Up To $500.
Since Circa Sports is geared toward those “sharp” bettors, it will likely not offer significant promotions.
What’s important to realize about all these deals is how the refunds or bonus bets are credited. They come as site credit that must be wagered again before you can withdraw. For example, with DraftKings’ offer, you’d need to place (and win) another bet with the $300 credit to cash out.
The only notable restriction is that bettors can’t place player-specific prop bets on college games involving Missouri schools. Betting on Missouri-specific team outcomes is still legal. Also, you cannot bet on high school games.
 Where can I get problem gambling help?

There are resources available if you are struggling with problems related to gambling. Missouri’s problem gambling helpline is 888-BETS-OFF, or 888-238-7633, and is open 24/7.
The Missouri Department of Mental Health also provides a list of certified gambling treatment counselors for those struggling or worried about someone who is. However, experts worry these counselors might not be aptly trained to deal with the fast-acting consequences that come from having access to a mobile casino at all times.
Amendment 2 also specified that per year, the greater of $5 million or up to 10% of sports betting tax revenues will go toward Missouri’s compulsive gambling fund, which intends to provide resources for troubled gamblers.

They surely are.
This shutdown, however, is the result of a deeper more dangerous problem.
What are local legislators doing to represent, promote and fight for policies and funding that will directly impact the people they are supposed to be working for?
Nearly 650,000 Missourians will be unable to purchase needed food because money is running out for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, because of the shutdown — and very little is being done to resume and sustain the necessary funding.
Gov. Mike Kehoe has indicated he would provide food-aid funding of $10.6 million for seniors and $5 million to food banks. That is just a partial stop-gap measure for a short period of time.
What about Missouri’s low-income families and people with disabilities who also receive SNAP benefits?
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley is working on a bill to fund SNAP benefits, and while 10 other Republican senators have signed on, the Senate leader has not. The bill may not even be brought to the Senate floor for a vote. The U.S. House is not in session, so its passage is very uncertain.
Are the governor and our state and Congressional legislators urging the president and Congress to get back to their jobs and find a lasting solution? Would you be allowed to just not show up for work for weeks and expect to receive back pay when the job you have been hired to do goes undone?
That is exactly the case with members of Congress.
Over 42 million Americans receiving SNAP benefits and are now at risk for dealing with serious food shortages for an indeterminate period of time. The president and members of Congress have put their personal and partisan policy priorities ahead of the needs of the people who elected them.
The impending food shortage is not the only crisis legislators — initiated or allowed — that many Missourians and fellow citizens in other states will face or continue to endure.
There are millions of governmental workers who have either been abruptly furloughed, unceremoniously fired, or working without pay — because of DOGE and as a result of the shutdown.
There are the other factors that are being put on the backs of hard-working Missourians and Americans: higher food prices and other consumer goods; impending higher unaffordable healthcare premiums, even total loss of health insurance coverage for some.
What are our state legislators doing to address these very important issues?
Then there is the unpredictability of tariffs roulette being played. Missouri is one of the top 10 states that produce soybeans. The tariffs have significantly put markets that they have relied on at risk. In the 23/24 growth season, Missouri farmers planted 5.6 million acres of soybeans at a total value of $3.36 billion.
Have the governor, state lawmakers and members of Congress been informing the Trump administration of the potential harm punitive tariffs will have on the livelihood of Missouri farmers and their families?
The Trump administration recently announced that an agreement on tariffs has been reached and China will resume buying soybeans. One looming question: Given the back and forth, on and off agreements, how binding and how long will this one last? Meanwhile China has reached agreements and has bought major quantities of soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. Where does that really leave U.S. soybean farmers?
What about the administration’s announcement — following giving Argentina a $20 billion financial bailout — that the U.S would be purchasing beef from Argentina to reduce current beef prices for U.S. consumers, which is higher than it has been in five years. That will have a negative impact on cattle farmers in our state and other states.
The Trump administration is considering a $10-14 Billion bailout for farmers. But that is a partial temporary fix. Many questions loom around this promise, including where will the money come from, who will it go to, or even will the bailout occur at all?
What legislators — state and federal — are fighting to remedy the plight of Missouri’s and the nation’s farmers?
With state and congressional legislators on the sidelines, entering the rings only to fight for someone else’s goals and priorities, we can expect that our needs will not only be left unaddressed, but allowed to get worse.
What would a performance evaluation of legislators reveal about how they are half or not doing their jobs as we continue to pay their salaries? Take a little time and think about the impact of legislative actions or inactions.
There are many important areas that the questions below can be applied.
What legislation in your recent memory has passed that was good, and for whom?
Who was or is being hurt, ignored, left behind?
What actions have made things worse, how, and for whom?
What is critically needed, but is being totally ignored?
Do you have any idea of what your legislators are doing right now?
Basically, are they upholding the oath of office and carrying out the duties and responsibilities as required?
After you have completed your assessment, do you like the performance report you see?
More importantly, if you accept it, why?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/54507629937_b65c7c9863_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 06:56:41.992957

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Unemployed Wisconsinites could lose a week’s jobless benefits if they don’t show up for an interview if a new draft bill becomes law.
The same measure would also turn up the scrutiny on the weekly work searches that people who’ve lost a job must undertake to collect unemployment insurance.
Gov. Tony Evers has repeatedly vetoed bills authored by Republicans in the Legislature that contain those and other changes to Wisconsin’s unemployment compensation system.
In his veto messages, Evers, a Democrat, has consistently criticized GOP lawmakers for trying to change the rules on jobless pay without working through Wisconsin’s joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council.
This time, however, the proposals have come from the advisory council itself.
On Sept. 24, the council voted to advance a bill that was endorsed by both its labor and management members. Despite that unanimous backing, some worker advocates are condemning the draft legislation.
“This is a terrible, terrible bill,” said lawyer Victor Forberger, whose practice focuses on representing people whose claims for unemployment compensation have been rejected by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.

State Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), the ranking Democrat on the Assembly’s labor committee, has repeatedly scolded Republican lawmakers for proposing unemployment insurance changes without going through the advisory council.
But after reading the advisory council’s draft legislation, Sinicki said, “I will not be voting for the bill, and we will probably offer an amendment to it.”
Shane Griesbach, a union official who chairs the council’s labor caucus, defends the council proposal, highlighting that it includes an increase in the maximum weekly unemployment benefit for the first time in more than a decade.
“It was a compromise between both labor and management on various issues,” Griesbach told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The draft bill has not yet been formally introduced in the Legislature. On Tuesday, Oct. 28, members of the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor, and Integrated Employment were told by email to hold their calendars open for a hearing on Nov. 13.
Labor-management negotiations
From the launch of Wisconsin’s unemployment compensation system in 1932 — the first of its kind in the country — the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council has been a standing feature, intended to reflect the interests of both sides.
Laura Dresser, courtesy University of Wisconsin
“The Wisconsin UI advisory council — with five representatives each from labor and management — was designed to balance the needs of workers and employers in unemployment insurance policy,” said Laura Dresser, associate director of the High Road Strategy Center, a think tank at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that focuses on the impact of economic policy and trends on working people.
“It is a good idea, and part of the Wisconsin Idea, to build this sort of policy infrastructure around the people who rely on and fund the system,” Dresser said. “But if either labor or management thinks they can get a better deal from the Legislature than the advisory council, that undermines the policy-making power of the council itself.” 
Among the controversial provisions of the draft bill is a disability pay penalty.
Under the typical protocol for bills that come from the advisory council, Sinicki, as the ranking minority party member of the labor committee would be listed as a coauthor of the legislation.
But Sinicki objects to the bill’s proposed penalty for people with unemployment claims who receive federal disability payments. If that doesn’t change, “I will not put my name on the bill,” Sinicki said
Since 2013, people laid off from work have been denied unemployment compensation if they also received Social Security Disability Income. This summer, a federal judge ended that ban, and the advisory council’s draft bill removes the ban as well.
But the draft bill also includes an “offset” that would claw back money from the SSDI recipient’s jobless pay each week. Over the course of one month, the amount clawed back would equal 50% of the recipient’s monthly disability check.
Earlier this year, DWD proposed to the advisory council ending the SSDI jobless pay ban but deducting 100% of federal disability income.
In September, Sinicki and state Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) introduced their own bill to repeal the SSDI unemployment pay ban and criticized DWD’s offset recommendation. Nine days later, the department told the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council it was dropping the offset proposal entirely and simply recommending an end to the SSDI jobless pay ban.  
The advisory council brought back the offset, however, at 50% rather than 100% of the federal disability income, in the draft bill approved Sept. 24.
Forberger said that at either 100% or 50%, requiring an offset against disability income is likely to wipe out jobless pay for many SSDI recipients.
Resurrecting vetoed changes
Other provisions in the advisory council draft have previously passed the state Legislature with only Republican votes, and then been vetoed by Evers.
‘Ghosting’ interviews: Unemployment insurance recipients accused of “ghosting” a scheduled job interview — failing to show up — would lose their weekly jobless pay for that week. A recipient would also lose benefits for a week for declining a job offer or failing to report on the first scheduled work day after being offered a job.
Victor Forberger
Republican lawmakers this year passed legislation that also would penalize “ghosting” interviews and rejecting job offers. No Democrats voted for the legislation, and Evers vetoed the bill, AB 169, on Friday. 
“I object to creating additional barriers for individuals applying for and receiving benefits from a program that is designed to support people and families experiencing economic hardship, as well as creating additional mandates for the department in administering these benefits,” Evers wrote in his veto message.
Forberger said the ghosting penalties — which have been introduced and vetoed in past years as well — are unneeded, with unemployment insurance claims remaining at close to record lows.
“We’ve still got a huge worker shortage in the state,” Forberger said. “This does absolutely nothing.”
Work search audit quotas: Another provision in the advisory council bill would require DWD to audit the work searches of half of all people making unemployment claims.
Evers vetoed a bill in 2023 that included the work search audit requirement.
“I object to this bill because the department already has substantial eligibility requirements and fraud prevention mechanisms in place to protect the unemployment system from potentially fraudulent activity,” Evers wrote at the time.
In response to a Wisconsin Examiner inquiry, DWD Communications Director Haley McCoy said via email that the department’s unemployment insurance division “has a well-established work search auditing program.” People making unemployment insurance claims must report their required work searches each week, which are subject “to random or targeted audits,” McCoy said.
McCoy declined to specify the department’s current audit frequency, calling that information “sensitive” and confidential “to protect program integrity.”
Identity proofing requirements: The advisory council bill includes new requirements for unemployment insurance applicants to prove their identities, and would require DWD to follow specific steps, including comparing applications for jobless pay against databases tracking death records, employment records, citizenship and immigration records.
On Friday Evers vetoed AB 168, which included similar identity proofing requirements.
“The department already implements comprehensive fraud prevention strategies, including identity verification, making the proposal to mandate identity proofing both unnecessary and overly burdensome of claimants,” Evers wrote in his veto message.
A benefit increase
The advisory council bill includes a one-time $25 increase in the maximum weekly payment that goes to jobless workers: to $395 a week starting in 2026, from $370 a week.
Screenshot of the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development unemployment insurance home page.
The last time unemployment has seen an increase in the weekly benefit rate was 2013,” said Griesbach, the council’s labor caucus chair.
Griesbach said that benefit increase, the unemployment insurance clawback for disability pay, the “ghosting’ penalty and the work search audit requirements were all products of the advisory council’s consensus process.
“All those things were part of an agreed-upon bill between labor and management and negotiation and compromise by both groups,” Griesbach told the Wisconsin Examiner. “It was an agreed-upon bill, and there were a lot of different topics that were discussed, and that was the compromise that was reached.”
Forberger said the proposed benefit increase keeps Wisconsin’s top unemployment benefit well below other Midwestern states.
In Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois, the maximum weekly benefit is at least $500 a week or more. Only Indiana, with a maximum benefit of $390 a week, would be lower, he said.
“This is a paltry increase,” Forberger said of the Wisconsin proposal. “It’s nothing to brag about.”
The advisory council bill’s increase is also less than DWD had recommended in its proposals to the council. The department proposed raising the maximum weekly  benefit by $127 in 2026, to $497, and then indexing the maximum to the consumer price index in 2027.
Sinicki acknowledged that by giving new life to Republican-authored unemployment insurance bills that she’s sharply criticized in the past, the advisory council’s bill has put her in a difficult position.
The ghosting penalty, for example, is an “attempt to throw more people off of unemployment insurance,” Sinicki said. She also voiced skepticism of increasing work search audits without funding more staff positions.
But the disability penalty, she said, is more than she would be willing to support.
“This puts me in a very tough spot, and also puts a lot of Democrats in a very tough spot,” Sinicki said. “As a Democrat, I cannot vote to take away benefits from disabled people.”

Several states have passed new laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Criminals have discovered a new way to steal millions from older Americans — and Indiana lawmakers have the power to stop it.
Cryptocurrency ATMs, often called “crypto kiosks,” are popping up in convenience stores, gas stations, and retail locations across the country. These machines allow users to conduct legitimate cryptocurrency transactions, but their lack of regulation compared to traditional financial institutions has made them a prime target for fraud.
Consumers in 2024 reported losing a total of $246.7 million via crypto ATMs — a 31% increase from 2023, according to the FBI. Among the crimes where the victim’s age was known, 86% of the losses occurred among Americans over 60. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg — many victims never report being scammed.
These crimes often start with a phone call or text message claiming an urgent financial matter. Victims are instructed to withdraw large sums of cash from their bank account — sometimes tens of thousands of dollars — and deposit it into a cryptocurrency kiosk. Once the money is transferred, it’s usually gone for good.
There are more than 20,000 cryptocurrency ATMs across the United States, and Indiana is no exception, with hundreds across the state. This means that, due to the lack of consumer protections, Hoosiers are left vulnerable. That’s why AARP Indiana is fighting to save older Hoosiers from losing their savings to criminals.
Citing potential for fraud, blue and red states pass new crypto ATM laws

During next year’s legislative session, Indiana lawmakers have an opportunity to act. Seventeen other states have enacted legislation, and cities are also taking steps to protect consumers. For example, Evansville recently passed an ordinance after law enforcement saw a steady increase in fraud cases connected to crypto ATMs.
Older Hoosiers—and frankly, all consumers — deserve stronger safeguards against this type of fraud. States like Arkansas, Iowa and Nebraska, and cities like Evansville have already set the standard with commonsense protections: clear fraud warnings, upfront customer service contact information, and refunds for outrageous fees tied to fraudulent transactions.
These measures work, but that’s not enough. There should be daily transaction limits, and consumers need receipts with detailed information to help them and law enforcement track suspicious activity. We also need direct communication channels between ATM operators and law enforcement — because when fraud happens, time matters. And for operators who ignore these rules? Serious penalties should apply.
Regardless of where they live in the state, Hoosiers should have peace of mind knowing their hard-earned money is secure. No one should have to worry about being tricked into handing over their retirement funds to a scammer hiding behind a screen. These criminals can be remarkably clever, often manipulating even the most knowledgeable individuals.
These dangerous loopholes can be addressed by state leaders, and with thoughtful collaboration, we can ensure all Hoosiers — especially older adults — are protected from fraud and confident their savings will stay where they belong. AARP Indiana is ready to help make that future a reality.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung)With the ongoing federal government shutdown now threatening to disrupt food assistance, Americans are finally learning why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is as critical as Social Security, Medicare, and other so-called entitlement programs.
Food banks and food shelves have long championed SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, as the nation’s largest and most-effective hunger relief program. An entire wall in our 230,000 square foot warehouse is dedicated to showcasing the program’s scale (for every meal a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine), and impact (every $1 in SNAP spending generates $1.50 in local economic activity). It’s often the first stop on tours of our food bank.
SNAP helps 42 million Americans — and more than 440,000 Minnesotans — afford groceries. In an average month, SNAP pays out $72 million in benefits in Minnesota alone — money which is spent at grocery stores and food retailers, accounting for roughly 12% of total retail revenue, according to the National Grocers Association. 
Over half of SNAP participants are either seniors or children, and fewer than 5% of SNAP participants are able-bodied adults without children. 
In Minnesota, half of all SNAP participants live outside of the Twin Cities metro area.
These facts were well known within the hunger-relief community, but due to the federal government shutdown and the prospect that, for the first time in history, SNAP benefits will not be paid out, they are now becoming known to the broader public. It’s about time.
As the cost of food has increased, especially over the past five years, fewer and fewer people are able to afford it, which is where SNAP comes in. SNAP provides critical, temporary food assistance that gives people time to get back on their feet without worrying about where their next meal will come from. 
Unfortunately, the program is under threat and anxiety is rising.
President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July Fourth. The law includes the largest-ever cuts to SNAP, totaling nearly $200 billion over the next ten years — roughly 20%. These cuts were achieved in large part by shifting the cost burden for this federal program onto states and counties, many of which have already announced property tax hikes in response — further exacerbating the ongoing affordability crisis. The bill also eliminates or reduces benefits for many older Americans, veterans, parents, eligible immigrants and unhoused people. 
Feeding America estimates that the cuts to SNAP in the OBBBA will lead to a loss of about 6 billion meals every year going forward. To put that in context, the entire Feeding America network of 200+ food banks —which includes Second Harvest Heartland, the nation’s second-largest food bank — distributed the equivalent of 6.5 billion meals last year. This alone would have further strained our system to the breaking point, creating a dramatic increase in food insecurity here and around the country. Fast forward a few months, and things are even worse.
When the federal government shut down on October 1, food banks and food shelves were not immediately impacted. The Trump administration’s decision to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children kept a lid on food insecurity. Hope was high that a bipartisan compromise would be found before the real pain of an extended shutdown set in. 
That hope quickly turned to despair.
After initially indicating that SNAP benefits would continue largely uninterrupted, as has been the case in every previous federal government shutdown, the USDA sent a letter to states on October 10 advising that they would not pay out benefits in November. In response, 25 states, including Minnesota, sued the USDA, arguing that they were required by law to use the $5 billion in contingency funding appropriated by Congress. On October 31, two federal judges ruled in separate decisions that the USDA must release those funds, but as of this writing, it is unclear whether they will comply— and how quickly funds could be released if they do.
The impact of even a temporary delay cannot be understated. 
No one is getting wealthy off SNAP; the program provides an average of less than $6 per person per day in Minnesota, for a total monthly benefit shy of $180. But when times are tight and you are deciding between food and utilities or rent, that extra help is a lifesaver. Without it, there is nowhere to turn but your local food shelf — and food shelves simply cannot do more with less. 
With all the attention on SNAP, our hope is that political leaders — including those who voted to cut the program but are now singing its praises — will rally in bipartisan fashion to not only ensure it is fully funded during the shutdown but that it is strengthened and expanded into the future.
After all, hunger does not discriminate by party, and everyone needs to eat.
Congress can and should do more to make sure everyone can afford to.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/usdafood-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-11-03 10:16:37.110314

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma lawmakers’ obsession with over-regulating our state’s health care industry is destroying it.
Thanks to their burdensome efforts thus far, we’re officially a top 5 worst state for health care.
We can’t get doctors to work here. We can’t get aspiring physicians to train here because we don’t have enough residency slots. We have a shortage of nurses and other critical health care workers. Patients can’t easily access what should be routine procedures. And we’re one of the least healthy states in the nation.
Yet Oklahoma lawmakers from both parties champion needless regulatory legislation under the guise of “fixing” things. The legislation does nothing more than make them feel good about themselves when they’re actually failing to address their underlying role in this entire debacle.
For instance, over the weekend, two unnecessary pieces of over-regulatory state laws took effect. 
The first creates a patient bill of rights, which sounds empowering for everyday people. What it really does, though, is add yet another layer of bureaucracy to health care providers by codifying into Oklahoma law protections that we already have under federal law — such as the ability to keep our health information private, to complain about our care, and the power to decide whether we receive treatment.
It took supporters of this measure five years to find a legislative body gullible enough to pass it.  Even Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt refused to sign it. He let it take effect without his signature, his polite way of signaling that he didn’t think this would move our state forward in a positive direction.
The second, inspired by already existing federal code, requires hospitals to spend time providing unhelpful raw prices for at least 300 procedures. (Oklahoma hospitals already do that because of the previously mentioned federal law.)
But unlike federal law that limits policing of pricing transparency to a qualified regulatory body, lawmakers in their stupidity decided to let Oklahoma hospital patients act as an enforcer.
They want patients to sue hospitals that they don’t believe are being transparent about their prices. If a patient wins, they can get their entire bill waived, even if it means the hospital is on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in care.
If a hospital loses hundreds of thousands in revenue, know who will have to foot that bill? We all will pay in some way. Hospitals don’t have the luxury of providing free medical care because they have employees to pay and costs to keep life support running 24-7.
Many of our hospitals, meanwhile, are on life support themselves.
Over the past decade, the Oklahoma Hospital Association reports that nine hospitals have closed across our state. And still more hospitals are reportedly facing financial challenges and struggling to keep their doors open.
Meanwhile, our legislators are encouraging patients to sue, which will also overload our court systems with frivolous claims and allow people to avoid paying for care they received based on a technicality?
No wonder we have a shortage of doctors, nurses and other health care workers and hospitals that can’t keep their lights on.
Who in their right mind could want to operate in a regulatory environment like that?
I don’t know why I would ever need to know the raw price for a medical procedure or the negotiated contract rates of private insurers. I do know that I don’t have enough free time to comb through complicated medical pricing information or drive two-plus hours to save a few bucks on a mammogram.
When I needed a mammogram last time, it took me months just to get access to one at a hospital. That’s a bigger problem.
The Cicero Institute, a nonpartisan public policy organization, reported in February that 75 of our 77 counties are now “health professional shortage areas,” a classification where there are at least 3,500 patients per provider.
Nearly 1 in 3 Oklahoma doctors are at or near retirement age.
We’re top 5 worst in total physician supply, primary physicians and general surgeons.
Meanwhile, we’re expected to be short 451 primary care providers at a time where there are only 195 residency slots. That’s important because residents often choose to practice in the state where they’re trained — as long as it has welcoming policies and not overburdensome regulations. 
And don’t forget our legislators in recent years also passed a law that could see medical providers prosecuted as criminals and locked up for years for performing an abortion to save the life of a mother. They also banned gender-affirming care for adolescents. That certainly is not helping with recruitment and retention either.
But it’s easier to pass laws that pander and over-regulate than to do the heavy lifting that actually moves the needle and addresses the real challenges facing patients, health care workers and hospitals.
Ultimately it’s going to require having an elected body that vows to keep their grubby paws off our health care systems unless they’re willing to spend the needed money to transform it.
And we’ll need a governing body that actually practices what it preaches when it comes to less government interference.

Cuts are coming in next year’s legislative session, but where and how deep remains to be seen. 
The post Wyoming Freedom Caucus wants to cut state budget, but won’t say how much yet appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers are determined to shrink the state’s budget in the 2026 legislative session, but where and how deep they will cut remains to be seen. 
“We’re going to do everything we can to limit the growth of government, so it does not outpace your paychecks,” House Appropriations Chairman Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, said Friday at a press conference in the Capitol rotunda.
Bear, a Freedom Caucus member who previously chaired the group of Republicans, said they are “setting some targets” and have their eye on pre-pandemic spending levels.
“And I’ll just be very general about those targets because we’re going to have to look at a lot of different parts of the budget,” he said. 
In April, the caucus announced it would take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing Wyoming’s budget.”
Those efforts have since included scrutinizing the Wyoming Department of Health’s budget — which accounts for a larger piece of the pie than any other state agency — via a newly formed subcommittee. 
“Wyoming is headed toward an impending fiscal cliff that is caused by what I believe is unsustainable spending,” Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft said in September at the subcommittee’s first of five meetings.

But until this week, lawmakers were working with an incomplete picture of Wyoming’s financial footing. On Thursday morning, state officials presented their latest revenue forecast, also known as the CREG report, to the Joint Appropriations Committee, which provided greater detail. 
While the report reiterated the volatility of Wyoming’s revenue streams, it did not indicate an imminent bust, like that of 2017 or 2021, when lawmakers were forced to make tough decisions. Rather, it announced a budgetary first for the state — Wyoming’s investment portfolio brought in a record $1.86 billion in earnings, surpassing other revenues from the mineral industry. 
Even so, now, while the state isn’t under the gun, is the time to cut spending, Freedom Caucus lawmakers said Thursday. 
“That’s what conservative is,” Pendergraft said. “Conservative means you’re going to live within your means. You’re going to live beneath your means, so that when things turn bad, you don’t have to turn around and find yourself in trouble.”
Many Wyoming residents are already struggling, including those dealing with steep property taxes, as was mentioned at Thursday’s press conference. Meanwhile, the federal government shutdown is shutting out those who rely on SNAP benefits to buy groceries and heating assistance to stay warm in the colder months. 
(Gov. Mark Gordon declared a public welfare emergency Friday ahead of SNAP benefits lapsing over the weekend in order to send emergency funds to charitable organizations and churches.)
While crafting the state’s budget has long been cause for contentious debate, it’s been a particularly fraught endeavor for lawmakers in recent years. In an unprecedented move earlier this year, the Senate refused to pass a supplemental budget. In 2024, the budget passed the upper chamber by just two votes after most Freedom Caucus members and allies voted against it in the House.
Asked how confident he was in the Legislature’s ability to pass a budget in the 2026 session, Bear said, “that’s a legitimate concern.”
“Two things to remember. One is that we have a constitutional responsibility to get that done, and so we really, literally can’t go home until we get that done,” Bear said.

Second, Bear said, “I took the lack of a budget coming out of last session very seriously,” adding that communication breakdowns and subpar negotiations pushed him to improve relationships between the two chambers. 
“So that’s the way I’m handling it on an interpersonal level, but in the end, we really can’t go home until the end,” Bear said. “We really can’t go home until we have a budget for the state of Wyoming, and I wouldn’t want to.”
Response 
A few Appropriations Committee members stuck around the Capitol after their meeting to hear what their colleagues had to say at the press conference. That included Devils Tower Republican Sen. Ogden Driskill, a rival of the caucus. 
Asked what he made of the Freedom Caucus’ commitment to cuts, Driskill said he’d have to wait to hear the specifics. 
“It’s easy to talk about motherhood and apple pie right up to the time that you get to the details. So until we see details, we really don’t know,” Driskill said. “I want efficient government. I want a small government. And if they can find places that we can tighten up, or there’s waste, fraud and abuse, I support them with that.”
However, Driskill said, he has concerns that “they’re going to cut ourselves into a budget crisis.”
In his opening remarks at the press conference, Pendergraft said the job of an appropriator requires one “to take the emotion out of things.”
“I’m very much the opposite,” Laramie Democrat Rep. Trey Sherwood told WyoFile. “The whole reason I ran was to be a public servant for our community. And when I look at our budget, I look at, ‘What does that mean for our hard-working friends and neighbors? What does that mean for our families?’ It’s not just a number on a page.”
Sherwood also pointed to the state’s record-breaking investment earnings as a cause for celebration. 
“It’s such a massive turning point,” she said. 
“Wyoming has set itself up to both weather the boom and bust, but to cover the cost of essential services from investment income,” Sherwood said. “And what does that mean? That means we don’t have to raise taxes.”
The caucus didn’t provide a timeline for releasing its budget plans, while the budget hearings start the first week in December. The session itself begins Feb. 9 in Cheyenne.

Enrollment opened Saturday. Changes in federal policy are anticipated to result in huge annual premium cost spikes, fewer resources and more reporting requirements. 
The post Sticker shock? Wyomingites could see skyrocketing bills on ACA health insurance marketplace appeared first on WyoFile .","When the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where roughly 42,000 Wyoming residents get their health insurance, opened enrollment Saturday, customers likely faced a double whammy: higher prices and fewer resources.  
The landscape looks different this year between federal changes to the marketplace’s administration and the ongoing government shutdown — caused in part by a deadlock over ACA tax credits designed to make insurance cheaper for consumers. 
As things stand, consumers are generally experiencing less help in navigating the system, seeing higher premium costs for plans and facing new reporting requirements. In some cases, people could find their health insurance costs spiking by thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars annually. 
Wyomingites have two months to shop for a plan before open enrollment closes Jan. 15. WyoFile reached out to experts and gathered information and tips for residents to keep in mind through the process: 
Costs may rise drastically 
The Affordable Care Act marketplace is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer.
Open enrollment is the annual window when individuals and families can sign up for health insurance through the ACA, adjust their plans or cancel coverage. 
Price jumps aren’t uncommon as insurers do raise premiums over time, but this year those increases will be larger due to the expiration of some enhanced premium tax credits. 
“Health insurance has always been and continues to be very, very expensive,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor with Georgetown’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. “But going into 2026, it’s only going to get more expensive.”

The tax credits were created in 2021 to essentially lower monthly out-of-pocket costs for ACA consumers, in some cases, all the way to $0. Congress did not extend them in the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, and an attempt to extend them now is one of the factors driving the government shutdown. 
The average ACA marketplace consumer will likely pay about 100% more for coverage in 2026, according to a fact sheet from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
In Wyoming, the impacts will vary depending on income, demographics and other factors. According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The premium increase for a 45-year-old who earns $62,000 annually could be upwards of $6,000.
Less help, more paperwork 
In the past, health “navigators” — professionals who guide customers through what can be a confusing open enrollment process — have been available largely thanks to federal funds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, however, slashed that funding by 90% this year. 
As a result, Enroll Wyoming, which offered free navigator help to those looking for insurance, experienced a significant budget cut. Despite paring down its staff from 10 individuals to just one full-time and one part-time employee, Enroll Wyoming will still offer services. 
“Enroll Wyoming stresses that it will be still around to educate and empower consumers,” reads an August press release. Consumers can learn more about accessing those services here.

The nonprofit will have more emphasis on online and phone communication in its new iteration, the release says. “At the same time, Enroll Wyoming is building a statewide network of partners to provide more referral support.”
Consumers will also have fewer options. Mountain Health Co-op announced in August that it will no longer offer health plans in Wyoming at the end of the year. That means Wyoming will be down to just two providers.
Finally, people should brace for more paperwork, Corlette said. That can include filing extra forms or submitting paperwork to reflect any changes in income. 
Stay informed, don’t rush
Enrollment opened Saturday. To get coverage starting Jan. 1, consumers must enroll in a plan by Dec. 15. If they enroll between Dec. 15 and the closing date of Jan. 15, coverage will start Feb. 1. If people are already enrolled and do nothing, they will be automatically re-enrolled in their plans.
The ACA marketplace only opened up what’s called “window shopping” two days before enrollment began, Corlette said, which means that it’s been hard for customers to suss out their new options.
“Also, the federal government told insurance companies that for this year only, they don’t have to include premium information in the notices that they send to consumers, which usually go out in October,” she added. That could further veil price changes. 
“I can imagine some people will be taken by surprise,” she said. “This will be a uniquely challenging year.”
So what can people do? 
First, Corlette said, they can contact their members of Congress to urge them to find more affordable solutions and let them know “the delay is not helping anyone.” 
Next, she said, they should stay informed. “If you see your premium is unaffordable, don’t lose hope. There is still a chance that Congress will strike a deal here and provide premium relief.”
Folks can hold off until Dec. 15, Corlette noted; they don’t have to rush into anything. 
If they do decide to leave the marketplace and look elsewhere, Corlette said, they should have caution. 
“There’s a lot of junk out there and a lot of aggressive marketing, so just be careful,” she said, adding that using a local insurance broker who can meet in person is generally a good way to help sort the quality plans from those that don’t offer much financial protection. 
What Corlette fears at this point is that “a lot of people will check their accounts, see their premium, get sticker shock, and say, ‘I can’t afford this,’ and walk away.
“And once they walk away, it’s really, really hard to get them to come back,” she said. “I think there’s still time for Congress to act, but probably too late to be sure that everybody stays insured.”
If people opt out of marketplace insurance, it would likely trigger even more cost increases. According to BlueCrossBlueShield Wyoming, when healthier people leave the marketplace, those who remain often require more care. That drives up costs for everyone.

Rather than a piecemeal approach to nuclear every time a new project pops up, Wyomingites deserve deliberate, comprehensive policymaking, writes guest columnist Carl Fisher.
The post As Radiant’s glow fades from Wyoming, it’s time for a bigger discussion about nuclear appeared first on WyoFile .","Last month, Radiant Industries abandoned plans to build a first-of-its-kind nuclear manufacturing facility in Wyoming, choosing Tennessee instead. Wyoming law would have prevented the company from storing nuclear waste at the site, and the regulatory uncertainty killed the plan.

Opinion

This move spotlights a watershed moment for Wyoming. 
Up until now, conversations around nuclear energy in Wyoming have happened on a case-by-case basis. When a new project is proposed, lawmakers scramble to decide whether to make exceptions to state laws to accommodate the plan. As Radiant’s glow fades from Wyoming, we have a chance to get ahead of the curve and develop a comprehensive statewide policy for future nuclear proposals.
The piecemeal nature of nuclear planning has come into sharp focus in recent years. In 2021, when TerraPower proposed a nuclear power plant in Kemmerer, state lawmakers opted to allow the company to store its nuclear waste at the facility despite a statewide ban. This paved the way for the project to move forward. 
A few years later, with a proposed “nuclear manufacturing” facility on the table in Bar Nunn, the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee tabled a measure to legalize nuclear waste storage. That, along with vocal community opposition, prompted Radiant to pull out of Wyoming.
Interest in nuclear technology is not going away any time soon. Future companies will doubtless come begging for more exemptions. Now is the time for Wyoming leaders to step up and have the conversations we should have been having all along about how to regulate this industry.
Granting every new company its own exemption is not the way to roll out a responsible nuclear policy. The conversation we need to have is much larger than Radiant or the wish-list of any single firm. With new nuclear technologies emerging, we are not just talking about storing radioactive waste. We are also talking about building new and untested reactors, transporting these reactors and waste across our highways and through our communities, and navigating new federal rules designed to expedite construction, which could end up leaving communities and the state on the hook for missteps. All of this needs to be taken into consideration as Wyoming leaders decide how to regulate future nuclear projects.
As the conversation unfolds, it is essential that our leaders listen to the questions and concerns expressed by Wyoming communities and acknowledge the lived experiences of those impacted by the nuclear industry. Gov. Mark Gordon has criticized those who are hesitant about nuclear, calling them “Club No.” But hesitation is healthy when the stakes are high and the issue complex. There is a lot to unpack and digest about this industry, and the skepticism voiced by community members, local leaders, and tribes has been warranted. 
Is nuclear right for Wyoming? The answer depends on careful consideration of opportunity and risk. We need to consider whether nuclear power is a reasonable and economically viable way to power our grid and reduce emissions. We need to weigh the impacts of increased mining. We need to evaluate whether there are sufficient safeguards to protect Wyomingites from catastrophic health impacts like the ones we saw in the 1960s, when a radioactive plume from the Susquehanna-Western uranium mill led to cancer clusters on the Wind River Reservation.
These calculations might look different for different communities. The outcome may well benefit the next iteration of Radiant. It should, at the very least, provide clarity for both industry and Wyoming’s communities about the types of projects we are willing to host. Communities deserve time. Industry deserves certainty. People deserve leadership over politics. Wyoming’s leaders should seize Radiant’s departure as an opportunity to take the lead in crafting clear, proactive and comprehensive policy surrounding nuclear energy — rather than doing things piecemeal, whenever a new project pops up. Taking the time necessary to thoroughly address an issue that will have impacts for tens of thousands of years is not only worthwhile — it is essential for the long-term success of our communities, our economy and our way of life.

Oct. 27, 2025. (Courtesy of Omaha Tribe of Nebraska)LINCOLN — The Omaha Tribe of Nebraska is moving ahead with legalizing marijuana, a move the tribe’s attorney general says Nebraska officials used to suspend negotiations on an unrelated state-Tribal tobacco tax compact. 
The tribe called the move “direct retaliation.”
Omaha Tribe Attorney General John Cartier said an assistant attorney general for the state called him Monday, an hour before the first meeting of the tribe’s cannabis commission. Cartier learned state officials would no longer negotiate on a tobacco tax compact because of the tribe’s more permissive position on marijuana. 
The Omaha Tribe Council unanimously voted in July to legalize medical cannabis and adult-use recreational marijuana. The initial focus of the tribe’s cannabis commission is “strictly” medical cannabis.
“It made me pause for about 30 seconds there, because I wasn’t really anticipating that level of obstruction,” Cartier told the Nebraska Examiner on Thursday. “I at least appreciated the candor and upfrontness about it.”

If a tobacco tax compact is greenlit, the state and tribe could split tax revenues from tobacco sales on the reservation. It could be a potential new windfall of hundreds of thousands of dollars for the tribe.
The Omaha Tribe reservation is in northeast Nebraska, more than 300 square miles, primarily in Thurston County and parts of neighboring Burt and Cuming Counties.
‘Direct retaliation’
In a follow-up conversation with Attorney General Mike Hilgers this week, Cartier said Hilgers indicated his office would confirm the state’s official position and how Gov. Jim Pillen wanted to proceed. 
Pillen asked Hilgers this summer to negotiate the contract on behalf of the State of Nebraska. The AG’s Office declined to comment on compact negotiations. Pillen’s office did not respond this week to questions about the dispute.

Cartier said he anticipates no change because “none of them fundamentally believe in a cannabis industry.” He said the AG’s Office has also indicated it plans to spend additional tax dollars in support of more policing of the Omaha Tribe’s border, because of the new tribal law.
“If that is their official stance, in our opinion, that’s direct retaliation, potentially a legal way for them to skirt their responsibilities and to use this as leverage,” Cartier said.
Cartier added: “People need to understand that they are still fighting bitterly to the very end on this topic, even though I think Nebraska voters have spoken, and they should honor that.”
‘Two plus two is four’
Voters in November 2024 overwhelmingly voted to allow someone to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation. Voters also created a new state commission to regulate the new medicine. The state commission’s rules would ultimately allow medical cannabis to be purchased in the state, a milestone not expected until at least mid-2026.
Hilgers has argued that cannabis should remain illegal because federal law classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — a drug the federal government says has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical uses. A bipartisan swath of advocates has called for rescheduling the drug for decades.

Congress has repeatedly prohibited the U.S. Department of Justice from interfering with state medical cannabis programs. Advocates, including those in Nebraska, have pointed to the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in upholding states’ rights to legalize marijuana.
“I think two plus two is four, even if everyone else says two plus two is five,” Hilgers said in May.
Pillen argues he has always supported medical marijuana but wants it to be strictly regulated to prevent a slide to legalizing recreational use. In September 2023, as advocates geared up for a third and ultimately successful petition campaign, Pillen said access to medical cannabis should only come with approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That hasn’t yet happened.
Nebraska followed dozens of other states in passing its medical cannabis laws in 2024, a nationwide push Hilgers recognizes as part of voters’ frustrations. He has said it’s an “abject failure” of the federal government not to enforce the laws it has created.
“I’m a big boy. It doesn’t bother me,” Hilgers, a former state lawmaker, said of opponents to his policy stance. “I’ve gone through the wars. What people want to say, they want to say.”
Hilgers’ office has not publicly commented on the tribe’s position on marijuana.
Negotiations began in July
Cartier said the Omaha Tribe reached out to Pillen in July to begin discussing a tobacco tax compact. The Santee Sioux Nation has such an agreement, which lets the Santee Sioux retain 75% of tobacco tax revenues. The Omaha Tribe says it seeks to keep 90% tobacco tax revenue while also taking on additional regulatory duties from the state, subject to negotiations.

State and tribal officials met in August related to a proposed tobacco tax compact, a meeting Cartier said was “highly productive” and left hope for “real progress.” The state promised to offer suggestions or a counterproposal within weeks.
“After months and months of promises and negotiations to be taken away from us at the last minute, it really is unconscionable to me,” Cartier said.
Cartier said it is easy to be rattled or emotional to a response like that, which he described as a continuation of government punishment of Native Americans “for just existing.” He said the Omaha Tribe is working to support its members and has passed a policy that could yield millions in economic development, plus job opportunities, without reliance on the federal government.
A contrasting tribal commission
Cheyenne Robinson, secretary of the Omaha Tribe Council, said Monday she was excited about the “historic day” for the Omaha people.
“We’re moving forward to committing to our sovereignty, having responsible regulation and economic diversification,” Robinson said. “Anxious for what’s to come.”

Jason Sheridan, chair of the Omaha Tribe Council, said Monday that all council members knew someone who could benefit from medical marijuana. He said he was glad the tribe was moving forward.
“I have nothing but confidence in all of you,” Sheridan told the commission.
The Omaha Tribe swore in four members to its own cannabis commission Monday — Jayzon Hundley, Amanda Hallowell, Arthur Isagholian and Allison Stockman. Cartier also sits on the commission as a nonvoting member. The tribe can seat up to one more member.
Hundley, grant accountant for the tribe, and Hallowell, a registered nurse, are enrolled members of the Omaha Tribe. Isagholian, with a background in agriculture, and Stockman, with a background in public safety and public health, bring about 40 years of experience in the cannabis sector in other states.

The inaugural meeting featured discussion on future commission rules and regulations, with a focus on how to test marijuana products for safety and navigate a potentially antagonistic state beyond its borders. One solution could be testing products on the reservation.
“Even if we think we have a legal right … they’re probably more than willing to fight that in the courts,” Cartier told commissioners Monday, referring to the Nebraska AG’s Office.
Cartier has said the tribe will defend its sovereignty and laws if and when needed. The commission will meet next Nov. 19, when it could approve its rules and regulations.
‘The driver’s seat’
State regulations from the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, nearing final approval, have been criticized by many members of the public as overly burdensome. Among the restrictions are allowing up to 12 dispensaries statewide.

Nebraskans would need to receive a specific medical cannabis recommendation from a physician registered with the state medical cannabis program for access to a licensed state dispensary. Dispensaries could not sell smokable products, vapes, edibles or raw flower. No more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the part of cannabis most associated with a “high,” could be purchased every 90 days.
The state commission could seek to finalize its regulations and seek final approval from Hilgers and Pillen as soon as Monday.
Cartier said the tribe hopes to provide a “stark contrast” to the state regulations and promote access to medical cannabis, a topic he said “should have nothing to do” with tobacco taxes.
“We made a determination that now is a good point to bring this to the public, without waiting for a response from Attorney General Hilgers and the governor, because, in our perspective, we are not in the backseat on this,” Cartier said. “We’re in the driver’s seat, and we want to maintain that position.”

(Laura Guido / Idaho Capital Sun) After around 20 years as a lawmaker in the Idaho Statehouse, Bart Davis said he had to learn to check his “politics at the door” at his new job as the state’s top federal prosecutor. 
That is a lesson he’s taken from his first term in the position of U.S. attorney for the District of Idaho under President Donald Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021. The U.S. Senate this month confirmed the nomination of the Idaho Falls native to serve another term. 
Davis, 70, said he learned a lot from the other attorneys who work in the office that he’s bringing with him this time around. 
“I learned from the people who were here how to check my politics, not my values, but my politics at the door,” Davis said, “and I learned that collectively, although we may disagree on some social issues, or we may disagree on other issues of the day, we don’t talk about it. And we talk instead about the cases we have, the mission that we share, and it was easy to get about the work with that type of a mindset.”
 Davis’s priorities for office come from the U.S. Department of Justice, including immigration, combating fentanyl  

Davis has yet to meet with the U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, he said during an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun Wednesday, but the priorities for the office are likely to remain largely the same as when he served the first time, under both former attorneys general Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr.

“My priorities are the priorities of the Department of Justice,” he said. 
Those include prosecution of drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, gangs, crimes against children, protection of law enforcement, violent crime, felonies committed on Native American reservations, and immigration enforcement. 
While there’s an increased focus from the current White House on immigration enforcement, Davis said, his office only gets involved when there’s a criminal aspect, such as smuggling undocumented immigrants, use of fraudulent federal immigration documents, or illegal reentry of someone who was previously deported. He doesn’t see that role being expanded much, because most enforcement will still occur through the Department of Homeland Security. 
One change Davis has noticed from his first time in the office is the very close presence of fentanyl, a highly potent and deadly opioid. 
“I am troubled that, what was once an oncoming problem with fentanyl, is reality in our state today,” he said. 
Overdose deaths related to fentanyl spiked in Idaho in 2021, going from 45 reported the prior year to 152. Fentanyl-related deaths continued to rise, going to 188 in 2022 and 197 in 2023, before dropping to 128 in 2024, according to the most recently available state public health data. 
 Most civil attorneys in office are furloughed due to government shut down 

The U.S. attorney’s office also has a civil division that handles matters such as representing the nation in civil lawsuits, allegations of discrimination in federal employment, and challenges to certain federal actions. The office also handles federal enforcement to ensure payments owed from federal court actions.

Davis’ predecessor, Josh Hurwit, added to the office for the first time a civil rights attorney and announced he intended to focus on prosecuting civil rights violations and hate crimes, the Sun reported. 
However, Davis said Wednesday he isn’t apprised of that divisions’ work at the moment, because most of the civil attorneys are furloughed under the government shut down that’s been in effect since Oct. 1. 
At the federal level, it’s estimated that approximately 75% of the lawyers in the Civil Rights  in the Department of Justice have been ousted, according to former senior DOJ attorney founder of Justice Connection Stacey Young. 
“That means that our country’s civil rights laws are not really being enforced right now,” Young told a group of reporters in Washington, D.C., earlier this month. 
Davis did not speak to whether civil rights and hate crime prosecution would continue to be a priority for the District of Idaho office. 
 Davis’ involvement in Idaho law, politics is longstanding 

Davis grew up in Idaho Falls as one of eight children in a family that did not shy away from tough topics, he said. 
“In my home, as a boy growing up, we always talked religion and we always talked politics,” Davis said. “And that was certainly the life I was exposed to.” 
His engagement with politics contributed to his desire to study law, and Davis went on to graduate from Brigham Young University-Idaho in 1978 and from the University of Idaho College of Law in 1980.
He started a legal practice in Idaho Falls, focusing on commercial, regulatory and transactional work, according to Davis’ biography on the the Department of Justice website. 
He said he started working on other legislators’ campaigns, and when Idaho Falls Republican state Sen. John Hansen decided not to run again, Hansen called Davis to ask if he had any interest. 
“I said, ‘Absolutely, I really am interested,’ because I’d been taking his pulse for a couple of election cycles before,” Davis said. 
After obtaining permission to run from his wife Marion, Davis put his hat in the ring. He won his first primary and general elections with 57% and 56% of the vote respectively, according to Idaho Secretary of State’s Office election data. He went on to serve what was then-District 29, until 2002 when it became District 33. He continued to serve as the District 33 state senator until 2017. He was Senate majority leader for 15 years. 
Davis’ spouse was a public school teacher at the time, and he said education was a top focus for them. When he was selected by his fellow Republican senators to be majority leader, he said he mostly stepped back from sponsoring his own bills. 
“What I learned then was that, for me, it was better to focus my attention on the process rather than carrying a lot of bills,” he said. “… My goal, I believed, was to provide an even handed and fair process for all legislative ideas.” 
Davis and his family faced tragedy in 2003 when their son, Cameron Wade Davis, who was 23 years old at the time, was shot and killed by another Boise State University student. Eight years later, fellow Idaho Falls Republican Rep. Erik Simpson, spoke to Davis before bringing a bill that would forbid Idaho colleges and universities from banning guns on campus, except for dormitories, the Spokesman Review reported. 
Davis said at the time, “I certainly didn’t pledge my support for the legislation, but I certainly understood.”

That 2011 bill passed the Idaho House but never advanced in the Senate. In 2014, the Idaho Legislature passed a bill allowing individuals with enhanced concealed carry permits to have firearms on campus, except in dorms or large buildings or venues housing more than 1,000 people. The bill also enhanced penalties for carrying a concealed weapon on a college or university campus while under the influence of alcohol — Davis voted in favor of this bill. 
He began eying the position of U.S. attorney and opted to step down from his Senate position in 2017. Davis said he knew he was interested, no one had to talk him into it, but he couldn’t say what it was that drew him to it. He noted that he highly respected the past position-holders, including his predecessor Wendy Olson, a Barack Obama appointee who resigned after Trump was elected to his first term. 
“I can’t honestly tell you what drew me to the Capitol or what drew me here,” he said. “I can tell you what kept me at the Capitol, and that was the collective commitment to try and get it right. I can tell you that’s true about the people here in this office, the collective efforts to try and get it right.” 
Trump nominated Davis in June 2017 and the U.S. Senate confirmed him in September that year. Davis stepped down in 2021 at the request of then-President Joe Biden. 
Trump nominated Davis again in March. 
“Many congratulations to my friend, Bart Davis, on his appointment as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho!” Gov. Brad Little posted on social media in April. “I am confident his legal wisdom and knowledge of Idaho will serve the Trump administration well.” 
The U.S. Senate confirmed his nomination in a largely party-line 51-47 vote on Oct. 7. Davis’ approval was included in a vote on a group of nominees, which included other Idahoans Michael Boren for undersecretary of agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment, Alex Adams to be assistant secretary for family support at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Brandon Judd to be ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of Chile. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in an emailed statement on the nominations, “The four Idahoans confirmed by the Senate today are intimately aware of the many commonsense needs of our state. Their expertise and knowledge will promote the opinions and on-the-ground experiences of Idaho’s constituents at the federal level. I look forward to working with them in these new capacities.”
Davis spoke highly of his predecessor, Hurwit, who worked as an attorney in his office under Davis’ first term. He also spoke highly of the new and returning attorneys in the office, but said there were a number of vacancies that “will take a great deal of my time and attention over the next six to eight months.” 
He said he loved his time as a private attorney and practicing law as well as his time in the Idaho Senate. 
“But the best job I ever had, as great as all those jobs were, was being the United States Attorney for the District of Idaho,” he said, “to work with these people who are genuinely trying to even handily apply the laws of the United States of America. It impressed me then, and it impresses me now.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]All 80 New Jersey General Assembly seats are on the ballot Tuesday, with Republicans hoping to flip enough districts to claim a lower-chamber majority that has eluded them for nearly a quarter century.
There are no certainties in this year’s legislative races, which will play second fiddle to the gubernatorial contest at the top of the ballot. Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherill are the front-runners in the race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy on Nov. 4.
Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021 and lost to Murphy, but his performance in some areas of the state was good enough to help the GOP flip six Assembly seats and a state Senate seat that year (most flipped back to the Democratic column two years later).
Still, Republicans face an uphill climb to grab control of the Assembly this year. They’d need to flip more than 12 Assembly seats to claim a majority. The chamber, for now, is split 52-28 in favor of Democrats.
“You’ve heard a lot of people saying could Ciattarelli flip the state Assembly, and I just don’t see a path,” Dan Cassino, director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll, said. “Even if all the swings go GOP, Democrats still have 45, 46. I just don’t know how they do it.”
Most of New Jersey’s legislative districts are not competitive, with the two major parties focused on a handful like the 3rd and 8th districts in South Jersey. Some seats in the southern end of the state have repeatedly changed hands in recent years, which have seen tightened margins.
The 8th District is one of only two in the state where Assembly representation is split between both parties. It is among the state’s most closely watched contests, and the most expensive. Candidates and outside groups have put more than $4.6 million into the district, according to an analysis by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission.
There, Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington) faces a repeat race against Assemblyman Michael Torrissi (R-Burlington). Torrissi’s running mate is Brandon Umba, a former assemblyman whom Katz ousted in 2023 in a race that took a week to call, while Katz is joined on the ballot by Anthony Angelozzi, a Hammonton High School history teacher and union leader.
The 8th District’s results were among the closest in the state in 2023.
“I’m not sure what to expect, but I’d be surprised if it was as close as it was the last time. I’ll be watching to see if it’s the same order, but it takes a lot for it to land as close as it did,” said Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics.
The 3rd District, which includes parts of Cumberland, Gloucester, and Salem counties, could also be competitive this year. That’s a district that has toggled back and forth between GOP and Democratic control in recent elections.
Incumbent Assembly members Heather Simmons and Dave Bailey, both Gloucester County Democrats, are seeking second terms against Republicans Gloucester County Commissioner Chris Konawel and Harrison Deputy Mayor Lawrence Moore.
The gubernatorial contest could have a great impact in districts like the 3rd, especially given that so few New Jerseyans know who represents them in the Legislature’s lower chamber.
Cassino said the major parties’ chances in these districts are dependent on the performance of their gubernatorial candidate.
“The issue is voters aren’t paying a lot of attention to what’s going on at the Assembly level, so you’re going to see very, very little split-ticket voting,” he said.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NJ-Assembly-floor-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-03 06:17:39.477653

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A court hearing in Nashville Monday could decide whether members of the Tennessee National Guard can continue patrolling the streets of Memphis as part of the Trump administration’s anti-crime task force. 
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and other public officials filed suit in October alleging Gov. Bill Lee’s deployment of National Guard members to Memphis violates state law and the Tennessee Constitution.
The officials are asking Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal to issue a temporary injunction to end the Guard’s presence in Memphis. 
“The Court should not stand by while the Governor asserts military power to run roughshod over Tennessee law,” the lawsuit said.
Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

Attorneys defending Lee argued the governor was acting within his legal authority to deploy the Guard to Memphis as “to combat unbridled criminal activity.”
Memphis is among a handful of American cities — Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago — that have seen a surge in federal law enforcement, including members of the National Guard, ostensibly to combat crime and apprehend immigrants without lawful status.  
Tennessee is the only affected state with its governor welcoming the federal presence. 
The legal fight centers, in part, on whether the Tennessee National Guard is a “militia” or an “army.”
A Tennessee governor’s use of a militia is restricted under the state law and the state constitution. 
“The Militia shall not be called into service except in case of rebellion or invasion, and then only when the General Assembly shall declare, by law, that the public safety requires it,” the Tennessee Constitution says.
State law constrains the governor’s use of a militia for civilian enforcement and requires cities and counties to request the governor’s deployment of the Guard. 
Shelby County Mayor, elected officials sue Gov. Bill Lee over National Guard deployment

Neither Memphis city officials nor Shelby County officials have requested the National Guard. 
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti argued that the National Guard is an “army,” not a militia, and therefore unrestrained by the restrictions set out in state law and the constitution.
Skrmetti warned that a decision that deems the Guard a “militia” in this case could have grave consequences in the future.
“If Plaintiffs’ foundationless assertion that the Guard is the Militia takes root in Tennessee law, Governors yet unborn will be deprived of legitimate and important tools to address some of our State’s most consequential crises,” Skrmetti wrote.
The lawsuit was brought by Harris, state Rep. Gabby Salinas and Rep. G.A. Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats, Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, two members of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners and a Memphis City Council member.
Before the lawsuit, Yarbro accused Skrmetti of an “improper revision” to a 2021 legal opinion from a previous state Attorney General, which cast doubt on the governor’s ability to use the National Guard for police activity.
The opinion was deleted from the state Attorney General’s site shortly before the National Guard’s deployment in Memphis.
In addition to Lee, the lawsuit names Skrmetti and Major General Warner Ross III of the Tennessee National Guard. 
On Friday, ACLU Tennessee and a Memphis area community organization filed an amicus brief in support of an injunction.

Pulliam, 39, died Nov. 25, 2024, three days before Thanksgiving, in the Ashton Place laundry room after emergency responders arrived “too late” to revive him. 
Pulliam, who was visiting his mother, suffered heart failure after he and a tenant became trapped in the laundry room. The electronic door malfunctioned, and neither had a cellphone with them to call for help.
“They couldn’t open the door to get out,” Davies said. “You’re supposed to be able to open the door to walk out and you only have to swipe with a fob to go in.”
Davies said the tenant pounded furiously on washers and dryers, trying desperately to alert nearby tenants that she and Pulliam were trapped.
Pulliam, who had congestive heart failure dating to the COVID-19 era, complained that he couldn’t breathe and asked the tenant for help, Davies said.
Other tenants heard the commotion in the laundry room, Davies said, but were “afraid to open the door” because they didn’t know what was going on. They thought there might be “someone in there fighting,” she said.
Eventually, emergency responders arrived, but it was too late to save Pulliam.
“They tried to revive him, but they couldn’t,” Davies said. “So because that door malfunctioned, they [Pulliam and the tenant] couldn’t get help.” 
Davies, a retired assistant clerk of Superior Court in Durham, has hired a lawyer and said she is pursuing legal claims against Downtown Home Improvement Corporation Inc. (DHIC), the Raleigh-based nonprofit developer of the 51-unit affordable housing complex for residents 55 and older, and Community Management Corporation, the company DHIC hired to manage the property.

Yolanda Winstead, president of DHIC, said she is not at liberty to discuss Pulliam’s death due to possible legal action by Davies, but later provided this statement: “Based on our investigation, Ashton Place was not responsible for this unfortunate death that happened to occur on the premises.”
She directed further questions about Pulliam to Jack Bayliss of Carruthers & Roth, the legal firm representing DHIC. 
“It’s sad whenever a young person passes away like this, but Ashton Place doesn’t have any responsibility for his death, and that’s our position on the matter,” Bayliss said. “You know, our sympathies go out to Ms. [Debra] Davies, losing her son, but that’s about all we have to say on the matter at this point.”
Pulliam’s death underscores concerns and complaints made by Ashton Place tenants and those at nearby Willard Street Apartments about the management of the two apartment buildings, both developed by DHIC and managed by Community Management Corporation. 
Tenants say it takes months to make repairs. They also complain about building cleanliness and safety, particularly doors that they say do not always latch properly.
The two buildings, abutting the Durham Transit Center, share a single maintenance person. The tenants say that’s inadequate for more than 140-units.

“They have multiple, multiple, multiple complaints about the same thing from different people but they act like we’re all crazy,” said Rene’e Valentine, an Ashton Place tenant who has also lived at Willard Street Apartments. “We’re not collaborating to make complaints.”
At a recent Durham City Council meeting during which the council voted to increase protections for tenants, several Willard Street Apartments tenants shared concerns about the operation and management of the property.
City Councilwoman Chelsea Cook, a leading supporter of the amendment who introduced it to council, said it adds teeth to the city’s Neighborhood Improvement Services Department, which oversees the Code Enforcement Division.
“Our city code inspectors used to have the ability to enforce their inspections,” Cook said. “We used to have a criminalized component to that. The criminalization component was stripped by the state.”
Vincent Lawrence, a resident of Willard Street Apartments, called the poor maintenance of the apartments one of Durham’s “worst kept secrets.”
“There have been close to two dozen in management in succession in and out of the door,” Lawrence said. “They have been using skeleton staffing to run the building.”
Lawrence told the council that he has been without heat for one week, which he said is due to the “negligence” of the management firm and the inability of the maintenance person to make such repairs.
DHIC President Yolanda Winstead, who spoke candidly to NC Newsline about residents’ complaints, acknowledged that there has been a lot of turnover in onsite management since Willard Street opened in 2021, but that it’s been stable the past year.
“What has turned over a bit more has been the maintenance staff, and frankly that’s because that expertise is in high demand,” Winstead said. ”Maintenance staff are able to make a lot more money working for market-rate communities.” 
The residents’ complaints to council about Ashton Place and Willard Street Apartments took place as the council considered an ordinance that would make it illegal for landlords to collect rent if a housing unit is found to be“imminently dangerous” to tenants’ health and safety.
Under the new ordinance, which is modeled after one in Charlotte, landlords can be charged with a misdemeanor if they collect rent on housing that has immediately dangerous conditions such as rotted or damaged structural supports, unsafe wiring, unsafe roofs, no potable water supply or no operating heating equipment in cold months, among other violations.
NC Tenants Union executive director Nick MacLeod
Nick MacLeod, executive director of the North Carolina Tenants Union, noted the “sad, hard irony” that Ashton Place and Willard Street Apartments were both hailed as housing developments built to address concerns about affordable housing needs for low-income residents and seniors.
“I think that CMC [Community Management Corporation] is responsible for maintaining safe staffing levels … but DHIC can absolutely say to the management company that they hire that they want them to have a certain number of maintenance people per this many units,” MacLeod said.
The NC Tenants Union has been helping residents of Willard Street Apartments to organize.
Winstead pushed back against some tenants’ belief that DHIC would be subjected to the new ordinance.
“DHIC is not a slumlord, and is not having people live in conditions that would rise to the categories that this ordinance is designed to cover,” she said. “We would just want to make sure that that’s clear, and that folks see for themselves that we’re operating a high quality property that provides affordable units.”
Winstead said DHIC is “happy” with the long-standing relationship with Community Management Corporation, which oversees more than 4,000-units of DHIC properties. She said DHIC is working with the management firm to address concerns.
“And while you know, none of our management companies do everything perfect all the time,” Winstead said. “You know, it’s not unusual to have complaints. They are being responsive.” 
In an emailed response to questions, the N.C. Housing Finance Agency, a funding partner for Ashton Place, said that it does have a regulatory responsibility to monitor multifamily rental properties that it provides funding for. 
“Properties receiving federal and state funding must meet certain criteria, and the agency works with owners and managers to make sure that properties meet program regulation,” an agency spokesperson said in the email. “The agency does a physical inspection and tenant file review depending on the funding sources, usually every three years.”

There’s grief in Davies’ face as she measuredly discusses Pulliam’s untimely death with a reporter. At times, she tears up as she describes the events that led to it.
When she moved into Ashton Place a little more than a year ago, she believed she’d found her “forever home.”
“This has got everything that I’ve been looking for,” Davies said. “I’ve got the space. I got the two bedrooms, so when my other son comes to visit, I’ve got somewhere for him. Little by little the management has been chipping away at my feelings of security.”

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Election Day is Tuesday. Voters who have already received a mail ballot must place it in a drop box or return it to an in-person polling location 7 p.m. Tuesday for their votes to be counted. It’s too late to return a ballot by mailing it.
Colorado has same-day voter registration, meaning that any eligible voter, even if they are not yet registered, can still cast a vote in the 2025 election by visiting an in-person polling location before 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations can be found at GoVoteColorado.com and on local county clerks’ websites.

Data released by the secretary of state’s office showed that 700,103 Colorado voters had returned their ballots as of Friday. As a percentage of active registered voters, that’s a higher figure than was reported at the same point in the past two off-year election cycles, putting the state on track for its highest turnout in an off-year election since 2019.
As usual, older Coloradans have made up the vast majority of voters returning a ballot so far this year, with voters under age 55 accounting for less than a third of all ballots returned as of Friday. Registered Republicans have returned slightly more ballots (204,332) than registered Democrats (202,432), but both trail behind the 285,175 ballots returned by unaffiliated voters, who make up half of all registered voters in the state.
What’s on the ballot
Colorado holds coordinated elections in odd-numbered years to elect candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races, often alongside one or more statewide ballot issues.
In 2025, Colorado lawmakers have referred two measures to the ballot, Propositions LL and MM, which would shore up funding for the state’s universal school meals program. Detailed information about both ballot measures is available in the 2025 Blue Book, prepared by nonpartisan state fiscal analysts.
Dozens of public school districts across the state are holding elections for their boards of education, drawing millions of dollars in outside spending by pro-charter-school organizations, conservative groups and teachers unions.
Municipalities including Denver, Aurora, Lakewood, Fort Collins and Pueblo are also holding elections featuring city council and mayoral races and local ballot issues.
Checking the status of your ballot
Colorado’s BallotTrax service allows voters to monitor the status of their mail ballot via phone, email or text notifications. Voters can also check the status of their ballot at any time by entering their registration information on the secretary of state’s website.
On average, about 1% to 2% of mail ballots in each election in Colorado are rejected because of a signature discrepancy or other issue. Voters whose ballots are rejected should receive a BallotTrax notification or a letter from their county elections office, which will include the steps they need to take to “cure” the problem and ensure their ballot is counted.

(Photo by Andrew Weeks/For the North Dakota Monitor) When Connor Fitzgerald sits down to create a lesson plan for his high school English class, he goes about it a little differently than he used to. Instead of spending hours on research and coming up with ideas, he punches words into a textbox on his computer and waits just a few seconds for results. 
This new way of approaching lesson planning — one not using textbooks but algorithms — is just the tip of the iceberg of how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the classroom. Teachers also use it for preparing quizzes, generating presentations, keeping track of student progress, and seeing how students might be challenged. 
For Fitzgerald, the benefit of using AI for class preparation is saving time so he can instead focus on more critical tasks such as student engagement. 
“That’s ultimately the goal, at least on the educational side of it,” he said. “How do you use this new tool, not to replace you but to ease your workload to do other things?” 
Fitzgerald, an English teacher at Milnor Public Schools, has been on the front lines for almost a year about how best to use AI in his classroom. He attended state training on its uses last fall and is helping to write his school’s AI policy, based on state guidance. Teachers can use AI for such things as lesson planning and prep work, for instance, and students can use it for idea generation. 
Educators and AI
Fitzgerald said he’s received training on the ethical use of AI and how AI can help educators regain some of their time. 
“The idea with the training was that AI is brand new technology, and so how do you use it in the classroom in a way that is ethical and works best for you,” he said. “I use a lot of AI tech since that training for creating grammar worksheets — essentially, taking what we already do as teachers and shortening the worktime so I don’t have to sit there and come up with 45 example sentences to put in a worksheet when I can have the computer create it for me.” 
Fargo Public Schools uses AI in much the same way and has seen similar benefits, including saving time on repetitive tasks, according to Liann Hanson, director of standards-based instruction. 
“We’re using it in practical ways that save time and support student learning,” she said. 
Examples include generating rubrics, adjusting reading levels, designing assessments, and producing visuals. 
“This helps teachers devote more attention to individualized instruction and relationships with students,” Hanson said.

Jeff Fastnacht, superintendent for Bismarck Public Schools, said some teachers and principals have intentionally stayed away from using AI while others have jumped on board with enthusiasm. Fastnacht uses AI every day, noting it makes his job easier. 
“I get more done, and I think I’m a better superintendent because of that,” he said.
Fastnacht believes the same could be true for teachers who use it. 
“Teachers are drowned by the number of reports and requirements put on them, the expectations they have to execute in the classroom, the sheer number of things that distract their time from actually working with a child, which should be their primary focus — working with children,” he said. 
However, he said teachers are cautioned on the limits of AI. “What a computer can’t do for you is digging into a kid and diagnosing what the learning challenges might be,” he said.
Fastnacht said much like the internet revolution of the 1990s, some educators are leery about the potential uses of AI, perhaps even worried about how far it will go in replacing the teacher. He’s not worried, however, and said it’s just another tool to use, not a replacement tool. 
Hanson, from Fargo Public Schools, echoed similar sentiments: “Importantly, teachers always review and apply their professional judgment. AI is a support, not a replacement.”
Students and AI
Most North Dakota schools who are using AI allow students to use it in the classroom for simple tasks. But first they are taught the acceptable uses of it. Students and their teachers also are taught to be “good prompters,” or how to ask the technology appropriate questions to get the most out of it.
“There’s different levels of AI intervention,” Fastnacht said. “The skill of prompting, the skill of having a dialogue with AI and anticipating learning, how you want data represented back to you. That’s a whole process of learning how to prompt AI.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At Milnor Public Schools, Fitzgerald said his approach is basic, that students can use AI for idea generation, not for class work. 
“I tell them as long as they submit what they put into AI and what they got out of it, along with their assignment, then I will probably be OK with it,” he said.  
For oversight, Fitzgerald said it’s so far been a “trust, guess and check” process; the check aspect for him means typing parts of a student’s work into a program to see if AI was used. “It’s basically AI checking for AI,” he said. But it’s not a perfect process and he tries to vet the work himself, often scouring several websites. 
In some respects, Fitzgerald said it’s difficult to say how much AI has benefited students. Unlike him, he hasn’t noticed much reduced work time for them. “It’s a little different in that regard,” he said. “For them, it’s getting creative input on the way into an assignment.” 
Ethical considerations  
Educators said since AI is here to stay, it’s best that teachers and students learn how to use it appropriately. In that light, Bismarck Public Schools in September created training for educators about the different AI tools available, such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Microsoft Co-Pilot. Among the topics are using strong, specific prompts; being transparent with students; reviewing work carefully and protecting privacy; and how to harness visual element tools such as Canva. The training reinforces what the district’s “guardrails” are with regards to the technology, Fastnacht said. Protecting student information is paramount. 
Fitzgerald said teachers must be careful what they put into AI programs for fear that personal information might unintentionally be regurgitated in some fashion. 
The Fargo school district provides guidance and expectations because of the risks of AI, Hanson said.
“The main drawbacks of AI are the potential for bias, inaccuracies, privacy concerns, overreliance, and issues of academic integrity if students misuse tools,” she said.
Fitzgerald said although AI should be approached with caution and oversight, there are benefits of using the tool in the classroom for both teacher and student. But he expects it might have its limits. 
 “I don’t know how much further it will go in terms of what it’s allowed to do in the classroom now,” he said. “I can’t at this point imagine what I would do with it outside of it helping me reduce my workload.”

The 17 active judges on the U.S. 5th Court of Appeals in January will hear both the Texas case and a similar case happening in Louisiana, which was the first state to pass a requirement to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.
A federal judge in August found Texas’ Ten Commandments law unconstitutional and temporarily blocked it from taking full effect, following an initial lawsuit against 11 school districts. The complaint was brought forth by 16 families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and a coalition of religious freedom organizations. The civil rights groups later sued 14 more districts.
The ruling only applied to the 11 school districts named in the groups’ first lawsuit, though attorneys expressed hope in court that other districts would not implement the law. But those lawyers later told the same court in a legal filing that many districts are implementing the new law or have signaled an intent to do so.
Full 5th Circuit to hear case on Louisiana law requiring Ten Commandments in classrooms

In his August decision, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery concluded that the law favors Christianity over other faiths, is not neutral with respect to religion and is likely to interfere with families’ “exercise of their sincere religious or nonreligious beliefs in substantial ways.”
“There are ways in which students could be taught any relevant history of the Ten Commandments without the state selecting an official version of scripture, approving it in state law, and then displaying it in every classroom on a permanent basis,” Biery wrote in his opinion, adding that the law “crosses the line from exposure to coercion.”
Texas appealed the ruling, sending the case to the same court where a three-judge panel recently blocked Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law from taking effect. The state requested that all active judges on the court hear the case, as opposed to a three-judge panel. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the court to take up Texas’ and Louisiana’s appeals together, which it granted in late October.
“The Ten Commandments are a cornerstone of American law, and that fact simply cannot be erased by radical, anti-American groups trying to ignore our moral heritage,” Paxton said. “There is no legal reason to stop Texas from honoring a core ethical foundation of our law, especially not a bogus claim about the ‘separation of church and state,’ which is a phrase found nowhere in the Constitution.”
Oral arguments in the Texas case, Rabbi Nathan v. Alamo Heights Independent School District, concluded in August, several weeks after the 16 families, of various religious backgrounds and represented by the religious freedom organizations, sued the state over what their lawyers called “catastrophically unconstitutional” legislation. Cribbs Ringer v. Comal Independent School District, the latest legal filing, includes more than a dozen new families.
In court, the attorneys argued with a lawyer from the state attorney general’s office over the role Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison played in developing the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment, which protects the freedom of religion. Both parties also debated the influence of the Ten Commandments on the country’s legal and educational systems, and whether the version of the Ten Commandments required to go up in schools belongs to a particular religious group.
Another group of parents filed a similar lawsuit in Dallas during the summer.
Texas’ Ten Commandments law was one of the latest measures passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year. Critics say the law injects religion into the state’s public schools, attended by roughly 5.5 million children.
The background
Senate Bill 10, by Republican Sen. Phil King of Weatherford, required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms on donated posters sized at least 16 by 20 inches. Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law in late June, the day after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found a similar law in Louisiana was “plainly unconstitutional.” The court ruled that requiring schools to post the Ten Commandments would cause an “irreparable deprivation” of First Amendment rights. An Arkansas judge ruled similarly in a separate case.
Supporters argue that the Ten Commandments and teachings of Christianity broadly are vital to understanding U.S. history, a controversial message that has resurged in recent years as part of a broader national movement to undermine the long-held interpretation of church-state separation. Texas GOP lawmakers have passed a number of laws in recent years to further codify their conservative religious views, a trend encouraged and celebrated by Christian leaders.
“This issue is likely to get to the United States Supreme Court,” Biery, the judge, told a San Antonio courtroom prior to opening arguments in the Texas case.
Biery’s August ruling blocking the law from taking full effect applied to the following school districts: Alamo Heights, North East, Lackland, Northside, Austin, Lake Travis, Dripping Springs, Houston, Fort Bend, Cypress-Fairbanks and Plano.
The latest lawsuit from the ACLU seeks further action in the following districts: Comal, Georgetown, Conroe, Flour Bluff, Fort Worth, Arlington, McKinney, Frisco, Northwest, Azle, Rockwall, Lovejoy, Mansfield, McAllen.
What are the plaintiffs saying
“Posting the Ten Commandments in public schools is un-American and un-Baptist,” Griff Martin, a pastor, parent and plaintiff in the first ACLU lawsuit, said in a statement. “S.B. 10 undermines the separation of church and state as a bedrock principle of my family’s Baptist heritage. Baptists have long held that the government has no role in religion — so that our faith may remain free and authentic.”
In the lawsuit brought by the North Texas parents, the plaintiffs, who identify as Christian, said the law was unconstitutional and violated their right to direct their children’s upbringing.
One of them, a Christian minister, said the displays will offer a message of religious intolerance, “implying that anyone who does not believe in the state’s official religious scripture is an outsider and not fully part of the community.” That message, the minister argued, conflicts with the religious, social justice and civil rights beliefs he seeks to teach his kids.
Another North Texas plaintiff, a mother of two, is worried she will be “forced” to have sensitive and perhaps premature conversations about topics like adultery with her young children — and also “does not desire that her minor children to be instructed by their school about the biblical conception of adultery,” the suit states.
The plaintiffs in the ACLU suit come from diverse religious backgrounds, including families who are nonreligious. Allison Fitzpatrick said in a statement that she fears her children will think they are violating school rules because they don’t adhere to commandments like honoring the Sabbath.
“The state of Texas has no right to dictate to children how many gods to worship, which gods to worship, or whether to worship any gods at all,” sad Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which brought the lawsuit alongside the ACLU.
The attorneys called the version of the Ten Commandments in SB 10 a “state-sponsored Protestant version,” which was corroborated by their witness, constitutional law professor and religious history expert Steven Green. They argued against the notion that the Ten Commandments were central to the development of the country’s legal and educational systems, which Green agreed lacked historical support. The court also found Green’s testimony more persuasive than the state’s.
What the state is saying
The attorney general’s office argued in the August hearing that the Ten Commandments are part of the nation’s history and heritage, and that previous rulings from federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court blocking the commandments from going up in classrooms did not examine that historical significance.
Attorneys for the state noted that the Supreme Court recently shot down the test that courts previously relied on to determine when a government had unconstitutionally endorsed or established a religion. And attorneys pointed out a decades-old ruling in a Nebraska case, regarding a Ten Commandments monument on city property, where an appeals court decided in favor of the monument that displayed the same version of the commandments Texas wants to show in public schools. They relied on that ruling to make the case that SB 10 does not favor a particular religious group.
Their viewpoint was supported in court by Mark David Hall, a professor and author who studies religious liberty and church-state relations. Hall, the state’s expert witness, recently wrote a book that considers how “Christian Nationalism Is Not an Existential Threat to America or the Church.”
Attorney William Farrell from the attorney general’s office described SB 10’s requirement as a “passive display on the wall” that does not rise to the level of coercion. The Ten Commandments posters must only go up if they are donated to the school, he further argued, and the law does not specify what would happen if districts choose not to comply. The state views that as evidence that it poses no threat or harm to families.
“SB 10 doesn’t restrict anything,” Farrell said. “It doesn’t exclude anything or specifically require any … participation by students.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A rarely granted honor, described as the University of Nebraska’s “highest and most prestigious award,” was recently bestowed on two former NU coaches.
The Regents Medal was given posthumously Friday to Bob Devaney, a two-time national champion football coach who helped make wearing red a state obsession, and to Terry Pettit, whose 1995 national championship in volleyball paved the way for Nebraska becoming what many call “the volleyball state.”


Past recipients of the University of Nebraska Regents Medal:
2023 — Howard and Rhonda Hawks
2017 — Richard “Dick” Holland (posthumously)
2016 — The Abel Family and Tom Osborne
2014 — Walter Scott, Jr.
2013 — Mike Yanney and Dr. Gail Walling Yanney
2011 — Robert B. Daugherty (posthumously)
2009 — Bill and Ruth Scott
2007 — Charles W. Durham


The medal has been given only eight times in the past 18 years and only once previously to someone involved in athletics — former NU football coach and athletics director Tom Osborne.
It is intended, NU President Jeffrey Gold said, for individuals who provided “exceptional benefits” in furthering the goals and mission of the state university system.
NU Regent Paul Kenney, who presented the awards at a banquet Friday, said both coaches set standards of excellence that carried forward long after they retired. Both programs have nation-leading sellout streaks due to work by Devaney and Pettit to promote their sports.
Mike Devaney, one of Bob Devaney’s two sons, detailed how his father, a native of Saginaw, Michigan, worked in a foundry and was planning a career as a boxer before eventually going to college and taking a job as a teacher. His hiring, he said, was on the condition that he coach the football team.
Bob Devaney coached at four Michigan high schools, winning state titles, and on Duffy Daugherty’s staff at Michigan State before becoming head coach at the University of Wyoming.

Prior to taking over at Nebraska, Mike Devaney said his father watched film of the NU team’s 1961 season. His father, he said, couldn’t believe that the team, which had talented players like Bob Brown and Larry Kramer, had won only three games that year.
Bob Devaney coached at NU until 1972, winning eight Big Eight titles, playing in nine bowl games and claiming national championships in 1970 and 1971. He later served as NU’s athletic director from 1967 to 1992.
Mike Devaney said his father criss-crossed the state to build support for the football team and make “Go Big Red” a state motto. His father, he said, was a masterful speaker and communicator who made everyone in the audience feel like he was talking to them.
Pettit, a 79-year-old native of Crown Point, Indiana, got a teaching job at Louisburg College in North Carolina on the condition that he coach the golf, tennis and volleyball teams.
In volleyball, he molded a group of players who had never played the sport, winning the state junior college title after losing the first set of the season, 0-15.
Pettit famously applied for the head volleyball coaching job at Nebraska in 1977 after the women’s basketball coach at Louisberg, Paul Sanderford (who would later coach at Nebraska), found an advertisement for the Husker opening in a waste basket.

Over 22 seasons at Nebraska, Pettit built the Huskers into a national power in a sport then dominated by teams on the West Coast. He frequently recruited players who were great athletes in other sports, training them into great volleyball players.
Pettit’s teams won 21 conference titles, qualified for the NCAA tournament 17 times, and played in six final fours, winning it all in 1995 over Texas.
Now retired in Fort Collins, Colorado, Pettit is a published author and poet who produces a regular podcast on leadership and volleyball called “Inside the Coaching Mind.”
In his comments, Pettit said Lincoln business owners never said no to helping build the volleyball program by buying tickets, sponsoring tournaments, purchasing a new scoreboard and bringing in ranked teams to play the Huskers.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)Public employees in West Virginia are getting fleeced on health care after a decade of neglect by the Legislature. If you know how insurance works, you see we must bring more people into the insurance pool to boost revenues and secure our public benefits. It is time to embrace “PEIA for All.” (#PEIAforAll!)
The Public Employees Insurance Agency (PEIA) is a participant in the health insurance marketplace. It should act like one. Allow private employers and individuals to become insured under PEIA. Charge reasonable premiums. Administer claims prudently. Watch the balance sheet brighten.
In the private sector, we have a saying: “Grow or die.” Tragically, the Republican Party is on the side of letting public benefits die. But nothing could be worse for public employees or the private sector in the Mountain State.
PEIA for All would raise revenue to improve public benefits, while providing more affordable coverage for the tens of thousands who will suffer from the impending loss of health care tax credits, and increasing access to health care generally. Talk about killing multiple birds with one stone. PEIA could charge affordable premiums for new non-state employers that would generate crucial cashflow to support public benefits.
Reasonable Republicans have historically embraced this path forward for PEIA, sometimes referred to as “PEIA Plus.” Just run the program like a business with some public values. It’s not privatization (you can’t privatize because you need the public assurance of affordability and value for the ultimate plan beneficiaries). It’s not rocket science. It’s good government. And it’s a lifeline for our businesses, which need healthy employees but often cannot afford retail insurance prices.
Health insurance premiums are about to skyrocket for tens of thousands of West Virginians due to the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credit. The unsubsidized part of those premiums will increase more in West Virginia than any other state. So PEIA has the chance to charge substantial premiums while still outperforming the private market next year. Employers could make a modest contribution to defray part of the premiums. The state could further reduce premiums by offering the federally-funded reinsurance plan that reduces premiums by paying for high-dollar claims. 
This would all enable PEIA to collect a commercially adequate amount of premiums to operate with reasonable margins while offering coverage for public and private employers, and individuals. Since PEIA doesn’t have to pay off shareholders, any surpluses could be devoted to defraying further premium hikes for plan beneficiaries, or improving coverages. PEIA could structure these as parallel plans for public, private and individual participants.
You might ask: “why would anyone oppose PEIA for All?” The only reason that comes to mind is if they simply oppose all public involvement in solving public challenges. Luckily, the vast majority of West Virginians don’t feel that way based on the broad and longstanding public support for PEIA. We are already running a public health insurance program through PEIA, so it’s not a vast leap. It’s very doable.
Indeed, the independent analysts recently retained by the state (BDO) and the PEIA Board both seem to acknowledge the value of PEIA for All. First, the recent BDO report (p. 31) suggested that plan finances would improve by increasing the cost-share for non-state participants (which is exactly what happens, but over a larger population, with PEIA for All). 
Second, the current proposal by the PEIA Board entails requiring non-state employers to include all of their employees on the plan in order to promote solvency (another illustration of the principle that the more people you have paying reasonable premiums, the more solvent the insurance pool). These stakeholders are already converging on the obvious structural solution to secure the long-term solvency of this insurance pool: expanding it to cover a younger, larger, healthier population.
West Virginia simply cannot afford to keep wasting all our income on overpriced, unsubsidized, necessary services like health care, child care and utilities. PEIA for All is part of a broader strategy for supercharging our economy by enabling households and businesses to focus on their core goals. Step One: PEIA for All. Step Two: Guarantee child care so people can afford to work and businesses can thrive. Step Three: Cap the cost of utilities (invest in efficiency, etc.) so high bills don’t keep us at a competitive disadvantage. These steps help to ensure more workers are receiving a living wage.
This is how we flourish. This is the way forward. In 2026, West Virginians can vote for this change, or resign ourselves to crushing costs and economic pain.

Those potential illegal voters account for 0.0001% of all registered voters in Tennessee.
Responding to a letter from President Donald Trump congratulating him for using the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system, Hargett thanked the president for improving the system to help Tennessee “protect our voter rolls.” 
“The collaborative spirit and speed with which your administration worked to improve SAVE and make it available is unprecedented,” Hargett said in a letter posted on Facebook.
Hargett said his office is referring those who might not be U.S. citizens to the FBI for investigation.

The SAVE system is designed to help states verify citizenship and immigration status of people seeking government benefits. But states such as Tennessee use it to check people’s citizenship status for voting, even though some groups question its effectiveness.
The Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy institute that advocates for democracy and justice, reports that information from SAVE is sometimes incomplete or old, making the program useful but not fully reliable in determining a person’s citizenship. 
The institute also said a move by the Department of Homeland Security to expand the amount of information accessible through SAVE increases the risk of states erroneously purging eligible voters from their rolls.
Tennessee had about 4.3 million registered voters as of June after purging some 276,000, according to the Secretary of State’s website.
Trump offered the program free of charge to states in March with an executive order to protect election integrity and make sure only U.S. citizens cast ballots.
“You were one of the first leaders to step up and protect the integrity of our elections by using the SAVE system — and I commend you for your decisive action,” Trump said in his letter to Hargett.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)West Virginians insured through the federal government’s health insurance marketplace should expect some sticker shock when shopping for 2026 plans, but experts say it’s important they follow what’s happening in Washington. 
Open enrollment for 2026 began Nov. 1 and continues through Jan. 15.
West Virginia has the highest rates in the country for insurance plans on healthcare.gov. Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and Caresource, the only two West Virginia companies who offer plans there, have been approved for rate increases in 2026  — 13.9% for Highmark and 7.6% for Caresource.
The federal government has been shut down for a month as Congress remains deadlocked over whether to extend enhanced premium tax credits that have made Affordable Care Act plans more affordable. They could still extend the credits. If they don’t, they’ll expire at the end of the year. 
West Virginia families of all sizes and incomes will see a spike in their monthly premiums by as much as ten times for the same plan next year, according to an analysis of 2026 plans by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. Without the enhanced premium credits, households in the state will see their premiums increase by 133%, according to the Center on Budget and Policy.
“West Virginia is among the state’s most impacted if Congress fails to extend the enhanced premium tax credits that help make health coverage affordable for about 60,000 West Virginians who don’t get health coverage through their job or Medicare or Medicaid,” said Kelly Allen, director of the Center on Budget and Policy. “We have some of, I think, the highest commercial health care costs in the country, which is why we’re disproportionately impacted.”
As an example, a 60-year-old couple with no kids who earns $85,000 a year in Raleigh County would see their monthly premium jump from $601 per month in 2025 to $4,646 per month in 2026 without the tax credits extended.
A 30-year-old single woman in Raleigh County earning $35,000 per year would see her monthly premiums increase from $95 per month this year to $218 per month next year.
Customers may want to wait and see
Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University, said people who buy their health insurance on the marketplace should pay attention to what’s happening with Congress.
“It’s hard to ask people to do that because watching what Congress is doing is like watching two toddlers squabble in the playground,” Corlette said. “But this year it really is important because  it will significantly affect your finances if Congress does extend [the enhanced premium tax credits].”
Allen said people should contact their representatives about the importance of extending the enhanced premium tax credits. 
Corlette noted that even if Congress does extend the subsidies, it’s unlikely to take effect immediately, she said. This year, it might be worth waiting until a little later into the open enrollment period before shopping for coverage. 
“[Don’t wait] too late,” she said. “You have until Dec. 15 to sign up for Jan. 1 coverage. So don’t wait too long, but it probably doesn’t make sense to try to buy something [on] Nov. 1 this year.”
Louise Norris, a health policy analyst with healthinsurance.org, said people may want to log on to healthcare.gov, update their information and familiarize themselves with the plans that are available and what they cover. 
“That’s a really good first step, because the actual plans themselves are not up in the air,” Norris said. “All of that is finalized like in terms of what the policies cover, what the deductibles are, the out of pocket, maximums, the provider networks, what drugs are covered, that sort of detail isn’t going to change.”
But there’s no wrong way to enroll, she said. If people pick a plan now and Congress decides to approve the enhanced premium tax credits later, people can go back and pick a different plan, she said. 
“Regardless of what you do, just keeping an eye on how this is evolving is important,” Norris said. “So don’t look at it now and decide you can’t afford it, and then forget about it. Definitely stay on top of it. Because the numbers are pretty alarming.”
Less help enrolling available this year
This year, the Trump administration cut a federal program that assists people enrolling in marketplace plans by 90%, from $100 million to $10 million. 
“The bottom line is that it’s going to be a lot harder for people to find anyone to help them through the process, which for many families, can be complicated and confusing,” Corlette said. “When you’re applying for, in this case, tax credits, the application can be a little bit confusing.”
In West Virginia, First Choice Services received $125,000 this year to run the state’s Affordable Care Act navigator program, compared to $1.25 million last year, Corlette said. 
Jeremy Smith, program director for First Choice Services, said the agency closed four of its five offices around the state and laid off most of the staff because of the budget cut. They plan to do most of their work over the phone instead of in person, he said. 
“We won’t be able to travel and meet with people or go around and do the enrollment events and communities like we used to,” he said. 
First Choice Services also runs the state’s suicide lifeline, substance abuse treatment helpline and problem gambler helpline, so the agency is set up well to help people by phone, he said. 
Last year First Choice staffed 12 full time employees in the navigator program. This year, the federal funding supports one and a half full time workers, Smith said. Together with some funding assistance from state foundations, First Choice Services has five or six people helping with enrollment, Smith said. 
“We’re still trying everything we can to help as many people as possible,” Smith said. He added that the agency has partnerships with federally qualified health centers around the state that can help people sign up if navigators aren’t available to help. 
Smith added that because of the staffing cuts, First Choice also put more resources this year on its website, wvnavigator.com to help people through the enrollment process.
“So [if] somebody wants more information on how to enroll in a marketplace plan, they can visit our website and kind of follow the prompts and hopefully be able to get enrolled themselves,” he said. “And then if they do need us, we’re still here.”
No coverage for immigrant families 
Also new this year, lawfully present immigrant families who are ineligible for Medicaid because they have been in the United States less than five years and earn less than the federal poverty line are no longer eligible for tax subsidies on a marketplace plan. That will make coverage unaffordable for many of them. 
About 10,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival recipients were also terminated from coverage beginning in August after the Trump administration reversed a Biden-era policy and stripped them of their eligibility for coverage.
Higher tax penalties possible
This year, marketplace customers may face higher penalties if their actual income turns out to be more than what they project when applying for health coverage. To determine how much financial help in tax credits customers are eligible for, they have to estimate what their income for next year will be.
This year, there will be no limit on the amount low income people are required to pay back to the IRS if they turn out to make more money than they projected. 
For a lot of people who don’t get a steady paycheck from a large employer, estimating what they’ll make next year can be a challenge, Corlette said. 
“One of the major changes that Congress made this year was to basically say, if you guess wrong what your income is going to be, and you end up getting more premium tax credits than we think you’re entitled to, the IRS can basically come back and ask for that money back,” she said. 
Customers would pay the IRS back on their 2027 tax return.
People who realize next year that their income projection is off should contact the marketplace and update that information, so the marketplace can adjust the subsidy in real time, Norris said.
“That way you’re not scrambling to pay back a big amount of money when you file your taxes,” Norris said.

(Screenshot courtesy of C-SPAN)I believe there is a nearly universal rule in Idaho politics, at least there once was before the white nationalist, anything goes Republicanism came to dominate the state. 
Richard Stallings
The rule is simple: for a Democrat to win in Idaho a Republican must screw up big time, and then a competent, capable, courageous Democrat can win office and even re-election. Richard Stallings proved the rule.
Stallings, who died last week at 85, was a little-known Ricks College – now Brigham Young University-Idaho – history professor when he challenged long-time Republican Congressman George Hansen in 1982. Hansen, a physical giant of a man as well as an ethical pigmy, had held the eastern Idaho congressional seat off and on since 1964. He’d lost to Frank Church in a Senate race in 1968 and then served in the Nixon administration before returning to Congress in the 1970s. 
You could write Big George’s legislative accomplishments on one-quarter of a sticky note, but his legal and ethical transgressions fill a library, including campaign law violations, bank fraud and failure to file many years of tax returns. Not all of Hansen’s troubles were known when Stallings unsuccessfully challenged him and eventually narrowly beat him in 1984, but enough was known that just enough conservative eastern Idahoans grew tired of Hansen’s shenanigans. Still, Stalling won his first election by 133 votes in a year when Ronald Reagan carried every Idaho county and racked up 72% of the vote. 
Stallings ran against a red tide, even if in his case it was a tide impeded by a crook. 
Once in office, the low-key, soft spoken history teacher did many smart things. He got a seat on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and mastered the details of farm and water policy to the great benefit of many of his constituents. He focused – as hardly any member of Congress does these days – on answering his mail and meeting the voters. He displayed an independent streak by staying true to his pro-life position, while refusing to knuckle under to White House pressure to support Reagan’s misguided adventures in Central America. 
‘A true public servant’: Former Idaho congressman Richard Stallings dies at 85

Once in office Stallings demonstrated not only legislative aptitude, but electoral prowess. He defeated solid Republicans and rolled up impressive 60%-plus margins in his last two U.S. House races. Republicans targeted him repeatedly, but he prevailed. Some took to calling the squeaky-clean congressman “Dick,” rather than the Richard he always used. I always thought it was a subtle way to demean Stalling’s quiet, formal, professional demeanor. 
The obituaries have correctly stressed the Stallings penchant for public service. He was a giver, not a taker, serving in a variety of local, state and national roles after the end of his days on a ballot. 
Arguably, Stallings’ one great political mistake was a run for the U.S. Senate in 1992. Pure conjecture here, but Stallings might well have held his eastern Idaho House seat for several more terms.
Instead he lost to young, up and coming Boise Mayor Dirk Kempthorne in a Senate race that was never close. I watched that race closely and spent a few days on the trail with Stallings, and became convinced he had started too late and never became truly comfortable as a statewide candidate. 
That 1992 campaign proved another old political rule, at least it used to be true before extreme partisanship came to rule every Idaho election. The rule: Rexburg is a lot different than Lewiston, a candidate known and respected in Bear Lake County isn’t automatically accepted in Bonner County. 
Now having an R behind your name is all it takes in most corners of the state. In such a political environment George Hansen could still be in office. 
Richard Stallings last political act, fittingly, came earlier this year when he joined another good and capable former Idaho Democratic congressman, Larry LaRocco, to tour the state giving voters who can’t get an audience with their elected representative a forum to raise questions and speak out about the many and awful excesses of the current administration. 
Dear congressional delegation, here’s what we learned from 11 in-person town halls throughout Idaho

The 11 in person town hall meetings stood in bleak contrast to the shameless contempt shown for their constituents, at the most important political moment in our lifetimes, by U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch and Congressmen Russ Fulcher and Mike Simpson. 
The Stallings-LaRocco meetings brought out hundreds of Idahoans who long for engagement and common sense but instead are ignored by the people who are supposed to serve them. As Stallings and LaRocco wrote in an open letter to the Idaho delegation after the meetings: “Your avoidance of Idahoans has resulted in your further isolation from the common sense and pragmatism of Idahoans.” 
No one can say that Richard Stallings avoided his voters or refused to confront the issues of his day – and ours. 
Idaho has gone so far down the MAGA rabbit hole of conspiracy, characterlessness and cultishness that it can seem impossible that a moderate, sensible, constituent-oriented Democrat might again represent the state in Congress. But it was once thought nearly impossible to elect a Democrat in eastern Idaho, too. 
If Richard Stallings were running today one suspects the history teacher and civic minded citizen in him would counsel us to return to basic principles – reverence for a functioning constitutional system with real checks and balances, a belief that America’s best days are ahead if we return to a politics that values character, honesty and restraint and a conviction that we really are one vast nation with all the potential and challenges that have always been a part of the American story. He would try to bring out the best in us, not play to the worst of our fears or passions. 
We should mourn the passing of good people who espoused and lived such ideals. Richard Stallings was such a person.

Chipman announced her candidacy for the Shelby County Commission Thursday. 
If Chipman wins, she will join Nashville Metro Council Member Olivia Hill as the only other transgender elected official in the state. 
“Representation is really important,” Chipman said. “One of the things I’ve tried to do is to show up and show that trans people are just like everybody else: I’m a wife, a mom, I’m a tech entrepreneur.”
The number of transgender women in public office in the U.S. did not increase between May 2024 and June 2025, while the number of trans men in office increased by one, according to a report from the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute. 
Technology consultant Lena Chipman is attempting to become the second transgender Tennessean elected to office. (Photo: Lena Chipman)
Chipman is running to replace Michael Whaley — who is term-limited from running again — in District 13, which encompasses east and midtown Memphis.
She said part of what influenced her to run is to provide a voice for marginalized communities during a time in which the federal government — including a task force in Memphis — is focused on deporting immigrants. 
“You understand what it’s like to be targeted by the government,” she said. “You learn that empathy for how other people are living their lives and you learn it’s important to use your privilege to benefit others.” 
Hill said that when she ran for office in Nashville, she focused on outworking criticism or pushback she received for being trans. 
“I tried my best to distance myself as a trans human and to focus on showing I was a qualified person,” said Hill, an engineer and U.S. Navy veteran. “I said ‘these are the skills I have; I’m just looking for a right to sit at the table and fix the broken parts of Nashville.’”
The principal of a startup company, Chipman is one of three candidates who have declared their candidacies for the seat: Amber Huett-Garcia, currently a member of the Memphis-Shelby County Schools Board, announced her campaign via Facebook. LaGina Mitchell Scott, a school counselor, is also running. 
Chipman has lived in Memphis since 1980 and holds both a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree from the University of Memphis. She is a board member for the MidSouth LGBT Chamber of Commerce. 
She said she hopes she can serve as an example for other transgender Tennesseans who aspire to office. 
“Being transgender is just one part of my identity but I hope it inspires another generation of leadership,” she said. “I’m breaking a glass ceiling that exists.”
The primary election for Shelby County offices, including mayor and county commissioners, is scheduled for May 5, 2026; the general election will be Aug. 6, 2026.

(Getty Images)Even if their SNAP cards don’t work at the grocery store because of a political stalemate in Washington D.C., most Kentuckians receiving federal food benefits will have to start submitting proof of work this month, even as the federal government stays shut down. 
Effective Nov. 1, veterans, the homeless, recent foster care youth and adults ages 54-64 are no longer exempt from work requirements to receive food benefits for themselves and their families through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
The expanded work requirements, mandated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are expected to cost 114,000 Kentuckians their food assistance, policy experts say.
Work reporting requirements are not new, but the sweeping budget bill passed by Congress this summer expanded who has to abide by them. 
In Kentucky, the impact will be “substantial,” says Cabinet for Health and Family Services spokeswoman Kendra Steele.
Under previous rules, SNAP recipients in 117 of Kentucky’s counties — most of the state — were exempt from work reporting requirements due to the local unemployment rates, Steele said. 
Now, people who get SNAP benefits in all 120 counties will have to comply with the new work and reporting requirements. 
They and new applicants who meet the following criteria will be required to work or participate in Kentucky’s Employment and Training program for at least 80 hours a month:

The recipient is age 18 through 64 years and 11 months, an expansion from the previous age range of 18–54.
The recipient is not living with a dependent child under the age of 14, down from the previous standards of under 18. 
The recipient is not working at least 80 hours per month.
The recipient is not meeting another exemption (like disability, being unfit for work and exempt from work registration). 

“Previously exempted categories, such as veterans, the homeless, and former foster youth, no longer meet exemption requirements,” Steele said. 
Jessica Klein
Jessica Klein, a policy associate with the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the “red tape” could result in 114,000 losing their benefits based on analyses from 2018, when work reporting requirements led to 30,000 people losing benefits. 
“The 25 years that work reporting requirements have been included in SNAP policy, have pointed to the evidence that it doesn’t improve work outcomes, it doesn’t create new or meaningful employment, and what it does do is create that additional paperwork that people have to fill out on a monthly basis,” Klein said. “This is in addition to all of the other documentation and paperwork that people in this population have to submit for SNAP and for other programs that they participate in.” 
Work reporting requirements “are not effective at improving work outcomes,” Klein said, “but they’re very effective at creating red tape for participants.”  
People who don’t meet the requirements will “only be eligible to receive SNAP for 3 months during a 36-month period unless they become exempt,” according to the cabinet. 
Shannon Moody, chief officer of strategic initiatives with Kentucky Youth Advocates, said the expansion rules will put a “squeeze” on elderly Kentuckians who are raising minor relatives — a population already seeing other assistance cut. 
The increased work requirements will put an additional strain on grandparents who aren’t working or have left the workforce “in order to care for their relative kids in some kinship situations,” Moody said. 
Former foster youth, who until now were exempt from work reporting, already have lower educational attainment than their non-foster peers, Moody said. 
She worries they will have to choose between school and eating: “it’s pretty tough to juggle both” work and school, she said. 
Shannon Moody, Kentucky Youth Advocates’ Chief Officer of Strategic Initiatives.
“We definitely have some concerns when it comes to our former foster youth. They are not typically working in the highest paid jobs, they are not typically accessing a lot of other supports,” she said. “We know that they’re often coping with the traumas that they’ve dealt with as children that are affecting their ability to care for themselves.” 
These new rules are taking effect even during a government shutdown that threatens to cut off SNAP benefits altogether in November, Klein said. 
“I think that might be getting lost in the stress that is coming to families when having to manage not having the benefits that they need,” she said. 
The Trump administration said funding for SNAP ran out on Nov. 1, leaving around 563,080 Kentuckians to face even worse food insecurity. Gov. Andy Beshear and other Democrats sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the decision to halt funding for the program and two judges ruled Friday it was illegal to withhold money in a SNAP contingency fund. President Donald Trump said his administration was awaiting further guidance from the courts and that in any event  SNAP benefits, which are loaded onto electronic benefit transfer cards, would be delayed in November because of the government shutdown.
Regardless of the shutdown’s effect on SNAP, people who cannot meet work reporting requirements and lose SNAP benefits will likely lean more heavily on food pantries, which are already struggling to keep up with the demands of a state with high rates of food insecurity, experts said. 
“I think we are going to see families turn to food banks, families turning to other assistance within communities that doesn’t rely on federal or state funding,” Moody said. “And then, unfortunately, we may be seeing people just going hungry; kids being sent to school having not eaten at all since their previous school meal or breakfast.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Providence School Board is looking for candidates to fill the seat now held by board member Melissa Hughes whose term expires at the end of the year. 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office announced last week that the city is now accepting applications, which can be filled out online through Friday, Dec. 12, at 4:30 p.m.
“We are looking for School Board members who represent our city’s vibrant neighborhoods and who will serve as strong advocates for our students, families and educators,” Smiley said in a statement.
When the school board was reshaped into a half-elected, half-appointed body during the 2024 elections, both new and old members were set to serve staggered terms. The new board structure assigns two board members (one elected, one appointed) for each school board region, which each comprise three wards in the city. Hughes shares Region 1 with elected board member Corey Jones. The region covers Wards 1, 2 and 3 in Providence.    
Hughes has served on the board since January 2024, and was reappointed by Smiley earlier this year for a one-year term that will end Jan. 1, 2026. 
The candidate selected to fill her seat will be appointed to a full three-year term which expires in 2029.
Hughes said in a statement last week that she will not seek reelection, arriving at the decision “after careful consideration and discussion with my family.”   
“As a parent of two now high school students in Providence Public Schools since kindergarten, I know firsthand that we are in a critical moment for PPSD [Providence Public School District], one that requires an unwavering focus on doing what is right for students to sustain and build upon the momentum of the last few years,” Hughes wrote.
Hughes serves on the board’s Finance Committee, and was previously the board’s secretary as well as chair of its Policy Committee. She previously served on PPSD’s Parent Advisory Council and the parent teacher organizations at Classical High School, Nathan Bishop Middle School, and Vartan Gregorian Elementary School — all schools her children have attended.
Hughes bundled a warning into her parting words, noting the school board’s pivotal role in the Providence school district, which has been under state control since 2019. The school board continues to advocate for a quicker return to local control of the schools, which is currently set to end at latest in 2027.       
“[A]s conversations continue around transition back to local governance, I have serious concerns that the focus remains on adult power and control rather than centering students first,” Hughes wrote. “Six years later, there is still no clear collaborative plan amongst local officials for how they will work together for the good of all PPSD students, even though overlapping, conflicting decision making within Providence was a core issue motivating the state intervention in 2019.”
Will Providence get its schools back sooner or later? Depends which side you ask.

Hughes characterized the “systemic design flaw” of the district as “conflict amongst local officials continuously fighting for control of school decisions for the sake of control itself.” Hughes said she feared progress “will stall or regress” without a clear plan for the district. 
All applicants will need to participate in a public forum on Dec. 16, from 5 to 7 p.m, to be considered for the role. The forum will be held at the Providence Career and Technical Academy. The public can submit questions ahead of time for candidates, who will have a moderated discussion during the forum.  
After the forum, the selection committee will send its recommendations to Smiley, who will then forward his nominees to the Providence City Council for review.

(Getty Images)As we approach the holidays, there are Kentuckians who won’t be focused on lights and tinsel but on food and shelter.  While we await the opening of the federal government and the actual receipt of federal assistance through the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP), there are other serious issues in the day-to-day lives of many in poverty.  
As headlines seem to change hourly regarding critically needed resources for low-income individuals, I feel compelled to highlight another available opportunity that would make a critical difference in the lives of Kentucky’s vulnerable families.  
First, I’d like to thank Gov. Andy Beshear for his allocation of $5 million in emergency reserve funding to help those with SNAP.  Kentuckians are struggling with food insecurity; losing SNAP would be detrimental to many. To put that in perspective, for a family of three to be eligible for SNAP, their gross income must be no more than 130% of poverty or less than $3,000 a month.
According to Feeding America, there are 213,830 children and a total of 753,410 Kentuckians facing hunger. These alarming statistics were gathered before we heard that the SNAP funding could lapse.
In late September, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) announced a 35% reduction in the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP) which provides modest cash payments to poor families. Those critical reductions became effective this month.  
KTAP comes from federal funding known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The eligibility income for a family of four for KTAP is $1,315 a month.
Many low-income families rely on both KTAP and SNAP; it’s help for food and shelter. I want to note that 42% of kinship families utilize KTAP.
So, what can be done?  Recently, there was a publicized funding shortage for the Senior Meal Program managed by the CHFS.  Kentucky Budget Director John Hicks identified $25 million in state general funds that were originally tagged but not used for a Medicaid study. The governor used approximately $9.1 million of those funds to restore funding for senior meals.
Now there’s $15.9 million remaining and available. Recently, Auditor Allison Ball and Ombudsman Jonathan Grate recommended that the $14.7 million be used to implement a kinship law known as Senate Bill 151 and the remaining $1.2 million go towards supplementing KTAP.
So why should we follow those recommendations? 
SB 151 is a straightforward kinship bill. It ensures that children have a voice as to where they are placed and that caregivers — often elderly grandparents — have time to understand critical paperwork during moments of crisis. It potentially keeps kids from losing thousands of dollars in resources that were meant for them.  
As 42% of kinship families utilize KTAP, SB 151 could give SNAP and KTAP some relief because future kids and caregivers might not need these programs once they get the help promised by SB 151. Implementing SB 151 is both a strategic and operational approach.
Kinship kids are vulnerable. Kinship care is when a child lives with a relative or family friend other than a biological parent. Kinship families are what holds our child welfare system together. Caregivers step in with limited resources and do so at an enormous personal sacrifice. They are a lifeline to many children. Our state has twice the national rate of child maltreatment and twice the national rate of children in kinship care.   
If looking for legislative approval in using these funds, I am confident that the General Assembly would be eager to see solutions because:

Lawmakers unanimously passed SB 151 last year and have been waiting for its implementation. 
Legislators got involved when they heard of the Senior Meal Program reductions 
KTAP reductions were of concern and discussed during the Oct. 225 Interim Joint Committee for Children and Families.  

Of course, there are possible variations for using the available funds in implementing SB 151 and KTAP but the point is that there’s more we can do.  
As for keeping promises, I’d like to remind the governor that in October 2023 during the gubernatorial debate, when asked about kinship families, he said “we need to do everything we can to ensure their needs are met.”  
Using the available funds for some or all of SB 151 and KTAP is a humane example of doing everything we can. Especially considering the circumstances we are in today.
Every day children are losing access to resources to sustain their lives. These are issues that shouldn’t be delayed for another year, another month, or even next week. 
The funding exists. The kinship law exists. The governor has the authority and opportunity. The needs are clearly present and urgent.  He did it for SNAP and the Senior Meals Program. He should do it now — for the kids.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1153457088-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 05:56:37.582025

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Supreme Court will take its time to decide a case that could keep Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments from serving on three Virginia university governing boards, or allow them to serve after being sidelined since June. The high court heard oral arguments in the case on Thursday.
In August, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection, appealed to the court after the Fairfax County Circuit Court suspended eight of the governor’s appointments from serving on the governing boards at the Virginia Military Institute, George Mason University and the University of Virginia.
Judge temporarily suspends appointees senators rejected from serving on Va. college governing boards

The lower court ruled in favor of nine Democratic state senators, some of whom serve on the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, who requested the temporary injunction and said the committee’s decision to block the board nominees was a “definitive” refusal, according to court records. Democrats on the committee rejected the appointments due to concerns about their backgrounds, ideological leanings and qualifications while Republicans on the committee supported the appointees.
The justices spent roughly 30 minutes with the parties asking about the legislative procedures, constitutional interpretation and limits of judicial intervention in legislative matters involving the case. The court must now decide whether the Democrats’ challenge is valid and whether they have the right to bring it forward. 
“I didn’t think that the justices, by their questions, were shedding a lot of light on where they might be going,” said Carl Tobias, a professor and expert in constitutional law at the University of Richmond. “I don’t know how this is going to go, or the timing.”
Tobias said both parties’ oral arguments were consistent with their stated briefs throughout the ongoing ordeal that has stretched through the summer. The central question of the case is whether a vote by the 15-member state Senate Privileges and Elections Committee constituted a “refusal to confirm” or “no” by the General Assembly under the Virginia Constitution’s Refusal Clause. 
In Virginia, when the governor nominates a candidate to a board or commission to a seat, they need the General Assembly’s approval. Common practice by the General Assembly is to vote on the list of gubernatorial candidates in both chambers during the legislative session. In this situation, the lawmakers rejected the appointees outside of the regular session, a move they said would protect Virginia’s institutions of higher learning from partisan attacks, including those launched after President Donald Trump’s administration initiated several investigations into Virginia’s universities, primarily the University of Virginia and George Mason University. 
The governor and Miyares said the action was outside the bounds of the law. A Fairfax County Circuit Court in June temporarily suspended the board appointees from serving as the matter plays out.
Governor’s office responds to Senate Dems’ ‘illogical’ rejection of Youngkin appointees

In court Thursday, Miyares’ office representing the three governing board rectors, argued that the circuit court’s decision was incorrect, asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction and that the committee’s vote did not meet the requirement for a final refusal because there were other ways for appointments to be confirmed. The attorney general is seeking to vacate the suspension.
Attorneys representing the lawmakers are hoping the court will uphold the lower court’s decision.
Tobias said the attorney general’s petition avoided the arguments Democrats are making about the committee’s longstanding practice and how state law supports them. Instead, it focuses on the fact that the Democratic Senators lacked standing to pursue the claims and should have used a different kind of writ.
Miayres’ office made a significant amount of “contingent arguments” to the court on Thursday, Tobias said, and “maybe (the justices will) be convinced by that, but maybe not.”
Tobias said that, on average, cases have taken between a month and three months to decide when there is disagreement among the justices.
The timing of the decision is also significant because in January, the next governor and new House members will join senators in considering future college board appointments.
Should the court overturn the suspension, the decision could create uncertainty about some appointments that were in line to fill the multiple vacancies at UVA, GMU and the Virginia Military Institute. In total, the Senate committee rejected 22 of the governor’s appointments.
“If it’s that strong a ruling in favor of the governor’s appointments, there may be an issue that arises there,” Tobias said. “So potentially, there could be more (appointments) than there are vacancies, and then I guess somebody is going to have to make a choice about who waits.”

(Photo courtesy VPAP)We Virginians are about to elect our 75th governor, the first woman to hold the office. For those not yet up to speed, you can learn quite a lot about Democrat Abigail Spanberger or Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in very short order.
For instance, in two or three clicks — less than five seconds — you can see how many millions of dollars their campaigns have raised, who gave each the most and how they’ve spent it. That alone tells you who will have the next governor’s ear the next four years.
We take that knowledge for granted now. “Just VPAP it,” we say, using the acronym for the Virginia Public Access Project as a verb just as off-handedly as we’d say, “Google it.”
What’s amazing to folks of my advancing years is how relatively new all of this is and the unlikely way VPAP evolved out of a journalistic aspiration to democratize essential information about who runs our state and local governments, and the money (and influence) behind them.
Consider: Of the 74 men who’ve enjoyed the honorific “His Excellency” (it’s actually a thing!), universal and free online access to detailed, curated, analyzed and actionable campaign finance data has existed only since the election of governor No. 68, Jim Gilmore, 28 years ago.
The data was there. It was on paper in filing cabinets in the offices of the State Board of Elections (now the State Department of Elections). Anyone was free to inspect the tens of thousands of pages, stacked feet high, Monday through Friday during business hours (except, of course, on government holidays).
That was the Virginia way. The commonwealth had resisted reforms to limit the amounts of donations to candidates, as the federal system does. Rather, in Virginia, the rule has always been to give what you want but disclose all you give. Sounds great until you want to actually know the details.
That began to change in 1994 and 1995 when two newspapers — the Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk and the Richmond Times-Dispatch — undertook separate, independent efforts to key data from those paper campaign finance reports into an electronic table and engage in the hot trend of the time, Computer-Assisted Reporting.
In the 1994 midterms two years into Bill Clinton’s presidency, contributions surged toward Republican House and Senate candidates, presaging a Red Wave election that gave the GOP both houses of Congress for the first time since 1955. The two papers deployed teams to review reams of paper reports ahead of the 1995 General Assembly elections and build datasets to see if that was happening in Virginia. On the Pilot’s two-person team was David Poole, a lean, bespectacled and inquisitive Capitol reporter.

The anticipated Republican Capitol Square takeover didn’t materialize in 1995. The groundbreaking data reporting the newspapers did showed that candidates spent a record $20 million with all 140 seats up for grabs. Poole’s team found that the nine political action committees that gave the most to legislative candidates directed 95% of their largesse to sitting lawmakers. The RTD wrote about how donors used PACs as a passthrough to give money without leaving footprints as direct contributions did.
Those details about the embryonic days of what became VPAP are in Poole’s book “Trusted Source,” published this year. It chronicles the growth of the nonprofit group he led from its inception into the ubiquitous presence in Virginia public life that it is now.
“We came along very early when the internet was still kind of happening. A lot of states ended up computerizing (campaign finance) records, but they’re really just giant PDF farms,” Poole said in an interview last week, noting that making sense of those bare-bones sites required users to invest hours or days of tedium to extract useful information.
Virginia’s reluctance to digitize its political money records went beyond its unhurried pace of change. Elected officials were happy to keep the data on paper only, largely rendering the “disclose” part of the Virginia way meaningless. Poole, more than anyone, forced change. He left newspapering, harnessed the growth of affordable, interconnected desktop computing and made meaningful disclosure real in Virginia.
I remember those early days. It began as a consortium of Virginia newspapers — the RTD and the Pilot joined by the Roanoke Times, the Washington Post and the (Newport News) Daily Press — brought together by my boss, Dorothy Abernathy, then the Virginia bureau chief for The Associated Press. The papers underwrote the creation of a campaign finance database they would share for the 1997 governor’s race, and Poole took the reins.
Poole foresaw the decline of ad-supported print news and a place for a nonprofit to make public campaign information public free and more accessible via the internet. According to his book, the first bare-bones iteration of VPAP.org — the nonpartisan, nonprofit portal tracking money in Virginia politics — debuted online on June 13, 1997, sourcing its data straight from the Virginia Department of Elections.
“It revolutionized covering campaign finance and politics,” said Pam Stallsmith, a retired longtime RTD Capitol correspondent and opinion page editor. VPAP made it easier for journalists to follow the money — guidance that ultimately exposed the Watergate crimes — all over the commonwealth, she said. 
VPAP is why anyone can “figure out what’s going on with the oceans of campaign cash flowing in the commonwealth,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a University of Mary Washington political science professor and former reporter. “Any time an out-of-state reporter asks me about politics in Virginia, I make sure to direct them to VPAP.”
There were constant obstacles to keeping VPAP viable. Labor-intensive data mining, accuracy checking and coding was exhausting work for a staff as small as two. Finding money to sustain its work as a 501(c)(3) charity was a constant challenge. All of that commanded Poole’s attention, sometimes on nights, weekends and holidays.
“I realized that VPAP had to be more than one guy spinning eight plates at once,” Poole said.
Capitol Square is infamous for its intrigues and shifting alliances. That’s why I believe Poole’s most amazing feat was satisfying the demands and keeping the trust of core donors and stakeholders — elected officials, political parties and professionals, lobbyists and journalists with their often conflicting roles — while keeping VPAP true to its mission as an independent, fair, nonpartisan purveyor of value-added information. A miscalculation here, an overreach there, an indiscreet word spoken near the wrong ears and everything could have imploded.
Poole retired from VPAP two years ago. He left it with a large, diverse pool of regular donors, money in the bank, and a sophisticated staff that still pushes boundaries of using interactive visuals to make an ever-wider array of data easily understood.
VPAP will be at it again tomorrow on election night. That’s when the savviest politicos inside Virginia and elsewhere will turn to the site for the most advanced, graphically compelling, instantly updated returns available to learn firsthand who will be the first to be called Her Excellency.

Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	Maine Morning Star reporters have highlighted three local ballot measures that are emblematic of larger conversations playing out elsewhere, specifically related to child care, wages and public education. 
All Maine voters will be asked two statewide referendum questions. One proposes a multitude of election law changes including the requirement to show photo identification at the polls. The second will ask voters if they would like to implement a red flag law, officially called an Extreme Risk Protection Order, which would provide another way to temporarily remove one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members.
Here’s a closer look at what voters in Greenville, Augusta and Portland will see on Tuesday’s ballot. 
Greenville child care 
In the town of Greenville, voters will consider a local ballot measure to address a key issue in their community, but also across the state: child care access. 
Maine families are wrestling with a dire lack of child care options, particularly in more rural parts of the state. Piscataquis County, where Greenville is located, is one of the most rural areas. 
Residents of the town located on the southern tip of Moosehead Lake will decide whether to approve a $1 million bond to help build a multi-use community building that would include child care and preschool. 
Known as the YES (Youth, Education and Sport) Project, the Moosehead Caring for Kids Foundation, Greenville Consolidated School and the town have already raised $3 million for the building, including from federal funds back in 2023. 
There are 16 registered providers in Piscataquis County. Greenville has two providers but none had openings based on the latest available data from May.
“In my work with child care, I’ve realized that the solution doesn’t just lie with the state or the federal government,” said Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York), who has sponsored several child care measures during his tenure. 
Ingwersen thinks Greenville’s approach is an example of what could be an effective local solution, though noted that it’s up to the community to decide if they want to fund it, which he thinks is also key. 
Given how critical the shortage of child care is across the state, Ingwersen said it makes sense for funding to come from an array of sources, including private donors, foundations and the communities themselves. 
“There’s good benefits in that because it lets a community sit down and, even though it takes time, it’s the community that’s deciding what’s best for itself. They know.”
Another recent example of a local model is the Margaret Chase Smith Community School in Skowhegan that opened over the summer. That school is larger. It replaced three different schools. But it was also a joint effort, in this case between MSAD 54, the Maine Department of Education and Kennebec Valley Community Action Partners. It also was also partially funded by federal dollars in addition to nearly $5 million raised by the community over multiple years.  
However, there is a role for the state to play, Ingwersen said. 
The Maine Legislature has made several changes over the years to try to address access and affordability concerns, as research has found that the costs of child care in Maine now outpace college tuition. Lawmakers are slated to consider a host of new ideas to expand access in the state at the start of next session, which begins in January.   
Augusta School Board 
Debates about transgender student participation in sports has been a key focus of school boards across Maine in recent months. In Augusta, where a third of the school board seats are on the ballot, the election could determine the future of that district’s protections for transgender students.
Three of the board’s nine seats are up for reelection. 
The school board has been debating whether to protect inclusion for trans students, allowing them access to teams and school facilities aligning with their gender identity, as Maine law requires. Those conversations have grown increasingly tense. For example, earlier this month, three attendees stripped off their clothes during a public meeting to make a statement about what they described as the discomfort of cisgender students when asked to share spaces with trans students. 
However, the board ultimately voted to retain its inclusive policy. 
One of the candidates on Tuesday’s ballot is at-large incumbent Rita Pello, a Title I coordinator and regional program manager at the Maine Department of Education who is among the board members that has voted to preserve trans students’ protections. She’s being challenged by Kelly Smith, a senior tax examiner, who told the Kennebec Journal that one of her priorities is to “uphold Title IX while protecting fairness in female sports.”
In addition to Pello, at least one other incumbent has supported inclusive policies, but is being challenged by a candidate who is not, according to their public statements.
Augusta resident Katrina Ray-Saulis has been watching the school board meetings because she helps take care of a 13-year-old district student who identifies as nonbinary. The student has had an affirming experience in school so far, she said, and she wants to “make sure Augusta stays good for them.”

“If we end up voting in anti-trans candidates to the school board, we’re going to end up with board members who want to supersede state law to follow the president’s executive order,” Ray-Saulis added, referring to President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back transgender protections.
Augusta is not the district where this issue is being decided by local elections. Last year, RSU 40, which represents five towns in northern Waldo County, repealed  protections for transgender students over fierce opposition. But, in an election shortly after the vote, three of the four seats were  filled by candidates who were against  the decision and the new board reinstated the deleted policy. 
Earlier this year, several bills aiming to rescind protections for trans students failed passage in the Maine Legislature, but local districts have been considering changing their rules, and several already have, according to Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine.
While the Trump administration and others like Smith have argued that Title IX, the federal anti-discrimination law that aims to prevent sex-based discrimination, prevents the participation of transgender girls in girls’ athletics, the law does not specifically say anything about trans people. Rather, it has been interpreted by the courts to bolster protections across the country. 
“Title IX has not changed, and an executive order isn’t law. It’s just a presidential opinion,” Drew said. “And so I think these districts are going out on a limb, and they’re putting themselves in jeopardy.”
Portland minimum wage
Portland voters will be asked if they’d like to raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 an hour over the next three years.
The city’s minimum wage currently sits at $15.50 an hour. Under the proposal on Tuesday’s ballot, it would jump to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027 and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage would keep pace with cost of living increases.
Currently, the state’s minimum wage is $14.65, but the Maine Department of Labor announced in September a 45 cent increase that will take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
If voters support the measure, the Portland City Council would also be able to amend or repeal the ordinance at any time.
The question is backed by progressive organizations such as the Maine Democratic Socialists of America, but there are concerns from members of the business community. 
“Large national chains can absorb this cost, but the small businesses and nonprofits that are truly the backbone of our economy, that make Portland vibrant and that provide jobs and economic stability so many depend on they can not absorb this cost,” said Quincy Hentzel, chief executive officer of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce, during an August City Council meeting on the proposal. 
In 2020, Portland voters approved a referendum question that raised the city’s minimum wage to $15 by 2024. That ordinance, which had an effective date in 2021, can’t be amended for five years except with another referendum. 
Per Maine law and a 2016 citizens referendum, the state is required to make an annual adjustment based on the cost-of-living index for the Northeast Region. However, the cities of Portland and Rockland have had their own minimum wages, which they usually update based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

Rob Bresnahan said his proposal will be an important part of the Farm Bill 2.0 discussions.,"A dairy farm advertising milk on its barn can be seen from the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg on October 14, 2025. (Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Less than two months into President Donald Trump’s second term, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that it was cancelling a program that sent millions of dollars to Pennsylvania farmers who provide products to food banks.
The Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA) was established in 2021 as a response to the coronavirus pandemic by President Joe Biden’s administration.
In the final full month of Biden’s term, his administration agreed on the latest contract to renew the initiative. For Pennsylvania, it meant an additional three years and $13 million for the program.
The cancellation of LFPA in March resulted in bipartisan pushback from lawmakers like Gov. Josh Shapiro, all four chairs of the General Assembly’s agriculture committees (Republicans and Democrats), plus farmers and food banks, alike.
Since 2022, LFPA had provided nearly $30 million in funding to participating Pennsylvania farms to provide locally grown products to food banks, according to Shapiro’s office. Nearly 190 farms and 13 regional food banks across the state participated in this program.
Now, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, which includes U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), have crafted legislation that could revive the intent of this program.
The Local Farmers Feeding Our Communities Act would allow states, through USDA, to establish these cooperative agreements connecting farmers and producers with food distribution organizations, according to the authors of the proposal. As a result, funds will be used to purchase local, fresh, and minimally processed foods like seafood, meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fruit, and poultry. The bill also sets aside a portion of these funds to purchase food specifically from small, midsize, beginning, and veteran farmers.

Bresnahan told the Capital-Star that there’s “certainly some correlations” between this proposal and the program established under the Biden administration.
In August, while attending his first Ag Progress Days at Penn State University as a member of Congress, Bresnahan said that agriculture is about a $65 million industry in his district, based in northeast Pennsylvania.
“The average farm in our district is 179 acres, with over 95% of them being family farms,” Bresnahan said.
“The idea is we talk about hunger. We talk about the food security challenges, but sometimes we’re not talking about the local farmers that produce this,” he added. “And this is a way that we can marry two of those different ideas together.”
Chris Hoffman, president of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, is backing the effort.
“I think that is just a miraculous program that we can take from the farms, go right into feeding our friends and neighbors who are in need,” Hoffman said. “It’s really, really serious when one of seven people go to bed hungry every night in Pennsylvania.”
“And so it’s our job,” he added. “We live in the land of plenty, and so we need to make sure we have food for everyone out there.”
In addition to the Farm Bureau’s support, the bill is also backed by several other organizations including Feeding Pennsylvania, the National Milk Producers, and Save the Children.
Democrats and Republicans talk about LFPA contract cancellation differently
The effort to revive the program has earned support from both sides of the aisle, although Democrats and Republicans differ on why it met its end. 
Shapiro announced in June at the Share Food Program in Philadelphia that his administration filed a lawsuit against USDA over the cancellation.
“I’m tired of waiting for someone to stand up for our farmers and our food banks. That task falls to us,” Shapiro said. “The USDA and the Trump administration ignored our farmers, and they ignored folks who are hungry here in Pennsylvania.”
As of Oct. 30, there has not been a ruling.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-ME), one of the Democratic co-sponsors of the legislation, described the decision by the USDA to cancel the contract as an action that “pulled the rug out from under farmers and food banks.”
However, Republicans aren’t pointing the blame at Trump.

During a roundtable discussion during Ag Progress Days, Thompson promoted Bresnahan’s proposal, but said the one established by the Biden administration was not authorized by Congress. He added it was “no surprise” that under an administration change, the program could be discontinued.
“I thought they were really good ideas,” Thompson said. “I begged Secretary Vilsack, who was President Biden’s secretary of agriculture, to work with Congress to bring us those proposals, to legislate them. And he refused.”
Bresnahan said the cancellation of the contract is what inspired the bipartisan action to find a solution for a program that he thought, “was very efficient.”
“Again, I’m not in the administration, and I’m not sure how the executive branch sometimes decides what programs come and what programs go, but we thought this was something if you were to really hone in on the actual program, the Local Farmers Feeding Our Communities Act was exactly that,” he told the Capital-Star.
In late August, Bresnahan led a roundtable discussion on the proposal in his district at Brace’s Orchard in Dallas, Luzerne County. He told the Capital-Star that 10% of the revenue, about 55,000 pounds of food at Brace’s Orchard last year, was through LFPA.
“What we want to do is codify this and make it a reality in perpetuity,” he said.
What do the Food Banks think?
George Matysik is the executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia, a hunger relief organization that serves the five county region in and around Philadelphia. Some 305,000 children across 800 schools are served daily through their work with the National School Lunch Program.
He said they participated in the LFPA program over the past few years as demand has increased.
Like others participating in the program, he found out in March when it was reported by national outlets like Politico.
“We had a signed deal for this. This was a contract that we had with the USDA,” he told the Capital-Star in an interview in September. “We had already put in orders with some of the local farmers.”
“So, it wasn’t just about the cancellation,” he added. “But it was also just about how we found out, when we found out, no notice with a signed contract, all of that made it all the more challenging for us.”
Matysik said the Share Food Program, at this time, has less resources than any time in recent memory, while they’ve seen a 120% increase over the last three years for those coming to them for food assistance.

“And now you’re taking away one of the one of the programs that really helps benefit the folks that we serve, in particular, again, with fresh, local, nutritious food, and you’re ripping that away at a time when we need these types of programs more than ever,” he said.
Five months after the cancellation of the contract, Matysik told the Capital-Star that they were feeling the impact of it.
“I have never seen our warehouse as depleted as it has been over the last three months, and that’s not just because of LFPA,” he said. “That’s also a number of the other cuts that we’ve received from this administration.”
“All of those cuts, all of those cancellations for us, has added up to about eight-and-a-half million dollars per year in total food and funding that our organization would receive that we’ve had pulled away from us,” he added. “So, more than a quarter of our total food and funding has been ripped away in the course of the last six months here.”
Matysik supports Bresnahan’s proposal and said if it was enacted, they would be able to serve about one-and-a-half million more meals per year over the three-year period.
However, adding that he was “thrilled” to see the proposal, Matysik said it only addresses “one very small portion of the total cuts” made over the course of the last year to food banks.
Where does it go from here?
Thompson has said he was going to work to include the measure in Farm Bill 2.0. However, he said they had to figure out a way to pay for it, so they don’t raise taxes and increase the debt, and pointed to Farm Bill 1.0 as an example.
“I think we’re going to get there,” Thompson said. “We’re both dedicated to getting that done.”
Bresnahan told the Capital-Star that if they can’t run it as an independent piece of legislation, they would hope to incorporate it into the next farm bill.
However, he didn’t express any concern about how to pay for it.
“I think a program like this could absolutely be paid for independently by just the proper administration of the program,” he added.
Bresnahan also expressed optimism his proposal could get across the finish line.
“I do think it has a reality, more so than ever,” he said to the Capital-Star, while noting the organizations that support it and the bipartisan support. “This is an example of how government can work together.”
A specific timeline on this piece of legislation being voted upon remains to be seen.
“But I’m guaranteeing this will be an important part of the Farm Bill 2.0 discussions,” Bresnahan told the Capital-Star.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dairy-farm-turnpike-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-03 05:16:39.140400

King/Mississippi Today)Illicit drug overdoses and the deaths they cause are trending down this year, despite spikes in a handful of states, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A handful of places with rising overdoses are responding to the problem with cooperation, they say, by sharing information about overdose surges and distributing emergency medication.
“The national conversation is just about warships in the Caribbean and drones and borders,” said Nabarun Dasgupta, who studies overdose trends at the University of North Carolina. “It discounts this huge groundswell of Americans taking care of Americans. There’s a huge amount of caregiving and tending to the needs of local communities that is being done in a non-flashy way because this is hard, slow work.”
Overdose deaths have been dropping steadily since 2023. As of April, the latest date available, deaths were at 76,500 for the previous 12 months — their lowest level since March 2020. A pandemic spike in overdose deaths drove the number as high as almost 113,000 in the summer of 2023, according to federal statistics.
Overdose deaths are rising among Black and Indigenous Americans

President Donald Trump has ordered more than a dozen military strikes against boats in the open waters of the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean since Sept. 2, claiming without publicized evidence that their occupants were drug runners bringing narcotics to the United States. Nearly 60 people have been killed.
The bulk of deadly fentanyl is smuggled over the border with Mexico in passenger cars, according to a September report by the federal Government Accountability Office. Chemicals and equipment, mostly from China, are smuggled in via cargo trucks, commercial ships, airplanes and the mail, according to the report.
A more timely indicator of overdoses — nonfatal suspected overdose patients in hospital emergency departments — was down 7% this year through August compared with 2024, according to Stateline’s analysis of CDC statistics.
The nonfatal overdoses were up for the year in only a few states and the District of Columbia. The largest spikes were 17% in the district, 16% in Rhode Island, 15% in Delaware, 11% in Connecticut and 10% in New Mexico, with smaller increases in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah, New Jersey and Minnesota.
Other states saw drops in nonfatal overdoses: Maryland had the largest decrease through August, about 17%.
But Baltimore had an attention-grabbing cluster of 42 overdoses between July and October, all within the same neighborhood. No fatalities were reported. The cluster led the city to set aside $2 million in October for more mobile services, harm reduction and social supports to fight overdoses.
New studies find wide racial disparities in opioid overdose treatment

New Mexico is seeing more overdoses and more deaths than the previous year in three counties on the Colorado border. In response, New Mexico is distributing both warnings and naloxone, an opioid-overdose antidote.
Officials are giving naloxone to storekeepers near overdose sites and alerting those seeking services about the deadly threat in the local supply.
“We started planning naloxone saturation and different types of outreaches so we can hopefully stem this from getting even worse,” said David Daniels, harm reduction section manager in the New Mexico health department.
“Putting messaging directly into clients’ hands is extremely valuable. That might be, ‘If you’re choosing to use, don’t use the regular amount. Maybe you should use a quarter of it. Test it out first,’” Daniels said.
The three counties in New Mexico — which include the capital city Santa Fe, ski resort Taos and Española, the setting of the 2023 TV black comedy series “The Curse” — saw about 438 more deaths from July through September than they did during the third quarter of 2024, according to Stateline calculations. That’s more than double the 383 overdose deaths for the area during the same time period last year.
Roger Montoya, a former Democratic state representative who runs an arts nonprofit in Rio Arriba County, said most of the deaths there have been among homeless substance users.
A local hospital has responded with programs to get treatment for more people, and his own Moving Arts Española group concentrates on helping children and young people break a cycle of economic despair that often leads to addiction and homelessness, he said.
“We try to redirect and strengthen the resiliency of young people who largely are being raised by grandparents and kin because mom and dad are either dead, on the street or incarcerated,” Montoya said.
Overdose deaths are down nationally, but up in many Western states

But most states with overdose increases are still showing fewer deaths, mostly because the drug supply in the eastern United States is more likely to be cut with sedatives that don’t have the same deadly effect as fentanyl, though they can cause overdose.
The drugs linked to Baltimore’s mass overdoses were cut with an unusual, powerful sedative, according to federal testing. The sedative can cause people to lose consciousness but can’t itself be treated with reversal medication such as naloxone.
By contrast New Mexico’s tests on this year’s clusters generally found more deadly fentanyl than usual in the local supply, said Phillip Fiuty, a technical adviser on adulterant testing in the state health department.
“We’re not seeing the type of adulteration they’re experiencing on the East Coast. Once something is in New Mexico, there’s little to no adulteration,” Fiuty said.
Some East Coast states are seeing more overdoses but fewer deaths. Rhode Island warned of spikes in nonfatal overdose in August and September, but deaths through September were still lower than during the same period last year, according to state figures.
That’s not always the case. Connecticut reported a surge of both fatal and nonfatal overdoses near interstate highways in May and June.
“One of the factors is change in the illicit drug supply or bad batches. I think that’s what’s playing out now. The drug supply is increasingly unpredictable,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.

– Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials


The association has a suggested framework for community response to spikes, but cities and counties may be hampered by a new aggressiveness on enforcement and more hostility to local efforts to stop deaths, she said.
The current Trump administration has shown some reluctance to support community harm reduction techniques, she said. That includes the temporary suspension of $140 million in funds for a program called Overdose Data to Action, known as OD2A, that the first Trump administration started to sound the alarm when spikes happen.
“Given recent cuts to health care and substance use and overdose prevention services that we’re seeing, that is impacting some of the work on the ground,” Freeman said. “It’s pushing people away from being able to make the changes they need to make to change their lives. It has the potential to create more of an overdose problem.”

When you don’t inspire a community of graduates, you don’t invest in human capital. If you don’t have an educated workforce, you cannot attract industry. If you cannot attract business and industry, the health of the community and the economy of the region suffer.
DOJ sues Providence schools over teacher loan forgiveness program it says excluded white hires

As a lifelong resident of the South side of Providence who represented the area for 16 years in the General Assembly, I was disappointed to hear the U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Providence, attempting to halt the Providence Educator of Color Loan Forgiveness Program based on discrimination of white people.
This program provided up to $25,000 to newly hired teachers that identify as individuals of Asian, African American, Indigenous or Latino descent, to help pay off their student loan debt.
In a system where about 78% of the teachers are white and 82% of the students are either Black or Hispanic, it is vital to provide more inspiration through role models that look more like the student body. 










In a system where about 78% of the teachers are white and 82% of the students are either Black or Hispanic, it is vital to provide more inspiration through role models that look more like the student body. 


The program is funded privately by an endowment of $3.1 million from the Rhode Island Foundation but administered through the public school system. This is the loophole the DOJ hangs onto in order to go after the program. The Providence School system (PPSD) and the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) tried to negotiate to save the program, but the feds seemed uninterested. 
There are ways to work around the DOJ’s objections like having a non-public entity screen applicants, but this would create a roadblock in the Trump administration’s political objectives. In a petty, almost cruel move, it would sue for punitive measures by paying teachers who they say were passed over for the program. 
The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division cites blatant discrimination in its lawsuit. But it turns the issue upside down. It’s not the teachers who are the object of the program but the students. If there’s any discrimination going on, it’s towards the students. 
With unemployment among African Americans currently more than double the national rate, it is crucial to maximize opportunity in the minority community.
I ask President Trump as the leader of our country this: Do not stand in the way of developing tomorrow’s American capital and our country’s future leaders. Our competition and standing in the world depend on it.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderCampaigning for two contested seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission has intensified during the early voting period, turning a relatively quiet election cycle into a partisan fight over utility rates and energy policy.
Two Republican incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson, are being challenged by Democratic nominees Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson in an unusual off-year election delayed by litigation. Republicans fear that, since these state PSC races are being held outside major election years when voter attention to statewide races is low, local elections in Democratic-leaning cities could result in an upset.
The special election, which has attracted national attention, represents the first time since 2020 that any members of the all-GOP commission have stood for reelection in a general election. This is Fitz Johnson’s first time facing voters since he was appointed to the panel in 2021. 
Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon said in an interview that because of the unique nature of the election and likely low turnout, his focus is on raising awareness, saying that it would be disappointing to have a statewide position elected by a small fraction of voters.
“Unfortunately, there are a lot of people in the state that have no idea that these two statewide offices are up for election,” McKoon said.

Nearly 638,000 people, or about 9% of registered voters, had cast ballots during the early voting period for the 2025 general election, according to the Georgia Secretary of State election data hub. By comparison, nearly 3.8 million people voted early in the last presidential election.
High-profile Georgia Republicans have stepped in to help raise the election’s profile. After Gov. Brian Kemp headlined a rally to energize the state party and “came to (his) rescue,” as Echols said in his “Energy Matters” radio show this week, others have joined in. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene reminded her followers on social media to vote early, saying that Republicans are “skipping an extremely important election” and that “Democrats will turn Georgia into California!”
“(Kemp) has done quite a bit for me lately. He’s done a series of commercials. He’s engaging I call it ‘his machine,’ and there’s not a more popular Republican in the state of Georgia than Gov. Brian Kemp,” Echols said in the Wednesday episode titled “Tim’s future is on the line. What will happen?”
When asked if he is feeling more comfortable after the high-profile endorsements ahead of Tuesday, Echols said he’s “making slow progress.” He’s seeking another term in the District 2 seat, which represents a swath of east Georgia that goes as far north as Hart County and as far south as Savannah. 
Fitz Johnson, who is running for the District 3 seat, which includes Fulton, DeKalb and Clayton counties, has been stumping in conservative areas outside his district. The five members on the commission must live in specific regions of the state but are elected by voters statewide. Fitz Johnson said in a text message “there’s no doubt this is going to be a close election” but that he feels like he is getting his message across to voters.
“Voters clearly understand the difference between our sound conservative leadership versus Democrats’ reckless climate mandates,” he said.
The Democratic candidates have centered their campaigns on recent utility bill increases, with the Democratic Party of Georgia having a statewide “My Power Bill’s Too High” tour during the early voting period. That message echoed a $2.2 million campaign from the Georgia Conservation Voters Action Fund highlighting the current commission’s approval of six Georgia Power rate hikes in the last two years. That campaign, which launched a website linked theyraisedyourbill.com blaming the two Republican incumbents for energy bill increases, has “engaged over a million voters” ahead of Election Day, according to Allie Brown, deputy director of Georgia Conservation Voters.
“GCV Action Fund launched this campaign because we need cheaper, cleaner power. To get that, we need new leadership on the Public Service Commission,” Brown said in a statement. “Our campaign reminds voters what they already feel every month: they can’t afford more of the same. Tim and Fitz have raised our bills, and now it’s up to voters to stand up and fire them on Tuesday.”
Hubbard said his strategy for reaching voters uses specific economic data to target Georgians most affected by rising energy costs. Hubbard said that his campaign is “very much micro-targeting” Georgia Power customers.
“They don’t usually know about the PSC unless someone like us tells them about it. It’s still pretty obscure, but they all know their power bill’s gone up, and I tell them why,” Hubbard said Saturday while campaigning in Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County. 
At each house, Hubbard would tell the resident who answered the door that “if you’re a Georgia Power customer and you’ve seen your power bill go up, we can help do something about that,” while reminding them to vote for him and Alicia Johnson.
These messages have resonated with some voters. Tiffany Barkley, a 28-year-old nurse from DeKalb County who voted early, said the current commission’s decisions were a key concern and that she wants to see the commission be more accountable to the public. 
Anne Branscome, a 79-year-old retiree in DeKalb County, said that a change in the PSC “at this point in time is enormously important,” referring to a growing number of data centers under proposal or being built in Georgia. These data centers require large amounts of energy and water, and Branscome said she is concerned that officials aren’t considering their impact on the future.
“We need people to understand that we can still have technology, and we can still do the right things, and we can use the right ways to do it,” Branscome said. “And we feel like there’s too much corporate interest driving this whole effort without much thought or preparation.”
The Republican campaign has focused on boosting turnout among reliable voters in low-turnout areas, including areas without a local contest on the ballot, and on framing the election around the parties’ ideological differences.
McKoon said that the party is “certainly highlighting the partisan differences,” saying that Georgians “don’t want to go down the road of financing Green New Deal initiatives that, frankly, don’t work and will undermine the reliability of Georgia’s electric grid.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1000045077-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-11-03 05:16:39.140400

Since a waste management company proposed a landfill adjacent to the lake, the small community in and around Dalton has been at the center of one of the state's more contentious landfill debates. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin) Once again, the question of where to put trash — and who should get to decide — is shaping up to be one of the environmental issues most discussed among New Hampshire legislators this upcoming session.
This year’s proposals cover an array of ideas to stem New Hampshire’s trash flow and tighten regulations on where it can be directed. 
The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services currently considers applications for new landfills in the state. Environmental and community groups, and some legislators, have criticized the rules the department applies to its consideration of prospective permits, calling them weak and saying they do not adequately take into account factors like proximity to water bodies and wells, soil type, and effects on local communities.
Some have pushed for a new committee to grant or deny landfill permits based on a broader array of factors than what NHDES currently considers, including Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who recommended such a solid waste site evaluation committee and a one-year moratorium on new landfills in her biennial budget proposal in February. 
After lawmakers failed to agree on details and those measures were ultimately dropped, Ayotte told the Bulletin in July she would continue pushing for a “revamped regulatory process” regarding landfill siting, including more community input throughout the process, this session.
So far, two different versions of a site evaluation committee, both based on Ayotte’s proposal, have emerged from the House and Senate ahead of the new session beginning in January. Lawmakers will weigh both as they consider whether to tighten the process through which new landfills are proposed and approved. 
Here is what some lawmakers said about early forms of those proposals, plus a handful of other waste-related bills to look out for this session.
Senate proposal: A committee amendment
Members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted unanimously on Oct. 23 to move forward with one version of a site evaluation committee. The legislation, authored by District 17 Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican, took the form of a replace-all amendment to House Bill 707, which was retained last session after passing the House. 
At the time, the bill redefined and broadened the criteria that NHDES would use to assess landfill proposals. Now, as amended by the Senate, the bill proposes a seven-member committee that would evaluate new landfill proposals on factors including economic and tourism impacts, noise, odor, traffic, and the proposal’s net addition to New Hampshire’s waste disposal capacity. 
Some state representatives, including Rep. Kelley Potenza, the Rochester Republican who originally sponsored HB 707, reacted to the Senate’s amendment with harsh criticism, saying it gives concessions to the waste industry at the expense of local control. 
The proposal’s focus, according to the amendment, lies in “maintaining adequate, reasonably priced disposal capacity for solid waste generated in New Hampshire,” creating a body to evaluate proposals for such capacity, and chartering that body with preferentially approving expansion of existing landfills over creating new ones. 
Its language references the controversies that landfill proposals often generate at the local level, but goes on to state that New Hampshire’s overall interest in developing new solid waste disposal capacity would be considered above local regulations.
“The use of local land-use regulation to prevent siting of new capacity can result in the frustration of the state’s interest in maintaining adequate capacity,” it reads. The proposal would establish a preference for expanding existing landfills over constructing new ones, then build on that preference to allow the state to bypass local policies.
“The state’s preference for such expansions warrants that the state’s regulatory and policy interests take precedence over local regulations and restrictions, particularly because the (New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services) rules provide robust protection of human health and the environment,” it reads.
Rep. Linda Haskins, an Exeter Democrat, said the amendment’s language is not strong enough. She worried the proposal would disenfranchise municipalities where landfills might be proposed by stripping them of the ability to fight developments they do not want.
Wayne Morrison, president of the advocacy group North Country Alliance for Balanced Change, said in a statement the proposal could affect ongoing negotiations in the North Country, where residents have been divided over a stalled landfill proposal in Dalton and the previously proposed expansion of a nearby landfill in Bethlehem, both led by Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems.
According to a 2012 settlement between Casella and the town of Bethlehem, the landfill there is set to close when it reaches capacity — expected to occur in 2026 — with further expansion prohibited. A Casella representative said this October the company would be open to restarting expansion talks with the town, but the Bethlehem Select Board voted unanimously against engaging, according to reporting by the Caledonian Record.
Tom Tower, a member of the North Country Alliance for Balanced Change, said in an email that some worry Pearl’s amendment would clear the way for expansion at Bethlehem despite the town’s resistance. Meanwhile, Haskins said she believed the language was too weak to preclude the development of a landfill in nearby Dalton. She also expressed disappointment over the Senate’s emptying out of the language in HB 707, which she said was the result of long negotiations in the last session.
Potenza has reintroduced that legislation once more, she said, though past experience makes her doubtful it will progress in the Senate. 
As in the previous version of HB 707, Potenza’s proposal calls for NHDES to revise the rules it uses to evaluate proposed new landfills, including with updated setback requirements from water bodies and drinking water wells and a benchmark for a prospective site’s soil hydraulic conductivity, a measure of how quickly groundwater seeps through soil. 
Pearl did not respond to a request for comment.
House version
Like the Senate amendment, the site evaluation committee proposal set to appear as a House bill this session is also based on Ayotte’s proposal in last year’s budget, said prime sponsor and Dover Democratic Rep. Peter Bixby. The LSR is co-sponsored by Republican Reps. Potenza, Judy Aron, of South Acworth, and Liz Barbour, of Hollis; and Democratic Reps. Haskins, Nicholas Germana, of Keene, Jared Sullivan, of Bethlehem, James Gruber, of Alstead; and Sen. David Rochefort, a Littleton Republican.
Bixby’s proposal would similarly establish a seven-member committee to evaluate proposals for new landfills. Like the Senate-proposed committee, this committee would also evaluate the “net public benefit” of landfills — though against a slightly broader array of criteria, including impacts on human health and wildlife and the “characteristics and source of waste.” Those factors are an addition to the other factors common to the House and Senate versions of the proposal, which include impacts on aesthetics, historic preservation, economics, tourism, outdoor recreation, business development, existing land uses, property values, traffic, noise, and order.
The makeup of the committee differs slightly from the version presented by the Senate, which specifies that the committee chair would be the commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs or a designee. In the House bill version, the committee’s chairperson is designated as the chair of the New Hampshire Waste Management Council.
And while the House version also states that expanding an existing landfill is preferable to constructing a new landfill at a previously pristine site, it adds that constructing a new landfill in a brownfield, or a site contaminated with hazardous waste due to previous use, would also be preferable to building on undisturbed land. The House version also requires the committee to request information about whether the landfill will prioritize accepting waste that originated in New Hampshire.
Both proposals include a $20,000 base charge for a major solid waste disposal facility application, with additional charges that increase according to the tonnage of waste the facility is expected to receive, and call for a yearlong moratorium on new landfills.
According to Bixby, the amount of public input allowed in each proposal, the sway given to local zoning, and the range of potential impacts that would be evaluated are the major differences between the two.
“The key is that (this bill) provides a robust procedure for public comment from the affected communities on a landfill that is being proposed,” Bixby said. 
Both proposals identify an assistant attorney general as a representative for the public in proceedings before the committee. They also call for at least two public information sessions: one or more before the application is filed, and another after it has been filed with the committee, in the affected municipality. The House’s proposal allows the committee to compel additional sessions in other municipalities as is deemed “reasonable to inform the public of the proposed project.”
Addressing capacity
Other landfill-related legislation on the table ahead of the upcoming session attempts to address New Hampshire’s capacity to take in waste.
“It is in the vital interest of the state to maintain capacity,” said Germana, who sponsored an LSR that he said seeks to limit the placement of out-of-state waste going into New Hampshire landfills.
The bill, Germana said, would give current operators until 2030 to reduce the amount of out-of-state waste they accept to 30% of their total. New landfills would be subject to the 30% out-of-state limit.
A large proportion of the waste disposed in New Hampshire landfills — such as nearly half of the total tonnage in 2022 — comes from out of state. A previous attempt to cap that influx, led by then-Rep. Rochefort in 2024, was unsuccessful; concerns about whether it would limit inter-state commerce, and in turn violate New Hampshire’s interstate commerce clause, were part of what stymied the legislation, Germana said.
But Germana said he was optimistic about a new approach. 
“There are ways to challenge the interstate commerce clause,” he said. The new proposal has a higher ceiling for out-of-state waste, and Germana said he did not believe it would be financially detrimental for waste processors.
“It’s still almost a third of what they bring in, and they are allowed to charge as much as they want for that out-of-state waste,” he said. “… It’s not at all an undue burden for these businesses.”
Haskins and Potenza said stemming the flow of out-of-state trash would help prevent New Hampshire from needing to construct new landfills. 
Controlling the flow of in-state waste
Among the other proposals related to waste disposal is one from Germana to study the disposal of vapes and e-cigarettes. The devices have become a headache (and fire hazard) for transfer station operators around the state, Germana said, due to their flammable batteries and the federally regulated nicotine they contain. A committee may evaluate solutions from regulating what varieties of the devices are sold in New Hampshire to a form of extended producer responsibility, which would call for manufacturers to invest in safe disposal for the products.
Food waste is another big contributor to New Hampshire’s waste stream, said Rep. Lucius Parshall, a Democrat from Cheshire. Parshall filed an LSR to establish a commission that would advise the Department of Environmental Services on making composting more feasible, ideally diverting food waste from landfills, he said.
Parshall also filed a bill to explore introducing a broader form of extended producer responsibility, or EPR, statewide. In an interview with the Bulletin, he described the system as another way to lessen the waste stream entering New Hampshire’s landfills. He is driven, he said, by concerns over the state of the environment, pollution, landfill capacity, and the ever-increasing problem of excessive plastic packaging.
Previous attempts to introduce the legislation have been unsuccessful, including a narrower bill that would have created a system specifically for paint cans, led by New London Rep. Karen Ebel, that died in the Senate. Parshall said he hoped his new proposal would provide a framework for New Hampshire to charter a Producer Responsibility Organization, or PRO, that would work directly with a wide array of manufacturers to help them reduce waste and assume more responsibility for the packaging of their products.
“What EPR would do, effectively, is shut the tap off so we don’t have this barrage of waste coming into the state,” Parshall said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/forestlakelandfill-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 05:16:39.140400

Filing begins at noon Monday for partisan candidates and 3 p.m. for nonpartisan candidates. Because Nov. 11 is Veterans Day, a federal holiday, the weeklong filing period will end on Nov. 12, according to the secretary of state’s office. The primary election is scheduled for March 3 and the general election is Nov. 3. Runoff elections for the general election, if necessary, will be Dec. 1. 
Next year’s election calendar also includes two special elections to fill vacancies in Senate District 26 and House District 70. The Senate District 26 seat became vacant after the death of Branch Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield on Sept. 2. The House District 70 seat opened up when Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, resigned on Sept. 30 to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.
The schedule for both special elections include a primary election on March 3 and a general election on June 6. However, the timeline for both special elections is being challenged in two separate lawsuits that argue the current dates will leave voters in both districts without representation during April’s fiscal session when state lawmakers will make funding decisions. 
Two weeks ago, a judge in the Senate District 26 lawsuit ordered the state to hold the election “as soon as practical.” Both the plaintiff and defendants in the case have appealed the ruling to the Arkansas Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, another judge issued a ruling Friday ordering the House District 70 general election be held on March 3, after hearing arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday. The attorney general’s office said it would appeal.

Democrats hopeful
Republicans hold a supermajority in the Arkansas House and Senate, but Democrats are hopeful they can flip some seats, including House District 70 where Alex Holladay, a health care professional who was defeated by Wing by 286 votes in the 2024 election, is seeking the Democratic nomination. Arkansas Democratic Party Chair retired Col. Marcus Jones called it “the most closely contested” House race in the 2024 general election, in an October press release. 
“Given that Democrats have over-performed by 18% in Special Elections since Trump took office, we feel confident that we can deliver another seat for Democrats in our State House,” Jones said. 
Holladay is expected to run against Cordelia Smith-Johnson, a U.S. Air Force veteran and plaintiff in the House District 70 lawsuit, in the Democratic primary for that seat. Business owner and physical therapist Bo Renshaw has said he intends to seek the Republican nomination in the race. 
One state issue that’s likely to affect next year’s elections is the ongoing fight to build a state prison in Franklin County. Since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced plans to construct a prison near Charleston a year ago, elected officials and local residents have pushed back against the project. 
Stubblefield, whose family has land bordering the proposed prison site, was one of the most outspoken opponents of the prison. Four Republicans have declared their intention to fill the late senator’s seat — Stacie Smith, Arkansas Oklahoma Gas’ community affairs coordinator, businessmen Brad Simon and Ted Tritt, and former state Rep. Mark Berry. 
Smith, Tritt and Simon have publicly stated they oppose the prison. 
“Crime is a serious problem in Arkansas, and we absolutely need to take decisive action to keep our families safe and hold criminals accountable,” Simon said in a September press release. “But dumping a billion-dollar mega-prison in the heart of the River Valley isn’t the solution — it’s government overreach that risks our water, environment, and local economy.”
On his campaign website, Berry said it would be “a daunting task” to find a solution to the problem, which “did not happen overnight.”
“And it won’t get fixed overnight,” he said. “I believe we can fund a prison, find a location more acceptable to the public that can also meet the water capacity needs.”
Funding for the prison likely will be a fiercely debated topic during the fiscal session that begins on April 8. Stubblefield was among a handful of lawmakers who blocked a $750 million appropriation bill in the Senate during this spring’s legislative session. The prison is expected to cost $825 million, according to preliminary estimates. 
Another outspoken critic of the prison, Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, is being challenged in the Republican primary election for Senate District 28 by Bobby Ballinger. King defeated his father, former Sen. Bob Ballinger, by about 400 votes in the 2022 Republican primary. 
Sanders’ political action committee has contributed $3,500 to Ballinger’s campaign, according to his latest campaign finance report. Sanders also confirmed to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette that she is supporting Trey “BoDirt” Bohannan, who is challenging Sen. Ron Caldwell in the Republican primary for the Senate District 10 seat. 
Caldwell, like King, voted against the $750 appropriation bill all five times it was voted down in the Arkansas Senate this spring.

The bill’s backers initially tacked it onto the massive utility overhaul lawmakers approved earlier this year, but the program didn’t make the final cut. Now, they’re working to pass the pilot as a standalone bill.
Boosters’ view
Roger Sikes, a campaigner with Solar United Neighbors, sees new momentum behind the effort. Ohio is a net importer of energy, with a rapidly growing data center sector placing even greater demands on the grid. Energy bills have shot up and don’t seem likely to come down in the immediate future.
“So that creates a context where we, in Ohio, we need energy generation,” Sikes said. “We need much more energy generation quickly, and we need to increase capacity. That has, I think, pushed legislators to have more urgency around creating generation sources.”
Just a few years ago, Sikes doesn’t think lawmakers would’ve been willing to try new things. But with their constituents struggling to balance higher grocery prices, property taxes and energy bills, there’s greater interest in outside the box ideas.
Ohio’s central energy challenge is demand outstripping supply. Lawmakers began to address that in this summer’s overhaul package House Bill 15. Among the changes, the bill opened the door to so-called ‘behind the meter’ generation — think small scale power plants built to provide energy directly to new data centers or other energy intensive industries.
Sikes sees the community solar pilot, House Bill 303, as another measure pushing in the same direction. Instead of power generation dedicated to a particular commercial enterprise, the program allows a group of residents to go in on a small power facility together. The energy would go to the grid, and participants would see a rebate on their monthly power bill.
Ohio lawmakers send energy overhaul to the governor

The effort is structured as a four-year pilot program, capped at a total of 1,500 megawatts around the state. All told, Sikes said, that much energy could power about 300,000 homes. The legislation also caps the size of individual power facilities at 10 megawatts or 20 megawatts if it’s built on a brownfield.
Community power facilities can use several different energy sources, including natural gas, but Sikes think solar has a natural advantage. “Community solar is just way faster getting these electrons onto the grid,” he said, noting projects can be up and running in as little as nine months.
That said, solar developments in particular face unique headwinds in Ohio. A four-year-old state law grants local governments the authority to block solar and wind developments. In addition, projects that get regulatory approval might be uneconomical with the federal government pulling back on solar subsidies.
About five years ago, solar companies came calling at Mark Clay’s Ashtabula County Farm.
“I went through and talked with all of them, got an attorney, picked one, (and) we got a lease,” he said. “Everything went through, and they just recently dropped me due to the current situation with the current administration.”
At about 47 acres, Clay’s farm is small, but increasingly difficult to manage on his own. He gets solicited on a weekly basis by developers who want to turn the land into a subdivision. “I really don’t want to do that,” he said. “I would like to be able to hold on to the farm and make it work for my family.” Clay thinks the community power pilot could give him additional income — helping him keep the land with his family and doing something good for his community.
Steve Mondak, who farms 120 acres in Columbiana County, made a similar argument. He’s paying “almost to the penny” double what he did 30 years ago when he bought his farm.
“We need to bring costs down across the board,” Mondak said. “Electricity is a big one, a big factor in most people’s budgets. If we can control it, if we can empower individuals to create their own electricity, to be able to sell a little bit back to the to the companies, reduce their bills?”
“Who would, in their right mind, go against that?” he asked. “That seems like, I mean, it’s just a no brainer.”
Opposition and reticence
Ohio’s power challenges have had a marked effect on the lawmakers tasked with debating energy policy. In the House and Senate Energy committees, Republicans and Democrats have able to work together to advance legislation with substantial bipartisan support. Supporters hope the community power pilot will be another example. The Senate version of the proposal, Senate Bill 231, has bipartisan co-sponsors, for instance.
But Ohio’s monopoly utilities oppose the idea. AEP Ohio and an industry group representing utilities criticized the arrangement.  They believe customers who aren’t subscribing to community power programs will wind up paying some of the cost for customers who are subscribing.
It’s a point that the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, Maureen Willis, brought up as well. In committee testimony she suggested several changes aimed at ensuring costs are borne by the people using the program, and bill credits reflect the program’s actual savings.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Republican lawmakers passed a law last year requiring hard documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. Next year, those requirements are set to face their first major test: the federal midterm elections, which are likely to draw more than half a million Granite Staters.
Now, as Democrats and voting rights activists argue the new laws are unconstitutional and will prevent eligible residents from voting, lawmakers in Concord are attempting to make complying with the new requirements easier.
The House Finance Committee recommended a bill Thursday that would create a process by which someone who does not have a passport, birth certificate, naturalization papers, or other relevant documents could attempt to prove their citizenship anyway.
But Democrats voted against the bill, reiterating their concerns with the 2024 registration law and arguing the new legislation will only create more complications for local officials. 
The bill, House Bill 365, would require town and city election workers to contact the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s Office to attempt to confirm the voter’s citizenship. The office would need to make “reasonable efforts” to do so, including by checking in-state, out-of-state, and federal databases. But the bill includes an exception for voting day; cities and towns and the Secretary of State’s Office are not required to help people obtain the documentation on Election Day if it would interfere with their other duties. 
The bill would also create a process for people who want to obtain copies of their documents but cannot afford to do so. If a resident is found to be indigent, the city or town “may” provide a voucher to cover the costs of recovering the birth certificate, passport, or other qualifying document, the bill states.
If a municipality does provide that voucher, the secretary of state would be required to reimburse the cost. The latest version of the bill directs that $50,000 in state funds be available to do so.
Republicans say the bill should assuage critics who say the new law will punish people who do not have passports and birth certificates. 
“It ensures that voters who are unable to produce their proof of citizenship due to financial means can access proof for voting purposes,” said Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, speaking during the Finance Committee meeting. “Supporting (the bill) demonstrates our commitment to strengthen our existing election integrity laws.”
But Democrats said the bill does not adequately support cities and towns that are trying to help their voters prove their citizenship. Rep. Rosemarie Rung, a Merrimack Democrat, said she was originally in support of the bill. But later, she said, she felt she had been “snookered.”
“It looks great from the outset — that it’s going to be a benefit — but we have no process in place,” she said. 
Rung and others said there was not enough clarity over how towns and cities should assist voters in proving citizenship and obtaining documents and when they could refuse to do so on Election Day. 
“There is no defined process on how the secretary of state would remit the document cost, or how municipalities would submit vouchers for reimbursement,” said Rep. David Preece, a Manchester Democrat. “Without that framework, this bill is little more than a window dressing for a bureaucratic mess waiting to happen.”
Some Democrats raised issues with the amount of money provided to help municipalities. The bill would not actively set aside the $50,000, but would rather allow Gov. Kelly Ayotte to request that it be drawn out of the state’s General Fund, raising the potential that the funding might not be there.
The bill comes after former Gov. Chris Sununu signed House Bill 1569 into law in 2024, requiring that voters produce hard copies of their citizenship documents in order to newly register in the state — with no exceptions. That law replaced the previous system in which new registrants could sign an affidavit attesting to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. HB 1569 is facing two federal lawsuits; those lawsuits are expected to be heard in federal district court in early 2026. 
Responding to Democratic criticism over the amount of money set aside in HB 365, Sweeney noted that less than 1% of new registrants used affidavits in the most recent New Hampshire elections. “So I don’t foresee a bureaucratic mess. I don’t see this being a huge burden on municipal officers.” 
And Sweeney added the new bill does nothing to change the requirements under HB 1569. “The voter laws are already changed,” he said. “This is just going into setting up a program to help those that need it.”
The bill leaves the Fiscal Committee with a 14-11 recommendation that it ought to pass after Thursday’s party-line vote. It will be taken up for a vote by the full House on Jan. 7.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0700-1024x612.jpg,,,2025-11-03 05:16:39.140400

Food benefits have stopped flowing because of the federal government shutdown. (Photo by Getty Images)There’s a word to describe the mess that Kansas and the rest of our country faces, now that the federal government shutdown has stopped food assistance.
That word is failure.
It’s a failure on the part of a Washington, D.C., governing class interested in scoring points at the expense of everyday people just trying to feed their families. It’s a failure of government bureaucrats — such as former Kansas Rep. Patrick Penn — who have used the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a political bargaining chip in the months leading up to this shutdown.
More broadly, it’s a failure on the part of a society that allows so many to go hungry without government intervention. In the United States, one in eight people receives benefits through the program. That’s more than 12% of the country’s population. In Kansas, about 186,000 people receive SNAP, which is also known as food stamps. That’s more than 6% of our population.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve watched food prices rise, entry-level job opportunities disappear and a president take office whose persona depends on gilded excess.
What’s left for those who simply want to eat? Can they perhaps go to the planned East Wing ballroom at the White House for a sandwich and cup of soup? How about the remodeled Lincoln bathroom?
Don’t think I’m letting Democrats off the hook here, either. The whole reason we’re in this situation to begin with is the party’s somnambulant performance over President Joe Biden’s term and the failure of the party to inspire voters last year. Now out of power and searching for ways to prove their mettle, Democratic leaders picked a fight with the Trump administration over government funding.
Well, they got that fight. And their stated mission of renewing Affordable Care Act subsidies makes sense. But as people go hungry, does it really make sense to keep fighting a political battle?
I mentioned humorist Will Rogers last week. Back in 1931, he put his finger on the infuriating contraction of hunger in America: “Here we are, in a country with more wheat, and more corn, and more money in the bank, more cotton, more everything in the world; there’s not a product that you can name that we haven’t got more of than any other country ever had on the face of the earth, and yet we’ve got people starving. We’ll hold the distinction of being the only nation in the history of the world that ever went to the poor house in an automobile.”


Here in Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration has been involved in a legal feud with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over sharing personal information about SNAP recipients with the federal government. The overall message has been that hungry Kansans exist as political props. If Republicans can make Kelly look bad for protecting Kansans’ data, all the better.
Meanwhile, food banks brace for impact. Food drives have picked up across the country. At the Shawnee Mission Unitarian Universalist Church, where I appeared at an event Saturday about media literacy, attendees brought a variety of canned and packaged food. They were doing their part. They were trying to help.
But dear reader, it made me angry. It made me furious. As I considered that food drive, as I thought about the stories Kansas Reflector has run over and over about SNAP, all I could focus on was that word: failure.
We have failed our fellow humans. And while both parties and our national government bear huge responsibility, so does our business class. So do all of us. We have mainstreamed hunger. We have left government benefits that partially solve this problem at the mercy of soulless political tacticians.
I wish I could believe that we can do better. But can we? Have we? What has happened to give us any indication that we could actually make progress in solving this problem?
Increasingly, I look at our nation and our government and see a system that no longer even pretends to do the best it can for people. Both political parties indulge in byzantine schemes, while leaders to the right hail authoritarian power grabs and those to the left squabble amongst themselves.
I walked through downtown Lawrence this weekend, feeling the autumn breeze and watching trees burst into improbable orange and yellow and red. I walked, and I did not despair or rage or grieve.
For a moment, the misery lifted. My thoughts took a positive turn. The interruption in SNAP benefits might prove short lived, thanks to court decisions. Our leaders might decide, having danced so close to the edge, to reach a lasting truce. Absent such breakthroughs, each one of us can take positive actions in our own lives — donating to that food drive or volunteering at that food bank. Or, I suppose, writing a column.
Yet I cannot shake the deep disappointment that gnaws at me late at night and early in the morning.
Bad times have come. And all of us are responsible.

(Courtesy of Reach Out and Read)I bought my grandson five books for his birthday, five titles** in hardcover from a variety of authors and nestled in a small antique case. While I was prouder of myself than I probably should have been, the gift felt weirdly old school, an homage to a past when books were prized and people actually read them. Wait, that’s my past. Plus, my grandson can’t even read these.
Well, OK, he just turned one. There is that. 
My worry, however, is that by the time he can or will want to read them, advances in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or similar large language models and their technological kin will have further changed how we read, write and, most importantly, think. Those monumental alterations may cut further into the notion that reading books remains an intellectual, informational and entertainment bonanza for those choosing to take one down off the shelf. Or, perhaps more appropriate, download to your Kindle or iPad.
Lest you think I’m some sort of unreconstructed Luddite, let me hike up my pants, check my Social Security benefits and welcome you to Geezerville, where I will make the case that we’ve been here before. Well, kinda.
Shortly before philosopher Marshall McLuhan told us in 1964 that the “medium was the message,” not the actual content it was delivering, FCC Chairman Newton Minow said programming on television, just past the glow of its first golden age, was a “vast wasteland.” McLuhan’s premise enjoyed some notoriety on college campuses and among cultural observers. Television, however, continued apace with new and ever-changing content on a continuum that ran from exceptionally-accomplished-to-utter-wasteland.  So “Ken Burns Civil War” and “The Wire” might be on one end and “Jerry Springer” and “My Mother the Car” on the other. 
Today we watch Netflix and YouTube on all our screens, the television one included. Studies have long suggested that too much “screen time” can negatively impact children’s development, but, nevertheless, also educate and inform them. Other research indicates that the tube can also enrich adult lives while possibly increasing loneliness, anxiety and the physical troubles associated with too much couch time. In sum, the “wasteland” continues to have mixed reviews.
Some of the same worries accompanied our descent into social media about the turn of the century as we found friends, shared cat videos and berated, doxxed and threatened each other over our political affiliations. That slide into some depressing and dangerous depths continues. Social media remains the chief suspect in a series of societal ills, not the least of which is the rising sea of misinformation compromising our ability to communicate with each other — ironically the platforms’ once highly-touted promise. The best antidote to date is moderation or abstinence, both of which are a drag on the positive impacts of social media, such as the ability to disseminate information at lightning speed.
My grandson has yet to open an account on Bluesky, X, Instagram or even Facebook, so I’m holding out hope for the little guy, who is brilliant, handsome and kind, as I’m sure your grandchildren are.
So where do artificial intelligence, large language models and other “thinking” technology fit into a history that began with a cathode ray tube and now has robots speaking and learning and getting smarter? I have no idea either.
We do know this: In our relationship with science and technology, the wonders of life-saving advances, mind-blowing potential or simply advanced scholarship are almost always ahead of our ability to understand them. The advent and role of AI is no exception. Our history and experience tell us that if we are smart about things — sometimes we are, sometimes not so much — we can find ways not simply to cope with our flourishing technology, but rather to use it to our advantage. To enhance our work rather than eliminate our work. To serve us rather than scare us. To enlighten us rather than undo us. 
Which is why I gave my grandson books for his future, one in which they may still play some role in advancing culture, enlightenment, education and, yes, entertainment. I consider the covers to my quintet … and all his toddler books for that matter … as the original screens.
AI is a rare and exceptional tool, at least until a new one comes along. Still, even though it can’t reopen the government or compel our leaders to tell the truth or undo a natural calamity, we should make peace with it. 
Then write a story about it. Perhaps put it in a book.
**If you’re keeping score at home, the five books were “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “The Catcher in the Rye,” “The Outsiders,” “The Baseball Codes: Beanballs, Sign Stealing and Bench-Clearing Brawls, the Unwritten Rules of America’s Pastime,” and a novella titled “Warm, for Christmas,” written by his grandfather.

Connecticut is one of the richest states in one of the world’s richest countries.  We now face the very real prospect of tens of thousands of people unable to eat and losing health care. The cruelty of HR1, President Donald Trump’s big ugly bill, and his government shutdown, are taking hold in Connecticut.  Massive numbers of people are at risk to be without food and/or healthcare. 
Despite an extraordinary court order that the federal government use contingency funds to keep the feed assistance coming, the threat still exists in the face of Congressional inaction.
We, in Connecticut, must act.
HR1 and the shutdown are just the latest cruel actions by Trump and Republicans that reward billionaires and corporations and at the expense of working people. Even if Congress does restore these cuts, Connecticut must be prepared to step up and make sure children do not starve and that all people have healthcare.
Unfortunately, our leaders appear to be negotiating Connecticut’s response in terms of budget limits instead of determining what it takes to meet the needs of Connecticut residents. We finished the 2024 fiscal year with a $1.9 billion surplus, which can and should be used to meet urgent needs now.
Gov. Ned Lamont, Speaker Matt Ritter, Senator Martin Looney — we have an emergency.  We cannot food bank our way out of this. Children will go hungry and health care will be at risk for everyone, unless you act.
Connecticut has the capacity to address these cuts. At the moment we have a record surplus and the wealthiest among us are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts as part of Trump’s big ugly Bill.
It is good that the legislature and the governor are planning a special session to address the looming crisis and cruelty about to be unleashed in Connecticut. But we need to step up, go outside the current budget framework and develop both a short term response and longer term solutions to what we are about to withstand over the next couple years
Immediate steps include:

Ensure no one loses coverage as a result of the One Ugly Bill and Trump’s inaction.  This includes people seeking reproductive health care, Legally Present Immigrants and people receiving Enhanced Premium Tax Credit to purchase insurance on the exchange.  We know some of these items will be costly, but we should consider reforms that would lessen the costs, particularly around the tax credits.  An example is to clamp down on the profiteering by insurers through vertical integration and their self -dealing through both mandatory disclosure and caps.
Prepare for the looming mess the bill creates for Medicaid and SNAP.  DSS has acknowledged the problems with their call centers with some recent announcements. However these steps will not come close to solving the problem and DSS should have to meet the same standards they demand for contractors in terms of customer service.  In addition, we need to significantly increase our investment in community health works to help people navigate the new bureaucratic hurdles in the bill and to do the traditional health and wellness functions CHWs perform.  This will save money on uncompensated care and by keeping people healthier.
Make sure people have food.  The fact that Trump is playing political games with food is no excuse for Connecticut to not act here.  It is a lot of money, but if the idea of our neighbors going to bed hungry isn’t enough of a reason to act, the impact on grocers, small businesses, and farmers should make this a no brainer for the governor and legislature should be.

Some people are arguing Connecticut can’t afford to address the needs.  We argue Connecticut can’t afford not to.  We have a record budget surplus that the legislature can redirect to cover this.  
In addition, the wealthiest amongst us are receiving huge tax cuts from the ugly bill.  Do the Governor and the legislature really think these people should be able to cash these tax cuts while others starve and/or lose health care?  
We find that hard to believe because in Connecticut NO ONE SHOULD STARVE OR LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Another day in Paradise, where 3 million Floridians may soon go hungry.
SNAP, what we used to call Food Stamps, is out of money. 
Head Start centers, which serve about 45,000 Florida children, plus pregnant women, are mostly closed. That’s not merely a blow to medical screenings and critical early childhood education, it means the kids won’t get the meals Head Start provides. 
And no, churches and food banks can’t fill the gaps. Nobody has those kinds of resources.
Nobody but the federal government.
Veterans’ services have been curtailed, and the National Flood Insurance Program suspended. 
That means you can’t close on that Florida dream house unless you buy private flood insurance, which can cost nearly twice as much, especially if you’re near water.
There are already longer lines at airports and flights delayed as some TSA officers and air traffic controllers, all deemed “essential employees” but not being paid, call in sick.
(And who can blame them?)
ICE agents, on the other hand, are still getting their paychecks, arresting cleaning ladies and using tear gas near children on their way to a Chicago Halloween parade.
A judge, incredulous that she had to remind federal agents children in Halloween costumes “do not pose an immediate threat,” told them to knock it off.
Our tax dollars at work.
Some national parks and refuges may be open, but without visitor centers, rangers to tell you how to avoid alligators or escape an irate wild hog, or anyone to pick up litter or clean bathrooms. 
As of last year, there were approximately 95,000 federal employees in Florida. It’s unclear how many there are now, what with DOGE slashing and burning, dumping anyone and anything “not consistent with the president’s priorities.”
NASA and NOAA, for example, apparently fall into the “not consistent” category: about 1,700 have lost their jobs. 
Who needs satellites to help us track hurricanes? It’s more sporting to guess where the storm might go. 
Even if there are, say, only 90,000 federal workers left in the state, they’re not getting paid, which means they’re not spending money in their communities.
Shops, restaurants, services–all taking a hit.
Grocery stores, appliance stores, clothing stores will be hurting, too.

Hitting what the current occupant of the White House calls “Democrat programs” is more important than the 42 million across the country who might not have enough to eat.
Taking away the subsidies which help millions get health care, which is at the heart of the shutdown fight, is not just owning the libs, it’s an act of calculated cruelty.

Florida has 4.7 million enrollees in the Affordable Care Act, the most of any state.
Many are service workers, gig workers, people who have decent, lower-middle class jobs which don’t offer health care, or those who’ve retired but aren’t quite old enough for Medicare.
Instead of paying a few hundred dollars a month, many will see their premiums rocket up to more than $1,000 a month, in some cases trebling or quadrupling. 
Don’t be poor and don’t get sick
Gov. Ron DeSantis is unmoved, suggesting that all most people need is a catastrophic plan, the kind with high deductibles – like around $10,000 – which many can’t possibly afford.
DeSantis and the Legislature have refused to expand Medicaid to Floridians who make less than $21,000 a year.
The message: don’t be poor and don’t get sick. If you’re poor, it’s probably your own fault, and if you get the flu or COVID-19 or the measles, well, either suck it up or go to the emergency room.
And you wonder why health care costs in this country keep climbing while Americans’ get sicker and fatter and more susceptible to disease?
Pretty much every other developed nation on earth offers universal health care. These countries pay on average half what Americans do and get better health outcomes. 
Don’t you hate that “socialized medicine?” 
Our government likes to remind everybody the U.S. is the richest nation on the face of the earth. Yet we pretend we cannot take care of our most vulnerable citizens.
WIC, the federal nutrition program for women, infants and children, got some extra money in October, keeping it afloat in some (but not all) states, but that money’s running out. 
Last week more than two dozen state attorneys general and governors sued the USDA, demanding they release the money for food assistance. 
Fun fact: the US Department of Agriculture has a $6 billion emergency fund, but the Trump regime denies there’s an emergency.
Two federal judges disagree. Massachusetts Judge Indira Talwani said  “Congress has put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency.”
Judge Jack McConnell in Rhode Island ordered USDA to cough up the contingency funds “as soon as possible.”
Talwani hasn’t gone quite that far, but has directed USDA to say whether it’ll release the money Monday.
The problem is, even if USDA is forced to use its emergency funds in what is an actual emergency the money won’t stretch very far: SNAP costs $8.36 billion per month. 
The regime responded with partisan snark on USDA web page blaming Democratic senators for supposedly continuing “to hold out for health care for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures [refusing to] reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.” 
That is, of course, nonsense–and probably a violation of the Hatch Act, too. The ACA does not provide health care for the undocumented, and while some states allow for gender-affirming care for youth, others restrict it. The Trump administration is working to outlaw it altogether.
Other spending priorities
Here in Florida, Democratic members of the Legislature have written to the governor, urging him to use his emergency powers to help those dependent on the now-suspended SNAP funds: “For families already struggling under record food and housing costs, the loss of this critical support would be catastrophic,” they said. 
“Local food banks and pantries have already reported overwhelming demand and depleted supplies. . . . The state cannot stand by.”
Oh, but the state can indeed stand by. And often does.
DeSantis’ response was predictably snotty: “Did those Democrats write a letter to Chuck Schumer asking him to stop filibustering the spending? Come on.”
Last I looked, Republicans control the government. All of it. 
They could release those allotments any time, just as they could negotiate a solution to our outrageous health care costs. 
Maybe if the state hadn’t spent $50 million of taxpayer money in 2024 to defeat ballot measures DeSantis disliked or untold millions of bucks suing over providing health care to children or giving upper middle-class families vouchers so they can send their kids to private schools without breaking a sweat, or flying asylum-seekers to Martha’s Vineyard, we might have a little extra cash to spend on the needy. 
The federal government could pay for SNAP, Head Start, flood insurance, heating assistance, WIC, and all the rest of it if the regime weren’t so busy wasting your money on Trump’s expensive whims, such as bailing out his friend, the right-wing fruitcake president of Argentina, to the tune of  $40 billion. 
Or retrofitting his Qatari gift-jet as Airforce One, which reportedly could cost  us about $1 billion.
Trump’s buying Homeland Security Spokesmodel Kristi Noem not one, but two new private jets, costing in the region of $200 million, in case Delta first class is sold out and she needs to get to El Salvador for a photo-op.  
As for the tax cuts, the ones overwhelmingly benefitting the rich, well, they will cost the nation a big, fat $4 trillion over the next 10 years.
A billion here, a trillion there: pretty soon you’re talking real money.
Extending the ACA enhanced premium tax subsidies would cost us $350 billion over 10 years.
Even if you practice good old Republican voodoo economics, it’s pretty obvious that $350 billion is way less than $4 trillion.
Insured people go to the doctor, get preventative treatment, and expert help when they need it.


	A sickness boom in Florida?/subhed]
Uninsured people either never get the care they need or go to the emergency room, which costs us all a lot in increased hospital costs and insurance premiums. 
Here in Florida, we’re pretty much guaranteed a sickness boom: the anti-science fanatic running U.S. Health and Human Services pushes raw milk and unproven Covid treatments while cutting money for genuine medical research, and Florida’s surgeon general demands the state do away with vaccine mandates.
Trump and congressional Republicans want us to believe that if the Democrats will just pass a “clean” Continuing Resolution to fund the government, they can all sit down and have a nice chat about healthcare. 
Remember how they said they’d never touch Medicaid? And Trump promised he wouldn’t touch the East Wing to build his trashy new ballroom? The Ukraine war would end? The price of eggs would drop? 
If you buy the cozy image of Republicans “negotiating” ACA subsidies with Democrats, I have a lovely piece of Florida swamp land to sell you.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-03 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Moving Bridgeport forward through charter reform,Thomas Gaudett,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/03/moving-bridgeport-forward-through-charter-reform/,The changes proposed on the ballot this November are all about building a city government that works better for everyone.,"Amending our City Charter—the blueprint for how our local government is structured and operates—is a rare opportunity. On November 4th, Bridgeport voters will have the chance to approve a comprehensive charter revision which was the work of a bipartisan group of thirteen Bridgeport residents committed to improving local governance and the image of our city. The proposed reforms substantively improve and modernize several aspects of local government, while also signalizing a renewed commitment towards professionalism, integrity, and ethics in Bridgeport.
As both a lifelong Bridgeport resident who served on the Charter Revision Commission and as the City’s Chief Administrative Officer, I strongly encourage voters to support this charter rewrite.
Ethics Reform
Bridgeport is moving in the right direction with balanced budgets, higher credit ratings, and exciting new development projects. But there’s no doubt that Bridgeport’s reputation has been a drag on its success. Understanding this reality, the Charter Revision Commission made ethics reform a centerpiece of charter revision, turning what is currently a single paragraph in the charter to an entire chapter.
The revised charter formally reestablishes the Ethics Commission and creates an Office of Municipal Ethics, providing an independent mechanism to uphold integrity in local government. The Commission will have the power to adopt a City Code of Ethics, investigate alleged violations, and impose fines—demonstrating Bridgeport’s commitment to accountability and public trust.
Civil Service Reform
Bridgeport’s civil service rules, which have not been meaningfully updated in decades, have created challenges for city officials tasked with enforcing them and have resulted in costly litigation for taxpayers. Building on the work begun by the 2012 Charter Revision Commission, the proposed reforms bring much-needed clarity and modernization.
The revisions clearly define which positions serve at the Mayor’s discretion — typically only department heads and senior policy roles — and which are protected civil service positions — most positions in local government — which continue across administrations. This balance ensures both alignment with the Mayor’s goals for the city and stability in city government.
The reforms also create a structured process for the creation of city positions moving forward, allowing for local government to adapt with the times. Overall, the proposed civil service changes protect employees’ rights, ensure consistency in hiring, and strengthen the integrity of our personnel system.
City Council Reform
For years, members of the City Council and civic advocates have called for changes that give the Council more independence and the tools to perform its legislative role effectively. This charter revision delivers on many of those long-awaited improvements.
The Office of Legislative Services will now be formally recognized as an independent arm of the City Council, led by a Director chosen by the Council and staffed to meet its operational needs. The revisions also clarify Council leadership roles and responsibilities, empower the Council to act when boards or commissions have long-standing vacancies, and set procedures for creating new boards, commissions, and departments. Together, these reforms strengthen the Council’s independence and capacity to govern effectively.
Modernization and Good Governance
The current charter has not been comprehensively updated in decades. It still references long-defunct agencies, omits essential modern departments, and includes outdated notice requirements, structural inconsistencies, and typographical errors.
The proposed revision—informed by best practices from Connecticut’s leading municipal charter expert Attorney Steve Mednick and modeled after recent charter reforms in Norwalk and New Haven—brings Bridgeport’s Charter into the modern era. It reflects the city’s actual organizational structure and creates processes for the City Council to make future updates as the city evolves.
Additional improvements include consistent formatting across the Charter itself, gender-neutral language, and clarification of ambiguous provisions. Together, these updates make the charter clearer, more usable, and aligned with good-governance standards across the state.
Making Clerk Positions Nonpartisan
“Question 2” on the November ballot proposes converting the City and Town Clerk positions from elected partisan offices to professional, nonpartisan civil service roles, with only for-cause removal, beginning after the 2031 municipal election. This proposal will not impact the current incumbents or the 2027 municipal election for these offices.
While the voters of Bridgeport elect a Mayor, City Council, and Board of Education to make policy decisions, the work of our City and Town Clerks are largely administrative in nature — filing records, preparing agendas, and administering absentee ballots. It is the opinion of the Charter Revision Commission that these positions demand professionalism, not partisanship.
Bridgeport made a similar change decades ago to the position of City Treasurer, which is now a nonpartisan civil service role. City government is better off for that change. Furthermore, setting the start date for these changes to December 2031 allows the current incumbents to remain in office while allowing time to plan for a smooth, depoliticized shift.
A Vote to Move Bridgeport Forward
The reforms that have been put forth by the Charter Revision Commission are the result of years of proposals and debate, build on the positive aspects of the 2012 Charter Revision Commission, learn from costly lawsuits and mistakes of the past, and are aimed at creating a better, brighter future for Bridgeport.
It’s rare in Bridgeport politics, but the charter reforms have brought most of our local government officials and reform advocates together around a common cause—building a government that works better for everyone.
On November 4th, I urge my fellow Bridgeport residents to vote YES on Charter Revision. By improving our City’s founding document, we will move Bridgeport forward towards a better future.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, is running for Minnesota governor, joining a slew of Republican candidates who are vying to challenge Gov. Tim Walz next November.
Demuth, who served as the GOP House minority leader during the Democrats’ 2023-2024 trifecta, raised money and recruited candidates to topple the trifecta in 2024. Republicans flipped three key swing districts in 2024, bringing the House to a 67-67 tie between Republicans and Democrats.
Though the tie hasn’t allowed Republicans to pass significant legislation, Republicans were able to block Democratic priorities — while propelling Demuth to emerge as the face of Republican opposition.
Demuth, 58, was first elected to the Minnesota House in 2018 after serving on her local school board in Cold Spring — about 20 miles southwest of St. Cloud — for over a decade.
Demuth’s campaign website was active Sunday, and she’s expected to announce she’s running for governor at a Monday morning news conference.
“I’ll never bow to the radical mob,” Demuth says in a campaign video while a shotgun is slung over her shoulder. “And I’ll never apologize for standing up for common sense … Let’s fire Tim Walz and take our state back.”
The House speaker joins a growing field of GOP candidates who are seeking to beat Walz next year, including Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive. If Republicans can raise money and blanket the media, they’ll have plenty to work with to attack Walz’s nearly eight years in office, from flagging school test scores to fraud-riddled government programs.
Demuth is likely to pitch herself as an electable general election candidate compared to the rest of the field. Demuth and Robbins are both Minnesota House members and Robbins has raised her profile in recent months by publicizing fraud in public programs.
But Robbins served as state chair for 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley, which will likely be a frequent source of attacks from Republicans who will question her loyalty to Trump. 
Republican primary voters tend to follow the party’s convention endorsement, wherein hundreds of hardcore activists — often the most ideologically dogmatic — decide the candidates’ fate.
Demuth was elected House speaker earlier this year after a rancorous start to the legislative session. A judge ruled one of the newly elected Democrats ineligible for office because he didn’t live in the district. Republicans sought to use a temporary 67-66 advantage to win full control of the chamber, and Demuth threatened to refuse to seat Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke, who won a contested race.
To prevent this usurpation, Democrats boycotted the session for three weeks and then won a Supreme Court case. The two sides came to an agreement wherein Tabke was seated, and Demuth could claim the speakership for the whole two-year session.
Demuth became Minnesota’s first Black House speaker and first Republican woman speaker. She used her caucus’ power of exactly half of the House to force the DFL to roll back state-subsidized health insurance for undocumented immigrants. House Republicans also blocked numerous tax increases proposed by Democrats.
Demuth agreed to a few tax increases, including increasing the state’s tax on cannabis from 10% to 15% and repealing the electricity sales tax exemption for data centers, which will increase costs for companies — which could make for attack fodder from her fellow tax-loathing Republicans.
Long negotiations in the split Legislature caused lawmakers to go into a one-day special session and pass a $66 billion biennium budget. 
Right on cue, Robbins decried the deal in a statement Sunday, saying that although she’s friends with with the House speaker, Demuth isn’t electable.
“Lisa Demuth agreed to a backroom budget deal that raised taxes and shut down the Stillwater prison with no plan which will result in releasing criminals back into our communities,” Robbins said. “Demuth and Walz raised our taxes and made our streets less safe, and that’s exactly what I’m fighting against.”
Demuth was born in Paynesville, Minnesota, and has four children. She’s spent the bulk of her life in rural Minnesota. Outside of politics, Demuth manages commercial properties, and her husband, Nick Demuth, runs Avon Plastics in Paynesville.
In response to Demuth’s campaign for governor, Alliance for a Better Minnesota — a progressive political group — said Minnesota needs a governor who will stand up to Trump, not acquiesce to him.
“Lisa Demuth would bring Trump’s dangerous agenda to Minnesota. She would take away our reproductive freedoms, underfund our public schools and give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations at the expense of Minnesota families,” Marissa Luna, executive director at Alliance for a Better Minnesota, said in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MG_8997-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-02 19:02:53.829566

The Liberty Flames (4-4, 3-1 CUSA) scored 42 combined points in the second and third quarters to defeat the University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (4-4, 2-3 CUSA) Saturday evening.
 
The Blue Hens lined up to punt from their own 26 yard and it felt like a streak of luck to have that opportunity. The play before the punt, quarterback Nick Minicucci threw what appeared to be an interception but was ruled as an incomplete pass following a review. Instead of sending the defense out to about midfield, Delaware had a chance to flip the field and make the Flames traverse a longer distance. Liberty ended up having an even shorter field than if the interception stood.
On fourth and six with more than eleven minutes remaining in the second quarter, the Blue Hens snapped the ball to linebacker Gavin Moul standing on the right hash of the punt formation. Moul ran the ball toward the middle of the field and flipped the ball to safety KT Seay running the opposite direction. Seay was met in the backfield by junior Bryson Jennings seconds after receiving the ball and the play ended without any chance of earning the first down.
The Flames outscored the Blue Hens 21-3 following that play in the second quarter, coasting to a 59-30 victory over UD, Saturday evening in Lynchburg, Virginia.
The former Georgia Tech running back — Evan Dickens — was the beneficiary of Delaware’s questionable attempt at trickery. Two plays after Liberty took over at the Blue Hen 21 yard line, Dickens rushed up the middle five yards to the endzone for his first of three consecutive touchdowns.
Dickens’ next touchdown was a one yard run that followed a UD three and out on the Blue Hens ensuing possession. Following a punt from the Hens, the Flames marched 79 yards downfield on 13 plays to set up Dickens’ second touchdown run of the quarter. The redshirt sophomore finished his terrific second frame with a 30-yard run to the endzone in the Flames final possession of the first half.
Delaware’s offense only mustered nine points on three made field goals from graduate kicker Nate Reed in the first half. The Blue Hen’s offense struggled both on the ground and in the air against the conference’s highest ranked passing defense and third ranked scoring defense. 
The Blue Hens had six big plays — passes of more than 15-yards and runs of over ten yards — in the first half compared to nine for the Flames. None of UD’s plays went for more than 30 yards.
Delaware finished the first half with 205 total yards of which only 39 came from the ground game — an area where Liberty had struggled all year allowing close to 190 yards on the ground per game entering the contest.
Following Dickens’ fourth touchdown of the game on a 72-yard run to open the second half, things got better for the UD offense. The Blue Hens scored back-to-back touchdowns to cut Liberty’s lead down to 35-24 with under six minutes to play in the third quarter. The two scores came on receptions by tight end Elijah Sessoms and junior Donovan Lewis which were their first career touchdown receptions. 
The Flames answered the scores with a pair of touchdown receptions from Donte Lee Jr. and Jacob Jenkins in the final minutes of the third quarter. The catches put the score out of reach of a fourth quarter comeback as Liberty started the final frame ahead by 25 points.
The Flames ended the game with their season high for total yards (561 yards) and rushing yards (282 yards). Conversely it was Delaware’s worst defensive game of the year allowing a season high rushing total and season high total yardage. 
Dickens’ ended with a record setting day rushing for a career high 217 yards and four touchdowns. 
The Blue Hens have four games remaining on their schedule. Three of those games are against fellow CUSA members including next week’s game against Louisiana Tech. That game will be on November 8 at Tubby Raymond Field.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gemini_Generated_Image_bfmrk1bfmrk1bfmr.png,,,2025-11-02 18:02:01.735995

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Oral History Project video)TOPEKA — Former Kansas Senate President Steve Morris, who served southwest Kansas for more than three decades as an elected school board member and state legislator, died Saturday. He was 79.
Morris died unexpectedly at home in Hugoton. He had undergone a series of bypass surgeries and underwent treatment for prostate cancer, said a daughter, Stephanie Heger.
“He was definitely someone who only wanted what was best and for people to work together,” Heger said in an interview Sunday. “He wanted to be a policymaker instead of a politician.”
As a father, she said, Morris was kind, humble and adhered to the biblical concept of “do to others as you you would have them do to you.”
“He was one of the people who never said a negative thing about anyone,” Heger said.
She said services were pending.
Morris was born in Garden City and raised in rural Hugoton. He graduated from Hugoton High School in 1964 and from Kansas State University in 1969. He served on active duty as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force from 1969 to 1974 before moving to the Air Force Reserve and returning to Hugoton to farm. His was married to Barbara Morris and they had three daughters — Susan Morris, Sara Tasset and Heger.
He was on the Hugoton Board of Education from 1977 to 1993 and the K-State Alumni Association Board of Directors from 1985 to 1991.
In 1992, Morris was elected to the Kansas Senate by defeating Democrat Leroy Hayden. Morris, a Republican, was a member of the Senate for 20 years.
He served as the chamber’s president from 2005 to 2013 during a period in which the Legislature grappled with controversial casino gambling legislation and court cases on funding of K-12 education. He was involved in shaping major bills on the budget, taxation, transportation and energy issues.
He lost a campaign for reelection in 2012 when defeated by Republican Larry Powell in the August primary. GOP Gov. Sam Brownback and Koch political interests had targeted Morris and one-half dozen other Senate Republicans they viewed as political moderates.
“Americans for Prosperity and Kansas Chamber sent out I think something like 40 negative, large postcards in the last two weeks of the campaign,” Morris said in an August 2024 interview with Kansas Oral History Project. “People had never seen something like that before. They assumed all those things were true, which they weren’t.”
Morris also was interviewed by Kansas Oral History Project in July 2020 regarding his legislative career.
Morris said that after leaving the Legislature he missed “the good people we worked with” and that “overall it was a good experience.”
 In 2014, Morris played a role in Republicans for Kansas Values, which supported Democratic state Rep. Paul Davis’ unsuccessful campaign for governor against Brownback.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SteveMorris-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-02 17:00:37.407888

The assistance, which was denied by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), would have  helped the state prepare for situations like the record-breaking floods that swept through southeastern Wisconsin in August. 
“The risks of severe flooding will only increase due to climate change, and our community needs to be prepared,” Moore said in a statement Thursday. “FEMA’s ill-conceived decision denies our state the opportunity to take proactive efforts to prevent future flooding and damage, which saves homeowners and taxpayers dollars in the long run.”
Research shows that severe storms and flooding will increase in Wisconsin due to climate change. Shortly after the August floods, which inundated parks and left over 1,800 homes damaged or  destroyed, Wisconsin Policy Forum noted a “dramatic increase” in extreme rain and flooding events, resulting in higher payouts for flood insurance. 
Although the Trump administration  approved a first round of disaster funds to assist individual homes and small businesses, additional support to help repair public infrastructure was also denied in late October. Counties in areas represented by both Democrats and Republicans were denied additional assistance.
“State and local governments cannot do it alone,” said Moore. “I expect Gov. Evers will rightly appeal this denial, and I hope that request will get bipartisan support in our congressional delegation. As our communities continue to recover, it is clear there is a need to build our communities back stronger and more resilient. I will continue advocating for Wisconsin’s needs at the federal level and push back against these ill-advised decisions.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-02 18:01:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Monkey escape in Mississippi gives a glimpse into the secretive world of animal research,"Jeff Martin, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/02/monkey-escape-mississippi-secretive-world-of-animal-research/,The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research.,"The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.
Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59 near Heidelberg, spilling wooden crates labeled “live monkeys” into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.
Key details remain shrouded in secrecy
Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn’t own them and won’t identify who does.
An initial report from the sheriff described the monkeys as “aggressive” and carrying diseases such as herpes, adding to the confusion. Tulane later said the monkeys were free of pathogens, but it is still unclear what kind of research the monkeys were used for.
The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.
“When a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,” said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
“It is highly unusual — and deeply troubling — that Tulane refuses to identify its partner in this shipment,” Jones-Engel added.
One thing that is known is that the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado pickup hauling the monkeys was driven by a 54-year-old Cascade, Maryland, man when it ran off the highway into the grassy median area, the Mississippi Highway Patrol said in a statement to The Associated Press. The driver wasn’t hurt, nor was his passenger, a 34-year-old resident of Thurmont, Maryland.
Confidentiality is built into contracts, blocking information
Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prohibit the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to the AP. That’s done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.
“To the best of Tulane’s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,” the statement said.
The crash has drawn a range of reactions — from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.
“How incredibly sad and wrong,” Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said of the crash.
“I’ve never met a taxpayer that wants their hard-earned dollars paying for animal abuse nor who supports it,” the Georgia congresswoman said in a post on the social platform X. “This needs to end!”
Tulane center has ties to more than 155 institutions worldwide
Tulane’s Covington center has received $35 million annually in National Institutes of Health support, and its partners include nearly 500 investigators from more than 155 institutions globally, the school said in an Oct. 9 news release. The center has been funded by NIH since 1964, and federal grants have been a significant source of income for the institution, it said.
In July, some of the research center’s 350 employees held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the opening of a new 10,000-square-foot office building and a new laboratory at the facility. This fall, the facility’s name was changed from the Tulane National Primate Research Center to the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center to reflect its broader mission, university officials announced.
Research monkeys have escaped before in South Carolina, Pennsylvania
The Mississippi crash is one of at least three major monkey escapes in the U.S. over the past four years.
Last November, 43 Rhesus macaques escaped from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research after an enclosure wasn’t fully locked. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
In January 2022, several cynomolgus macaque monkeys escaped when a truck towing a trailer of about 100 of the animals collided with a dump truck on a Pennsylvania highway, authorities said. The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29160952/AP25302613820212.jpg,,,2025-11-02 13:16:47.302730

Detroit residents who haven’t already voted will head to the polls on Tuesday to help decide who the city’s next mayor will be.
The election — featuring candidates Solomon Kinloch, a pastor, and Mary Sheffield, city council president — has been largely focused around issues related to neighborhood revitalization, safety, poverty, and housing instability.
All of those issues affect the city’s public schools, and each of the candidates say they intend to play a role by partnering with schools to ensure children have a quality education.
What that role looks like remains to be seen. But low academic achievement, high rates of chronic absenteeism, and the myriad effects of poverty on student learning are key challenges in Detroit.
Here’s what you need to know about the election.
 What can Detroit’s next mayor do?

Unlike in some other big cities, Detroit’s mayor doesn’t have any control over or say in education issues. But the mayor can still have some influence.
For instance, students miss school at alarming rates in the city, and it’s not just because they want to blow off the classroom.
More than half of the students in the Detroit Public Schools Community District attend school outside their neighborhood, and challenges getting to and from school often lead to absences.
The Detroit Partnership for Education Equity and Research has reported that a third of families in Detroit don’t own a car, and 30% of families don’t have a fixed way to get their children to school.
Meanwhile, high school students largely take city-run transportation to get to school, and Chalkbeat has often heard from teens that buses don’t always arrive on time or pass them by when they’re waiting at the bus stop.
While the mayor can’t equip all Detroit residents with vehicles or require students to attend their neighborhood school, they can address issues with the transportation system. The topic came up earlier this month when Sheffield and Kinloch met for a televised debate.
Sheffield vowed to provide “more coordinated transportation to reduce absenteeism and get our students back in school,” while also noting that the city needs to improve transportation wait times. Kinloch said that in order to improve transportation, the city needs to ensure it is offering competitive pay to transit workers, has reliable vehicles, and has trained mechanics.
 What Detroiters told us they want from the next mayor

Chalkbeat asked Detroit residents to tell us what they would like to see the next mayor do to address education issues in the city.
Some common themes emerged. Residents said they welcome the mayor playing a role in education issues, though several made it clear schools should continue to be independently operated. They told us they want to see Sheffield or Kinloch address issues such as safety, transportation, poor attendance, lack of stable housing, and lack of student engagement.
One reader told us that the mayor needs to play a role because she or he “has a direct impact” on some of the biggest challenges facing schools in the city.
Sharon Kelso, a Detroit district parent and education advocate, said safety, lack of student engagement, and lack of accountability of school staff are major factors affecting student learning.
“There is currently too much failure with blame being placed on students and parents,” Kelso said.
The next mayor, she said, can promote parental involvement by holding town hall meetings to hear parent concerns. They can also hold town hall meetings and conferences to hear from students. Kelso said the mayor can work with DPSCD and charter school leaders to address transportation and safety issues.
 Sheffield and Kinloch’s views on education

Kinloch has said he will create a cabinet-level position that would partner with DPSCD “to make sure that we’re removing the social ills that keep the children from showing up in class in a productive way, not to just to survive, but to thrive.” He said on his website that the cabinet member would work with school administrators, educators, parents, and students “to coordinate city services that support student success.”
Sheffield, in a response to a Chalkbeat Detroit survey, said she would “commit significant resources” toward improving conditions that affect education that the city oversees. Sheffield, during the debate, said she would partner with DPSCD and charter schools on a consistent basis to “ensure that we have robust after-school programming within a two mile radius of every school, focusing in on literacy,” as well as addressing the social deterrents that affect students and families.
 How to vote in Tuesday’s Detroit election

Detroit residents aren’t just voting for a new mayor. They also will be electing city council members, city clerk, board of police commissioners, and the community advisory council.

Joe Pizarchik knows mining.
For nearly a decade, he served as the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), the federal agency charged with regulating the surface impacts of underground coal mining across the country.
Before that, Pizarchik served in his home state of Pennsylvania in its Department of Environmental Protection, first as assistant director of the Bureau of Regulatory Counsel, then as director of the Bureau of Mining and Reclamation.

Pizarchik said that in all that time, he’s never seen a situation quite as disheartening as the one the nation is experiencing under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with Inside Climate News, Pizarchik spoke at length about the current regulatory environment around coal mining and, more specifically, about a recent announcement in Alabama. The state’s top coal regulator has suspended federally mandated methane monitoring after a March 2024 home explosion atop a coal mine that left an Alabama grandfather dead and his grandson severely injured.
“It is extremely disappointing to see a Trump regime putting the interests of big corporations and wealthy people ahead of American citizens and the environment,” he said.


So far in his second term, President Donald Trump has emphasized his administration’s support for what he calls “clean, beautiful coal,” which is actually the dirtiest, and often most expensive, of fossil fuels.
The administration has also trumpeted the fast-tracking of coal projects across the country, claiming that doing so will “unleash American energy.” Often, however, that characterization doesn’t hold water. In Alabama, for example, where the Bureau of Land Management has just approved mining thousands of acres of publicly owned coal, part of what may be the largest mining expansion in state history, none of the extracted coal will be used to power American homes. Instead, the metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, will virtually all be shipped overseas through the port of Mobile, Alabama, for use in foreign manufacturing.
Pizarchik said that he’s particularly concerned about the ability of federal agencies like OSMRE to enforce regulations required by law during a government shutdown.
Even when Pizarchik was head of the regulator and a government shutdown wasn’t at hand, he said, it was difficult for the agency to meet its goal of inspecting 10 percent of all mines. Now, under the current regulatory environment, Pizarchik said that’s even further out of reach.
“It’s highly unlikely that’s happening at this point,” he said.
Pizarchik is also deeply troubled by the actions state like Alabama, where regulators have moved to push back against what he views as common-sense enforcement of federal law to protect citizens from imminent threats.
In March 2024, a home exploded above Oak Grove mine, a longwall coal mining operation in rural Jefferson County, southwest of Birmingham. The explosion, likely caused by the release of methane gas, which is released during the mining process, led to the death of W.M. Griffice, a grandfather, and severely injured his grandson.

In December 2024, following an extensive investigation by Inside Climate News, federal regulators at OSMRE issued a “Ten-Day Notice” indicating that the mine might have been out of compliance for failing to adequately monitor potentially explosive methane emissions. The notice required Alabama regulators to come into compliance or “show cause” for any failure to seek adequate remedies.
In response, state officials required coal companies across Alabama to submit methane-monitoring plans within 90 days to mitigate risks posed by escaping gas. Before the 90 days were up, and at the request of the coal industry, the director of Alabama’s coal regulator, Kathy Love of the Alabama Surface Mining Commission, issued a six-month extension.
Officials from OSMRE pushed back, writing to Love that they felt the extension was “excessively long” and that the agency likely would not have abated its Ten-Day Notice had they known she planned such a delay.
In September, as that extension was about to expire, Love sent a letter to OSMRE notifying federal regulators that she had indefinitely suspended any requirements to monitor methane gases above coal mines, even where homes and businesses are present. Love also asked federal regulators for a formal review of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the Ten-Day Notice, which she said she believes should be “withdrawn.”

Pizarchik said he’s never heard of a state agency approaching federal regulators months after a Ten-Day Notice to ask that it be withdrawn. If Love had issues with the agency’s actions, he said, they should have been expressed to federal regulators months ago.
“If Alabama and this director thought there was no merit to it, she had ten days to put together the evidence and demonstrate that,” he said. “She didn’t do that, which I think raises questions about her credibility.”
Love declined to answer Inside Climate News’ questions about the letter and Pizarchik’s observations. “No comment,” the director said in an e-mail.
Pizarchik also said that the timing of Love’s letter may be opportunistic, sent at a time when OSMRE’s regulatory staff is stifled by the government shutdown and in the shadow of the Senate’s confirmation of Lanny Erdos, a former coal executive, as the new head of OSMRE.
“This letter’s timing might have been tied to the impending shutdown and with the change in leadership,” he said.
Love’s letter also came just weeks after the Bureau of Land Management approved a private company’s mining of federal coal in Alabama, partly based on the expectation that Alabama would soon have methane monitoring requirements above mines.
That expansion of Warrior Met’s Blue Creek mining facilities is slated to be one of the largest buildouts of coal mining infrastructure in the state’s history, with capital costs topping $1 billion. Taxpayer-funded support for the project, which included the controversial deepening of Mobile Bay to support exporting mined coal, may exceed $400 million.
“That could definitely be another timing factor,” Pizarchik said. “Wait until that project is finalized and then suspend the monitoring program so the coal companies don’t have to do it.”
Secretary Doug Burgum speaks to miners inside Warrior Met’s Mine No. 4 in Alabama. (Department of the Interior)
Pizarchik also said that he doesn’t buy Love’s contention that the technology doesn’t exist to conduct such monitoring and that doing so would be cost prohibitive for coal operators.
“It’s a crock of bull,” Pizarchik said. “Longwall mines are the most efficient in the country. So they ought to be able to afford that.”
Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill even lowered costs for coal mines, he said, reducing royalties on mining publicly owned coal and providing a tax break for metallurgical coal operations.
And the technology to monitor methane, Pizarchik said, already exists. Anyone can go into a Lowe’s or Home Depot and buy a basic methane detector, similar to a fire alarm, to provide protection. There are also basic steps mining operators can take to reduce the risk of methane escaping into residences or other confined spaces.
“You simply vent the methane into the atmosphere,” Pizarchik said. “And that’s not particularly expensive.”
Pizarchik also noted that Love’s letter unnecessarily criticizes a citizen who complained directly to federal officials following the home explosion. Love wrote that OSMRE’s regulatory actions may have been based on “media pressure and a citizen’s unknowledgeable complaint.”

Pizarchik said that preventing citizens from providing relevant information to federal regulators would violate the law. During the first Trump presidency, the administration moved to change federal rules to prevent direct citizen complaints, but that decision was ultimately reversed in the wake of lawsuits by environmental groups and, ultimately, Biden’s election, Pizarchik said.
“She appears to want to go back to the rules the way Trump had changed them last time—and that would make them not in compliance with federal law,” he said. “And she’s making a bold assumption about whether that citizen was knowledgeable or not, because the fact is, we know methane got into her neighbor’s home and killed a man.”
Ultimately, Pizarchik said Love’s suspension of methane monitoring increases the risk to residents living above coal mines, particularly “gassy” mines where significant amounts of potentially explosive methane gas are released during mining.
Love and her agency’s actions may bring into question whether the government, and potentially even Love personally, Pizarchik said, may be liable if another tragedy like the March 2024 explosion were to occur again:
“Given the six-month extension and now the permanent suspension, has she not created the circumstances for government liability in Alabama, in her official capacity and maybe in her personal capacity, if someone else is injured or killed from a methane explosion?”
If he were still director, Pizarchik said he would likely take a multi-prong approach to dealing with Alabama regulators. First, he would reissue the Ten-Day Notice requiring immediate action to mitigate the risks of methane escaping from mines. Then, he would begin the lengthy process of a federal takeover of Alabama’s mining regulatory program.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota legislative leader predicted he can “almost assure” that “every legislator” will support reforms addressing inmate rehabilitation and recidivism during the legislative session that begins in January.
Sioux Falls Republican Rep. Greg Jamison, a House majority whip, made the comment as a legislative committee examining recidivism rates held a meeting Wednesday in Sioux Falls. Recidivism is the term applied to inmates who commit more crimes after being released from prison.
Jamison is also a member of a new task force taking up the issue, appointed by the governor and dedicated to rehabilitation transformations in the system.

Both groups came out of lawmakers’ disillusionment with the state’s rehabilitation efforts during discussions about the need for a new men’s prison. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden promised to form the task force in exchange for support for the $650 million project in Sioux Falls, which he and lawmakers approved during a special legislative session in September.
The legislative committee will finalize its list of recommended legislation at its next meeting, targeting rehabilitation, diversion and supervision issues that affect incarceration and recidivism rates. Diversion of nonviolent felony suspects into rehabilitative programming, sentencing reform, more support for inmates reentering society, and addressing why parolees return to prison are all pieces that could impact South Dakota’s incarceration and recidivism rates, lawmakers on both groups said.
The new task force intends to look at rehabilitation throughout the remainder of 2025 and 2026. Task force chair and Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the task force will focus on short-term and long-term rehabilitation efforts happening with inmates while in prison.
Representatives with the Council of State Governments Justice Center spoke to lawmakers about helping improve rehabilitation efforts based on data from South Dakota and other states. The nonprofit worked with several other states to study and suggest criminal justice and prison reforms.
The nonprofit is already partnering with the state Department of Corrections through next spring to shore up the data tracking offenders who reenter South Dakota communities and better understand outcomes of inmates after they are released from prison. The task force voted to explore working with the nonprofit on Wednesday.

“We’ve struggled to kind of chart our path and goals and now our time is up,” Jamison said, “but this next committee, really, is going to have another window of time to evaluate and lay out a timetable and goals.”
A majority of inmates stay in the prison system for a year or less before being released. Ryan Brunner, senior policy adviser for the governor, said that timeline can limit the rehabilitation programs available to inmates. Upon admission, about 91% of male inmates and 97% of female inmates last year were diagnosed with a substance use disorder.
The task force plans to dive more deeply into rehabilitation options and community partnerships connected to programming for education, faith, tribal and behavioral health needs. Venhuizen said the group will likely meet again in December.

Three hearts
Harper Grant, 15, Chelsea
Octopuses have three hearts. I’ve been told that I do too. Is it the way I look at you or the way I listen? Is it how I place my hand on your shoulder or how I smile? I don’t think I try to hide myself the way an octopus does, and I certainly don’t have the tentacles to show off. But everything about the octopus seems familiar. 
The skin that changes color at will to help them hide. They’ll bury themselves in the sand just to be safe. That has to be uncomfortable, right? I’m sure they don’t exactly like it, but there are dangers around. The octopus is as much prey as it is predator, and their flexibility is both a blessing and a curse. Great for getting around and hiding out, but so easily breakable it’s funny. How much of me is in that skin?
The eyes that watch their surroundings for prey. Looking for the perfect chance to strike while hidden under a rock. How long do they wait just to eat? The ocean is littered with fish, shrimp and crabs for them to eat, but how many tries does it take just for one bite? That has to be exhausting, spending all day waiting to replenish the energy spent on waiting. When do they even have time to sleep? With those eyes that always watch for a chance that they may not even take. How much of me is in those eyes?
And of course, those three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills to pick up oxygen, and the other
takes that blood and spreads it to the rest of the body. When an octopus swims, its third heart stops. Is that why they crawl? Even if they’re slower crawling, they can’t live a life of swimming. They’ll die. So they crawl, at the price of slowness. At least it won’t be their own fault if harm comes to them. At least they can say they were careful.
So, I guess I have to ask now. How much of me is in those hearts?

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island has not sent a voter list maintenance mailing to all active registered voters in over 15 years. That changes as early as Monday, Nov 3, when voters across the state should start receiving a notice in a white envelope with yellow markings and an “Official Election Mail” decal. 
The enclosed letter asks recipients to review the information on their voter record and update any inaccurate or outdated information online at vote.ri.gov or by mail using the form on the back of the letter.
Reviewing and responding to the mailing will help ensure the accuracy of Rhode Island’s voter list and that voters are eligible to vote in the 2026 elections, according to the office of Secretary of State Gregg M. Amore.
If voters receive a letter addressed to someone who does not live at their address, they are asked to write “Not at this address” above the address on the envelope and return the envelope to their mail carrier. 
State and local election officials receive voter list maintenance information from several agencies, including the Division of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Health, and the U.S. Postal Service’s National Change of Address program. 
A voter’s registration becomes inactive when a piece of official elections mail is returned to the sender as “undeliverable.” If an inactive voter does not cast a ballot in one of the next two federal elections, their voter registration can be removed from the voter list, according to federal and state law.
Election officials have removed 107,738 voters from the state’s voter list through these voter list maintenance processes since Amore took office in January 2023.
Voters who need assistance updating their record can call the Department of State Elections Division at (401) 222-2340 or their local Board of Canvassers’ office. For more information on the mailing and a list of frequently asked questions, visit sos.ri.gov/mailing.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-02 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Private schools would take public fund vouchers, but  not with strings attached",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/02/private-schools-would-take-public-fund-vouchers-but-not-with-strings-attached/,"Private schools have been relatively quiet on  vouchers, though they say now they would take public funds if they did not have to follow the same rules as public schools.","During a recent meeting of the special Mississippi House committee studying school choice, private schools made it clear that they would not participate in any voucher program that required them to follow the same rules as public schools.
An official told legislators the private schools would not submit their students to state assessment tests and would not require their schools to have open enrollment.
When asked about a possible middle ground, Barrett Donahoe, executive director of the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools, replied, “I don’t think we have to compromise anything. I think our schools do a good job.”
The private schools’ refusal to bend on certain issues should not be a surprise to legislators. While House Speaker Jason White, House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar of Senatobia, Gov. Tate Reeves and advocates have touted the need for and advantages of vouchers, the private schools historically have been relatively quiet on the issue, though they do say now they would take the public money as long as they did not have to follow some of the rules adhered to by public schools.
But in recent years, as late as 2024, private schools embraced state tax credits being used to benefit them instead of direct taxpayer payments through vouchers.
They reasoned there would be less oversight with tax credits.
The Mid-South Association of Independent Schools said in a paper titled “The ABCs of School Choice” that tax credits with revenue going to private schools were considered more advantageous to them than vouchers.
“Freedom advocates, instead, look for policies like tuition tax credits and tax credits for donations to scholarship funds, to free up resources so that parents and donors can fund their own choices,” said the paper found on the MAIS website in 2024. “Such policies expand choice for parents without shifting the burden for their children onto others.”
The paper, which no longer is available on the private school association’s website, in part reads, “School choice cannot exist without driving up taxes – or cutting other parts of the budget to avoid deficits. As of 2019, private schools educated 44,000 students in Mississippi. If the Legislature approved a $7,000 voucher for each of those children, it must come up with $308 million more dollars in tax revenue – plus the increased bureaucratic costs (and other costs) associated with administering the program.” 
The state currently offers limited tax credits to private schools through a program dubbed the Children’s Promise Act. The program allows a person or business to make a donation to one of the private schools certified by the Department of Revenue and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for up to 50% of the donor’s state tax liability or a credit on local property taxes.
In simple terms, the donors to private schools get to pay less in either state income taxes or local property taxes.
The maximum a private school currently can receive through the program is $405,000 annually. Because of the popularity of the program with the private schools, there have been unsuccessful efforts in recent years, led by White and Lamar, to expand the Children’s Promise Act. It is currently capped at $9 million per year in tax credits.
To qualify to receive the benefits of the tax credits, a school must provide services to at least one student with “a chronic illness or physical, intellectual, developmental or emotional disability” or be eligible for the free lunch program or be a foster child.
The Department of Revenue, which oversees the program, has said it does not know how many students who fit into the Children Promise Act categories are educated by each school. Yes, theoretically, it could be only one.
While Lamar, the primary legislative advocate of the Children’s Promise Act, has sought unsuccessfully to increase the amount of the tax credits, he has not made any effort to increase the oversight of the program.
Some have argued that the tax credits do not put a strain on the state budget because money from state coffers does not go out to the private schools.
The argument seems disingenuous since people who donate to the private schools can have their tax liability cut in half, thus reducing the amount of money going into the state general fund.
Reducing the amount of state revenue available, as the tax credits do, accomplishes the same goal as vouchers – decreasing the amount of money available for public schools, health care, law enforcement and other services the state is expected to provide.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06124141/3X0A2527-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-02 07:16:39.011769

“This is the best place in the world to train,” says Jessie Diggins, a gold, silver and bronze medalist and member of the SMS T2 elite cross-country team capping its offseason in Vermont.

STRATTON — After winning Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals and, just last winter, her third cross-country season World Cup, Jessie Diggins could be forgiven for lazing away the summer and fall on vacation. So why has the most decorated U.S. Nordic skier in history instead run, biked, roller-skied and weightlifted the past six months in Vermont?
“This is the best place in the world to train,” the 34-year-old said recently atop Stratton Mountain as she pointed to steep trails and a nearby gym. “There’s everything you need.”
Diggins isn’t alone in her assessment. She’s one of a half-dozen athletes — including fellow U.S. Olympians Julia Kern and Ben Ogden, Canadian colleague Rémi Drolet and U.S. development team members Fin Bailey and Jack Lange — capping their offseason in the Green Mountain State as part of the SMS T2 elite cross-country team.
The team — formed in 2012 by Stratton Mountain School and the T2 Foundation, a nonprofit that’s now part of the World Cup Dreams Foundation — trains annually from May to the start of racing in November.
“We’re getting prepped all the ways you can when you don’t have snow underneath your feet,” said head coach Colin Rodgers, a former Middlebury College ski team captain and recent U.S. Ski & Snowboard coach of the year. “This place has a tradition and track record that’s probably unmatched anywhere else.”
Or at least in the “lower 48” United States. Diggins, Kern and Ogden just scored three of the seven top “A” slots on the 2025-26 U.S. cross country ski team (which also includes “B” racer Jack Young of the Craftsbury Outdoor Center’s Green Racing Project). Alaska Pacific University’s elite team snagged another three “A” positions, while a Mainer training in Norway took the final spot.

“I remember talking with a couple of people about starting this,” said Caldwell, now 70.
Those “couple of people” weren’t random folk. Take Caldwell: A 2013 inductee into the Vermont Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame, he’s the father of 2014 and 2018 Olympian Sophie Caldwell and the son of 1952 Olympian John Caldwell — the latter who literally wrote the book on cross-country skiing in a trailblazing 1964 guide the Boston Globe calls “the bible of the sport.”
Another team founder: Caldwell’s friend and fellow Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American to win an Olympic Nordic medal, in 1976, and U.S. flag bearer at the 1992 Winter Games. Koch, 70, remembers when offseason training was limited to cycling the back roads of his childhood Windham County.
“We weren’t pricking our fingers and taking blood samples — that’s all new to me,” Koch said of today’s physical and physiological performance testing. “We know a lot more now than we did then.”
So much so, Diggins devoted an entire chapter of her recent memoir “Brave Enough” to her Stratton workout.
“We hike, swim, gravel bike, run … this incredible mix of different things,” she said in an interview. “You’re trying to train as hard and as much as you can, but not stepping over into injury or burnout.”
“I think of it as stacking bricks,” Diggins continued. “Every day that you work out you add another, and then the weeks build into a really strong base, an incredible fortress of fitness.”
Diggins elaborated on the regimen on comedian Paula Poundstone’s podcast.

“Roller skis,” the Olympian told the host, “are kind of like speedy death traps because they don’t have brakes.”
Diggins said she can wheel more than 50 miles an hour, spurring Poundstone to wonder if everyone on the team was still standing.
“We’ve lost the ability to have a knee-modeling career or an elbow-modeling career,” the skier replied, “but other than that, we’ve lost nobody.”
Instead, all are somebodies. Kern, named to the U.S. cross-country ski team at 17, is now a 28-year-old two-time World Championship medalist.
“I wanted to train with the best,” Kern said of her arrival at Stratton a decade ago.
Ogden, for his part, is the son of two other of those founding “couple of people,” John and Andrea Ogden of nearby Landgrove. But the 25-year-old University of Vermont graduate earned his place on the team as a two-time NCAA national champion and winner of the World Cup’s 2023 Green Bib for fastest male skier under age 23.
“I’ve been coming up to Stratton since I was a kid,” he said.
The team works out six days a week, then kicks back on Mondays.

“There are certain times you need to train really, really hard, but there also are times when you need to be recovering,” Rodgers said. “Your body’s only able to absorb the training if you give it proper rest.”
The team took side trips this summer and fall to Olympic venues in Lake Placid, New York, and Park City, Utah. Diggins and Kern also flew to the Snow Farm cross-country ski area in New Zealand.
“Although we can replicate training on roller-skis,” Kern said, “nothing beats being on snow.”
Then again, working out amid green grass and flaming foliage has its benefits.
“You just feel really supported by this close-knit community,” Diggins said.
In appreciation, the team gathered more than 100 local Bill Koch Youth Ski League students at the base of Stratton Mountain in August for a question-and-answer session.
“What’s your favorite glitter color?” one girl asked Diggins, who often bedazzles her face.
“One time I got to glitter Ben’s mustache for a team relay,” she said of Ogden, “and that was a combo of blue and red.”
The team is wrapping up its training before the start of international racing Nov. 28 in Finland, the 2026 Olympics Feb. 6-22 in Italy and the first-ever World Cup cross-country finals in the United States March 20-22 in Lake Placid.
But while at Stratton, members are focused less on the future than on the present.
“The process of being fit enough to try to win the race is the fun part, and you have to really love and enjoy all that goes into that,” Diggins said. “The race is like the cherry on top.”

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Oct. 30, 2025.
Riding trails in Kirchner Woods on Taber Hill Road Thursday morning, Louis Arevalo noticed the smell of rain-soaked cedars and decaying leaves melting into the ground.
Long a locals’ hangout for lunch rides and dog walks, these trails just became a lot more accessible through minimal upgrades. Arevalo is an adaptive rider from Essex who rides a recumbent, hand-powered bike. He’s known for tackling terrain some able-bodied riders would shake their heads at, but today he’s taking flow laps with his dog Ozul, smelling cedars and leaves and giving feedback to Stowe’s trail ambassadors about the upgrades.
“I can ride more advanced terrain,” Arevalo said. “But it’s nice to have gentle terrain for everybody to either learn on or just play together on.”
It didn’t take much to make the Kirchner trails more accessible — mostly widening bridges and removing some rocks — but there’s a massive payout as people of all ages and abilities can now enjoy them. Arevalo especially likes how the trails still feel natural, with roots and non-threatening rocks making the ride interesting, but not necessarily technical.
“The number one question we received about this project was, ‘Is this going to become another Cady Hill?’ And the answer is, ‘No,’” Caroline Loeb, stewardship director with the Stowe Land Trust, said. “We’re not smoothing trails in the same way. Cady Hill serves a very different purpose. The goal here is to keep the rugged natural beauty while providing better access.”
According to Kenzie Brunner, executive director of the Stowe Trails Partnership, Stowe has some of the best accessible riding terrain in Vermont — and she would know. In her prior role with the Vermont Mountain Bike Association, she traveled the state taking inventories of these types of trails.
Since the formation of the Trail Accessibility Hub through the Vermont Trails and Greenways Council in 2023, which dispersed $600,000 in Vermont to assess and upgrade as many trails as possible, towns like Stowe have been expanding their accessible terrain to the point where some zones no longer distinguish between an accessible and non-accessible trail.
Kirchner Woods is the latest trail network in Stowe to receive this treatment. Charlie’s Bypass and Eagle Ridge in Cady Hill have seen the biggest changes, and Stowe Trails is currently planning another beginner and adaptive-friendly trail behind Stowe Village Inn.
For Staub, Brunner and Tom Rogers, executive director of the Stowe Land Trust, the Kirchner project highlights the potential of local partnerships.
The Land Trust owns Kirchner Woods, and according to Staub, the group identified its trails for accessibility upgrades years ago. Acting as a conduit to state funds, the Land Trust contracted Stowe Trails to perform the upgrades. Nicole Corriveau, an AmeriCorps member whose time with the land trust ended this year, worked closely with Stowe Trails on construction. There were even a handful of successful volunteer trail days.
Riding is only permitted on trails in the bottom half of Kirchner Woods, but the area is still a hotbed of activity for hollow residents and visitors alike.
“It’s beautiful in there,” Jeff Alexander said. He works with Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sports and helped Stowe Trails assess the changes that needed to be made in Kirchner.
Like many old mountain bike trails in Stowe, the system in Kirchner was built decades ago by former resident Hardy Avery. They’re beloved trails, Brunner said, and they haven’t changed that much.
“Recreation is such a well-loved and well-engrained thing in the state,” Staub said. “And we’re saying, like, ‘We’ve already done some of the work of making these places public and putting the trails in,’ but they’re not serving everybody. So how can we all collectively change that? I think it’s an across-the-board phenomenon.”

Seeing the falls
The Mill Trail to Bingham Falls is also getting an accessibility makeover. Owned by the Stowe Land Trust, the trail is short and not intended for mountain biking, but it’s extremely popular and dangerous for some people.
According to Rogers, Stowe Mountain Rescue, of which he is a member, responds to Bingham Falls seven or eight times a season. From a Google Maps perspective, it’s just a short jaunt from Route 100 to the majestic crashing falls, but the trail is steep with several hazards.
The calls are mostly non-emergent — lots of twisted ankles and busted legs — but some are more complex, with people trying to navigate areas where “they could really hurt themselves,” Rogers said.
Stowe Land Trust is midway through an accessibility project in the area. So far, they’ve replaced culverts with bridges and removed dangerous hazards. Rogers said the motivation is twofold — to improve flood resiliency and create a universally accessible trail.
“It’s just such a beautiful falls and a lot of people want to see it,” Rogers said. “Our goal is to open up the outdoors and nature, especially in some of these really high-profile beautiful spots, to people of all abilities.”

WINOOSKI — At her last city council meeting on Sept. 15, Kristine Lott closed out six years as Winooski’s first female mayor. Lott stepped down before the end of her term to start a family, and she reflected on the time she spent as mayor and the lessons she would carry forward. 
“It is so much more people-management than policy,” she said. “So much relationship building and communication to try to get these things to come together and move. It’s public service, but it is really people’s service before anything else.”
“I mean, it’s exciting to be the first breaking a barrier,” Lott said of her election in 2019. 
A week after being sworn in, Lott was thrown into the deep end: her first city council meeting as mayor included a vote on a $23 million bond for the city’s Main Street Project. The moment marked the start of a steep learning curve. 
“I didn’t say anything the whole time,” Lott recalled.  She said the experience was very intimidating, but she was determined to ask questions and learn quickly. 
In an interview after Lott’s final city council meeting, Interim Mayor Thomas Renner said he always admired “Mayor Lott’s attention to detail and the way that she is able to see the big picture and also the future picture of what we’re discussing at the moment.”

“I really want to make sure I uphold Mayor Lott’s legacy and continue the work that she’s been doing,” Renner said. 
Renner is breaking barriers as well. He is the first black man and first openly gay man to be mayor. “I’m excited to be able to bring some diversity to the job as well,” he said.
Just over a year into her term, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, giving Lott a challenge that would define her mayorship. “‘What am I doing?’” she remembered thinking. “I am in a leadership role. I don’t know what to do in this scenario.” 
During those first months, Lott leaned on staff and council members to help her steady the city through an unpredictable and challenging time. Lott said the Black Lives Matter movement in particular “made racial disparities come to a head.”

“The way that COVID information was being shared initially was not getting to a lot of our BIPOC and New American community members,” she said.
Winooski is among the most diverse cities in the state and one of Vermont’s only majority-minority school districts. Lott said she always felt a responsibility to reach across the community and make sure that as many voices as possible were heard and a part of the conversation. 
“As a white person representing this most diverse city, I knew that I had to do work to make sure I was engaging with other racial backgrounds,” she said. “It takes intentional work.”
That intention was clear during Lott’s time in office, said City Manager Elaine Wang. “Kristine was a really great partner,” Wang said. “She had a very even-handed approach, always listening to all perspectives before deciding on a direction.”

Some of Lott’s proudest moments came not from policy but from the bonds she built. Among them are her relationships with the members of Winooski’s Islamic community, which began with a simple introduction that grew into something much more meaningful.
Early in her first term, Lott kept walking past the Islamic Community Center of Vermont, just a few blocks from her house, and decided to stop in and introduce herself.  “Eventually someone answered, and I was like, ‘Hi, I’m the mayor,” Lott said, laughing. 
What started as a tentative knock on the door grew into a lasting relationship. Lott helped open lines of communication between mosque members, city staff and school liaisons that hadn’t existed before. She calls it her “biggest small win.” 
“The relationship building I did with the Islamic community through the mosque made me feel so good,” she said. “What was seemingly a small effort on my part really made them feel more included.” Lott said it will feel strange to lose the constant connection to what is happening around town.
“I’m just not going to be as plugged in as I was before,” she said. Lott is now ready for a new chapter filled with more time for herself and her family. She’s excited to enjoy the fall weather and welcome her first child later this year. 
“It’s going to be very freeing,” she said. 
Lott doesn’t hesitate to encourage young people to get involved in local politics. She said every perspective adds value to the community.

“Just do it,” she said. “You don’t need any special training or experience. The politics we’re doing at the local level impact everyone who lives here, and the more different perspectives we can get involved, the better the outcomes will be.”

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Communities around Louisiana, in a bid to get more information about the environmental and health impacts of industrial pollution, are taking data collection into their own hands — despite a law restricting how their research findings can be used to enforce air quality regulations. 
The practice is called community, citizen or participatory science, and it involves data collected from non-scientists that’s passed along to researchers who use their expertise to study and understand what they mean. From air quality to fisheries impacts, the grassroots-gathered information has the potential to inform the public about impacts of nearby industry. 
“Our challenge for really a couple decades has been: How can we get something that can empower the communities to be able to speak for themselves, about the issues, with data?” said Marylee Orr, executive director of Louisiana Environmental Action Network. 
The Louisiana-based nonprofit, long involved with community air monitoring projects, recently posted on its website an interactive air monitoring dashboard. The site gives continuous updates from air quality sensors placed at four locations along the Mississippi River in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The dashboard also lists locations and readings from Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality monitors.

The system, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, uses stationary air quality sensors to measure spikes in air pollutant levels. Toxic emissions such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds can be detected, recorded and displayed on the online dashboard, providing neighboring communities with information about potential health risks. 
Similar efforts to get hard numbers for air and water quality concerns are also happening in Cameron Parish, where community air monitoring and water quality research partnerships are expanding. The area is the site of three liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals, and six more LNG facilities are either under construction or in the planning stages.
Environmental groups, including the Habitat Recovery Project and For a Better Bayou, have been working to secure funding for air quality monitoring equipment and underwater sound research in an attempt to find the source of air pollution and fisheries disruptions in the region. 
“Stories hold weight, and science and data holds weight,” Habitat Recovery Project director Alyssa Portaro. “When we put these two things together, it really gives a robust picture of what’s going on.” 
Fishermen and advocates alike suspect air quality and fisheries problems in Cameron have ties to the nearby LNG facilities but have no independent data to back up their suspicions. The environmental groups received grants to buy monitoring equipment and hire fishermen to collect data and partner with scientists for research projects.
“Nobody knows exactly what’s going on out here,” said Sky Leger, a fisherman who works along Cameron Parish’s coast. He and his girlfriend, restaurant worker Karri Hooper, recently got involved with community science monitoring, in part, to help track whether noise from boat traffic and LNG facility construction is impacting adjacent fishing grounds.

Around the country, scientific communities have seen growing acceptance of data collection in partnership with non-scientists. 
“There’s been increasing recognition of the power of these types of projects to collect really useful data,” said Bradley Allf, a postdoctoral research associate at Colorado State University who uses participatory science to study urban ecology and conservation.
Allf studied the concept of citizen science data collection for his doctoral thesis, saying the research technique has grown in popularity as well as acceptance within the scientific community over recent decades. 
“There was some hesitation around whether we can really trust data collected by people who haven’t necessarily been trained in science,” Allf said. “I don’t think that’s very true anymore.”
Despite its expanding acceptance, the struggle to increase transparency around industry’s environmental impact in Louisiana with community-gathered data faces legal hurdles. 
The Louisiana Legislature approved a law in 2024 enacting strict qualitative standards for community air monitoring programs in order to be considered valid data that state regulators could use for oversight or enforcement. 
Air-monitoring equipment and analysis must use the most current EPA-approved techniques, and data must be analyzed at labs the Louisiana Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program certifies, according to the legislation dubbed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act.
Environmental groups argue these standards, which can be costly, prices them out of being able to do research. The cost for the state’s preferred monitoring equipment runs up to $500,000 dollars, said former EPA official Larry Starfield, an adviser to Orr’s monitoring dashboard project
“That’s not something that is accessible,” said Misha Mayeur with the Habitat Recovery Project. 
The equipment her group intends to buy with current grant proceeds costs around $11,000, cheaper than the regulatory monitors that cost more than their entire annual budget to buy. 
The sensors the Louisiana Environmental Action Network uses for its stationary air monitoring in Southeast Louisiana, like those in Cameron Parish, aren’t up to the standards for regulatory enforcement in the 2024 state law. The regulatory monitors required in Louisiana to allege pollution violations cost around $500,000 dollars, said former EPA official Larry Starfield.
Even if the data can’t be used to enforce air quality standards for Louisiana, Orr said there’s still value in community awareness that could prompt change. 
“If the data suggest a problem, it’s an opportunity for communities to invite companies to investigate their concerns,” said Orr. 
Starfield said he hopes keeping the community informed could offer a way to let industry prove its willingness to cooperate and improve air quality. 
“Many of the workers live in the community. Why wouldn’t you want to have a good relationship?” he said. 
President and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association and Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance president David Cresson responded to the launch of LEAN’s dashboard in a statement emailed to the Illuminator, saying the association was reviewing LEAN’s data and methodology. 
“We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue,” Cresson said in a statement from the association.
And if industry chooses not to cooperate, Starfield said data can help encourage state and federal entities to get involved. 
“The idea is to engage Louisiana [Department of Environmental Quality] and EPA in a situation where there’s a feeling that there’s a problem here, we’re seeing a pattern,” he said. “Certainly bringing in EPA and bringing in LDEQ and asking them to investigate … that’s absolutely a good thing.”
Fishermen in Cameron used their collective voice to engage state enforcement in August when they brought to light impacts to oysters, crabs and fish from dredging spills near the site where Venture Global’s CP2 LNG facility is being built. 
Venture Global initially claimed there were no sediment spills or harmed fisheries. But at the urging of fishermen, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries sent a biologist to study the area, and the official later confirmed oysters had been killed.

“The only thing that they’re going off of is by the reports of the people that Venture Global hired,” Leger said. “But we have the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries coming out here and checking the oysters … and they are saying that there is very much so a problem with sediment being on top of those oysters in the lake.”
Portaro said this example is a strong argument for informing the community, as well as involving scientists, in documenting air and water quality issues in places like Cameron Parish. 
“The fishermen were able to verify that, document it; then Fish and Wildlife came out and said, ‘Yeah, there is mud in the lake,’” said Portaro. “Sometimes the biologists on the job need the community keeping an eye on them, a well-informed community.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cameron-community-science-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-02 06:16:51.508557

But the next year, a 26-year-old Republican woman named Erin Stewart was elected mayor.
It was the start of a 12-year run for Stewart. She has been reelected every two years, the beneficiary of her own brand of fusion politics, an aversion to polarizing national issues, and the low turnout in municipal races that tend to blunt a Democratic advantage in voter registration.
On Tuesday, Democrats will try to exploit open seats for mayor or first selectman in New Britain, Norwich and Torrington and the coastal suburbs of Branford and Westport. They are held by Republicans, and all the communities except Torrington have Democratic advantages in voter registration.
More than 150,000 votes already had been cast as of 10 a.m. Saturday in early voting that ends ends Sunday, with 75,657 ballots cast by Democrats, 33,474 by Republicans and 43,936 by unaffiliated voters.
With no competitive mayoral contests in the larger cities, New Britain is the marquee race. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal headlined a rally there Saturday for the Democratic nominee, state Rep. Bobby Sanchez.

A victory there would be important to Democrats on two counts: It is home to Stewart, who is exiting city hall to focus on a run for governor in 2026, and it offers a test of the degree to which animosity to President Donald Trump can be used to turn out Democrats who typically vote only in presidential years.
“I’m listening to a lot of individuals throughout the city in New Britain that are not happy with the current administration in Washington, D.C., and I think that’s going to trickle down to our local elections this year,” Sanchez said. “The working poor are really pissed off they are not going to get SNAP benefits.”
The Trump administration ordered the suspension of the SNAP food program, effective on Saturday, the start of the second month of the partial federal shutdown. Two federal judges ordered Friday that payments resume, but it could take days to restart a program that relies on federal vendors using state data to load benefits on electric benefit transfer, or EBT, cards.
Sanchez, 64, is a soft-spoken nonprofit administrator who has been a state lawmaker for 14 years. He trying to become the first Hispanic mayor of a city known for its Polish immigrant heritage but is now 43% Latino or Hispanic and 14% Black.
New Britain is a city of 74,000 where the poverty rate is 20%, median household income is $51,586, nearly 11,000 people rely on SNAP federal assistance for food and 30,000 rely on Medicaid for health care. Democrats are exploiting the interruption of SNAP and threats to Medicaid.
“We’ve made a big point of that in campaigning, that everybody is on the line,” said Don DeFronzo, a former New Britain mayor and state senator supporting Sanchez. Democrats “did a mailing this week that says, ‘Today, it’s SNAP. Tomorrow, it’s Medicaid. Tomorrow, it’s Social Security.’”
GOP voter registration increased during Stewart’s tenure, but Democrats still outnumber Republicans in the city by nearly a 3-1 margin.
The Republican nominee for mayor is Sharon Beloin-Saavedra, 60, an alderwoman who was a Democrat until last year, albeit one who was allied with Stewart and most recently was elected on the GOP line. She bristles at any attempt to associate her with Trump.
“I don’t support Trump, but I support Erin Stewart. I support the city of New Britain,” Beloin-Saavedra said. “Donald Trump has nothing to do with the city of New Britain.”
Ben Proto, the chair of the Connecticut Republican Party, said Trump is a tactical distraction employed by Democrats, not a relevant factor in running a municipality.
“If the most important issue to you is whether or not the pride flag gets flown over town hall, well, I think you’re missing the whole point of municipal government,” Proto said. “I think other people care more about other things, like, more importantly, did my trash get picked up? Did my street get plowed? Did the ambulance show up when my kid fell out of the tree and broke his arm?”
Stewart, anticipating a Republican primary for governor, now embraces Trump after studiously keeping a distance. When she opened an exploratory campaign for governor in January, she announced without prompting that she had voted for Trump in all three of his campaigns for the White House.
“It’s not that she’s necessarily a rabid Trumper, but she empowers him,” DeFronzo said of Beloin-Saavedra. “They all do. By being there, they empower him to do what he’s doing. And no one has the balls to stand up and say, ‘No, stop!’ I think it makes a difference.” 
Speaking at the rally, Blumenthal said, “It’s us vs. them, and you have a right to ask, ‘Who is on my side?’”
Other cities
There are no mayoral races in Bridgeport, Hartford or Waterbury, where mayors are at the midpoint of four year terms.
Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker are heavily favored in their reelection campaigns. There are open mayoral races in Hamden and Norwalk, where Democratic primaries in August determined the likely winners on Tuesday, given the voter registration.
On Saturday, Lamont left the New Britain event to campaign in Torrington, where the Republican mayor, Elinor Carbone, also is leaving office after a dozen years.  Democrat Stephen Ivain, a councilman and Democratic chair, is facing Republican Molly E. Spino, a former Marine who has served on the council and board of education.
Torrington has trended Republican in both voter registration and election results. Trump won handily in 2024, and a long-time Democratic lawmaker was unseated.
In Norwich, Democrat Singh Swarnjit is attempting to become first Sikh elected as a mayor in Connecticut. He faces Republican Stacy Gould in a city where Democrats have nearly a 2-1 voter registration advantage. Republican Mayor Peter Nystrom did not seek another term.
In Westport, a wealthy Fairfield County town that also has more than a 2-1 Democratic advantage, Republican First Selectwoman Jen Tooker is not running, creating an opening for Democrats. Tooker won four years ago with just 50.03% of the vote. The candidates trying to succeed her are Democrat Kevin Christie and Republican Don O’Day.
In Branford, Republican First Selectman Jamie Cosgrove is not running, an opportiunity in a community where Democrats outnumber Republicans, 7,113 to 4,362. The candidates are Democrat Josh Brooks and Republican Jeff Vailette.
Bristol, a community with a Democratic edge in voter registration and a history of close elections, has a mayoral rematch. Democrat Ellen Zoppo-Sassu is challenging Republican Jeff Caggiano, who narrowly unseated her four years ago. Trump and national politics went unmentioned in a debate last week.

(Nuclear Regulatory Commission)Swords or ploughshares?
That’s the dilemma that has plagued us since the sudden dawn of the nuclear age. Should we split atoms for peace or to rain destruction on our enemies? In the space of a single human life we’ve done both, killing hundreds of thousands in two atomic bomb attacks on Japan and then building nuclear reactors to provide light, power and medicine.
Radioactivity was discovered just more than a century ago, when Wilhelm Roentgen detected X-rays. In high school textbooks, most of us saw the ghostly radiograph of his wife Anna’s skeletal hand with wedding band, “Hand mit Ringen.” The image — the first X-ray — prompted Anna to remark, “I have seen my own death.” In 1913, science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted both nuclear power and weaponry, in “The World Set Free.” In 1938, the trio of Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann were first to recognize that uranium atoms split when bombarded by neutrons. When physicist Leo Szilard confirmed fission, according to author Edward A. Friedman, he said ”the world was headed for sorrow.”
In 1939, Szilard and Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising that fission could be used to create a powerful new bomb. The scientists feared the Nazis were already working on such a device, and their letter helped spur creation of the secret Manhattan Project, which eventually resulted to the test firing of the first atomic bomb in a remote part of New Mexico in 1945. Three weeks later came the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
The Cold War began shortly after, and by 1949 our former allies, the Soviets, had their own nuclear weapon, too.
Later we created nuclear weapons stockpiles ready to kill hundreds of millions more and built dozens of nuclear generating plants to provide about 20% of the American electrical supply. One of those plants, Wolf Creek, owned by two regional utilities, has been online in Kansas since 1985.
Now comes a firm founded by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates, with the lure of bringing “advanced” nuclear power to Kansas. TerraPower announced a partnership last month with the state’s Department of Commerce and Evergy, one of the owners of Wolf Creek, to explore placing a natrium reactor somewhere in the utility’s service area of eastern Kansas.
TerraPower is already building a $4 billion pilot natrium reactor site in Wyoming, with half of the funding from the US Department of Energy. Some of the projected energy may power AI data centers. The company promises clean and safe power through its innovative technology, which uses molten salt (natrium is Latin for sodium) to cool the 345-megawatt reactor instead of water, as is done at Wolf Creek and every other commercial nuclear plant in the U.S.
A few Kansas communities in Evergy country have already tossed their hardhats in the ring to host the natrium reactor, including my home city of Emporia. The city commission, along with the county board and a regional development association, signed a letter of support for the project. Commissioners in Coffey County, home to the Wolf Creek plant, have also expressed interest, as have officials in Hutchinson.
TerraPower claims it will only place reactors where they are wanted, but there’s not been time for any substantive public discussion yet on the issue. Nobody asked Kansans whether we want a second nuclear plant or not. Another firm, Deep Fission, is working with an undisclosed partner to place reactors at the bottom of mile-deep holes in Kansas to supply power-hungry AI centers, but it’s not answering questions about details or whether it has sought state approval.
The gold rush for new nuclear is on.
We are, according to current U.S. policy, on the verge of a “new nuclear renaissance.” Old fears spawned by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are receding in popular memory. There is now public and bipartisan support for expanding nuclear power, according to a Pew Research Center poll.
It is understandable why leaders in a community like Emporia — which logged the state’s highest unemployment following the closure of Tyson meats — would find TerraPower’s projected 1,500 construction and 500 permanent jobs attractive.
But those vying to bring TerraPower jobs to their communities might want to cool their enthusiasm long enough to consider the safety and security risks presented by natrium reactors.
These risks were described to me by Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group. Lyman is an expert on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and safety and security. He’s also one of the authors of “Fukishima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster.”
“I have signifcant concerns,” Lyman said, “related to safety and security as well as for the economics. … It’s inexplicable to me why there’s so much enthusiasm for this type of reactor.”
When I spoke with Lyman on Tuesday, he’d just finished monitoring a multi-day Nuclear Regulatory Commission advisory committee meeting reviewing the preliminary safeguard assessment of the TerraPower’s Wyoming reactor.
It is important to note that TerraPower refused my repeated requests for an interview. “TerraPower will have to politely decline participation in this opportunity at this time,” public relations specialist Brooke Leader said on behalf of the firm.
The problems with the natrium reactor, Lyman said, are inherent in the design of any sodium-cooled reactor. The molten sodium bursts into flame upon contact with air or water, he said, and these types of reactors have historically been expensive to build and prone to leaks. But, he said, the most worrying thing about the natrium reactor is that it uses fuel enriched to up to 20% of the isotope Uranium 235. This fuel is called HALEU, for high assay low enrichment uranium, and it’s just below the threshold for weapons-grade material.
Conventional nuclear reactors use fuel that is between 3 and 5% enriched.
Natrium reactors require HALEU to make them smaller and more efficient, Lyman said, but there is no domestic source of this fuel available in the quantities needed. In addition, security at natrium reactors would have to be beefed up compared with conventional reactors, because HALEU is attractive to terrorists and rogue states. Enriching uranium to 20% represents most of the effort required to make weapons-grade material.
In addition, there’s the problem — inherent with every reactor currently operating or planned in the United States — that there’s no long-term storage solution for spent fuel. Work on the Yucca Mountain geologic repository was halted in 2010. All waste is stored on-site, in cooling ponds and dry casks. It will remain hazardous for much longer than there has been recorded history — tens of thousands of years.
We can’t even keep the government running year-round or provide reliable food and health care to our poorest Americans. How can we expect to keep the distant future safe from us?
The immediate risk with a natrium reactor, Lyman said, is fire.
Molten sodium “is a highly reactive material, so you have to keep it away from the air and water at all costs,” Lyman said, “or you could end up with a sodium fire. And having a nuclear reactor where the coolant itself can catch on fire just sounds like a bad idea. It really is. So they have to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent any exposure of the coolant to air or water.”
This adds a level of unneeded complexity, he said. Even though TerraPower claims that natrium reactors are safer than light water-cooled reactors, Lyman said just the opposite is true. The time to respond to accidents is much shorter, he said, and there is no containment structure — the familiar dome-shaped vessel — as additional backup to contain leaks.
“The Department of Energy is trying, with Congress’s help, to stimulate and stand up a whole production program for this kind of (HALEU) material,” Lyman said. “But the demand is very unclear. The investments are on the order of billions and billions of dollars for an infrastructure to make this fuel. It’s a risky proposition, and it’s not clear that TerraPower is going to have the amount of fuel it needs just for the first plant.”
Because TerraPower would not speak to me, I will rely on author Edward A. Friedman, in his 2025 book “Nuclear Energy: boom, Bust, and Emerging Renaissance,” to make the case for next generation reactor technology.
“The promise for successful realization of (advanced) technology was significantly enhanced with the groundbreaking of the TerraPower sodium-cooled natrium reactor,” Friedman writes. Bills Gates’s company, TerraPower, began construction June 10, 2024, at Kemmerer, Wyoming,  “of the natrium fast-neutron, liquid sodium-cooled reactor (SFR) that uses an associated liquid salt storage system. This fail-safe, small modular reactor (SMR) will be the first model in the world for cost-effective replacement of a coal-fired power plant with a nuclear reactor.”
The reactor is expected to become operational in 2030.
Gates hopes for hundreds of coal-to-nuclear transformations in the future, according to Friedman. Indeed, the vision of replacing fossil fuel that drove Gates to found TerraPower in the first place.
“There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter,” Gates wrote in his 2021 book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”
“The hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive,” Gates wrote.
Nuclear is the only carbon-free energy source, he said, that can reliably deliver power day and night through any type of weather on a large scale. It’s also one of the few practical ways to bring electricity to the poorest of countries, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to energy is highly correlated to wealth and happiness.
“It’s no secret that nuclear power has its problems,” Gates wrote. “It’s very expensive to build today. Human error can cause accidents. Uranium, the fuel it uses, can be converted for use in weapons. The waste is dangerous and hard to store.”
Yet, nuclear represented our best hope of stopping global warming, he claimed. There was nothing more important than halting the rise in temperature if we were to avoid catastrophe.
Recently, Gates has changed his tune on climate.
In a memo to COP30, the United Nations climate change conference scheduled for next week in Brazil, Gates abandoned his previous “net zero” views. He criticized “doomsday” climate scenarios and suggested that people will be able to “live and thrive” in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. It’s time to put “human welfare” at the center of climate strategies and improving agriculture and health in the poorest countries.
“Climate change is a serious problem,” he said, “but it will not be the end of civilization.”
The memo sounds like nothing short of a retreat from climate activism from a man who had spent personal billions on a quest for net zero. In the case of his push for advanced reactors, Gates may have been so driven by his desire to stop global warming that he swallowed the nuclear pill.
His sudden redirection must be having some effect on TerraPower, the company he founded. But his memo will have no effect on the U.S. delegation to COP30, because there will be no official American presence there. Donald Trump had already pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The world has now blown past the agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming, with more climate suffering to follow.
Trump recently directed the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing, something we haven’t done since 1992. There is not yet a name for this arms race, but it is on as surely as the seas are rising. I am reminded of Damocles from Greek mythology, who was taught the dangers of power by the sword dangling above. So let us call this the Age of Damocles, because nothing is happy for those wracked by anxiety.
It is no coincidence that we embrace a new arms race at the same moment we accelerate the regulatory process to approve and deploy new types of nuclear reactors that use disturbingly enriched fuel. While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears. Troubling issues remain.
Opposition to nuclear power that curbed the U.S. nuclear power program from the 1980s until recently was based not only on fictional movies like 1979’s “The China Syndrome” but in real-life accidents like Fukishima in 2011, in which an earthquake and tsunami shut down the power grid and made it impossible to cool the reactors. More recently, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, has caused alarm because it’s been damaged and sometimes cut off in the ongoing war with Russia. Movies that might contain some inaccuracies, such as the 2019 HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” are not causes of our nuclear jitters but expressions of them.
This is the global context in which we find ourselves pondering whether a new type of nuclear energy is good for Kansas or just a costly experiment that will risk accident or murderous mayhem. We live in a new period of global instability, one driven by all the old forces — greed, ignorance, haste, denial — that have plagued us since the ice receded. The communications from TerraPower have been carefully curated to present a sanitized version of a techno billionaire philanthropist’s dream of a nuclear renaissance.
I’m cold to the idea of spending billions on nuke plants to power, in large part, electricity-hungry AI data centers. It seems immoral when so many Americans go hungry and are without health insurance. Beyond that, there’s just too many unanswered questions about next-generation reactors.
But I’m opposed to the TerraPower plan for a natrium reactor in Kansas not because of the unknowns — where, how much, how long? — but because of what we do know. The HALEU fuel, in the amounts needed, presents an unacceptable risk of nuclear proliferation.
Let us not unknowingly beat our ploughshares into swords.

Manfred Mann
Has this ever happened to you?  You’re driving on a narrow road in the dark, when the headlights of oncoming traffic suddenly blind you, leaving you wondering where is the road and whether you might crash.


With sunset now coming as early as 5 p.m. (thanks to the return to Standard Time), driving in the dark becomes a real challenge if not a danger.  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data shows nighttime crashes are three times more likely than daytime, even on dry roads.
Why is this happening?  There are several reasons that headlights appear so bright.  The first is that the headlights may not be properly aligned, aiming too high.  And with more vehicles riding higher from the road (think SUVs and trucks), their headlights shine more directly into oncoming traffic.
Most problematic are the new kinds of headlights we use.  The older incandescent (yellowish) lightbulbs are being replaced by LED or xenon lights, which are blue-white and more glaring to your eyes. That’s because bright oncoming headlights, especially the bluish ones, cause the pupils in your eyes to constrict rapidly, literally blinding you until the oncoming vehicle passes and your eyes adjust.
What can you do? When bright lights come at you, don’t look into the oncoming beam.  Instead, look to the right edge or lane marker of your driving lane.  Use anti-glare mirrors, especially  in your rearview mirror,  so headlights on vehicles behind you don’t hit your eyes.
Most of all, slow down!  Being blinded on darkened roads, coated with wet slippery leaves, is dangerous.
Will blue light glasses help?  Even with good driving habits, glare from new headlight technology can still feel intense leading some drivers to look for solutions like special glasses.  
But the jury’s still out on this idea.  Some manufacturers and optometrists say that lenses designed to block or filter short-wavelength blue light can help reduce the perceived glare by filtering out that part of the spectrum.  Some glasses described as “for night driving” (the ones that are often yellow in tint) also have reflective coatings.
Doctors say some patients swear by these specs, making them more confident.  But safety experts say you shouldn’t take this as license to drive faster than is safe for the road conditions.
What else can you do? You can start by making sure you’re not part of the problem.  Get your own headlights checked for alignment at your mechanic or national chains like Midas or Goodyear.  It’ll cost you about $100.
It used to be that the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles checked headlight alignments during your bi-annual emissions tests, but that ended in 2001.  A bill (HB 6163) before the Connecticut legislature in 2023 would have restored those tests, but it never became law.
In the United Kingdom they’re taking this problem more seriously, upping testing of headlight brightness and where they aim down the road.  Some are even calling for a ban on super-bright LED and xenon bulbs.  UK stats claim 280 collisions a year in that country are caused by the dazzling bulbs.
Meantime, take it easy on the roads at night.  Maybe even avoid driving in those hours, if you can.  Try the glasses, if you’d like.  But above all… stay safe!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/headlights.jpg,,,2025-11-02 04:56:18.340335

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]NEWARK — Former President Barack Obama made a push for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill during a raucous campaign rally just days before Election Day.
“If you meet this moment, if you believe change can happen, you will not just elect Mikie Sherrill as your next governor, you will not just put New Jersey on a brighter path, you will set a glorious example for this nation,” Obama said Saturday to a packed house in the Essex County College gym.
More than 2,000 people attended the rally, cheering for the former president, chanting in support of Sherrill, and holding blue-and-white signs reading, “Hit the road, Jack,” and “Let’s land this,” a reference to Sherrill’s background as a helicopter pilot for the U.S. Navy. Hundreds who couldn’t snag tickets watched on a screen outside.
Saturday’s event was the latest in a string of events to boost voter turnout ahead of Tuesday’s election, where Sherrill and Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli are on the ballot. Polls show Sherrill ahead with a narrow lead, and Ciattarelli has been holding his own campaign stops with high-profile guests.
New Jersey is one of two states with a gubernatorial election this year, and they are often framed as a signal of voter sentiment one year after the presidential race and a year ahead of congressional elections.
Democrats from across the state came out to support Sherrill, including Democratic Reps. LaMonica McIver, Rob Menendez, Frank Pallone, and Nellie Pou, and local lawmakers like state Sens. Teresa Ruiz and Vin Gopal. Gov. Phil Murphy and his wife, Tammy, also spoke to the crowd in advance of the ex-president’s remarks. 
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, and former teachers union chief Sean Spiller — who all ran against Sherrill in the June Democratic primary — also attended. 
Sherrill, who walked on stage to Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run,” was greeted with a standing ovation and chants of “Mikie! Mikie!” 
She largely repeated her standard stump-speech promises, saying she would stand up to President Donald Trump, make New Jersey more affordable, and fight for the middle class. She also restated her pledges to freeze utility rates on her first day in office, lower prescription drug costs, and improve public schools. 
Sherrill attacked Ciattarelli for aligning with Trump, who held a tele-rally in support of the GOP nominee last week. The crowd often booed at the mere mention of Republicans. 
“I’m feeling nothing but courage. New Jersey will need courage, courage to make a change,” Sherrill said during her 20-minute speech. “Anger and courage are the daughters of hope.”

More than 1 million people have already cast ballots in New Jersey, either through early in-person voting or using mail ballots. Sherrill encouraged everyone to get their “friends, family, and frenemies” to get out and vote. 
Obama took the stage at around 7 p.m., hours after appearing in Virginia to support Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee in that state’s governor’s race. During his 40-minute speech, during which the audience in Newark remained standing, Obama told voters they “have a candidate worth being excited about.”
He slammed Trump for unleashing masked law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, wreaking havoc on federal workers and people dependent on food stamps during the government shutdown, and weaponizing the U.S. Department of Justice to go after his political enemies.
Obama said the country and our politics are “in a pretty dark place right now.”
“The good news is there is something you can do about it, New Jersey, right here, right now. You’ve got a candidate for governor … someone who sees you and knows your struggles,” he said. 
Obama said Sherrill, if elected, would work “with anyone if it helps the people of New Jersey, and she will listen to everyone too, whether they voted for her or not.” 
He also took aim at Ciattarelli for running for governor three times — Obama joked he believes in “persistence, but at a certain point” — and said that during Ciattarelli’s current campaign, he had to “suck up” to Trump. 
“At the end of the day, what this election is about, what politics in a democracy is always about, is values,” he said. “What do we care about? What are we voting for? What do we prioritize? What are our core convictions?”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Saturday in Norfolk, former President Barack Obama lent a familiar and energizing presence to a campaign rally for Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for Virginia governor. 
Obama headlined the event, where Virginia Democratic lawmakers at the state and federal level as well as Spanberger’s running mates spoke in support of her in a final attempt to galvanize voters ahead of Tuesday’s historic race, where Spanberger or Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears will be elected the state’s first woman governor.
The crowd of roughly 7,000 chanted “yes we can” and sang songs before the speakers — including Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News and Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi and attorney general candidate Jay Jones — took the stage.

All of them drew applause, but the crowd roared with excitement when the country’s 44th president walked to the podium. The rally, days ahead of Election Day, is the third time Obama has stumped for Virginia’s gubernatorial nominees since leaving the White House.
Obama portrayed Spanberger as a “workhorse” in Congress whose bipartisan track record will translate to good governing. 
“Abigail does not just say the right thing,” Obama said. “As your governor, she will do the right thing.” 
Spanberger called Obama “someone who represents the very best of public service” whom she was “honored and humbled” to have in Virginia to cheer her on.
 Themes of service, bipartisan cooperation

Service, Spanberger emphasized in her speech before Obama’s, has been the core of her career — first, in law enforcement, then the Central Intelligence Agency, and later in Congress where she worked with lawmakers of both parties to pass bills that became law. 
She recalled how health care policy first inspired her to run for office. Frustrated by Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act — Obama’s legacy as president — she said “I knew I had to do something.” 
“Spoiler alert, I won,” she said of being elected to Congress, flipping the 7th  District to Democratic control and defending the seat two more terms before deciding to seek the governorship. 
Health care remains a critical issue this election cycle both in Virginia and nationally, as the Republican-controlled Congress passed a reconciliation bill this summer that will trigger changes to hospital funding mechanisms and may cause millions of Americans to lose Medicaid coverage. Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation are also trying to extend ACA subsidies that help low-income earners purchase health insurance, but those efforts have been stalled amid the current government shutdown. 
In addition to health care affordability, Spanberger noted her goals to address housing, and energy affordability and said as governor, she would stand firm against overreach from President Donald Trump’s administration while finding ways to work across the aisle. 
“You deserve a governor who will work with Democrats and Republicans to grow our economy and not stand by while Virginia’s workforce is under attack,” she said, a reference to the Trump administration’s layoffs of federal workers. Virginia is home to nearly 150,000 civilian federal employees.
“When I was in Congress, I worked with anybody and everybody to deliver results,” Spanberger said. 
 ‘We need that light’

After branding her the next governor of Virginia, Obama asked voters to cast their ballots for Spanberger. As he reflected on the first 10 months of Trump’s second term in office — marked by the federal layoffs, ramped up anti-immigration efforts and growing economic strains — Obama pitched Spanberger as an inspiration amid the widescale uncertainty. 
“And Lord knows, we need that light. We need that inspiration, because let’s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” he said. “It’s hard to know where to start, because every day, this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”
“I know I’m the ‘hope and change’ guy,” Obama said in reference to his winning presidential campaign slogans, but he emphasized he is “worried” about the direction of the nation under Trump. Obama criticized Capitol Hill Republicans for the ongoing government shutdown and Trump for “using the Justice Department for going after his political opponents,” “deploying the National Guard in American cities, claiming to stop crime waves that don’t actually exist,” and other actions to which the crowd booed in response.  
“Don’t boo, vote,” Obama said, a callback to 2016 when he supported Hillary Clinton for president. “They don’t hear boos, they hear votes.”
 Jones joins the rally

The event also featured Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Hashmi and attorney general candidate Jones — the first time both have campaigned in person with Spanberger since news broke of violent texts Jones sent in 2022. 
Jones apologized to former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his family for the texts at an  Oct. 16 debate with Republican incumbent Jason Miyares. In the messages, Jones said hypothetically he would kill Gilbert with “two bullets” and referenced his children dying.  
The incident was not rehashed during the Saturday rally with Obama, as Jones reiterated his commitment to standing up to Trump if elected. As the top lawyers for the state, attorneys general have responsibilities that range from consumer protection to providing legal counsel to governors and signing onto multi-state lawsuits. 
“I’m running for attorney general to put Virginia first,” he said as the crowd cheered. 
With over one million votes already cast via early voting, Election Day on Tuesday, Nov. 4 will determine who next helms Virginia’s executive branch and which party will control its House of Delegates, where all 100 seats are on the ballot.

The Caesar Rodney Riders scored 21 points in the second quarter to beat the Cape Henlopen Vikings, 35-14, Thursday night.
 
CAMDEN — Amidst a moderate downpour of rain, Caesar Rodney’s senior quarterback Quinn Deviere stood in the pistol formation awaiting the snap on third down. Needing four yards for a new set of downs, Deviere caught the snap and surveyed the field starting to his right working his way back to the middle of the field. That’s where he found sophomore Denzel Jones.
Deviere launched his pass through the rain to Jones overtop the second level of the defense. Jones leaped up and caught the elevated pass securing it with two hands without breaking his stride. Jones burst across the field to the left sideline where he turned upfield and finished the play in the endzone for the Riders’ first score of the game. 
Jones’ 46-yard touchdown catch was one of three consecutive touchdowns for Caesar Rodney in the second quarter that helped them defeat Cape Henlopen, 35-14, Thursday night.
The Riders scored their next touchdown just a few minutes after their first. The Riders started their offensive possession on the Vikings’ 20 yard line following a turnover on the kick-off. On the second play of the drive, Deviere connected with senior Jayden Minor at the back of the endzone to take the lead. 
Deviere’s third touchdown pass of the game came in the final minutes of the first half on a deep ball to Jones. The sophomore caught the pass and raced 60-yards to the endzone completing a strong second quarter for Caesar Rodney.

The whole second quarter was played while rain poured down on the players, coaches and fans. The heaviest rain started with about six minutes left to play in the first quarter and lasted until the end of the half. The skies were clear for the Riders’ senior night celebration pregame and the Vikings first touchdown of the game in the first quarter.  
Junior quarterback Jameson Tingle scored Cape Henlopen’s first touchdown on their first offensive possession of the game. On third and goal, Tingle took the quarterback keeper and dove into the endzone for the rushing touchdown. Junior running back Ozmeer Batson scored the Vikings’ other touchdown in the late stages of the third quarter on a one yard run through the middle of the defense.

The Riders held the district’s second best scoring offense scoreless the rest of the way and added a pair of scores in the fourth quarter to earn the victory.
Caesar Rodney is 2-2 in 3A district two play this season sitting behind the undefeated Smyrna High School in the standings. Cape Henlopen is also 2-2 in district play. The two teams are tied with St. Georges and Sussex Central whom also have 2-2 district records.

,DC,2025-11-01 20:33:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump administration must restart SNAP benefits by Wednesday, judge rules",Jane Norman,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-must-restart-snap-benefits-wednesday-judge-rules,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Saturday issued a written order saying there is “no question” that U.S. Department of Agriculture contingency funds must be used to provide food assistance for 42 million Americans during the government shutdown.Rhode Island U.S. District Court Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. had said during a Friday hearing he was granting a temporary restraining order sought by cities and nonprofit groups. McConnell ordered that the government distribute payments of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. Because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, Trump administration officials had said the program could not provide SNAP benefits beyond Saturday.In response to McConnell, President Donald Trump in a social media post later Friday said administration lawyers believed the funds could not legally be paid and that he needed clarification about how to distribute SNAP benefits. “I do not want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,” Trump said.  “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding …”Government lawyers also filed a brief in the Rhode Island case asking McConnell to clarify how his order could legally be carried out, noting it was delivered orally and there was no written transcript.In his Saturday order, McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, quoted Trump and said, “So, here’s the ORDER and here’s the legal direction from the Court.”In a footnote, the McConnell order also said: “The Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”McConnell said it was likely that the plaintiffs would succeed in their case. He noted that Congress appropriated funds for SNAP in an annual spending bill, and lawmakers directed that $3 billion should be put in reserve through Sept. 30, 2026. Another $3 billion in a later bill was put aside until Sept. 30, 2027. “There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown; in fact, the President during his first term issued guidance indicating that these contingency funds are available if SNAP funds lapse due to a government shutdown,” McConnell said.Two options in written orderBecause the $6 billion is not enough to cover the estimated $9 billion cost of November benefits, government lawyers have said it would be difficult to determine reduced benefits, McConnell said. He said USDA then should “within its discretion, find the additional funds necessary” to fund the full $9 billion, suggesting use of $23 billion in a fund for state child nutrition programs.If the government chooses to make full SNAP payments for November, it must do so by the end of the day Monday, he said. If instead the government makes a partial payment of SNAP funds, then it must pay out all the $6 billion in contingency funds by Wednesday, he said.He asked the government to update him by noon Monday how it was complying with the order.In a separate case, a federal judge in Boston also ruled Friday that the USDA plan to pause SNAP was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.No matter what happens on Monday, experts and a key member of Congress have said that some SNAP recipients still may see delays in their benefits because changes in administration from the federal government to states to vendors take time. In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the Saturday cutoff would have been effective for November benefits.",,,,2025-11-01 17:00:57.686047

First, colleges are not doing enough to build purpose, confidence, agency, and maturity. Colleges are not the cause of growing anxiety and a declining sense of purpose among young people; but, faced with the reality of these trends, colleges have not changed their models nearly enough to help students build purpose, confidence, agency, and maturity. 
Second, colleges are not doing enough to build “durable” or “transferable” skills and the networks and experiences students need to transition successfully from high school to 21st century careers that pay good wages.  
There is a striking gap between what students and college administrators think students have learned and can do, and what employers think students can do, particularly in vital areas such as communication, critical thinking, professionalism, and leadership. For example, 81 percent of recent graduates feel they are adept at critical thinking, while only 56 percent of employers agree. Seventy-eight percent of new graduates say they are proficient at communication, while only 54 percent of employers agree. 
Third, colleges cost too much. While many colleges and degrees still provide a great return on investment, many do not. Over the last 80 years, the relative portion of college costs borne by students/families, philanthropy, and the public sector has gone up and down, but the actual cost of delivering a year of college has risen sharply — at about four times the rate of inflation. 
The cost today of delivering a year of college education (not including research expenses, housing, etc.) at a four-year institution ranges from approximately $25,000 to $40,000,   compared to the average cost per student of delivering a year of K-12 education of about $16,000. And this is true even though K-12 students are in class for about 950 hours a year and college students are in class for about 350 hours a year. 
After a career spent mostly in K-12 education, for the last decade I have partnered closely with 20 different four-year colleges and universities, including public and private, large and small, selective and not selective. Each of these institutions offer strong programs backed by committed faculty and staff. But none is doing nearly enough to address the root causes of this trio of crises – a crisis of purpose, a crisis of skills, and a crisis of cost.  
The result is that American young people and their families are voting with their feet (the percentage of high school graduates choosing to enroll in college has declined from 70 percent in 2009 to 61 percent in 2023) and Americans of all ages are sharing their opinions about college, including at the ballot box.  
According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans expressing “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in higher education declined from 58 to 36 percent over the last 10 years while the percent expressing “very little” or “no” confidence shot up from 10 to 32 percent. 
So what should be done? And how can Massachusetts – home to America’s first public school (Boston Latin), first university (Harvard), and one of the greatest concentrations of colleges (104 colleges in a state of 7 million residents) – lead the way? 
I believe we need fundamentally new models for teaching and learning and that the new models need to break the monopoly of “sage on the stage” teaching and lean into an experiential learning revolution – a dramatic increase in real-world, apprenticeship-based, internship-based, and work-based learning.  We need to get students out of the classroom and out into the community.  
When I was in college, I learned a lot from some very sagacious professors who lectured and led discussions in their area of expertise. But I learned much more from job and internship experiences out in the real world. My experience is not an outlier. A survey sponsored by Hult International Business School reported that 77 percent of young people entering business careers said they learned more in their first six months of work after college than they did in four years of college. Why not make college more like those first six months of work? 
To be clear, I don’t think the purpose of college is just to prepare young people for work. And I do think an important role remains for “sage on the stage” instruction, including lectures, guided discussions, and liberal arts inquiry led by skilled professors. The purpose of college should include preparation for work, but also preparation of young people for a life of purpose, a life of civic leadership, and a life of critical thinking and action as citizens in a democracy, and as family and community members. 
What are some new college models that could point the way forward – and that could address the three crises of purpose, skills, and cost? 

A whole new type of college – an apprenticeship college – where half the credit comes from purposeful work with special projects, guided challenges, reflection, mentorship, and more. Reach University is piloting this approach with future teachers and public health workers, and College for Social Innovation, the nonprofit I lead, is exploring the creation of a two-year public service college built around four immersive public service internships as well as related courses in problem solving, human centered design, and communication. History credits can come from studying the history of social change movements in Boston and math credits from diving deep on the use of data to explain the successes and challenges of various social impact strategies. But the internships themselves – packed with research, project management, independent learning, and mentorship – need to be credited too. 


A whole new type of college that is organized around missions, not majors, and that includes deep Outward Bound-type experiences at launch, at least two immersive high-impact learning semesters that offer learning primarily outside of the traditional classroom (with full academic credit), and a requirement that every student complete a capstone project that connects to their personal and professional mission. Colleges built around mission and purpose can build from an emerging network of “microcolleges” such as Deep Springs College in Nevada, Thoreau College in Wisconsin, and the Seguinland Institute in Maine, all supported by Springboard, a nonprofit designed to research and support small and purpose-driven learning communities. 


A whole new type of college that marries AmeriCorps or other intense and well-scaffolded service experiences with deep mentoring and low-cost distance learning taken at whatever pace is desired by the learner — with degrees earned over two years or over 10 years. This model can build on the work at Boston-based nonprofit Duet, which in partnership with Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) enrolls low-income students to work toward associate or bachelor’s degrees, using just half of their Pell grant to pay for classes at SNHU and the other half to pay for intensive mentoring and personalized coaching from Duet.  

The dramatic changes we need will require new and disruptive innovations – new “microcolleges” with the freedom to invent new approaches to higher education. But I also believe that many of New England’s current public and private universities have the potential to pivot and to build on the many superb things they are already doing while also adding substantially more real-world learning with substantially more rigorous assessment of that learning. The recent effort across Massachusetts public universities to dramatically expand work-based learning programs, supported by the Axim Collaborative, is a good start.  
The challenge is to move immersive, experiential learning from the sidelines to the center and from extracurricular to curricular. A related challenge is to measure learning much more robustly in a way that marries the mastery of competencies such as storytelling, data visualization, human-centered research and design, and project management with credits and credentials.  
In the future workforce, jobs that require simple research and even powerful regurgitation will be done by AI, by robots, or by low-wage labor from other countries. Great jobs will still exist, but they will require the type of nimble problem solving that can only be learned through real-world practice and experience. Colleges need to realize that what the students are learning today is not enough anymore. 
Our goal must be nothing less than a bottom-up rethinking of that period between high school and adulthood that finds new ways to build confidence and purpose, new ways to build skills and networks, and that does it for an affordable price.  
I often refer to Boston as “the Silicon Valley of social innovation,” and that description has been well earned over the centuries. Now we face a new crisis around the declining efficacy of one of those innovations – higher education – and we need to lead the nation again, in an experiential learning revolution – a set of solutions that help more young people become the leaders we need and the fulfilled adults they want to become.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-01 17:05:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,Uncertainty over federal food aid deepens as the shutdown fight reaches a crisis point,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/01/uncertainty-over-federal-food-aid-deepens-shutdown-fight-reaches-crisis/,Crises at the heart of the government shutdown were in focus as the federal food assistance program faced delays and millions of Americans were set to see a dramatic rise in their health insurance bills.,"WASHINGTON — The crises at the heart of the government shutdown fight in Washington were coming to a head Saturday as the federal food assistance program faced delays and millions of Americans were set to see a dramatic rise in their health insurance bills.
The impacts on basic needs — food and medical care — underscored how the impasse is hitting homes across the United States. Plans by the Trump administration to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Saturday were halted by federal judges, but the delay in payouts will still likely leave millions of people short on their grocery bills.
It all added to the strain on the country, with a month of missed paychecks for federal workers and growing air travel delays. The shutdown is already the second longest in history and entered its second month on Saturday, yet there was little urgency in Washington to end it. Lawmakers are away from Capitol Hill and both parties are entrenched in their positions.
The House has not met for legislative business in more than six weeks, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., closed his chamber for the weekend after bipartisan talks failed to achieve significant progress.
Thune said he is hoping “the pressure starts to intensify, and the consequences of keeping the government shut down become even more real for everybody that they will express, hopefully new interest in trying to come up with a path forward.”
The stalemate appears increasingly unsustainable as Republican President Donald Trump demands action and Democratic leaders warn that an uproar over rising health insurance costs will force Congress to act.
“This weekend, Americans face a health care crisis unprecedented in modern times,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said this week.
Delays and uncertainty around SNAP
The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold payments to the food program starting on Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to make them. Trump said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, which will not happen until Monday.
Benefits were already facing delays because it takes a week or more to load SNAP cards in many states.
“People are just nervous, scared,” said Jill Corbin, the director of the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry in Norwich, Connecticut. ”It’s not really a definite answer that we have right now.”
As people lined up early Saturday for hot meals and groceries, the Connecticut organization had 10 extra volunteers to help newcomers navigate the process. On Wednesday, some 400 families visited the food pantry and 555 people received hot meals.
“It’s kind of like everything is unraveling at the same time,” Corbin said. “I’m not going to lie. It is challenging.”
The SNAP program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and costs about $8 billion per month. The judges agreed that the USDA needed to at least tap a contingency fund of about $5 billion to keep the program running. But that left some uncertainty about whether the department would use additional money or only provide partial benefits for the month.
“The Trump administration needs to follow the law and fix this problem immediately by working closely with states to get nutritional assistance to the millions who rely on it as soon as possible,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said in a statement following the ruling.
Democrats demanded this week that the government fund SNAP, but Republicans responded by arguing the program is in such a dire situation because Democrats have repeatedly voted against a short-term government funding bill.
“We are now reaching a breaking point thanks to Democrats voting no on government funding, now 14 different times,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a news conference Friday.
Trump injected himself into the debate late Thursday by suggesting that Republican senators, who hold the majority, end the shutdown by getting rid of the filibuster rules that prevent most legislation from advancing unless it has the support of at least 60 senators. Democrats have used the filibuster to block a funding bill in the Senate for weeks.
Republican leaders quickly rejected Trump’s idea, but the discussion showed how desperate the fight has become.
Health care subsidies expiring
The annual sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act health insurance also begins Saturday, and there are sharp increases in what people are paying for coverage. Enhanced tax credits that help most enrollees pay for the health plans are set to expire next year.
Democrats have rallied around a push to extend those credits and have refused to vote for government funding legislation until Congress acts.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., spoke on the Senate floor this week about constituents who she said face premium increases of up to $2,000 a month if the credits expire.
“I am hearing from families in my state today who are panicked,” she said. “The time to act is now.”
If Congress does not extend the credits, subsidized enrollees will face cost increases of about 114%, or more than $1,000 per year, on average, health care research nonprofit KFF found.
In the days before the start of open enrollment, Democratic officials across the country warned that the cost increases would hit their constituents hard.
In Wisconsin, for example, families on the ACA’s silver plan could see premium increases of roughly $12,500 to $24,500 annually depending on their location. Sixty-year-old couples could face increases ranging from nearly $19,900 to $33,150 annually.
“No matter what the percentage is, it’s a hell of a lot,” Gov. Tony Evers, D-Wis., said.
Some Republicans in Congress have been open to the idea of extending the subsidies, but they also want to make major changes to the health overhaul enacted while Democrat Barack Obama was president. Thune has offered Democrats a vote on extending the benefits, but has not guaranteed a result. And he is demanding that Democrats first vote to reopen the government.
So the country waits and watches for Congress to act.
T.J. McCuin, whose family owns and operates farmers markets in Mesa and Apache Junction, Arizona, said 15% of the markets’ customers use SNAP benefits. He was not assuming the delays would immediately hurt the business, but added, “Hopefully this isn’t a long-term problem because once those benefits run out, then it’s going to start to hurt.”

(Photo by Clisby/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)​Martha Layne Collins, who as the only woman to serve as governor of Kentucky revolutionized the state’s economy by landing Toyota Motor Manufacturing, died at 3 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 1, in Lexington. She was 88.
Her husband, Dr. Bill Collins, said his wife died in her sleep at Richmond Place, a retirement community in Lexington where they have been living. 
“I was with her. We had a lady for hospice, and caregivers came in and out. She died peacefully. She lived a remarkable life,” he said.
Her remarkable life began with her birth in Shelby County on Dec. 7, 1936. She served as governor from 1983 to 1987, when Kentucky governors were limited to one term.  
Collins was considered a candidate in 1984 for vice president of the United States as a running mate with Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who instead chose Geraldine Ferraro.
Collins was elected lieutenant governor in 1979 and served simultaneously with Democratic Gov. John Y. Brown Jr.  
Collins got off to a rocky start as governor but after the first two years excelled, using economic incentives to bring Japanese automaker Toyota’s largest manufacturing plant to Georgetown in 1986, a development that remains an economic mainstay in Kentucky.  
Collins also successfully pushed for improvements in education. In June 1985 she unveiled a package that raised teachers’ salaries by 5%, reduced class sizes, funded construction projects, provided aides in kindergarten classrooms and helped find more money for poorer school districts. 
After leaving office, she was president of St. Catharine College in Springfield from 1990 to 1996 and later taught leadership classes at the Harvard Institute of Politics’ John F. Kenedy School of Government.
Dr. Collins said their children, Steve and Marla, will decide arrangements.  Steve is director of Hall-Taylor Funeral Home in downtown Shelbyville, which his grandfather, Martha Layne’s father, Everett Hall, operated.

(Photo by Minh Ha/Verite News)The Federal Communications Commission voted Tuesday to loosen regulations set just last year that would have significantly reduced the rates that prisoners, jail detainees and their loved ones pay to keep in touch.
In July 2024, the FCC passed its first cap on rates that prisons and jails — along with their telecommunications contractors — can charge inmates to make audio calls. The rule, originally scheduled to take effect at the beginning of this year, set the rate at 6 cents per minute for a 15-minute call for large jails and prisons, far below the rates that most people were paying in Louisiana, where some parish jails were charging as much as 25 cents per minute, according to a 2022 report by the Prison Policy Initiative.
Criminal justice reform advocates, including Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who runs New Orleans’ jail, have argued that high call rates stretch family budgets and prohibit the type of connectivity that studies show is beneficial to incarcerated people and their families.

Still, for decades people behind bars and their loved ones have been forced to pay exorbitant rates to stay in touch, while telecommunications companies and facility operators have traditionally split the revenue they made from enforcing high rates.
Hutson, who will step down in May after losing her reelection bid this month secured a new contract that offers one free 15-minute phone call per day and one free 20-minute video call per week to jail detainees.
Neither Hutson, nor Sheriff-elect Michelle Woodfork immediately responded to requests for comment from Verite News.
In 2023, Congress granted the FCC the authority to regulate phone rates and in 2024 it voted unanimously to significantly limit the amount that telecommunications companies and the facilities that they provide service to can charge for calls.
But the rule never took full effect. State prison systems and local jails, such as the New Orleans city jail, that had active contracts with telecommunications providers were given a one-year grace period to adjust their rates. And then, in June of this year, the FCC announced that the caps would be delayed until April 2027.
Thursday’s vote, meanwhile, nearly doubles the 2024 cap for some institutions. The new interim rates raise the maximum cost of phone calls with people inside prisons from 6 cents per minute to 11 cents per minute. Rates for large jails, like the Orleans Justice Center, defined as holding 1,000 or more residents, are now capped at 10 cents per minute for phone calls. Rates for medium to very small jails range from 11 to 18 cents per minute. Under the previously agreed upon rules, those rates were capped at between 7 and 12 cents per minute.
The new rates include a two-cent-per-minute added fee that would go to the jails and prisons for “correctional facilities’ expenses.” The temporary regulations continue to prohibit fees known as “site commissions” — a percentage of the per-minute calls that is shared with facility operators, such as sheriff’s offices — and other ancillary fees, associated with setting up an account to make phone calls.
Women need earlier intervention in the criminal justice system, report suggests

The change in rate caps appears to be a response to concerns raised by telecommunications companies that the 6 cents per minute limit did not cover the costs of security measures — like surveillance of calls — associated with providing service in prisons and jails. FCC members said the 2024 rules had resulted in some jails ceasing to provide telecommunications services at all.
In a meeting on Zoom on Monday, prison phone justice advocates representing Worth Rises and the United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry said that only one small jail, in Baxter Country, Arkansas, had opted to end telecommunications services in retaliation against the lowered rate caps.
Criminal justice reform advocates at Louisiana nonprofit the Promise of Justice Initiative have been campaigning to convince the state Department of Corrections and local sheriffs to reduce the cost of phone calls for detainees and their loved ones to zero. Hardell Ward, director of community impact for the organization, said the FCC is backpedaling and going against what Congress and voters want to benefit telecommunications companies.
Ward noted that Securus, one of the the largest prison and jail telecommunications companies in the United States, is owned by Tom Gores, owner of the Detroit Pistons, through his private equity firm Platinum Equity. Securus provides phone services for Louisiana state prisons and a number of parish jails. (The New Orleans jail uses a different contractor.)
“Louisiana pays for the Detroit Pistons,” Ward said.
A representative for Securus’ parent company Aventiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the rate changes from Verite News.
Ward said that lower call rates keep incarcerated people more connected with their loved ones on the outside, which in turn keeps them happier and makes the prisons and jails safer.
“When you deny that connection, you’re putting guards who have to manage that facility in the line of fire. You’re taxing the resources of sheriffs,” Ward said.
Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, a Shreveport Democrat who represents north Louisiana on the commission — which regulates telecommunications companies for the state —  has long criticized rates for phone calls with incarcerated people. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Campbell said he is against the less restrictive rate limits.
“We have the highest rate of incarceration in the country and the poorest people,” Campbell said. “It all circles around one word – greed. If you gave [the telecommunications companies] 6 cents, they’d want 10 and if you gave ‘em 10, they’d want 15 and then 20.”
The Louisiana Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Verite News.
Federal Communications Commission member Anna Gomez, a Biden administration appointee and the only commissioner who voted against the rate cap increases, opened her remarks by calling the move to increase rate limits for prison and jail calls “indefensible.” The other two commissioners, Olivia Trusty and Chairman Brendan Carr, were both appointed by President Donald Trump.
“[Adopting the new rules] implements an egregious transfer of wealth from families in incredibly vulnerable situations to greedy monopoly companies,” Gomez said, noting that people with loved ones behind bars are saddled with the difficult choice of paying the high rates or losing their connections. “Families have no option but to pay the higher rates, regardless of whether they have enough to make rent, buy groceries or pay the electric bill.”
Trusty, who joined the commission this year, noted that telecommunications companies that provide phone service in prisons operate at an advantage because their customers can’t sign up with a competing firm. But she said the high costs of safety and security measures, like recording and monitoring phone calls, unique to providing service to carceral facilities, must also be considered.
Before the vote, Carr noted that changes to rate caps of prison and jail communications have resulted in multiple lawsuits. In November Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and the Louisiana Sheriff’s Association sued the FCC in opposition to the 6 cent rate cap.
Carr laughed at an audible “boo” that came from a member of the audience when he entered the deciding vote to approve the new rate caps.

(Photo courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa have enacted emergency plans as they prepare for interruptions to federal nutrition and fuel programs come November.
“These are things that were thrown on us knowing damn well that we are going into our winter months,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chair Jamie Azure said during a Thursday morning tribal council meeting. “This is a literal life and death situation for a lot of people.”
Tribal governments are tapping into their own resources to help their communities weather the shutdown, which started Oct. 1 after Congress failed to adopt a budget.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa on Thursday announced it will deploy over $1 million to help fill in some of the service gaps. That includes $500,000 for food vouchers, $500,000 in fuel assistance, $40,000 to a community soup kitchen, $50,000 for a senior meal program, $100,000 for a school backpack nutrition program and $40,000 for meals at Turtle Mountain College, the tribal council said during the meeting.
Native communities scramble to provide food with SNAP, WIC cutoffs looming

“We probably won’t feel a major impact for a few weeks into November, but it was important that we exhausted every avenue before we got to this point,” Azure said.
He said the tribe doesn’t expect the federal government to reimburse it for any of the expenses after it reopens.
Tribal governments are also encouraging members enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to switch to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Distribution Program, which provides food to low-income households living on reservations. Some Native American households living near reservations can also participate in the program.
The Spirit Lake Nation informed its members they had to close their SNAP account by Tuesday in order to be eligible for the Food Distribution Program for November.

Rep. Collette Brown, a Warwick Democrat and Spirit Lake Nation citizen, said Thursday that the tribe is worried about how to get food and supplies in the hands of members without reliable transportation.  
She said the Food Distribution Program offers healthy options and enrollees typically get more food per month compared to SNAP, but that it is less convenient since it requires people to pick up boxes in person at distribution centers.
Brown said the Spirit Lake Nation may establish a food voucher program for its grocery store, though the tribal government hasn’t decided yet.
“They’re still thinking it over, trying to identify where we can get funds,” she said.
Brown said the tribe will do whatever it can to keep its citizens warm and fed during the winter. They have firefighters splitting wood for fuel, and may also bring in hunters to help process game, she said.
In an Oct. 23 statement, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear criticized the shutdown and its effect on federal programs as a violation of the federal government’s duty to tribes.
“Congress, your citizens need you to come together,” Sitting Bear said in the statement. “Our tribal nations need you to fulfill your promises and obligations written in treaties and trust agreements. The consequences of your divisive political rhetoric are putting unneeded stress on your countrymen and women.” 
A state of emergency declaration adopted by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe authorized the tribal council to use emergency funds to support social services during the shutdown.
The declaration notes that the tribe has more than 2,300 monthly participants in SNAP, about half of which are children. It has about 200 participants in the Women, Infants and Children Program, and about 900 participants in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program during the winter.
Leaders of Turtle Mountain, Standing Rock and Spirit Lake, along with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate and Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation adopted a joint resolution on Oct. 23 calling on the state to support the continuation of services like SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children Program during the shutdown.
“I grew up on these programs, and I know firsthand how critical they are for families working hard to make ends meet,” Rep. Lisa Finley-Deville, a Mandaree Democrat and citizen of the MHA Nation, said in a statement announcing the resolution.
The MHA Nation in a Thursday statement to the North Dakota Monitor said it has not declared a state of emergency, but is coordinating with food distribution organizations to address food insecurity during the shutdown.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Thursday announced the state is using $1.5 million in general funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to go toward the Great Plains Food Bank and to sustain the Women, Infants and Children Program through the month of November.
“In my talks with the Governor’s staff this morning, each tribe will receive a truckload of food,” Rep. Jayme Davis, a Rolette Democrat and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa member, said in a Thursday Facebook post. She wrote that Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake’s deliveries are expected Nov. 5.

(Camera trap photo by Bryan White/USFWS)Craig Sweet, president of Iowa Trappers Association, is set to begin his 53rd season fur trapping this fall, just as soon as he gets the rest of his crops out of the field. 
According to Iowa Department of Natural Resources, furbearer season, which begins Saturday in Iowa, has had an “uptick” in interest due, in part, to workshops led by Iowa Trappers Association. 
Sweet said the more than six-decade-old organization has always held trapper workshops, but has started to hold more beginner-friendly classes in regions across the state.
The result, according to Sweet, has been a diverse crowd -– men, women, “oldsters and youngsters” — interested in learning how to trap. He said most attendees are interested in trapping because they have fur-bearing critters causing problems on their properties. 
“A lot of it is coming from people that are owning property and are wanting to control populations on their property for nest raiders and stuff like that,” Sweet said.

There are 14 furbearer species that Iowans can hunt or trap from Nov. 1 through Feb. 28: raccoon, muskrat, coyote, red fox, gray fox, beaver, mink, opossum, badger, spotted skunk, striped skunk, weasel, river otter and bobcat. Beaver season, according to DNR, extends until April 15. 
Sweet said he traps “everything that’s harvestable” in Iowa. Many of these critters, he said, are also viewed as a nuisance because they can cause damage to crops, gardens or livestock. 
The Iowa Trappers Association also has a series of publicly available videos on YouTube that detail basic trap setups and more advanced sets.
Historically, fur trapping was a profitable industry in Iowa. According to reports from DNR, species like beavers were so desirable at one point that the populations were almost decimated in the state.
 Throughout the decades, various pelts were more desirable than others, depending on fashion trends. Skunk, for example was frequently warn by movie stars in the early 1900s until the 1930s, which led to a spike in skunk fur trade.

In the late decades of the 20th century, anti-fur harvest groups, a drought and weak global fur market led to a “crash” in furbearer harvests in Iowa. 
DNR reported harvest trends have remained low since. While still low, harvest numbers increased to nearly 92,000 in the 2023-2024 season, which was up from around 65,600 the year prior. 
Since 2020, roughly 15,000 Iowans participate in fur harvest season each year. 
Vince Evelsizer, a DNR biologist specializing in furbearers and wetlands, said species populations for the upcoming season are in “good shape.” Evelsizer said most species are trending higher except for gray fox populations.
Muskrat populations have historically been tied to season precipitation amounts, as the slinky rodents live in marshes and wetlands, but DNR’s trends in furbearers report said overall populations have been declining since the late 1980s. 
Evelsizer said water levels in streams, marshes and rivers are better this year than last year, which might mean there are higher muskrat populations. 
“A lot of north Iowa marshes have water in them, which bodes well for species like muskrats, and the weather outlook is favorable heading into the first two weeks of the season,” Evelsizer said in a news release with DNR. “We’re not expecting freeze up for water trappers.” 
Evelsizer said fur prices this year are similar to last year, with a slight uptick in badgers, wild mink and striped skunk pelts.
Sweet said most trappers participate in the sport for fun, or to control animal populations, rather than to make money on the fur. 
“With the current markets, you got to do it because you like it,” Sweet said. “Because in the long run, you’re going to end up losing money.”
Sweet said he tans some of the pelts he harvests to hang on his walls or to give away at Iowa Trappers Association events. 
Furbearer hunting and trapping season begins Saturday, and Evelsizer encouraged prospective trappers to review regulations and to have a “safe trapping season.”

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration’s emergency order to keep the huge J.H. Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan operating past its planned retirement date has cost at least $80 million since May, its operator, Consumers Energy, told regulators and investors this week.
The company said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday that it would pursue the process laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy’s order for collecting those costs: It will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest.
Even though the peak summer electricity demand season has passed, executives at Consumers, Michigan’s largest energy provider, said that they see no sign of let-up in the emergency orders.
“We expect those to continue for the long-term,” said CEO Garrick Rochow in a conference call for investors. “And we’re prepared to continue to operate the plant and comply with those orders.”
He said the costs—$615,385 per day—should be shared beyond the 1.9 million electricity customers of Consumers Energy. The company plans to propose the tab be split among ratepayers (an estimated 42 million to 45 million electricity customers) in the nine states served by the regional electric grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).
“The benefits go to MISO,” Rochow said. “Not just to our customers, they go to MISO.”
Rochow said the Trump administration envisioned this approach. “That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said. Consumers Energy will have to apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to pass the costs to the ratepayers, and states that oppose such a cost allocation could move to intervene in those proceedings.
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued two consecutive 90-day orders—on May 23 and on Aug. 20—to keep the Campbell plant open under the emergency provisions of the Federal Power Act. In the past, such orders have been used to ensure energy delivery at times of natural disasters. But Wright used the act to execute Trump’s agenda to ramp up energy production, saying Campbell needed to stay open to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwest.
The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO. When he extended the Campbell order in August, Wright said that he was directing MISO “to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.”
“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power,” he said in that statement.
But critics say the operation of the 63-year-old plant is generating unnecessary costs as well as pollution. In a September regulatory filing challenging the DOE’s order, a coalition of environmental groups pointed out that even on the day of highest peak demand this summer, MISO had an unused surplus of resources greater than 10 times the power provided by the Campbell plant.
And indeed, according to recent Environmental Protection Agency data, two of the three units at the Campbell plant were not operating at all for about 30 days of the 131 days from the start of the DOE order through Sept. 30. The third unit at the plant only ran for 18 days. Such stoppages could occur for maintenance or simply because the grid operator did not call on the plant to deliver energy to the grid.
“Forcing this unnecessary coal plant to keep operating is bilking consumers for the benefit of the coal industry,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for Earthjustice, which is representing the environmental groups.
Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. The purpose of the litigation, Lenoff said, is “to stop the administration from harming consumers, trampling markets and unlawfully usurping the authority of states and regulators to make decisions in the public interest.”
Campbell is by far the largest of three fossil fuel electricity plants that are staying open beyond their planned retirements under Trump administration emergency orders. Campbell released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Talen Energy’s Wagner plant near Baltimore and Constellation Energy’s Eddystone plant just south of Philadelphia, both run on oil and natural gas. Some detail on their costs for keeping open may emerge next week, when Talen and Constellation report their third-quarter earnings.
Consumers Energy, which is continuing to work toward its previously stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, had projected that the retirement of the Campbell plant would save its customers $600 million over the next 20 years, or $30 million per year. Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1-1024x600.jpg,,,2025-11-01 09:16:48.517280

The field vying for one of the state’s two U.S. Senate seats grew recently with a candidate announcement by Justin McNeal, a Republican from Rapid City. His announcement sets up a potential June 2, 2026, primary race pitting him against incumbent Republican Sen. Mike Rounds.
McNeal said he is a Navy veteran and businessman who most recently founded Dakota BioChar, which aims to convert forest waste into material that can be spread on agricultural fields to improve soil health.

In his announcement, McNeal said the largest threat to the nation is its debt, and he pledged to work against what he described as the “unholy trinity”: special interests lobbying elected officials, who in turn receive campaign contributions from special interests.
“This system will never benefit ‘We the People,’” McNeal said.
At least two other people have announced their intention to seek Rounds’ Senate seat: Julian Beaudion, a businessman, community activist and Democrat from Sioux Falls, and Brian Bengs, a park ranger, Air Force veteran and independent from Hot Springs.
Johnson, Jackley have leads in polls
South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota released poll results this week.
Their poll of registered Republican voters found U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson leading the race for the 2026 Republican nomination for governor. He polled at 28%, followed by Gov. Larry Rhoden at 27%, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden at 15% and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, at 10%. Twenty-one percent of respondents were undecided.
The only declared Democratic candidate for governor so far is Robert Arnold, a college student. At least two independents have also publicly said they’ll run for governor: Allison Renville, a Lakota activist and member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, and Terry Gleason, a Chamberlain man.
In the race for the Republican nomination to succeed Johnson in the U.S. House, Attorney General Marty Jackley led the News Watch/Chiesman Center poll with 57% support, followed by Madison state Sen. Casey Crabtree at 5% and Piedmont businessman James Bialota at 2%. Thirty-six percent of respondents were undecided.
Announced U.S. House candidates on the Democratic side are former U.S. Department of Agriculture official Nikki Gronli, of Dell Rapids, and Sioux Falls nonprofit executive Billy Mawhiney. Scott Schlagel, a Democrat from Dell Rapids, has filed a statement of candidacy.
Campaign finance update
Rounds’ campaign begins with a big fundraising head start in the U.S. Senate race, according to campaign finance reports that include data through September.
His campaign committee came into the year with a balance of $1.9 million and raised $1.45 million while spending about $506,000, leaving a balance of $2.8 million. Beaudion launched his campaign this spring, bringing in about $146,000 since April and spending roughly $115,000, ending with about $31,000. Bengs, who also began his fundraising in April, raised about $155,000 and spent about $125,000, leaving a balance of about $30,000.

In the U.S. House race, Jackley raised about $526,000 since July and spent about $23,000, leaving him with about $503,000. Crabtree reported raising about $206,000 since July and spending about $25,000, ending with about $181,000.
On the Democratic side of the House race, Gronli reported raising about $23,000 since August and spending about $2,600, leaving her with about $21,000. Mawhiney reported raising about $17,000 since July and spending about $8,600, ending with about $8,500.
Candidates for state-level offices don’t have to report on their finances until January. Federal reports show that in the governor race, Johnson has about $6 million to bring over to his state-level campaign.
More candidate announcements
Attorney general: Jackley’s candidacy for the U.S. House creates an opening that McPherson County State’s Attorney Austin Hoffman hopes to fill; he recently announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination, joining at least one other Republican who announced previously, Lance Russell, the state’s attorney for Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties.
State treasurer: Jeff Monroe, a former state legislator who served the Pierre area, recently announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination to succeed the current officeholder, Republican Josh Haeder, who is term-limited.
State auditor: Sioux Falls City Councilman David Barranco has announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination to succeed incumbent Republican Rich Sattgast, who is term-limited.
Secretary of state: Incumbent Republican Monae Johnson is seeking reelection and has at least one challenger for the party’s nomination in state Rep. Heather Baxter, of Rapid City, while former state trooper Terrence Davis has declared his Democratic candidacy.
Public Utilities Commission: Former legislator Don Haggar has announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination to succeed Republican Commissioner Gary Hanson, who will not seek reelection.

Amid the cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, exacerbated by the ongoing shutdown, advocates called on the state to take action. They said lawmakers should expand Medicaid, protect food assistance programs, create standardized paid parental leave, support midwives and doulas and invest in child care and early childhood education. 
Mississippi is one of the most dangerous places to give birth, especially for Black women, who are four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related deaths, or deaths that occur during pregnancy or up to one year postpartum and are caused in part by the pregnancy. A combination of poverty, chronic diseases, provider shortages and policies that have shut out tens of thousands of Mississippians from health care contribute to bad outcomes for mothers and babies. 
Now, cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs threaten to walk back progress that has been made over the years, speakers said Thursday at the state Capitol. 
In the past three years, the Mississippi Legislature passed laws to give women an additional 12 months of Medicaid coverage postpartum, timely prenatal care as they wait for their Medicaid applications to process and paid parental leave for state employees. 
Democratic lawmakers and advocates in Mississippi had hoped to build on those policies by passing laws to guarantee all workers paid parental leave, and to expand Medicaid to cover those who currently fall in the coverage gap – making too much to qualify for the state’s strict Medicaid income threshold but too little to qualify for subsidies that make Affordable Care Act  marketplace insurance more affordable. 
Now, they worry that even keeping the current policies from shrinking might be an impossible feat. 
“We are facing dramatic cuts to Medicaid through the Big Ugly Bill and Donald Trump and Congressional Republican members’ efforts to gut this lifesaving health care program that covers so many births in your state and across the country,” said U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, one of the authors of “Momnibus” legislation aimed at addressing the Black maternal health crisis. Underwood attended the Mississippi event by video conference.
“To hear that you all are thinking about growing the workforce, investing in doulas, interested in taking a look at how to support community-based organizations and clinics across the state – these are the kinds of resources that our moms and our families need.”
Partisan disagreements over health care are at the center of the ongoing federal government shutdown. Democrats are fighting to renew Biden-era subsidies that are making health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. If they are not renewed, premiums on  ACA marketplace insurance plans will more than double next year, KFF estimates. 
And it’s not just about having health insurance, Cassandra Welchlin of the Black Women’s Roundtable argued. Welchlin described a mother she knows who works at a diner making $10 an hour, has no paid leave and relies on others to transport her. She risked her job to attend prenatal visits and returned to work two weeks postpartum. 
“If you aren’t Danielle, you know Danielle,” Welchlin said of the mother. “It’s not just about the health care coverage but a string of policies that we have to co-create together in order to make strong babies and healthy moms.”

The federal budget bill signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer includes the largest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in history. The cuts to Medicaid are expected to trigger the downsizing of many rural hospitals – and labor and delivery units are often the first to go when hospital budgets shrink. 

Women in rural areas already have few options for giving birth. Half of Mississippi’s counties are maternity care deserts, and the state Health Department recently declared a public health emergency for the state’s infant mortality rate – the highest in the nation. 
Nobody knows that more than Shenelle Ball-Burks, whose pregnant daughter and unborn grandchild died in 2021 on the side of the road as her husband was driving her 28 minutes from their home to the closest hospital. 
“I come before you from Belzoni in Humphreys County, a place where our hearts are full but our health care is empty, a place where the difference between life and death can be measured not in miles but in minutes,” Ball-Burks said at the hearing. “I didn’t know what to say when I was asked to speak here today because how do you find words when your heart has been shattered? How do you strive after watching your child’s life fade because help was too far away?”
Ball-Burks said she worries for all the moms and babies who will continue to suffer as help becomes farther away through federal and state policy changes. 
“I don’t want another mother to hold her child’s obituary instead of her hand,” Ball-Burks said. “I don’t want another husband to kneel beside a little girl crying for help that never comes. I don’t want another child to walk across a graduation stage in search of a face that isn’t there.”
Research shows that when eligibility for social safety net programs is made stricter, women tend to lose the most. That’s partly because women more often participate in the programs – due to the wage gap and life events such as childbirth – but also because they are more often caregivers to those who use the programs.
“This is not just a statistic, not just someone else’s problem,” said Rep. Timaka James-Jones, a Democrat from Belzoni and the sister-in-law of Ball-Burks. “It’s a sacred responsibility. Because when we save our mothers, we don’t just save one life. We save families. We save our children’s futures. We save the heartbeat of our communities.”

Many of the legislators and health care providers who spoke about their experience living through or witnessing the statistics that put Mississippi at the bottom of nearly every list when it comes to the health of moms and babies. 
“Mississippi remains one of the hardest places in America to be pregnant and give birth, especially if you’re Black,” said Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson. “I speak to you not only as a legislator but as a Black mother who has carried life while carrying fear. Our survival should not be revolutionary. It should be standard.”
Women in rural communities don’t just suffer from a dearth of hospitals or obstetricians. They suffer from a dearth of reliable and affordable support in all forms, said Dr. Michelle Owens, maternal fetal medicine specialist in Jackson and the chair of the Mississippi Maternal Mortality Review Committee. 
“There is data to support that having a person at the bedside, consistently, improves pregnancy outcomes and decreases C-section rates,” Owens said. “So what does that mean? It suggests that what we do with our hearts can even be more powerful than what we can accomplish with our hands.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06082152/New-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-01 08:16:31.936939

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A recent legislative hearing left people involved in the state’s medical marijuana businesses paranoid, and it wasn’t because they had been sampling their own products.
A meeting of the Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee turned into an assault on the program that the state’s voters approved in 2020 and the state implemented in 2022. The roster of speakers was a travel agent’s dream come true with a law enforcement officer from Missouri, an emergency medicine doctor from Colorado, a professor from Oklahoma, an addiction specialist from Colorado and the Sioux Falls school superintendent.
All of them were on hand to warn against the evils of marijuana in general and in particular how those evils can flourish thanks to a medical marijuana program.
Emmett Reistroffer of Genesis Farms Cannabis Company in Sioux Falls said it looked like a concerted effort to restrict or repeal the state’s medical marijuana program. Rep. Josephine Garcia, a Watertown Republican and chairwoman of the committee, didn’t like Reistroffer’s conclusion.
In a South Dakota Searchlight story, Garcia said the meeting’s agenda was set “to follow what was not done when this program was first rolled out. That was my only intention here. If you’re insinuating that me, as the chair, have said something or orchestrated something, I have not done that. It is awareness for the public. This is a public safety issue.”

With Garcia’s Murderers’ Row of anti-marijuana speakers, it sure seems like an orchestrated effort. Or perhaps it’s the first salvo in a battle to overturn the will of the voters.
Those of us who can remember back to the 2020 election recall that the virtues and pitfalls of medical marijuana were pretty well litigated. In the end, voters chose to approve the program with 70% of the vote. Garcia’s excuse that these issues have never before been discussed shows a frightening lack of memory or a penchant for being disingenuous.
Those of us who can remember back as far as 2017 know why Reistroffer and his colleagues in the medical marijuana community are so upset. During the legislative session that year, it only took a few days for lawmakers to dismantle Initiated Measure 22, despite it being approved the previous November by South Dakotans with 52% of the vote.
Sold to voters as an anti-corruption measure, IM 22 was quite likely unconstitutional and its implementation had been halted by a judge. Lawmakers, however, weren’t content to let the case play out in court. Working at an unusually fast pace, it took just over a week for lawmakers to dismantle IM 22, implementing some parts of the measure via legislation while jettisoning others.
Oversight committee testimony sends ‘shock wave’ through SD medical marijuana industry

The ease with which legislative leaders explained away their disregard for the will of the voters has not been lost on the people who organize ballot questions. It was a ballot question that gave South Dakota its medical marijuana program.
In some cases, ballot initiative organizers have turned to state constitutional amendments rather than initiated laws because they know that it will be at least two years before lawmakers can put the issue back on the ballot. In the meantime, the Legislature can’t mess with a constitutional amendment the way they did with IM 22.
Whether Garcia likes it or not, marijuana dispensaries are part of the state’s medical community. It’s hard to imagine surgeons, chiropractors or nurses receiving such shoddy treatment at the hands of a legislative committee.
Anyone with an agenda that includes getting rid of the state’s medical marijuana program may find that there’s not much appetite for such a change. Abolishing the program would mean that all the licensing work done by local governments would be wasted. It would mean the shuttering of small businesses that were created in the wake of the 2020 election. It would mean a lack of relief for the 16,477 people who hold patient cards. It would mean once again overturning the will of the voters.

These include contests for city, county, school, fire district and court of appeals positions, along with one statewide ballot measure. In the state’s biggest city and county, that means deciding on the next Seattle mayor and King County executive.
There are also several competitive legislative elections that could signal how voters feel about decisions to raise taxes and pass contentious social policies this past legislative session. The outcomes in those races could skew, but not upend, the balance of power in Olympia going into 2026. 
To count, ballots must be returned to a drop box or voting center by 8 p.m. Tuesday. 
Voters can also drop their ballots in the mail, but they must be postmarked by Tuesday. 
Election officials had advised those looking to mail in their ballots to do so a week before Election Day, as the U.S. Postal Service may not postmark returned ballots on the day they’re first collected. 
With the election just days away, officials recommend using drop boxes, going to a voting center or visiting a Post Office location to turn in your ballot if you haven’t already.

The secretary of state maintains a map of Washington’s 554 ballot drop boxes. It’s also available in list form.
As of Thursday, about 14% of Washington’s registered voters had returned their ballots. Garfield, Columbia and Jefferson counties were leading the pack in terms of the share of voters who’d cast ballots, while Franklin, Grays Harbor and Clark counties were bringing up the rear.
This year’s turnout is so far lagging 2021, when about 40% of voters returned ballots.
Voters can register or update their information in person at an elections office before 8 p.m. Tuesday. Oct. 27 was the last day for online and mailed registrations. 
To track your ballot, visit voteWA.gov. 
What’s on the ballot?
Only one measure will appear on every ballot of the more than 5 million registered voters in Washington. 
Senate Joint Resolution 8201 is a question of whether to invest tax dollars collected for the state’s new long-term care program, known as WA Cares, in the stock market. This would be similar to how the state handles pension and retirement funds.
Currently, the collections for WA Cares are invested in more vanilla investments, like government bonds and certificates of deposit. 
Advocates of the constitutional amendment argue the stock market would lead to larger returns and keep premiums low. Opponents say it amounts to “gambling in the stock market” with taxpayer dollars.
A similar measure failed in 2020.
A slew of vacated seats in the state Legislature are also up for grabs. The most notable is in the 26th Legislative District, covering parts of Pierce and Kitsap Counties, where Democratic Sen. Deb Krishnadasan is looking to retain the seat against Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier.
This race in a purple district gives Republicans a rare chance to narrow the Democratic majority in the state Senate. 
Conservatives are also hoping for good news out of the 5th Legislative District in east King County. Former lawmaker Chad Magendanz is looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Victoria Hunt, who was appointed after the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos earlier this year. Hunt won the primary comfortably. She was serving in the House before moving to the Senate.
A couple of Democrat-on-Democrat battles could also serve as a barometer of how voters feel about the more progressive turn the Legislature has taken in recent years.
State Rep. Amy Walen hopes to be a more moderate voice among Senate Democrats in her campaign against Sen. Vandana Slatter in the 48th Legislative District, representing parts of Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland. Slatter led Walen handily in the August primary.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
And in the 33rd Legislative District, Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling is more of a centrist Democrat, while Rep. Edwin Obras this year followed the Democratic party line in voting for tax increases, a cap on residential rent increases and other controversial policies backed by progressives. 
Those four races are the ones to watch, but five other appointed Democratic lawmakers appear on Tuesday’s ballot.

Oct. 30. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. UM Health-Sparrow and East Lansing Public Schools have opened a youth health clinic, open to all patients ages five to 21, based at East Lansing High School. 
This is the second youth health clinic in the region, following another in Grand Ledge that opened in April 2024. The clinic will have three staff members, according to Patrick Sustrich, a director of operations at UM Health-Sparrow — an advanced practice provider, a medical assistant, and a social worker. 
There is no requirement to be a student at East Lansing Public Schools to visit the clinic — anyone in the region within the age range is welcomed, and the clinic will be open year-round. A side entrance to the building, separate from the entrance to the school, makes that feasible. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“This on-site health center removes many of the barriers that families have faced,” said Dori Leyko, superintendent of East Lansing Public Schools. “No longer will students need to miss a day of school, or parents will need to take significant time off of work just to get a physical or see a clinician for minor illness.”

“With the clinic right here in our school community, care is more accessible, efficient and family friendly,” Leyko continued. “It removes transportation challenges, reduces missed class time and helps ensure students are healthy, ready and able to learn.”
“The biggest impact I think we can have is with mental health,” said Dr. Gregory Holzhei, a family physician at UM Health-Sparrow based in St. John’s. “Many of our students are suffering with mental health issues.”
Sustrich, said that in the first location, two-thirds of all visits to the clinic were related to mental and behavioral health concerns. 
He also mentioned specific programmatic services targeted towards students, including education around safe backpack weights — which he noted should not exceed 10% of a student’s weight. Another specific training, which the Grand Ledge clinic has done to help lower stress levels among new middle school students, teaches how to use combination locks. 
Leyko called the opening of the center the start of a “new chapter of care, connection and opportunity.”
Sustrich also noted that this clinic had room to grow, including adding more staff like a dietician or an exercise physiologist.
“You can see how this could just grow and morph into something much greater,” he said. “We’re still in our infancy and we’re not there yet, but the sky’s the limit.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Cue the crickets. 
That’s the sound you hear from Montana’s congressional delegation — Steve Daines, Tim Sheehy, Ryan Zinke, and Troy Downing — every time Donald Trump opens his mouth and lies about tariffs. You’d think one of them might clear their throat, tug on their cowboy boots, and say, “Excuse me, sir, but that’s not how tariffs work.” 
Instead, we get synchronized silence worthy of a barbershop quartet audition for “Spineless: The Musical.”
Here’s the truth Trump doesn’t want you to know (and apparently our delegation doesn’t have the nerve to explain): Tariffs aren’t paid by foreign countries. They’re taxes — on us. American consumers. Montana families. Small businesses. Farmers. You, me, and the guy trying to buy a new tractor part that now costs more than a used pickup.
Trump’s trade war has been a disaster for Montana agriculture. China stopped buying our soybeans, opting for Brazil’s instead. Prices are up, markets are down, and Montana farmers are left holding the bag — or, more accurately, the unsold bushel. And now Trump wants to fix his mess by importing more beef from Argentina. So, while our ranchers are struggling, he’s literally saying, “Let’s buy from Argentina instead.”
That’s not America First — that’s America Fumbled.
And what do we hear from Sens. Steve “Silent as a Stone” Daines, Tim “Trump’s Echo” Sheehy, and Representatives Ryan “Photo Op” Zinke and Troy “Copy-Paste Talking Points” Downing? Not a whisper. Not a peep. Just the faint hum of ambition and fear — fear of offending the Mar-a-Lago Monarch who pretends tariffs are like magic money falling from the sky.
If these four men were truly honoring their oaths of office, they’d be correcting the record, not cowering behind it. They’d tell their constituents that Trump’s tariffs are one of the largest tax increases on American consumers in history — following, of course, his massive tax cuts for the wealthy. The billionaires got their bonuses. The rest of us got higher prices, a lecture about patriotism, and a larger national deficit.  It’s obscene. 
Thanks, Trump. Your lies have economic consequences. And thanks to Montana’s delegation, they’re having political ones, too — or at least they should.
Montanans value honesty, integrity and straight talk. We can smell nonsense from miles away — usually right around campaign season. But when our so-called representatives choose silence over truth, that’s not loyalty; that’s cowardice in a cowboy hat.
Maybe Daines, Sheehy, Zinke, and Downing think silence is golden. In this case, it’s more like gilded cowardice — a shiny coating over an empty core. Their refusal to speak truth to Trump’s lies isn’t just embarrassing; it’s dangerous. Because every time they nod along, the lie grows stronger, the damage deeper, and the con thicker.
Montana deserves leaders who’ll call a lie a lie, even when it’s politically inconvenient. Leaders who understand that tariffs aren’t patriotic — they’re punishing. And that silence, no matter how polite or strategic, is still complicity.
So, here’s my humble suggestion: Next time Trump starts bragging about his “beautiful tariffs,” maybe our delegation could find the courage to whisper back, “Sir, those are taxes — on us.”
Until then, Montana’s Trump Choir can keep humming their favorite tune: “The Sound of Silence (and Surrender).”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/senaterepublicans-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-01 06:56:31.651930

One guiding principle, passed along by her film editor son Jeremy came in handy while penning, participating or appearing in 5,832 career legal opinions: Don’t bore, don’t confuse.

Miller-Lerman bored few last year with an opinion in which she drew upon Patty and Selma of “The Simpsons” cartoon fame to make a serious point about separation of powers among government branches.
And there was no confusing her messages in dissents on rulings, including one that left the state immune from a lawsuit brought by three siblings for years of physical and sexual abuse while in foster care. 
Now, at age 78 — after serving six years as an inaugural judge on the Nebraska Court of Appeals and 27 years on the Nebraska Supreme Court — Miller-Lerman on Friday hung up her robe. 
The mother and grandmother of two said she approached her work with judicial “restraint,” careful to avoid politics and to not be too “frisky.” She enjoyed staying in touch with pop culture to connect with the masses and, when appropriate, drop a colorful reference into writings and conversations.
She believes she contributed to the “useful” role of a judge and takes pride in furthering the discussion of gender equality.
“When you look at the body of work, forget all the administrative stuff that eats up an enormous amount of time, I think you could say, intellectually, I was disciplined and didn’t have poor humor,” Miller-Lerman said in a sit-down interview with the Nebraska Examiner.

Her retirement follows what colleagues describe as a trailblazing run launched when a young West Coast swimming champion opted for a legal career and rose to partner status at a major Omaha law firm while working part-time raising two children. Then-Gov. Ben Nelson, the last Democrat to lead the state, named her in 1991 to the newly established appeals court, where she was the first woman to serve on a Nebraska court higher than the district court.
In 1998, he appointed her to the state’s highest court.
Nelson lauded the Miller-Lerman appointments as among his best, saying she was not “anxious to make law” but rather “has been steadfast with her resolve to find justice and to apply the law.”
Miller Lerman’s parting words at a courtroom retirement ceremony: “I took an oath, and I think I kept my promise.”

While packing up personal items from her chambers, located alongside other Supreme Court justice offices in a private section of the Nebraska Capitol, Miller-Lerman ran across career-spanning mementos.

There was a handwritten letter and drawing from a young visitor recounting her 1998 swearing-in ceremony. Of Miller-Lerman, little Hannah Hysack wrote: “She’s the first girl in Nebraska to be a Supreme Court judge.” Now an adult, Hysack showed up at the retirement open house, too.
The justice also kept a photo of a neighborhood youngster who, on one Halloween, donned a robe and carried a book, gavel and sign: “I’m Lindsey. I make the rules.”
Miller-Lerman said she’s never shied away from discussing gender inequities in the legal field and is pleased to have been in a position to be a role model for budding women attorneys — though she recognizes there’s a long way to go.
She referred to the recent history of the state Supreme Court, noting that of the last eight appointments since hers, one yielded a woman, sitting Justice Stephanie Stacy. 
“You be the judge,” quipped Miller-Lerman.
She pointed to a bathroom available for the Supreme Court in the Capitol that to this day she said has a wall lined with urinals and one stall. “Because justices are boys don’t you know?” she said with a sarcastic smile.

Miller-Lerman, while she requested no remodel, said she made clear from the start that she’d be using the facilities regardless. 
Carol Knoepfler, a professor at Creighton University School of Law, was Miller-Lerman’s former law clerk for eight years and shared anecdotes of how her former boss firmly yet courteously set the record straight on a woman’s place in high places. 
She recalled driving with Miller-Lerman to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for an oral arguments session when a security officer approached their car to say they could not park in the area, as it was reserved for the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Said Knoepfler: “I can still hear the judge reply in a very polite, but very precise manner, ‘How fortunate — because I am on the Nebraska Supreme Court.’”
At the same time during her career, Miller-Lerman said she tried to “eliminate the impediment that gender may have” so that “we move on to substance.”
She cited an interview with Nelson for the first judgeship, when she wore a Navy blue suit with yellow pin stripes and a yellow silk blouse, seeking to strike a balance: “business-like, traditional, but feminine.”
It’s similar to her style today, she said. “I haven’t bought into being like ‘the guys.’ That is my brand, I think.”
Colleagues talked of a competitive spirit, noting that as a teen she represented the U.S. in the 1961 Maccabiah games, winning three medals, two gold and a silver. She beat a teammate for one of the golds, who, according to Swimming World, went on to win a silver medal at the 1964 Olympics in that same event, and later set a world record. 
Miller-Lerman, after graduating from a California high school in 1963, went to Boston area Wellesley College and was on her legal track.
She said she felt fortunate to have role models such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was her professor at Columbia Law School and, later, the second woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. Miller-Lerman clerked for Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights legend and the first Black woman to be named a federal judge.

Former U.S. Rep. John J. Cavanaugh, D-Neb., who also spoke at the retirement event, recalled meeting Miller-Lerman in 1980 when he joined Omaha-based Kutak Rock law firm after his time on Capitol Hill. He saw her as a rising star litigator and said it was unheard of at the time for a part-time practicing lawyer raising children to become a partner in a major law firm.
He reflected on current “vigorous efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion” and celebrated that his colleague’s influence and opinions “will forever remain a part of Nebraska law and justice.”
“A small Sturgis bike riding Jewish girl from Los Angeles with an Ivy League education and a heart of gold and a head of steel principles … a permanent fixture in our history,” Cavanaugh said of Miller-Lerman.

Fans described her legal clarity and human charity.  
Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Heavican, who served 18 years with Miller-Lerman until his retirement last year, noted her role in cases of “first impression,” those that present a novel issue not tackled before by that court.
He said she drafted the opinion that capital punishment judicial panels must be unanimous to impose a death penalty and another that decided same-sex partners had standing to seek custody and visitation of a child they co-parented.

Standing out also are Miller-Lerman’s “laser-focused” questions posed to attorneys during oral arguments, Heavican, an appointee of Republican Gov. Dave Heineman, said at the retirement event. He recalled her remark to those lawyers who tried to dodge: “That is the answer to a different question.”
Cavanaugh lauded Miller-Lerman’s dissenting voice in a series of sovereign immunity cases that he said continue to “haunt our state,” with the latest not allowing children abused while in state custody to seek public compensation or redress. 
He said courts and lawmakers have her written dissents to draw upon in future efforts to change law.
Perhaps her best-known opinion, said Miller-Lerman, is the 2007 State v. Winslow ruling, which allowed DNA testing for two of the “Beatrice Six” convicted in 1989 of a 1985 murder. The results showed neither had committed the crime. All six eventually were exonerated. 
They spent a combined 75 years in prison and won a $28 million wrongful conviction judgement.
A response she hadn’t expected, she said, came after referencing Patty and Selma of  The Simpsons in a concurrence when state officials tried to circumvent a state law that restored voting rights to felons who had completed their criminal sentences. The twin sisters of Marge Simpson she mentioned are cynical career employees at the Springfield DMV. 











Patty and Selma at the Department of Motor Vehicles may not be constitutional scholars, but they know they are expected to follow the law.


– Nebraska Supreme Court Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman



Miller-Lerman opined: “Patty and Selma at the Department of Motor Vehicles may not be constitutional scholars, but they know they are expected to follow the law.”
She went on, “Do we want to live in a world where every state employee who has a hunch a statute is flawed gets to ignore it?”
The Simpsons bit was picked up by national publications and podcasts, but truth be told, Miller-Lerman expected a different part of the opinion to gain more traction. It read: “If the statutes were declared unconstitutional as urged by some members of the court, the elected officials would choose their voters instead of the other way around.”
“Who knew?” she asked.

Nebraska voters have retained Miller-Lerman in four judicial elections, and she was up for retention next year. But she was ready for less “court noise” and demand from the job she said she took very seriously.
Having survived breast cancer in her 30s, she said, she has sought to “maximize my contributions.”

“I feel I’ve made a contribution,” Miller-Lerman said. “I’m not sure more years is necessarily going to enhance that.”
Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, appointed by Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, described her as a one-of-a-kind who enriched the Court. “Her legacy lives on, in all of our opinions.”
Upon her exit, Miller-Lerman said she had confidence that Nebraska’s Supreme Court won’t take the “easy wrong” and instead will “show the strength to demonstrate impartiality and justice.”
“In this time of instability, much depends on the strength and the authority of the courts,” said Miller-Lerman.
She plans to remain in Omaha, where her then-husband’s job first took the young family in 1975. Retirement allows more time with her grown children, Jeremy and Hannah, who live in other states. Still active and a gym-goer, Miller-Lerman is considering another level of service, including availability as a retired judge. 
“I’ll be useful,” she said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer-Focht/Tennessee Lookout) There is a dangerous willingness among too many political, civil, and community leaders — and, anecdotally, far too many everyday citizens — to sacrifice civil and human rights on the altar of authoritarianism. It’s as if the mere mention of “crime” is enough to justify rolling back the very constitutional protections that are supposed to keep us safe.
This is exactly what has happened with the rollout of the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force initiative. From the beginning, its justification has leaned more on anecdotes than on actual data, relying on propaganda released by law enforcement agencies designed to reassert law-and-order politics every time a semblance of progressive criminal justice reform begins to take root. And disturbingly, it’s working.
The receipts are already here
We don’t have to speculate about what over-policing looks like in Memphis. We have the receipts. The 2024 United States Department of Justice pattern and practice investigation of the Memphis Police Department laid it out in black and white: MPD has engaged in unconstitutional policing tactics, including racial profiling and broken-windows policing, that disproportionately target Black communities. The DOJ made clear that these practices not only violate civil rights but also fail to reduce violent crime in any meaningful or sustained way.
In short, the report confirmed what many Memphians — especially Black Memphians — have long experienced: a system more invested in control than in safety. And now, instead of breaking with that harmful legacy, the Memphis Safe Task Force has doubled down on it by expanding the very practices the DOJ condemned.
Policing the public, not protecting it
This “task force” strategy has dramatically increased encounters between everyday citizens and law enforcement, primarily through racialized traffic stops. Citations are up. Arrests are up. But the violent crime numbers have not fallen at a rate commensurate with the manpower and resources the task force has touted. Available data shows that on one day alone, 51 individuals were arrested—and 37 of them were not charged with violent offenses, including seven for the civil offense of “unlawful presence.” These figures reveal a clearly misaligned strategy: diverting massive law-enforcement resources toward traffic stops and civil detentions while pursuing the claim of reducing violent crime.
Traffic citations outnumber federal task force’s arrests in Memphis; sparse data leaves impact murky

Even worse, transparency remains elusive. Many local outlets report that full arrest data is not publicly available. Meanwhile, multiple law enforcement agencies are routinely swarming the same traffic stops, improvising on the spot about which agency will take credit depending on what they “might” find. That’s not coordination. That’s chaos — and it borders on systemic Fourth Amendment violations through unreasonable searches and seizures.
A constitutional crisis, not a crime strategy
Let’s be honest: this isn’t just about crime. It’s about appeasing a convicted felon in the White House who has made a habit of bending, breaking and badgering the law to satisfy his own power-hungry, fascist impulses. What we’re witnessing is a local extension of a national project that normalizes state overreach and weaponizes fear.
Leaders like Memphis Mayor Paul Young have chosen compliance over courage, openly confirming that MPD is now working directly with ICE. This partnership has terrorized immigrant communities and further eroded public trust. It is not public safety. It is state-sanctioned overreach that tramples both the First Amendment’s protections for assembly and dissent and the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Since this collaboration began, reports of federal enforcement activity have surged from a handful a day to hundreds each week, and nearly one in five arrests are now immigration-related, often involving nothing more than “unlawful presence.” This is not a targeted violent-crime strategy. It is the widening of a dragnet that places already marginalized communities in greater danger.
The cost of capitulation
When political leaders applaud superficial arrest numbers without interrogating what those numbers represent, they are applauding violations of civil and human rights. They are endorsing a two-tiered system where constitutional protections seem to apply fully only to white Americans. This is punitive populism in action: the exploitation of fear and punishment as a political performance, not a public safety strategy. This is not hypothetical; this is happening now.
As Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee recently stated, “we’ll figure things out along the way.” But “figuring things out” on the backs of Black and brown people is not governance. It’s experimentation with human lives. It’s dangerous. It’s unconstitutional. And it’s morally indefensible.
What real safety requires
Real safety is not built on surveillance, over-policing, or authoritarian force. It’s built on trust, transparency, and community investment. It’s built when the rights enshrined in the First and Fourth Amendments are protected instead of treated as collateral damage in a political spectacle of copaganda.
We should not, and cannot, accept an initiative that trades away constitutional rights for the illusion of security. If we care about safety, we must care just as fiercely about justice. Because the moment we normalize authoritarianism in the name of “safety,” none of us are safe at all.

The institution is unwilling to assert itself as an equal branch of government. (4X6, iStock/Getty Images Plus)Many Americans will be voting on Election Day — or have already cast votes — in races for statewide office, local positions and on ballot initiatives with major implications for democracy.
Congress is not on the ballot this November, but it will be in the 2026 midterms. A year from now, Americans in every state and district will get to vote for whom they want representing their interests in Washington.
But right now, Congress isn’t giving the American people much to go on.
As the shutdown of the federal government passes the one-month mark, the U.S. House of Representatives has been in recess for over 40 days. That’s the longest it’s ever stayed out of town outside of its typical summer recesses or the weeks leading up to their own elections.
Notably, the shutdown does not mean that Congress can’t meet. In fact, it must meet to end the shutdown legislatively. The Senate, for example, has taken votes recently on judicial nominations, a major defense authorization bill and a resolution on tariff policy.
Senators have also continued to hold bipartisan behind-the-scenes negotiations to end the shutdown impasse.
But with dwindling SNAP benefits, skyrocketing health care premiums and other major shutdown impacts beginning to set in, the House has all but abdicated its position as “The People’s Chamber.”
 
Long ‘path to irrelevance’
In addition to not meeting for any votes, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Democratic U.S. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Despite Johnson’s assurances, the shutdown does not prevent the House from meeting in a brief session to swear in Grijalva as a member for Arizona’s 7th District, which has been without representation since March.
Along with Casey Burgat and SoRelle Wyckoff Gaynor, I am co-author of a textbook, “Congress Explained: Representation and Lawmaking in the First Branch.” In that book, it was important to us to highlight Congress’ clear role as the preeminent lawmaking body in the federal government.
But throughout the shutdown battle, Congress — particularly the House of Representatives — has been unwilling to assert itself as an equal branch of government. Beyond policymaking, Congress has been content to hand over many of its core constitutional powers to the executive branch. As a Congress expert who loves the institution and profoundly respects its constitutionally mandated role, I have found this renunciation of responsibility difficult to watch.
And yet, Congress’ path to irrelevance as a body of government did not begin during the shutdown, or even in January 2025.
It is the result of decades of erosion that created a political culture in which Congress, the first branch of government listed in the Constitution, is relegated to second-class status.
 
The Constitution puts Congress first
The 18th-century framers of the Constitution viewed Congress as the foundation of republican governance, deliberately placing it first in Article 1 to underscore its primacy. Congress was assigned the pivotal tasks of lawmaking and budgeting because controlling government finances was seen as essential to limiting executive power and preventing abuses that the framers associated with monarchy.
Alternatively, a weak legislature and an imperial executive were precisely what many of the founders feared. With legislative authority in the hands of Congress, power would at least be decentralized among a wide variety of elected leaders from different parts of the country, each of whom would jealously guard their own local interests.
But Trump’s first 100 days turned the founders’ original vision on its head, leaving the “first branch” to play second fiddle.
Like most recent presidents, Trump came in with his party in control of the presidency, the House and the Senate. Yet despite the lawmaking power that this governing trifecta can bring, the Republican majorities in Congress have mostly been irrelevant to Trump’s agenda.
Instead, Congress has relied on Trump and the executive branch to make changes to federal policy and in many cases to reshape the federal government completely.
Trump has signed more than 210 executive orders, a pace faster than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Republican Congress has shown little interest in pushing back on any of them. Trump has also aggressively reorganized, defunded or simply deleted entire agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
These actions have been carried out even though Congress has a clear constitutional authority over the executive branch’s budget. And during the shutdown, Congress has shown little to no interest in reasserting its “power of the purse,” content instead to let the president decide which individuals and agencies receive funding, regardless of what Congress has prescribed.
 
Many causes, no easy solutions
There’s no one culprit but instead a collection of factors that have provided the ineffectual Congress of today.
One overriding factor is a process that has unfolded over the past 50 or more years called political nationalization. American politics have become increasingly centered on national issues, parties and figures rather than more local concerns or individuals.
This shift has elevated the importance of the president as the symbolic and practical leader of a national party agenda. Simultaneously, it weakens the role of individual members of Congress, who are now more likely to toe the party line than represent local interests.
As a result, voters focus more on presidential elections and less on congressional ones, granting the president greater influence and diminishing Congress’ independent authority.
The more Congress polarizes among its members on a party-line basis, the less the public is likely to trust the legitimacy of its opposition to a president. Instead, congressional pushback − sometimes as extreme as impeachment − can thus be written off not as principled or substantive but as partisan or politically motivated to a greater extent than ever before.
Congress has also been complicit in giving away its own power. Especially when dealing with a polarized Congress, presidents increasingly steer the ship in budget negotiations, which can lead to more local priorities — the ones Congress is supposed to represent — being ignored.
But rather than Congress staking out positions for itself, as it often did through the turn of the 21st century, political science research has shown that presidential positions on domestic policy increasingly dictate — and polarize — Congress’ own positions on policy that hasn’t traditionally been divisive, such as funding support for NASA. Congress’ positions on procedural issues, such as raising the debt ceiling or eliminating the filibuster, also increasingly depend not on bedrock principles but on who occupies the White House.
In the realm of foreign policy, Congress has all but abandoned its constitutional power to declare war, settling instead for “authorizations” of military force that the president wants to assert. These give the commander in chief wide latitude over war powers, and both Democratic and Republican presidents have been happy to retain that power. They have used these congressional approvals to engage in extended conflicts such as the Gulf War in the early 1990s and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade later.
 
What’s lost with a weak Congress
Americans lose a lot when Congress hands over such drastic power to the executive branch.
When individual members of Congress from across the country take a back seat, their districts’ distinctly local problems are less likely to be addressed with the power and resources that Congress can bring to an issue. Important local perspectives on national issues fail to be represented in Congress.
Even members of the same political party represent districts with vastly different economies, demographics and geography. Members are supposed to keep this in mind when legislating on these issues, but presidential control over the process makes that difficult or even impossible.
Maybe more importantly, a weak Congress paired with what historian Arthur Schlesinger called the “Imperial Presidency” is a recipe for an unaccountable president, running wild without the constitutionally provided oversight and checks on power that the founders provided to the people through their representation by the first branch of government.

Those who miss that deadline have until Jan. 15 to sign up for coverage that starts in February. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)As Marylanders start to navigate the open enrollment period for health insurance, state officials are pointing out that higher costs aren’t the only changes that could trip people up.
“We encourage everybody to come back in and look at their plan, make sure the plan makes sense for your needs, for your family’s need,” Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said in a webinar Friday on the changes on open enrollment this year.
The Marketplace Integrity Rule out of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the federal budget reconciliation bill, often referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” is bringing massive changes to health care.
But Eberle said that the expected expiration of popular federal tax credits for health care plans at the end of the year creates the “triple whammy” of factors that will jack up costs for some 300,000 Marylanders, which could lead to tough choices for some, including going without insurance.
While those federal policies bring in changes for the 2026 insurance year, not all will take effect right away. Here’s a run-down of what Marylanders can expect this open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, and in the future.
Costs going up
Maryland Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said that raised premiums will “continue to be a problem if Congress does not take decisive action to extend tax credits.”
The enhanced federal tax credit was created in 2021 to help more people afford health insurance during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, including Maryland’s congressional delegation have refused to vote a stopgap spending bill until Republicans agree to address the tax credits.
Health advocates, state officials brace for ‘sticker shock’ if ACA tax credits expire

“I’m a former head of the Medicare program,” Seshamani said. “I’m a physician. I’m also a mom. I’m a daughter — I know affordable and accessible health care is critical for us to protect.”
“We are in some very uncertain times,” said. “There’s a lot of headwinds to navigate, particularly with changes at the federal level, and we all see and appreciate the distress that this can cause for people in the health care system.”
Health care advocates say the credits brought more people into the insurance pool and helped keep premiums down.
For this year’s rate increase, insurance carriers asked for an average increase of 17.1%, accounting for the anticipated loss in enrollment if the tax credits expire. The Maryland Insurance Agency ultimately approved a 13.4% average rate increase, which applies to everyone on the health benefit exchange.
Some of the lower-income marketplace purchasers may be spared from the greatest premium hike this year. The General Assembly approved funding this past session that would partially replace the soon-to-expire federal tax credits for the upcoming year.
For the 2026 enrollment year, those state subsidies will be able to replace the extended tax credit for those under 200% of the federal poverty level. For those between 201% and up to 400%, the state subsidy will replace 50% of the value of the tax credits.
But the state’s fraught fiscal outlook means those state subsidies could be temporary, state officials say. Meanwhile, plenty of enrollees will see costs skyrocket.
“It’s a little bit better than losing that tax credit completely,” Eberle said. “For those who are over 400% of the federal poverty level, we are not able to do anything, so that will be a significant impact.”
DACA barred from marketplace
Some Marylanders will have a harder time accessing health care because of their immigration status.
The Marketplace Integrity Rule revoked a Biden-era decision that classified immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, as “lawfully present” individuals. Being lawfully present allowed DACA recipients, sometimes referred to as “dreamers,” access to the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to shop for plans.
The last open enrollment period was the first time DACA recipients could use Maryland’s insurance marketplace. Without the classification, DACA recipients are again barred from the health insurance marketplace. That change took affect in August, affecting about 300 DACA recipients.
DACA recipients get access to state health care marketplace for the first time

Eberle also said that around 18,000 lawfully present immigrants with incomes lower than 100% of the federal poverty level will no longer be able to use tax credits that kept their health care costs down. They can still use the exchange to shop plans, but it will be more expensive.
She said that options are limited for DACA recipients and people who are not in the country legally because of the federal changes. She notes that the 2025 plans that people currently hold are still valid, and urges those who may lose coverage next year to take care of health needs now.
“We’re trying to encourage everyone to use their coverage,” she said. “If you need medical care now, go get it. Utilize your health benefits this year, and don’t put off things that you might have been putting off for next year.
What’s sticking around?
While much of the conversation around open enrollment involves increasing prices, Eberle noted that the state’s subsidy targeted for young adults is still in play, meaning that people aged 18-37 may still qualify for financial help that brings their monthly premiums down, which creates a healthier insurance pool.
In addition, some federal changes won’t take effect this year, meaning that Marylanders and state officials have some time to prepare for new hurdles in access to health care.
For example, Marylanders who don’t commit to a health care plan by the end of this year will still have a few weeks in January to determine what insurance best works for them.
That’s because this is the last year of an extended open enrollment window before federal policy shortens it.
Starting in the 2026 open enrollment year, people will have from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 to commit to a new plan.
“That’s a big change,” Eberle said in an interview. “That’s not insurmountable. It’s just another barrier to coverage.”
Eberle says that with end-of-year travels and the holidays, many people struggle to deal with also shopping for insurance plans, so the extended enrollment window helps Marylanders enroll when things are a little more calm.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fortunately, Marylanders still have that extra time this year. Those who want coverage starting on Jan. 1 will need to commit to a plan by Dec. 31. Those who need a few extra days have until Jan 15, and their plans would begin Feb. 1.
She also said that another change coming down the line is the end of auto enrollment in coverage. Right now, if someone has a plan from the ACA marketplace and does not do anything with it, they are auto-renewed in the same plan if available.
In 2028, a new federal policy means that people will have to manually indicate that they want to continue coverage each year.
Eberle said that without auto enrollment, “if people are not aware of that and they let their coverage lapse, then they may not be eligible until the next year to get health coverage.”
While Maryland still has auto enrollment for the next two years, Eberle still urges everyone to take a look at their coverage and see if their plans are still the best for their household, especially considering a hike in premium costs.
“We’re in the open enrollment period and that’s what’s at the forefront right now,” Eberle said “We are encouraging everyone to come back and look at their plan selection.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024_dec13_openenrollment-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-01 04:16:32.118217

(Photo via State Archives of Florida)The white political elite in America – politicians, judges, lawyers, policymakers, businesses and corporations – has never as a whole acted in good faith towards its Black citizens. These “leaders” routinely moved electoral goalposts, added impediments to gum up the voting process, made promises they never intended to keep, lied, grudgingly made concessions and over time, always clawed them back.
Meanwhile, on the ground during the last century, mobs of white vigilantes used a campaign of terror, intimidating Black potential voters, beating, brutalizing and lynching African Americans, and burning down Black businesses and whole communities.  
Americans love to push out their chests and gloat about the freedoms citizens enjoy, but a dirty little secret is that being “American” has never referred to ALL Americans.
Throughout much of history, African Americans and their native brothers and sisters were forced to stand outside the proverbial shop window looking in, barred from entering by menacing gatekeepers and often forcibly removed, beaten, and killed if they tried to get inside.
The ability to vote is the sacred touchstone of American democracy but to this point, it is merely aspirational, frail, ethereal, because those opposed to electoral freedom have never quite figured out how to contend with America’s Original Sin.
For centuries, those in power found, and continue to manufacture, techniques to wage a relentless, multi-pronged war against a people.
The latest antagonists, in a long list of adversaries, are Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature and the MAGA-Republican-led US Supreme Court.
The future of the Voting Rights Act
Earlier in October, justices listened to arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a significant redistricting case that could determine the very future of the Voting Rights Act.
Voting Rights Act supporters rally outside Supreme Court as justices hear Louisiana case

If the high court overturns Section 2 – a provision that bans racial discrimination in voting — GOP-controlled legislatures would rush to redraw at least 19 more voting districts for the House of Representatives in favor of Republicans in the 2026 midterms, according to a recent report by the voting rights advocacy groups Black Voters Matter Fund and Fair Fight Action. 
The result, a National Public Radio story notes, could have “a cascading effect on congressional maps in mostly Southern states where Republicans either control both legislative chambers and the governor’s office or have a veto-proof majority in the legislature — and where voting is racially polarized, with Black voters tending to vote Democratic and white voters tending to vote Republican.”
New maps would deny racial minority voters a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidate, with Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas possibly ending up with fewer Democratic representatives in Congress. 
Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee could lose all of theirs, the report finds. And as much as 30% of the Congressional Black Caucus and 11% of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could also be lost.
It is not out of the realm of possibility that Republicans would cement one-party control of the House for at least a generation, according to Cliff Albright, co-founder and executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund.

“Part of the point that we’re trying to make with this report is that what happens in the South doesn’t just stay in the South,” Albright adds. “This racial gerrymandering has the ability to not just disempower, disenfranchise Black voters and to eliminate Black elected officials and Latino elected officials. What happens in these states impacts the entire country.” 
In Florida DeSantis and his MAGA Republican accomplices have eagerly embraced President Donald Trump’s commands for Republican state leaders to hold special sessions to redraw electoral districts in favor of the GOP.
DeSantis has argued in favor of manipulating electoral mechanisms to ensure that Florida is one of those states.
“I think the state is malapportioned,” he said at a press conference in Bradenton. “So I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade. So we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five-year period. It’s been really significant.”
Florida Chief Justice Carlos G. Muñiz (Photo via Florida Supreme Court)
Using population data from the US Census, legislators or independent commissions draw district lines once a decade to account for population changes. But Trump has upended the practice in an effort to pad the slim GOP majority in the House of Representatives.
The governor is proud of his actions in 2022 when he vetoed an original congressional redistricting map passed by the Legislature, labeling it a “disaster.” DeSantis then championed a proposal the Legislature agreed to pass that erased Black representation in Northern Florida and helped to flip Congress. 
While a variety of voting rights groups sued to strike down that map, the Florida Supreme Court ruledthat it was constitutional. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz said that legislators had a “superior” obligation to follow federal equal protection law, and not the Fair Districts Amendment passed by Florida voters in 2010. 
That amendment had a clause modeled after the Voting Rights Act now being scrutinized by the U.S. Supreme Court that said legislators could not diminish the ability of minorities to elect a representative of their choice. The Florida Supreme Court decision gives legislators in the future a way to sidestep that clause.
The Fair District Amendment also bans congressional districts from being “drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.”
But will DeSantis and the Legislature be able to use court rulings related to race to draw districts that accomplish the goal of flipping Democratic seats while at the same time eliminating minority representation in Congress? Time will tell.
Florida Supreme Court upholds congressional district maps

The League of Women Voters of Florida detailed the deliberate and expansive efforts by DeSantis and his cronies to use legislation, policies, programs and subterfuge to steadily reduce the electoral playing field for African Americans.  
“In recent years, the state of Florida has implemented an alarming series of policies that undermine voter participation, creating conditions ripe for mass voter intimidation, LWV officials said in the report. “State officials, led by Governor Ron DeSantis, have weaponized law enforcement to target voters across the state, from the arrest of formerly incarcerated individuals who believed they were eligible to vote to the harassment of citizens who signed petitions for a reproductive right ballot initiative.”
The report described these instances of systematic voter intimidation as a “a dangerous and deliberate attempt to disenfranchise certain communities – led explicitly by state institutions. They undermine both the rule of law and democratic norms. These actions create a chilling effect on political participation, discouraging people within the targeted communities from engaging in civic life. Fear and confusion around voter eligibility causes many to remain de facto disenfranchised even when they are legally eligible to vote.”
For years before the 2024 presidential election, DeSantis and legislative Republicans kept busy carrying out their part of their national party’s agenda to incapacitate parts of the state’s electoral apparatus to dissuade Black and brown voters, young people, seniors, and other Democratic constituencies from voting.
This meant passing a slew of laws that make it considerably harder to vote than was true four years earlier, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Florida is now one of four states that have “used single bills to enact an array of restrictions, imposing limits across the entire voting process,” the center has reported.
The Sunshine State is among 11 Republican-dominated legislatures that have impinged on ways the electorate can register to vote, while also restricting voter registration drives. 
According to the Brennan Center report, DeSantis has given “partisan actors unprecedented authority over elections”; he has also created “election police” to investigate and prosecute supposed fraud and intimidate eligible voters.
We are living in a time when those responsible for upholding the law are doing everything but. DeSantis, Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Supreme Court and phalanx of MAGA Republicans are making their moves with significant, concerted pushback from Democrats.
There is little expectation that the forces of regression, bigotry and retreat – who have plotted and schemed on ways to eviscerate not just the Voting Rights Act, but also to ensure that Black and brown voting power is permanently hobbled, disabled, demolished, will be slowed down.
And with this, we can expect these rogues to steal not just the 2026 midterm elections but the 2028 presidential elections as well.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)When natural disasters strike in the Lower 48, people affected are compensated for income lost from wage-earning jobs that have been interrupted, as well as lost assets with assigned financial value.
For residents of the Yukon-Kuskokwim region who were displaced by Typhoon Halong, such losses are not so easily quantified.
In the region’s affected villages, which are among the most rural communities in North America, most residents are Yup’ik and adherence to Indigenous traditions is strong. Those traditions are tied to the harvesting of wild foods and materials for personal and family needs. And much of the labor performed to carry out those harvests falls outside of the usual American cash economy.
Losses inflicted by the disaster in Kipnuk, Kwigillingok and other storm-damaged villages include the stockpiles of wild fish, game meat, berries and greens that have been built over months of unpaid work.
While there is not a dollar number for the food that was lost, its value is high, said Kelsey Ciugun Wallace, president of the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.
“Our foods are just so important to who we are as Native people,” said Wallace, who is Yup’ik and from Bethel, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta’s hub community. Traditional foods provide not just nutrition, but also emotional and spiritual support and “connect us to the land and water,” she said.
In response to the loss of subsistence food and access to food-gathering sites, the Alaska Native Heritage Center and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium are funneling traditional foods to displaced families.
They are coordinating a program that is taking in donations from around the state. Through it, frozen foods, like sockeye salmon from the Copper River Basin, muktuk from the North Slope and berries from Southcentral Alaska’s mountain slopes, have been collected in a huge freezer trailer parked at the heritage center,
The volunteer response has been overwhelming, and it extends beyond donations to cooking, preparing and serving, Wallace said.
“All the aunties in Anchorage are wanting to cook,” she said.
For ANTHC, the emergency food collection and distribution adds to a year-round traditional foods program, said Shea Seigert, the consortium’s senior manager of external affairs.
Seigert said he does not know how long the emergency program will run. “As long as there’s a need, we will continue to fill it,” he said.
Some of the donated food is being used by the nonprofit World Central Kitchen, which has been providing hot meals to evacuees and emergency workers at the William A. Egan Civic & Convention Center in downtown Anchorage and the Alaska Airlines Center on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus. Both sites have been operating as assistance hubs for the evacuees in the Anchorage area, and the two sites were also used as temporary shelters, though by this week, most of the clients were set to be transitioned to longer-lasting and more private living quarters, according to state officials.
Government agencies providing economic assistance are also attempting to accommodate the cultural needs of the people displaced by the typhoon.
One is the U.S. Small Business Administration, which typically provides low-interest loans to help victims of declared natural disasters recover from economic losses.
Kelly Loeffler, the SBA’s administrator, said the agency recognizes that damages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region are different from disaster damages in the Lower 48.
Loeffler, at a Wednesday news conference held in Anchorage with Gov. Mike Dunleavy, said the SBA has “modified some of the rules in order to speed relief to those survivors.”
Loans will be available to replace lost or damaged subsistence-related items, Loeffler said at the news conference, which was held outside the Alaska Airlines Center. That includes things like all-terrain vehicles, hunting knives and boats.
“We’re going to continue to respond to unique needs of the terrain, people and this culture and make sure that the funding meets the moment,” she said.
However, damages to subsistence camps are not eligible for such aid, according to an SBA statement issued on Monday.
The quandary of how to compensate for subsistence losses also affected the response to a similar disaster three years ago.  When remnants of Typhoon Merbok struck the same region and wreaked havoc farther north into the Bering Strait region, rural and mostly Indigenous Alaskans had to work through aid systems to get compensation for lost subsistence gear and equipment.
Federal agencies attempted to tailor aid programs to the needs of rural Alaska residents, and some of the relief effort focused on rebuilding and repairing traditional fishing and hunting camps. Additionally, the U.S. Geological Survey stepped up its mapping of the region and its identification of coastal hazards in Merbok’s wake.
But there were bumps, such as improper language translations provided by a contractor the Federal Emergency Management Agency hired.
The urgency for tailoring disaster response to the particular needs of Western Alaska is expected to continue into the future. Scientists project that climate change, by warming the ocean, thawing permafrost and thus causing the land to sink, raising sea levels and diminishing sea ice will trigger yet more regional disasters like Halong and Merbok.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC08537-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 22:56:41.418629

Dr. Jay Butler, who is a nationally recognized expert in infectious diseases, will start his UAA position on Dec. 28, the university announced on Friday.
Butler has experience in state, federal and tribal governments. Most recently, he was deputy director for infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. He held that position for six years. He left there in July, at a time when the CDC was being targeted for mass firings and cutbacks.

	Before then, he served as Alaska’s chief medical officer, chief of the Alaska Division of Health’s epidemiology section and director of the CDC’s Arctic Investigations Program. He also worked as senior director of community health services for the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, among other positions. And he served for 16 years as an affiliate professor at UAA’s WWAMI School of Medical Education, part of an educational partnership between Alaska, Washington, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. The program enables students in those states to get medical degrees, giving them options for studying at six different universities.
In a statement, UAA Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Denise Runge said Butler’s deep experience will be an asset to the College of Health.
“Dr. Butler joins UAA at an exciting time for our university,” Runge said in the statement. “His leadership and commitment to Alaska will be instrumental in strengthening UAA’s position as the state’s designated health university. We are thrilled to welcome him into a role supported by a strong team of faculty, staff and leaders within the College of Health.”
Butler’s work includes several years of research into influenza and other infectious diseases and their impact on Alaska Native people.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Seafood tissue samples taken from the Tangipahoa River last month contained harmful levels of arsenic in five of the 13 samples tested, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported.
It’s the latest update from state officials on the river’s health after the Aug. 22 fire and explosion at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. petroleum products facility in Roseland. The industrial disaster coated nearby homes and businesses with oily soot, while huge tanks filled with automotive oils and fluids spilled into the river and adjacent ponds. Cleanup efforts have collected 11 million gallons of liquid waste, according to state estimates. 
The state made its seafood test findings public late Friday in a news release, explaining Wildlife and Fisheries officials collected samples from fish, shrimp and crabs from the river as well as similar catch from Bayou Lacombe 40 miles away for comparison. 
The samples were taken Sept. 16-23 and submitted to the Louisiana Department of Health for testing. 
“With the exception of arsenic, no contaminants detected in seafood samples from the Tangipahoa River were present at levels expected to pose harm to public health,” the LDEQ statement said.
The agency explained further its analysis did not differentiate between organic and inorganic arsenic, the former being far less toxic. A 2016 study from the National Institutes of Health found human exposure to organic arsenic is most common through eating seafood though it is generally nontoxic.
Inorganic arsenic, when the heavy metal element combines with carbon or other materials, has been linked to different types of cancer and nerve damage. Exposure to this form is most common from drinking water contaminated with industrial products, according to the American Cancer Association. Fertilizers are also a recognized source of inorganic arsenic. 
State officials also pointed out there is already a state health advisory against eating fish from the Tangipahoa River for mercury levels that dates back to 2003. It covers black drum, bowfin, crappie, flathead catfish, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, red ear sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth buffalo and spotted bass.      
Earlier Friday, the Department of Environmental Quality and parish officials reopened a small lower stretch of Tangipahoa River to maritime traffic, though upper portions remain closed as cleanup crews continue to deploy spill containment booms.

,Daily Montanan,2025-10-31 23:14:50+00:00,Daily Montanan,First 2027 Legislature bill draft requested in response to ‘woke’ seminars at teachers’ conference,Micah Drew,,,,,https://dailymontanan.com/2025/10/31/first-2027-legislature-bill-draft-requested-in-response-to-woke-seminars-at-teachers-conference/,"Montana’s state Senate President, Matt Regier, has requested the first bill draft of the 2027 Legislature to rein in what he described as “political agendas” at teacher educational conferences.  The move follows backlash from conservative Republicans after recordings from several sessions of the Montana Federation of Public Employees educator conference were[...]","The dome of the Montana Capitol, with the statue of Mike and Maureen Mansfield in the lower center (By Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan). Montana’s state Senate President, Matt Regier, has requested the first bill draft of the 2027 Legislature to rein in what he described as “political agendas” at teacher educational conferences. 
The move follows backlash from conservative Republicans after recordings from several sessions of the Montana Federation of Public Employees educator conference were released on social media about culture-war topics, including book bans, gender ideology, and censorship in art. 
The educator conference had more than 300 sessions educators could attend during two days in October and provided required professional development units for educators. 
Shortly after the conference and announcement from Regier, MFPE said it was proud of the presentations on topics in math, science, language, art and more. It said nearly 1,000 educators from public and private schools attended.
With the backing of State Superintendent Susie Hedalen, Regier requested the bill draft title “Revise education laws related to teacher training and education and meetings of teacher organizations,” which he said will be similar to a bill brought this session that failed on a final vote in the Senate during the 2025 session. 
“Coming into this session, we knew this was an issue with PIR (pupil-instruction-related) days. There had been reporting on it from the conference last year,” Regier, the Kalispell Republican, said. “We need to make sure that tax dollars aren’t going towards political agendas in our schools.”
The controversy over the educators conference arose earlier this month after an individual went “undercover” at the conference and recorded educators at several of the sessions, releasing snippets of conversation online and tagging elected officials. 
Amanda Curtis, president of MFPE, told the Daily Montanan that the recordings and subsequent backlash from Regier and Hedalen was disinformation and lacked context. 
“I think I just have to say they are outright lying about what happens at this conference, and I don’t really understand what good it’s serving Montana students,” Curtis said. “There’s a lot of heartburn and disappointment in the Senate president and superintendent grandstanding on the first bill title being a teacher attack bill when they really could be focusing on helping … recruit and retain Montana teachers.”

 Pupil-instruction-related days

Montana’s administrative rules require schools to close for two days every October for professional development pupil-instruction related (PIR) days, where teachers can attend annual meetings of various state associations. 
Teachers are paid for the two days when students are not in class if they attend an approved professional development meeting and earn professional development units, or PDUs, which are required to keep their license. 
The third week of October has been designated as a time for teachers to do their professional development for decades. 
The state’s largest union, MFPE, has put on its teacher education conference for more than 30 years, Curtis said, in cooperation with the Office of Public Instruction. But the educator’s conference is not the only conference that takes place during that week — other professional organizations hold their own conferences at the same time. 
The Montana State Literacy Association Conference, the Association for Career and Technical Education Conference, the Montana Conference of Education Leadership, the Montana Music Educators Association Conference all schedule their programs for the October PIR days. 
The MHSA All-State music festival, for band, choir, and orchestra students, also takes place during the two days off; as does the all-state youth hunt. 
In a joint press release, Hedalen and Regier said their legislation would “end the practice of Montana teachers receiving educational credit for their participation in conferences promoting extreme leftist ideology and classroom indoctrination.”
“Montana has been closing schools and paying teachers for two days every year to attend this conference in order to develop professionally and better serve their students. But instead of learning how to instruct students on core skills and prepare them for life, these conferences have been indoctrinating teachers with leftist political extremism,” Regier said in the release.
Curtis said that broad legislation that could remove PIR days from state law would have wide-reaching implications for educators and students, and said that MFPE was proud to stand behind the extensive curriculum offered at their seminar. 
“There’s a lot of righteous indignation from members who are teachers who have been attending this conference for all or part of the 30 years,” Curtis said. “There’s a new fervor to join MFPE, I think from folks who have maybe not been as excited about union membership and can clearly see through the crazy culture war attacks.”
 Undercover recordings 

The MFPE conference, held in Missoula, included more than 320 different sessions for educators to attend, mostly one- or two-hours modules capped at 20 to 30 educators. 
The sessions covered the full spectrum of opportunities for educators, including topics like “Dyslexia the Superpower;” “Bring the stock market to life in your classroom;” “Advancing proficiency in STEM: practical strategies with AI and socratic dialogue;” “Fostering curiosity in your classroom with live butterflies;” “Rockets in the science classroom, Grades 6 7 8 9;” and a panel on school funding sponsored by the Legislature’s Interim School Funding Committee. OPI also had exhibition booths and their own presentations.
But Hedalen and Regier’s legislation focused on four seminars “promoting radical gender ideology, DEI, nude child photography, and sexually explicit books.”
Finley Warden, who isn’t a teacher but on social media says he goes “undercover to expose the far left,” recorded parts of four seminars and released short pieces of audio. Warden is a young, Missoula-based conservative activist who has testified before the Legislature 
According to an MFPE spokesperson, Warden registered for the conference as himself. In various sessions he presented himself as an art education student and a math teacher, and was introduced as himself by Curtis in one session.
Curtis said the recordings lacked any context, couldn’t be verified, and might be illegal under Montana law, which requires all-party consent before making audio recordings in private spaces. She said the union is consulting with attorneys and would take steps to protect the personal and professional safety of anyone recorded without their consent. 
One seminar was “DEI &A in the 2025 Art Room,” which included a discussion about censorship of art, specifically the 2024 removal of photographer Sally Mann’s exhibition from a gallery in Texas by police. Mann, once named the country’s best photographer, has sparked controversy going back to the 1990s, over a series of her work depicting her young children, sometimes in the nude. The National Coalition Against Censorship in a statement about the controversy said the photos contain “neither sexual context nor sexual content.”
The recording of the teachers’ discussion includes references to how the Nazi regime censored abstract art, and how to have discussions with students over whether censorship in art is acceptable. 
Other seminars that drew ire included one, capped at 25 educators, that was a training on advocacy and law for librarians. The course description stated it would show ways librarians can “uphold the laws protecting libraries in the face of information and material challenges and the challenge to our profession as a whole.”
A portion of that seminar, released in a recording, centered around a librarian telling a “victory story” about a graphic novel that had been removed from a school library, and the librarian’s role in getting it put back on the shelf after numerous students had requested it. 
Regier and Hedalen described the situation as a story about “bringing a sexually explicit book back to her library to provide to middle school students.” 
The book in question, a graphic novel in the Heartstopper series, focuses on a fictional gay high school couple, and has been the focus of several book bans in other states. 
The press release from the state describes the book as including “multiple passages of explicit softcore pornography.” The nonprofit Common Sense Media, which allows parents to rate media content, lists it as appropriate for ages 14 and up, and says it includes passages of high school students in a sex education class, and “implied sexual activity.”
A third seminar that was recorded included a member of the National Education Association sharing that there are educational modules that educators can access online to learn about LGBTQ+ issues, including gender identity and gender expression. 
None of the MFPE sessions are mandatory for educators. 
Curtis told the Daily Montanan that lacking context and the extent of discussions which took place in each seminar, the recordings and their characterization amounted to “lying and misinformation” about the conference.
Regier told the Daily Montanan in a phone call Friday that he was “not demonizing the education system,” but wanted to make sure there were safeguards in place to protect Montana students. 
“If the unions are going to keep going with sexualized content for kids or DEI or any of this other stuff that’s being reported, at a minimum I want to stop taxpayer dollars from going towards these,” Regier said. “If we’ve got 300 great courses here, and one that will sexualize your kids, or if there’s one teacher that has one left-liberal agenda – and they’re there for that and not to teach the kids math — that’s a problem.”
He said the goal of his bill is to put the decision about teacher educational opportunities in the hands of school districts, which can decide whether to keep the October days and what conference teachers should go to, and keep the “bad apples from pushing their agenda.”
He added that the bill will be modeled on House Bill 557, legislation with similar content brought by Rep. Jodee Etchart, R-Billings. The bill passed the House but died in a final vote in the Senate, after two Republican senators changed their votes. 
Regier called out the two senators, who were members of the Nine Republicans who opposed Regier’s leadership during the session and worked with Democrats in the chamber to push through major pieces of legislation, including Medicaid expansion and the state budget. 
“I hope this bill highlights the frustrations of myself and the other legislators who knew about this last session,” Regier said. “The public should know that if they’re voting for parental rights and local control, we want to assure voters there are a lot of good Republicans who have insight who are pushing back.”

 OPI takes a stance 

Following the release of the audio from the teacher’s conference, Hedalen sent a letter to school districts, saying there had been “potential violations of state and federal law in public schools related to DEI and gender identity instruction.” 
The letter reminded educators “to remain in full compliance with the law and to uphold the responsibilities entrusted to us by Montana families,” and pointed to legislation from the 2025 session including House Bill 471, which requires parents opt-in to human sexuality and identity instruction. 
In the press release, Hedalen said she is “currently investigating MFPE and other professional development providers,” to make sure they are following state and federal laws. The release also said that MFPE had not publicly published its conference agenda and list of sessions.
But Curtis said that OPI had been invited to participate “in every step of the planning process” of the conference, as they are every year. 
“Our office took their unanswered emails and lack of attendance in any planning meeting to mean they had no concerns with the conference,” Curtis said. “The list of courses has been available for review since May of 2025. OPI could have just walked over one block to our office, picked up a phone, or sent an email asking us to send a list of courses before they were ever approved.”
In an email, the spokesperson from OPI said that while many sessions at the conference “could have been beneficial to educators, there were also many that were problematic; introducing instruction that would be in violation of state or federal law or the educator code of ethics.”
Asked about specific seminars, OPI commented on the librarian discussing bringing the graphic novel back to the library but said there has been no legal investigation into whether any rules or district or state policies had been violated.  
“The discussion about returning a sexually explicit book to school libraries is ultimately a decision that should rest with parents. They are best positioned to determine whether material of that nature is appropriate for their 12- or 13-year-old children to read,” OPI said. 
Hedalen said through an OPI spokesperson that they had no prior knowledge that anyone was going to make recordings of the MFPE conference and that no one “recommended, suggested, or promoted such actions.”
The spokesperson for OPI clarified that the office does not want to stop PIR days or limit professional development opportunities for educators. 
“Our goal is to end the outdated practice of requiring schools to close for a specific conference and instead empower local districts and teachers to decide how and when to use those days for professional growth,” the spokesperson said in an email. “There are many excellent professional development opportunities available beyond the MFPE conference, including the OPI Summer Institute, the Teacher Learning Hub, and locally-driven PD.”
On Thursday morning, Hedalen had a meeting with Curtis that Hedalen described as “cordial,” but did not offer details. Curtis said it was a “productive meeting” in a press release, and emphasized the organization has a “shared commitment to continue working with her to provide irreplaceable professional development for educators.”
In addition to the requested legislation lawmakers will consider in 2027, the Office of Public Instruction is working on their own changes to professional development for educators. 
“We are currently undertaking a major overhaul of all PDU providers, including removing those that have failed to comply with the MCA or have not provided the necessary information that is required by ARM,” an OPI spokesperson said. “This new system will allow us to offer high-quality professional development courses for our teachers, ensuring they receive the training they need to best support student learning.”

The Boise-based group Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho, which was created this year, announced Oct. 29 it is beginning to collect signatures attempting to qualify the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to go before voters in the 2026 general election. 
The group filed an initiative petition with the state Aug. 29 and received ballot titles from the Idaho Attorney General’s Office on Oct. 20. 
Under Idaho state law, cannabis means marijuana, and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. 
The Idaho Medical Cannabis Act seeks to:

Allow qualifying patients with chronic pain or debilitating conditions like cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder or Alzheimer’s to access regulated cannabis for treatment. In order to access medical cannabis, Idahoans would need to apply for a medical cannabis card by presenting medical records showing a diagnosis of a substantial health condition from a medical professional authorized to make such a diagnosis.  
Establish a regulated licensing system for Idaho-based producers and dispensaries.
Prohibit the public use of medical cannabis, prohibit the sharing of medical cannabis with others and prohibit impaired driving while under the influence of medical cannabis.
Reclassify cannabis from a Schedule 1 drug to Schedule 2 drug in state law in order to allow for research of medical cannabis.  

“This is about giving families and individuals options when nothing else has worked,” said Amanda Watson, communications lead for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho. “This initiative was created with Idaho values in mind. It would require strong oversight, measures to prevent recreational use and most importantly, it would provide relief for thousands of Idahoans suffering from serious medical conditions. It’s a compassionate, conservative approach to health care.”
The short ballot title for the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act reads: “Measure decriminalizing the use, possession, production, cultivation, transportation, distribution and sale of marijuana by medical cannabis cardholders and production licensees.”
 Idaho Legislature strongly opposes marijuana

The new medical cannabis initiative sets up the potential to have two, dueling cannabis questions on Idaho voters’ ballots in November 2026. 
The Idaho Legislature, which staunchly opposes marijuana, has already placed a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution called House Joint Resolution 4 on the November 2026 ballot in Idaho. If approved by voters, HJR 4 would make it so that only the Idaho Legislature – not Idaho voters – has the power to legalize marijuana or other narcotics. HJR 4 applies to the growing, possession, use, selling, delivering, dispensing, prescribing, manufacturing or transporting of marijuana or other narcotics.  
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs $300 mandatory minimum fine for marijuana possession into law

“Too many legislatures across this nation have sat back and just waited as initiative after initiative would come after them, until they finally overwhelm it and overwhelm the legislature,” state Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said in March. “We are acting because that’s our responsibility.”
Days before adopting the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution, the Idaho Legislature also passed another law creating a new mandatory minimum fine of $300 for anyone convicted of simple possession of marijuana. 
 What is a ballot initiative and how does it work in Idaho?

In Idaho, a ballot initiative is a form of direct democracy where the voters of Idaho – not the Idaho Legislature – decide whether to pass a new law. 
To qualify the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act for the November 2026 election, supporters need to gather and verify signatures from at least 70,000 registered Idaho voters, with at least 6% of the registered voters in at least 18 of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts.  
Supporters have until April 30 to collect the required signatures and submit them for verification, Watson said. 
If the ballot initiative qualifies for the November 2026 election, it would require a simple majority of voters to approve it. 
All of Idaho’s neighboring states, other than Wyoming, either offer medical cannabis like Utah or recreational marijuana, like Washington, Oregon, Montana and Nevada. 
Since 2012, different groups in Idaho have tried and failed every two years to qualify a medical marijuana ballot initiative to go on the ballot, state records show. 
The Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho is a new, different group that launched this year. In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, Watson said the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho will use paid signature-gatherers to collect the necessary signatures by the April 30 deadline. Signature gatherers will be paid up to $5 per valid signature, and organizers are focusing on recruiting signature gatherers at this time. Information about applying to be a signature-gatherer is available on the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho’s website 
 What is the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho?

Public records show that experienced, high-profile legal and communications professionals in Boise have been steering the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to this point.
Watson, president and founder of Boise-based Atlas Strategic Communications, is serving as the communications lead for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho.
Jeremy Chou, a partner with the Boise law firm/public affairs firm Givens Pursley, represents the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho and submitted official paperwork for the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office.
Records available through the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office indicate the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho is a Boise-based limited liability company that was created Aug. 1. 
Givens Pursley Corporate Services, which has the same mailing address and a nearly identical name to Chou’s law firm, Givens Pursley LLP, is listed as the registered agent for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho.
In addition to the limited liability company, a political action committee, or PAC, has also been recently established in Idaho. 
Campaign finance records available through the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office indicate that the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho PAC was created Oct. 23. Those records list Rob Cronin as the treasurer and chairperson of the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho PAC, while the mailing address provided is the same address as Watson’s firm, Atlas Strategic Communications. 
The PAC, which is only a few days old, has not reported raising or spending any money as of this article’s publication deadline.

U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Jaiden Hartley said his agency was notified of the incident around 7 a.m. Friday. Coast Guard crews responded to an area just east of Tidewater Dock and found a blown methane well head, he said.
Natural gas condensate was released, and a light sheening was observed on the bayou’s surface, Hartley said. 
It’s unclear when the leak began and how much gas has been released. Technicians were still on scene as of about 5:30 p.m. still working to plug the well head, while cleanup crews were deploying absorbent boom in the area, Hartley said.
Lafourche Parish Fire District 3 Chief Devin Dedon said his department has been on standby in case more personnel are needed to assist.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Not far from the security line at the Salt Lake City International Airport, a woman struggled, screaming for help as two plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dragged her out. 
A video posted on social media shows one of the agents showing a badge to a Salt Lake City Police officer who observed the scene without interfering at about 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Not many details of the arrest were clear in the following hours, until Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall released a statement Thursday condemning it. 
“I am left wondering and aching from the fear and pain these types of operations keep striking in my heart and the hearts of so many of us,” Mendenhall said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After watching footage from witnesses, the Salt Lake City Police officer’s body camera and airport surveillance — in which the woman is seen trying to break away from the officers, yelling “I have my papers” — Mendenhall said she had been made aware of the case, involving “multiple plain-clothed ICE agents.”
ICE initially denied being involved in the arrest on Thursday morning, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. But, after the Salt Lake City Police and the airport confirmed the arresting officers were from ICE, the agency released another statement acknowledging their involvement.
Officials with ICE confirmed the woman is a 39 year-old immigrant without permanent legal status in the country from El Salvador who had entered the U.S. in 2007 and had received a removal order in absentia in February 2020.
In a statement, ICE confirmed that the arrest was a targeted enforcement operation and that the woman will be held in their custody pending her removal to El Salvador.
“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is executing its mission of identifying and removing criminal aliens and others who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” the agency wrote. “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.”
A Utah court records search Friday showed only a winter parking infraction in 2022 under the woman’s name.
Mendenhall lamented the incident, saying that so much about ICE operations like the arrest in Salt Lake City remain unknown.



Let us know what you think...


 


“In this case, for example, why were the agents in plain clothes without visible identification? Why did they choose the lobby of the airport—the gateway to our state—where some 28,000 people enter every day?,” Mendenhall said. “What I do know is that nothing about this incident, like so many ICE operations, makes me feel safer as an American.”
The city reached out to federal agencies searching for answers, “in the interest of promoting transparency, accountability and the well-being of all who live in and visit our city,” the Salt Lake City Council said in a statement.
“Incidents like this create fear and uncertainty in our community. The operation was not coordinated with or directed by Salt Lake City Police,” council members said.
City clarifications
While Mendenhall said there are details the city still doesn’t know about the detainment, she said some factors needed to be clarified.
Despite being inside the airport, the pre-security area where the arrest took place is considered a public space. 
Also, the Salt Lake City Police officer who observed the arrest was responding to the commotion in the terminal and visually confirmed the agents’ federal identification, Mendenhall said. 
Local law enforcement is prohibited from interfering with federal immigration enforcement.
In other daily operations from the city police, immigration status doesn’t influence how officers handle the situation, the mayor said, “nor do officers screen for immigration status when placing a person under arrest.”

Shapiro declares disaster emergency over SNAP benefits suspension,Peter Hall,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/food-insecurity/gov-shapiro-declares-disaster-emergency-over-snap-benefits-suspension/,The state will make $5 million available for food banks to weather expected spike in people seeking assistance,"Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding speaks at a news conference Friday at the Philabundance food bank warehouse in south Philadelphia, where Gov. Josh Shapiro announced $5 million in emergency funding to aid food charities as federal SNAP recipients miss their November assistance payments. (Photo by Commonwealth Media Services)As two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to release food assistance money, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday the state will make $5 million available to a network of food banks across the commonwealth.
Shapiro also signed a disaster declaration to ensure the state money is available immediately, as 2 million Pennsylvanians who rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) miss their November allocations. They would normally be paid Saturday.
“They made this determination even though they are sitting on billions of dollars of congressionally appropriated contingency funds,” Shapiro said in a news conference at the Philabundance food bank warehouse in south Philadelphia.
SNAP provides $366 million a month in food assistance, which benefits about one out of every eight Pennsylvanians – or about 15% of the state’s population.
Lori Jones-Brown, CEO of Philabundance, which is the largest non-profit food bank in the greater Philadelphia area, said food pantries across the region are already using reserves to meet increased demand. 
“Just today, one of my colleagues told me that a mother came to our warehouse North Philly with four kids in our car asking for help,” Jones-Brown said. “Pantries are seeing scared faces and longer lines, and this is happening at a time when we were already seeing record numbers.”

The $5 million in state funding will flow through Feeding Pennsylvania, a statewide association of the commonwealth’s nine food banks that serve more than 1.5 million people annually across all 67 counties.
Additionally, Shapiro said he has launched a private-sector fundraising effort to aid food banks through the SNAP Emergency Relief Fund that has already collected more than $1 million from Pennsylvania business leaders.
Shapiro noted the commonwealth  is part of the coalition of 24 Democratic states that sued the Trump administration this week, seeking a court order directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue food assistance for 42 million people nationwide.
While the ruling is an important win, Shapiro said, the commonwealth still faces a potential crisis in feeding its most vulnerable people. It will take up to 10 days for the administration to get the money into SNAP recipients accounts, he said, and that’s if President Donald Trump obeys the dual court orders.

“Given this administration and its propensity to ignore the rule of law, I don’t trust that they’re going to follow this judge’s ruling,” Shapiro said.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration also canceled $13 million in USDA funding over three years to purchase locally grown food for food banks in the commonwealth. The state is also suing to enforce its contract with the USDA.
“Not only is President Trump harming people who are hungry, he is harming Pennsylvania farmers, and that’s on top of what he’s already done to them with his ill advised tariffs,” Shapiro said. “I think right now, we should be doing everything we can to feed Pennsylvanians and not making excuses as to why it can’t happen.”
State House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said Shapiro’s actions show leadership and a responsible solution to the crisis, which she attributed to Republicans in Congress.
“While this solution is temporary, we can do more to ensure fewer Pennsylvanians rely on programs like SNAP, by increasing the minimum wage and investing in our schools and job training programs to give every person a path to success,” McClinton said in a statement Friday.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) and Health and Human Services Committee Chairperson Art Haywood (D-Montgomery) said in a statement the loss of SNAP payments will place an extraordinary strain on food charities.
“My colleagues and I have been receiving a deluge of calls from concerned constituents, fearful that they will not be able to stock their pantries and refrigerators because of the heartless decision of the president and his enablers in the federal government,” Costa said.

SNAP, historically known as food stamps, allows low income families and individuals to purchase food from neighborhood markets. For many, SNAP benefits have been sufficient to put food on the table, said Julie Bancroft, CEO of Feeding Pennsylvania. That organization will distribute the $5 million in emergency state funding to its network of food banks around the state.
“Where will they turn? They’ll turn to food banks and pantries, many for the first time, because their SNAP benefits have been just enough to make ends meet,” Bancroft said, noting the sudden increase in people seeking food assistance is exacerbated by the federal government shutdown during which most federal workers are not being paid.
“Our network is using cash reserves to keep shelves stocked, but these resources are limited and will run out, making emergency funding critical. The funding announced today will help ease the pressure in a time of crisis,” Bancroft said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/28564_gov_SNAP_DZ_009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 19:02:19.901360

Dianne Primavera, left, and Budget Director Mark Ferrandino, right, at the Governor's Residence in Denver on Friday. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Friday presented his initial budget plans for the next fiscal year, including recommendations to curb growth in state Medicaid spending.
The budget proposal includes about $18.6 billion in general fund spending, up 2.3% from the current fiscal year, which began in July. The Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee is in charge of crafting the budget and lawmakers are in charge of passing it, but the governor’s office gives hefty input through this proposal and an updated one in January.
The proposal calls for a 13% general fund reserve, down from the typical 15% reserve in recent years.
“This budget is a reflection of our priorities and supports our students by fully funding our schools, improving public safety, and addressing the strained fiscal environment we’re in due to H.R. 1 and President (Donald) Trump’s reckless tariffs,” Polis said in a statement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
H.R. 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is the federal tax and spending measure Trump signed in July.
Medicaid growth has vastly outpaced how much the state government is allowed to spend under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, a state constitutional amendment that pegs spending increases to population growth and inflation. The ballooning program was one reason lawmakers needed to trim $1.2 billion from the budget this year, and it is contributing to the expected $850 million gap next year.
Medicaid is a health insurance program operated jointly by federal and state governments that provides coverage to low-income families and individuals. Almost one-fifth of Coloradans receive Medicaid benefits.
Polis proposes an increase in Medicaid spending by about $300 million, versus the projected growth of about $630 million. He called that a “down payment” to get program spending closer to the TABOR cap rate — spending has increased about 8.8% per year over the last decade, according to his office, about double the TABOR cap growth. If that trend continues, Medicaid spending could eat up most of the state’s general fund spending ability.
“There’s two levers on Medicaid,” Polis said during the presentation at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. “One is how many people you cover and two is what you cover. There have been a number of benefits that have been added in recent years and some of those aren’t sustainable over time.”
He highlighted dental benefits. They were once capped at $1,500 per year, but then that cap was lifted. Polis wants to reinstate a cap at $3,000 annually.
He also wants legislation next year to set a year-over-year growth rate in Medicaid general fund spending. His office is working with a third party to compare Colorado’s Medicaid program with national benchmarks to give some idea of how to curb growth. A public report on those findings should be available late this year or early January.
Administrative cost cuts
The budget proposal also includes suggestions for changes in departmental administration costs, ranging from a 34% reduction in the governor’s office to an 8% increase in the Department of Public Safety. The Department of Early Childhood would see an 11% decrease, the Department of Local Affairs would have a 26% decrease and the Department of Higher Education would have a 16% decrease in operating costs. Overall, those cuts would save about $25 million.
“It doesn’t mean anyone is laid off,” he said. “It means openings wouldn’t be filled.”
Polis is once again calling for the privatization of Pinnacol Assurance, the the insurer of “last resort” for workers’ compensation, in order to cover the continuation of the senior homestead exemption and state building maintenance. His proposal predicts a $400 million profit from such a sale.
On education, Polis wants to limit in-state tuition increases to 2.6%. He also wants to raise per-pupil funding in K-12 to $413 and partially start to implement a new school finance formula intended to send money to districts based on individual student needs, instead of the five-year average number of students.

(Getty Images)Most individual health insurance plans sold in Missouri will increase in price next year even as customers prepare to dig deeper into their own funds to replace costs previously covered by federal tax credits.
The state Department of Commerce and Insurance on Friday released the approved rates for individual plans, most of which are sold on the health insurance marketplace. One carrier, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City, is lowering premiums an average of 4.1% for its plans available in 30 western Missouri counties. Some plans offered by the company will see an increase of as much as 9%.
Premiums will increase for the other eight carriers offering plans in all or part of the state. Ambetter Health plans, available off the marketplace in 109 counties, will increase an average of 1.9%, while Cox Health Plans, available in five southwest Missouri counties, will go up an average of 30.4%.
The costs for some Missourians will increase 70% or more if Congress does not extend tax credits enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because congressional Democrats refuse to vote to fund the government until Republicans add an extension of the credits to the spending bill. Republicans argue the government should be reopened before negotiations over subsidies resume.
Premiums will increase for the other eight carriers offering plans in all or part of the state. Ambetter Health plans, available off the marketplace in 109 counties, will increase an average of 1.9%, while Cox Health Plans, available in five southwest Missouri counties, will go up an average of 30.4%.
There are at least two companies offering health plans in every county, with a handful in the St. Louis area seeing seven vying for their business. 
“First and foremost, Missourians need to know our state continues to have a competitive market, which means they will continue to have meaningful choices when it comes to their health coverage,” Angela Nelson, department director, said in a news release. 
In addition to reporting the average change, the department also provided the largest change in cost for any single plan offered by the nine carriers. Those increases ranged from 6.4% for an Ambetter Health plan, to 110% for a Medica plan offered in 54 counties. 
Open enrollment for the individual health plans begins Saturday. Consumers who purchase coverage by Dec. 15 will have it start Jan. 1. Plans may be purchased until Jan. 15, but coverage will not begin until Feb. 1, the release stated.
Missourians will start considering their choices without knowing whether enhanced subsidies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency will be extended.
The original Affordable Care Act subsidies that took effect in 2014 tied the actual cost to consumers to a percentage of their income for people earning less than four times the federal poverty level. Consumers with poverty level income — $15,650 for 2025 for individuals, $32,150 for a family of four — paid 2.1% of their income as premiums, sliding up to 10% for households with income between three and four times the poverty level.
The enhanced tax credits put a cap on out-of-pocket premium costs for all consumers, with the highest earners paying 8.5% of their income and those with incomes below 150% of poverty level paying no premiums for their insurance.
“There is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty about whether Congress will extend the premium tax subsidies into 2026, and we are keeping a close eye on any developments at the federal level,” Nelson said.
Only two of the eight companies offering individual plans in Missouri through the federal marketplace will have plans available in every county or almost every county in the state. United Healthcare plans are available in every county and Ambetter from Home State Health plans can be purchased in every county except Clark, Lewis, Marion, St. Francois, Schuyler and Scotland.
The average monthly premium is about $755 for both the United Healthcare and Ambetter offerings, an increase of about 15% and 25%, respectively. 
An individual with an income of $62,600 a year or more would have to pay the full premium if the enhanced credits are not extended. That means paying $9,060 over a year for the average Ambetter or United Healthcare plan instead of $5,321, an increase of 70%.

 Cost increase impacts

A panel of community members and experts hosted by the Community Health Commission of Missouri in St. Louis on Thursday underlined potential impacts of the expiring subsidies.
Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president for health and policy advocacy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, said higher premiums could lead younger, healthier people to forgo insurance, driving up prices for those who continue to purchase plans.
“When folks can’t afford to buy insurance, it doesn’t mean they won’t get sick,” Weisgrau said. When they do enter the health system, providers pick up the cost, “and again, that eventually gets passed on to everybody else.” 
As Missourians confront higher insurance premiums, 650,000 low-income residents of the state could also be forced to cope with a loss of federal food benefits, with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, set to run out of funding on Nov. 1. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use contingency funds to pay at least partial benefits, but SNAP recipients could still face delays.
Panelists on Thursday said instability across federal safety net programs means communities will have to fill in the gaps through mutual aid.
“I think the neighborhood, the village, needs to be recreated,” said Shanelle Woods, one of the community members.
“There’s someone probably on your block that has extra,” Woods said. “Maybe Miss Jones has a pot of soup and she’s willing to share with your children. But, you have to build a relationship with your neighbor first.”
Panelists said policy conversations don’t address the difficulty of accessing safety net programs even when they are not being cut or suspended.
Shellie Robinson, who went on medical leave after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, said she struggled so long to prove she was eligible to receive disability benefits that she eventually had to go back to work.
Her doctors vouched for her, but, Robinson said, “it still wasn’t enough.”
“Who has the time to wait online or wait on a call for nearly three hours to talk to someone, to get it?” Robinson asked.
Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that despite a “myth” that people who buy marketplace insurance plans are “undeserving, or they’re lazy,” many working people don’t have access to affordable insurance. Older adults who don’t qualify for Medicare – for instance, due to a chronic condition – may also need marketplace plans.
“There are flaws in our insurance markets that put people in this situation,” McBride said. “That’s the truth of the matter, and you don’t hear that from Washington. It’s a blame game.”

Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency Friday and directed $5 million from the state’s budget reserve trust fund to food banks that are part of the Feeding Kentucky network.
This came on the same day a federal judge ruled that  the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to halt funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the government shutdown is illegal. The Massachusetts judge gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond. SNAP benefits are set to run out Saturday. 
Kentucky to hold a state food drive as threat to food assistance looms, governor says

Beshear’s order is “to ensure Kentuckians have access to food over the next few days,” his office said. About 563,080 people in Kentucky rely on SNAP to afford groceries.
Beshear’s executive order instructs the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management to work with the Office of the State Budget Director to “identify, allocate, and transfer funds as necessary from available sources to support the food banks during the lapse of SNAP funding,” beginning with the $5 million. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services will then provide the identified funds to Feeding Kentucky.
The budget reserve trust fund, also known as the “rainy day” fund, contains $3.7 billion. SNAP benefits in Kentucky total about $110 million a month.
Feeding Kentucky has seven food banks around the commonwealth. They will use the funds to buy and distribute extra food during the state of emergency, according to the executive order. 
The Lantern has asked Feeding Kentucky for comment. 
A federal judge in Rhode Island also ordered the Trump administration to fund SNAP. But even with the court orders, there could be delays in benefits. The USDA has not said how it will respond to the judges’ orders.

(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, recalled a Native mother in her 30s who started having memory loss and other dementia-like symptoms.
The woman had suffered multiple blows to her head and falls at the hands of her husband over the years. He had wanted to disable her, to make it more difficult for her to keep her children if she tried to leave him, Echo-Hawk said.
Many Native women have traumatic brain injury symptoms as a direct result of abuse, Echo-Hawk said. Tribal health advocates and groups serving survivors have long been aware of the problem, she said, but there has been little national research documenting the extent of it.
“It’s a very difficult thing to see,” said Echo-Hawk, of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. “This is a pressing concern.”
The Urban Indian Health Institute, an Indigenous health research group, this month launched a first-of-its-kind national survey of American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian women to determine the prevalence of brain injuries in Native survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. The goal is to illuminate the extent of the problem, guide clinicians, raise public awareness and direct resources.
A 2015 study in Arizona found a higher incidence of traumatic brain injuries in Native women in that state, but the new survey is the first national, Indigenous-led study of its kind, according to the institute.
It comes as domestic violence groups across the nation are struggling with federal funding delays caused by the government shutdown. As the impasse continues, the Trump administration has furloughed grant workers at the Office on Violence Against Women, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Traumatic brain injuries can cause memory loss, confusion and long-term behavioral changes and raise the risk of dementia. Some abusers intentionally inflict traumatic brain injuries on their victims because it doesn’t leave visible bruises, according to the Brain Injury Association of America.
The link between domestic violence and traumatic brain injuries has been well-documented in women generally, and the effects of such injuries have been studied in former football players and veterans. But research on Native communities is lacking. Even when Native victims show up in ERs, their cases often go underreported.
In a previous survey of survivors, some Native women reported broken teeth, evidence of blows to the head, Echo-Hawk said. But pushing and strangulation also can cause traumatic brain injuries.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Violence is a public health crisis among American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian women, who are overrepresented in intimate partner violence statistics. Fifty-five percent report experiencing intimate partner violence, and a disproportionate number of Native women and girls are murdered or go missing.
In a 2020 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 44% of American Indian and Alaska Native women reported being raped in their lifetime.
“People are losing their children because of memory loss and dementia,” Echo-Hawk said. “When people are experiencing intimate partner violence, they end up in ERs. Their children suffer. The whole community suffers as a direct result. And the same with the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.”
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

Doctors other hospital staff should receive more training on brain injuries and should know which communities are most likely to experience violence, said Nikki Cristobal, policy and research specialist for Pouhana ʻO Nā Wāhine, a nonprofit domestic violence resource center for Native Hawaiians.
Cristobal said one survivor told her clinicians hadn’t performed a brain scan or traumatic brain injury assessment on her, despite her ongoing psychological and cognitive symptoms. “It never occurred to anybody,” she said.
“We have to talk more about it,” said Cristobal, who worked with Echo-Hawk on developing the survey and is the principal investigator for the Missing and Murdered Native Hawaiian Women, Girls and Mahu state task force.
Native communities, including Native Hawaiians, have endured long-term, intergenerational traumas during colonization and forced assimilation that can’t be ignored when targeting the disproportionate rates of violence, Cristobal said.
“It’s the undercurrent,” Cristobal said. “It’s the precursor.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-31 22:17:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,"JXN Water to move forward with rate increase, report says",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/31/jxn-water-to-move-forward-with-rate-increase-report-says/,The water rate increase Ted Henifin requested  this spring for Jackson customers may go forward..,"JXN Water, the third-party manager of Jackson’s water and wastewater systems, said in a quarterly report filed Friday that it will move forward with a rate increase on water bills it first requested this spring. The increase will go into effect by Dec. 15, the report said. 
The rate increase, on average, would raise Jacksonians’ monthly bills — which also include costs for sewer and sanitation — by 12%, the utility said. 
Ted Henifin, who heads the utility, has reiterated JXN Water is rapidly losing money because of inadequate revenue. In September, the utility said it was “currently insolvent.” 
Henifin could not be reached Friday to confirm the utility’s plans to raise rates. JXN Water communications officer Aisha Carson said the report does not serve as an official notice of a rate increase. The quarterly update said JXN Water will issue an official notice to customers by Nov. 15.
Both Jackson’s mayor and city council have spoken out against the proposal, arguing it’s unfair to ask more from those who are contributing while about 30% of customers aren’t paying their bills. The city council voted in April against the increase, and Mayor John Horhn reaffirmed his position last week during a meeting with state lawmakers.
But under a federal court’s stipulated order that outlines the scope of Henifin’s powers and responsibilities, the court allows the utility to proceed with a rate increase without the city’s approval and as long as more than a year has passed since the last rate hike. JXN Water first increased rates in February 2024.
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate, who appointed Henifin to his role in 2022, said during hearings this summer the utility should explore all other avenues for funding, including collections from apartment complexes with large debts, before raising rates. Over the last year, JXN Water has pressured apartment complexes to pay their debts leading to shutoffs and ongoing lawsuits. It’s been months, though, since Wingate has last discussed the proposal, and it’s unclear if he plans to address the matter anytime soon.
Henifin’s frustration with the judge’s stance came out during a July hearing where the utility manager threatened to quit, although he walked back the statement soon after. 
In response to Wingate and city officials, Henifin maintained that even if all customers paid their bill at the current rates, JXN Water would still lose money. The utility estimated in September that it was losing $3 million a month.
The quarterly update also addressed $54 million the utility asked Congress to reallocate for operating funds. The money was originally part of $450 million in federal funding set aside for larger projects. 
While the money was held up as part of the ongoing federal government shutdown, JXN Water said it expected Congress to pass the funding bill “in the coming days,” and that the Environmental Protection Agency would issue the money to the utility in a new grant. But, the report added, the utility wouldn’t be able to access the $54 million until early 2026.

Ron DeSantis to step in to provide food aid being lost due to the government shutdown, hailed a pair of  federal court rulings late Friday that may allow the aid to flow again. 
But, they also warned it wasn’t enough to ensure food security for the nearly 3 million state residents who rely on the program.
A federal judge in Boston ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause a food assistance program for nearly 42 million people was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.
At nearly the same time Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge in a similar case brought by cities and nonprofit groups ordered the United States Department of Agriculture to continue payments and granted a request for a temporary restraining order.
Speaking on a Zoom conference call organized by the group Sabotaging Our Safety, state Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, said he was grateful for the judicial intervention but he cautioned that it was “only a temporary fix.”

 “We’re talking about a fund that could run dry in what, less than a month? Then that’s not stability, that’s survival,” he said. 
The USDA last week posted a notice saying SNAP benefits would expire Nov. 1 and put the blame on Democrats for not agreeing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. 
Democrats are against passing a funding plan that doesn’t extend the enhanced premium tax credits that lower the costs of so-called Obamacare plans purchased through the federal health exchange (healthcare.gov).
The partisan impasse has resulted in a month-long government shutdown.
“The best way for SNAP to continue is for the shutdown to end. If not for Congressional Democrats blocking government funding, November SNAP benefits would be paid on-time,” the USDA notice, first reported by Axios, notes.
SNAP has about $6 billion in contingency funds; $9 billion is needed to cover the costs of the program through November. But the federal memo says that SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to float the program during the shutdown.
The federal judges authoring Friday’s court orders disagreed with the USDA’s argument that contingency funds couldn’t be used.
SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Florida has the fourth largest SNAP enrollment nationwide with 2.94 million relying on the assistance for their food security, behind California, Texas, and New York.

Nationwide, 41.7 million people rely on SNAP benefits, August 2025 data show.
“I know they want this plane to come in for a landing, but let’s be clear,” Jones continued. “Right now, the White House, the House, the Senate and the courts are run by the Republican Party. They have the power – right now – to ensure that millions of Floridians – not only don’t go hungry, but they do not lose their health care. And the fact right now that Democrats are holding the line right now, for the fact to ensure that we don’t have a nation of sick people, I will continue to push the line that the federal government should do what’s right and feed the American people and stop bargaining with people’s lives.”
“Cruelty is the point”
State Rep. Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville,  joined Jones on the Zoom call and said she was “happy and grateful” with the court rulings.  But she worries that the administration will appeal the rulings.
“Because at this point, cruelty is the point, right?” she said.

Florida legislative Democrats sent DeSantis a letter earlier this week calling on him to declare a state of emergency over the impending loss of SNAP benefits and dip into the state’s “rainy day” fund to help cover the costs of the program. They also asked DeSantis to direct the Department of Children and Families to work to distribute food to local food banks and their partners.
Legislative Democrats urge DeSantis to declare emergency, fill food pantries

DeSantis dismissed that request a day later.
“Did those Democrats write a letter to Chuck Schumer asking him to stop filibustering the spending?” DeSantis responded at a Tampa press conference on Wednesday. “Come on.”
Meanwhile, Florida’s congressional Democrats also hailed the Friday rulings
U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat from Miami Gardens, called the ruling “good news and shows Republicans chose to illegally stop SNAP benefits this November.”
“The USDA must follow the court order and keep families fed. Now, Congress needs to come back to work, end the shutdown and save healthcare,” Wilson continued. 
U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, an Orlando Democrat, posted in part “Mr. President, the cruelty stops here. Food for our people should never be a political bargaining chip,” in responding to the ruling. 

Trump chose not to use emergency funds to feed over 40 million Americans. A federal judge just ruled that it’s against the law.

Oct. 31, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAround 50 individuals gathered in Portage, Mich. Friday afternoon, donning costumes and bearing treats, protest signs and handouts in opposition to the Palisades nuclear plant restart. 
Organized by a pair of anti-nuclear organizations, the “Zombies Against Palisades” protest aimed to call attention to several concerns as energy systems supplier Holtec International works to resurrect a previously defunct nuclear plant in Covert Township.
However the protest, located outside of Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (R-Holland Township) Portage office, also drew plenty of protestors in opposition to Republican policies and President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Speaking with the Michigan Advance at the first of two planned demonstrations, Kevin Kamps a radioactive waste watchdog for the anti-nuclear energy advocacy group Beyond Nuclear noted that the site was chosen both due to Huizenga’s support for reviving the plant and its location within the 50-mile emergency planning zone established to keep people and animals from eating contaminated food in the event of an emergency at Palisades.
While there are multiple paths to a potential meltdown at the plant, Kamps pointed to the plant’s steam generator tubes as one area of concern.

“They neglected to do safety maintenance for two years 2022 to 2024 making an already bad problem tremendously worse,” Kamps said, warning that if one tube blows, it will lead to a radiation release, while damage to enough of the tubes would result in a nuclear meltdown. 
An October 2024 report from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that 701 tubes in one steam generator and 248 in another were candidates for plugging or repairs, noting that the amount of tubes with stress corrosion cracking far exceeded previous estimates.
Nick Culp, Holtec’s senior manager of government affairs and communications, told the Advance that repairs on the steam generator tubes were successfully completed this summer. 
“Both the sleeving on the Steam Generator primary side system and cleaning on the secondary side will help ensure the system’s continued safe and reliable operation,” Culp said in an email. 
While Culp said the plant is undergoing “rigorous inspections, testing, maintenance, repairs, and upgrades” in preparation for its return to operation, Beyond Nuclear and other anti-nuclear groups have challenged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to approve the steam generator repair plan. 
Michael Keegan, the chair of Don’t Waste Michigan, which was formed in opposition to a nuclear waste disposal within the state, noted Palisades had also recently exceeded its allotted limit for releasing hydrazine into Lake Michigan. Hydrazine is a highly toxic chemical and expected carcinogen, which Palisades uses in its steam generators.

In a notice to the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, Palisades noted that the release occurred during a scheduled cleaning of the steam generators. It also listed several changes in its cleaning process to prevent future releases.
Josef Greenberg, a public information officer for EGLE, said the Department has reviewed the incident report filed by the facility and will be requesting additional information related to the incident and report. If there is a need for any additional corrective actions, EGLE will make that determination after reviewing all data and responses submitted by the facility. 
Although Culp said the release brought no risk to the health and safety of Palisades’ employees, the community or the environment, Kamps retained concerns about the plant’s impact on the community’s health. 
“Lake Michigan is drinking water for shoreline communities. Yes, [radiation and toxic chemicals] may dilute as it expands out into the lake, but the South Haven drinking water intake is four miles away,” Kamps said, citing high rates of thyroid cancer amongst residents living in nearby communities.
Nancy Falk, a Kalamazoo resident and former Western Michigan University professor was among the costumed protestors speaking out against the Trump Administration. 
When asked what concerns were at the top of her mind, Falk said “For heaven’s sakes, everything.”
“Look, I’m 87 years old. I’m on Medicaid. I’m on Medicare,” Falk said. “I have a daughter, recently divorced, who is going to have to get new health insurance. So that’s a concern. I have another daughter whose job is disintegrating, who has a disabled husband and two daughters in college and one to go, so there are many, many very immediate concerns besides the long range one.”
A former comparative religions scholar, Falk also had concerns about the president’s approach to foreign policy. 
“Trump seems very good at turning on the United States friends while cuddling up to the United States long-term, if not enemies, maybe rivals,” Falk said. 
When comparing Trump to other presidencies she had lived through, Falk said “Trump is the pits.” 
“I thought Nixon was bad. Trump is much worse. Nixon, at least, I think, knew when his time was up,” Falk said.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Stadard)The first item on every Washington voter’s ballot is a proposal to add a few lines to the state constitution that would change how billions of taxpayer dollars are managed.
Senate Joint Resolution 8201 seeks to let the state make stock market investments with payroll taxes collected for its long-term care program, known as WA Cares. Any earnings would have to be used solely for the program’s beneficiaries.
If approved Tuesday, the Washington State Investment Board would be legally able to handle the program’s assets in a similar manner as it does pension and retirement funds. 
This will allow for the tax dollars to be invested in a “safe and risk averse way” while producing greater returns for the program, said Heather Weiner of the Approve 8201 campaign in a recent debate at the University of Washington.
She said that since 1992, annual returns for Washington’s pension funds have averaged 8.9%, which is several percentage points higher than investments in government bonds. In the long run that would translate to a lot more dollars for the program.
“This doesn’t mean day trading, taking big risks on a stock market,” she said. “This means smart long-term [investing] so that in 50 years when people in this audience today will need long term care, that fund will be there for you.”
State Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Tukwila, opposes the measure.
“Our fiduciary responsibility is to the people,” he told the debate audience. “No one is going to know when the economy or stock market crashes. So, this vote is about whether we keep prudent fiscal management policies of our tax dollars and retain those constitutional protections.”
The Legislature voted earlier this year to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot. It passed by margins of 86-9 in the House and 42-7 in the Senate and will become law if more than 50% of voters approve it on Tuesday.
WA Cares, created by a 2019 law, is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation. A pilot program will start in January in a handful of counties.
Collections of the payroll tax began in mid-2023 and more than $2.5 billion was banked in the Long Term Services and Supports Trust Account as of summer.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit that are less risky but typically deliver lower rates of return. The WA Cares account is now subject to this limitation.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If the constitutional amendment is approved, the long-term service account would be added to the list of funds exempt from that prohibition alongside the state’s pension and retirement funds. The state investment board could then decide if it wants to invest in private equity funds and buy stock of private companies, or not.
In 2020, voters defeated a similar measure. It passed in only three Washington counties — King, Jefferson and Whatcom.
Weiner said this year’s proposal, unlike the one in 2020, mandates money made from investments must go into the WA Cares Fund. The intent is to prevent lawmakers from tapping those dollars for other budget needs.
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, back the ballot measure. So too do the Washington State Nurses Association, Washington State Council of Fire Fighters, AARP, and Washington Health Care Association.
Service Employees International Union 775 is underwriting the campaign. The union, which represents 55,000 long-term care workers in Washington, Montana and Alaska, had reported raising and spending $2.5 million as of Friday. That is five times more than it spent in a losing effort in 2020.
Hasegawa said there is no funded opposition campaign, just like the last ballot fight. He and three Republican state lawmakers penned the voters’ pamphlet statement opposing the measure.

Cecil Brockman,. D-Guilford. (Photo: ncleg.net)Barely an hour after N.C. House leaders took steps toward expelling him from the legislature, Guilford County Rep. Cecil Brockman submitted notice of his resignation.
Brockman, 41, was arrested and charged October 8 with multiple felony sex offenses with a minor.
Calls for his resignation came quickly from his own Democratic party as well as Republicans. But Brockman, who was initially hospitalized and is now jailed on a $1.05 million bond, has not publicly commented on the charges.
Late Friday afternoon, Republican N.C. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) announced the formation of a bipartisan “House Select Committee to Investigate Alleged Misconduct and Other Matters Included in Charges Against Representative Cecil Brockman.”
A little over an hour later, House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) announced that Brockman had resigned. Reives lauded the move, which will help shore up Democratic defenses against a veto override in that chamber.
“The allegations against him are serious and made it impossible for him to adequately represent his constituents,” Reives said in a news release.
It’s now up to the Guilford Co. Democratic Party to name a successor to the seat.
Hall said Friday that Brockman’s decision to resign “is the right thing to do for his constituents and for the North Carolina House of Representatives.”

The executive order allows Wyoming’s governor to send emergency funds to charitable organizations, churches. 
The post Gordon declares public welfare emergency in light of SNAP lapse, OK’s $10 million in aid appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon declared a public welfare emergency Friday ahead of SNAP benefits lapsing Saturday amid the federal government shutdown. 
“When people can’t eat, and we’ve got dozens of people being turned away at food banks, and trying to find ways to feed themselves, I would qualify that as an emergency,” Gordon said during a press conference. 
Over 26,000 residents rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy groceries. But while the federal government is closed, the program will go unfunded, leaving thousands of Wyomingites, mostly children, at risk. 
The executive order issued Friday enables the governor’s office to send discretionary emergency funds to charitable organizations and churches to provide food via food banks and pantries. 
State law grants the governor the authority to spend up to $10 million from the legislative stabilization reserve account, also known as the rainy day fund, in the event of a public welfare emergency. 
SNAP benefits are distributed by the Wyoming Department of Family Services on a monthly basis to a reloadable EBT card, which functions like a debit card, for buying eligible food items. 
The state, however, is unable to move emergency funds to those cards “because we do not have a direct agreement with our provider who does the EBT transfers,” DFS Director Korin Schmidt told reporters. 
“So in the absence of that, we had to come up with a different methodology, which is to distribute the food or distribute dollars to food pantries, food banks so that they can purchase and provide food directly to our neighbors,” she said. 
As outlined in the executive order, DFS will provide grant agreements to those organizations “receiving funds and direct that they use reasonable efforts to purchase nutritional, healthy food with the distributed funds.” 
Gordon said officials anticipate spending about $1.4 million a week. 
“And may I add, this is not intended to supplant the excellent work that’s already being done by volunteers, churches and others all around the state,” Gordon said. “This is an adjunct to it, and we are trying to work as closely as we can to make sure that the needs are met.”
Meanwhile, Gordon signed an additional executive order Friday aligned with President Donald Trump’s “Make America Healthy Again” executive order, which directs DFS to begin the process of submitting a waiver request to further restrict what can be purchased with SNAP dollars. It targets foods such as candy and soda.
Earlier this month, the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee voted to adopt similar legislation. That measure must still pass the full Legislature, which convenes in February.

Tony Evers | Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin ExaminerGov. Tony Evers signed a bill Friday that will limit cell phones in schools, making Wisconsin the 36th state in the nation to do so, and a bill that will make it easier for candidates for office to remove themselves from ballots. 
A Wisconsin Policy Forum report from May found that most school districts already restrict student cellphone usage to common areas, though policies vary widely across the state.  
Under the new law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 42, school districts will have until July 2026 to implement a policy that bans cellphones during instructional times. The policy will need to include exceptions for emergencies, for educational purposes and cases involving student health care, individualized education plans (IEPs) or 504 plans (learning environment accommodations).
Evers said in a statement that the decision about whether to sign the bill weighed heavily on him, especially given his belief that “decisions like this should be made at the local level by local school districts”. However, he said he is “deeply concerned” about how cell phone and social media use are affecting students, including their mental health, school outcomes and social skills. 
“Our kids are struggling today, perhaps now more than ever. It’s really tough to be a kid these days, and we know that cellphones can be a major distraction from learning, a source of bullying, and a barrier to our kids’ important work of just being a kid,” Evers said in a statement. “While I wish the Legislature would have taken a different approach with this legislation, I will never stop fighting for Wisconsin’s kids and working to do what’s best for them, which is why I am signing this bill into law today.”
Evers also pointed to widespread support for cellphone ban policies in his statement. 
Pew Research recently found that 74% of U.S. adults support banning middle and high school students from using cellphones during class — an increase from 68% last fall. A Marquette Law School poll found that 89% of voters support banning cellphones during class periods. 
Evers also takes action on 19 other bills
Evers also signed Assembly Bill 35, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 43, to make it easier for candidates to withdraw themselves from a ballot. 
Under the law, candidates for office in Wisconsin will be able to withdraw their candidacy in a general or primary election and not be included on the ballot if they file a sworn statement. 
The change to Wisconsin law was proposed after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was not allowed to remove himself from the presidential ballot in 2024 after he dropped out and endorsed President Donald Trump. State law then said that candidates could only have their names removed if they were dead. 
The new law will allow candidates to remove themselves, but they’ll be responsible for paying the Wisconsin Elections Commission a $1,000 fee. Non-statewide candidates will need to pay $250. 
Under the law, a person could face a Class G felony with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years if they intentionally filed a false statement withdrawing a person’s candidacy. 
Evers also signed Senate Bill 309, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 41, which clarifies statute to say that 911 call centers and dispatchers who transfer a caller to the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline are generally immune from civil liability for any outcomes resulting from the transfer. 
“Our 911 dispatchers play a vital role in the safety and security of our state, but they often don’t have the time or resources available to provide the response necessary for somebody experiencing a mental health crisis,” Evers said. “By offering much-needed protection to 911 dispatchers who transfer calls to the 988 Lifeline, this bill allows for a better and safer crisis response by ensuring crisis calls go to the service providers who are trained to provide appropriate care and resources to those who need it most.”
The law specifies that the immunity doesn’t apply if an injury is the result of an act or omission that constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct by the dispatcher. 
Another bill signed by Evers, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 46, seeks to address the reckless driving issue in Wisconsin by allowing local governments to implement ordinances that will allow officers to immediately impound a vehicle used to drive recklessly and retain the vehicle until all outstanding fees, fines and forfeitures are paid.
Evers said in a statement that the law will “hold bad actors accountable” and help keep roads and communities safe.
“Whether it’s distracted driving, speeding, or erratic and aggressive behaviors, reckless driving puts our kids, families, and communities in harm’s way,” Evers said. “Tackling reckless driving has been a bipartisan goal in recent years, and I’m glad to see this trend has continued this session.” 
Evers also vetoed several bills. 

AB 5, which would have required school districts respond to material inspections requests within 14 days
AB 39, which would have required state employees to work in person for 80% of their week, 
A handful of bills — AB 162, AB 168 and AB 169 — that would have made changes to unemployment and workforce development programs. 
SB 25, which would have prohibited a court from allowing a complaint to be filed in a John Doe proceeding against a police officer who is involved in a shooting if the district attorney determines there is no basis to prosecute the officer. 
SB 184, which would have barred local governments from implementing restrictions on a cars and vehicles based on its energy source

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma officials said late Friday that a vote will be held Monday to give $1 million per week to Oklahoma’s food banks during the federal government shutdown, a fraction of what is needed.
Two federal judges ordered Friday that the Trump administration must continue providing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as food stamps. The benefits are set to be cut off nationwide Saturday because of the federal government shutdown, affecting over 680,000 Oklahomans. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said in a joint statement that the funding will be provided from the state emergency fund, which is currently at $7.8 million, for up to seven weeks and will prioritize support for the most vulnerable SNAP recipients. The plan is contingent on a lack of federal funding for SNAP during the shutdown, according to a news release. 
It was not immediately clear Friday how this plan would be affected by the orders from federal judges or how the funding would be divided between Oklahoma’s food banks. 
The vote will be held 5 p.m. Monday at a Contingency Review Board meeting. Stitt, Hilbert and Paxton are the only voting members on the board. 
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
“This targeted emergency support, alongside the tireless work of our local food banks, will provide weekly food provisions to elderly, disabled, and child SNAP recipients across our 77 counties during periods in which SNAP federal funding is unavailable,” Stitt, Hilbert and Paxton said in the joint statement. “We encourage every business and nonprofit in the state to join us and be a neighbor to those in need during this time of uncertainty.
They asked Oklahoma’s businesses and nonprofits to contribute to food banks either financially or through lending their workforce. 
House and Senate Democrats and members of the legislative Black caucus on Friday morning called for a special session to use Oklahoma’s savings to fund SNAP during the shutdown. Oklahoma’s “rainy day fund” currently sits at more than $1.3 billion, but its uses are limited by state law. 
Stacy Dykstra, CEO of the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, which serves 53 counties in central and western Oklahoma, said it will cost the group $5.5 million per month to double its efforts. It will also cost the Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma, which serves the rest of the state, the same amount to double their efforts. 
She said on Wednesday that food banks only provide one meal for every nine that SNAP provides. 
SNAP costs over $100 million per month in Oklahoma, according to a lawmaker. 
“Funding from the State of Oklahoma is extremely helpful as the Regional Food Bank for Oklahoma works to be as deliberate as possible to find every food resource we can and distribute it to our network in an intentional manner,” Dykstra said in a statement. “This amount represents only a fraction of what will be required; however, it will provide critical support allowing us to begin getting meals to the most vulnerable Oklahomans.” 
Jeff Marlow, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma, said in a statement that while the funding will help reach some Oklahomans affected by the freeze in SNAP funding, a long-term solution will require immediate federal action to restore full support for the food assistance program.

As gridlock in Congress continues over the end of expanded health insurance subsidies, thousands of Vermonters will begin to confront an impossible choice about what to do in 2026: pay more or go without health insurance.

When the window to buy 2026 plans on Vermont Health Connect opens on Saturday, nearly 30,000 Vermonters will face what for many is an impossible choice: pay double or triple what they have been paying for their health insurance or go without.
Meanwhile, the federal government remains shuttered and Congress is gridlocked over extending the current subsidies that have made this insurance more accessible.
For Allison Mindel and her family, there is no real choice.

Since February, her 17-year-old son, Lei DeGroot, has been in intensive treatment at University of Vermont Medical Center for acute myeloid leukemia.
AML is a brutal cancer. It requires rounds of intense chemotherapy. It starts in the bone marrow and moves to the blood, which gives the cancerous cells a highway to spread throughout the body. 
Over the past seven months, Lei has spent a total of 174 days in the hospital. Mindel and her husband Matthew DeGroot split up the weeks, dividing time between their home in Worcester and UVM Medical Center’s inpatient rooms. In total, Lei has gone through five rounds of treatment,  cycling through one week of the system-blasting therapy, followed by three to four weeks of recovery, his immune system made raw and vulnerable to infection.
Two weeks ago, Lei was officially declared cancer-free. Last week, his central line for treatment was removed. The next day, he was able to go back to school in person.
On Friday, Mindel, her husband, and two of their children joined Sen. Peter Welch, Vermont hospital leaders and other families hit by the high cost of care in a press conference to advocate for the extension of the federal subsidies.
Mindel estimates that her son’s care cost between $1.5 million and $2 million. With the insurance her family of five has bought from Vermont Health Connect, she estimates they will end up paying $19,192 for the year: the $1,066 monthly premium for their top-tier MVP Gold plan, plus the $6,400 maximum deductible.
“When you’re [in the hospital] you see all the other people with all the other stories, and you realize, we are so grateful that we didn’t have to worry about our insurance coverage, and that it covered things.” Mindel told VTDigger. “There were so many other kinds of nightmare scenarios to worry about.”
Now, she is confronting a new nightmare as she weighs the costs of next year’s insurance. This coming year, without the enhanced subsidies for marketplace health insurance, the premium for the same MVP Gold plan will cost $3,386.47 a month — an annual total over $40,600.

Mindell runs her own consulting business, and her husband had worked for a small lobbying firm that didn’t provide its employees with insurance before he was laid off in July. He’s seeking a new job, but they are not optimistic he will find one that offers insurance for a full family anytime soon.
They can’t imagine going without health insurance. Her son will continue to need monthly blood tests and followup appointments, bone marrow biopsies, and expensive prescription drugs to manage and monitor his health.
“The care and the expenses don’t end,” Mindel said. 
Expanding affordability
The tax credits that made Mindel’s insurance — and the care it paid for it—affordable have only been available for a few years. They are on track to sunset soon, on Dec. 31, 2025. 
The 2010 Affordable Care Act, or ACA, laid the regulatory foundation for Vermont Health Connect, as well as the special marketplaces created by other states and the federal government for people to buy commercial insurance. The law also put in place a system of tax credits that have subsidized purchasing insurance plans for households making between 138% and 400% of the federal poverty level. (Anyone below that income level is eligible for Vermont’s Medicaid insurance program). 
In 2021, the American Rescue Plan expanded those tax credits, making ACA marketplace insurance plans newly affordable for millions of Americans, including thousands of Vermonters.
These “enhanced tax credits” became available to households earning more than 400% of the federal poverty line. The law capped the cost of premiums purchased by individuals and families on the marketplaces at 8.5% of a household’s income. Subsidies were also increased for many individuals already receiving credits, making health insurance premiums very low cost, or effectively free, for those households at the lowest income levels. 
In 2015, soon after Vermont Health Connect opened, 22,500 people on the marketplace received tax credits, according to an analysis by the Montpelier-based research group Public Assets Institute. Today, with the enhanced credits, that number is closer to 27,000. The amount each recipient receives in credits has jumped significantly in that decade as well: in 2015 a Vermonter’s average credit was $3,300. Today, that’s $11,400 in support, the Public Assets Institute found.
Without these expanded subsidies in the future, households will experience steeper costs in two different ways. Households making more than 400% of the federal poverty line will lose the subsidies entirely, and those under that income threshold, who will still receive subsidies, will see the amount of assistance shrink. 
Nationally, subsidized enrollees on the marketplace are seeing an average increase in their monthly premiums of about 114%, estimates the health news outlet KFF. 
In Vermont, the increase is even more stark. Because Vermont has some of the highest insurance premiums in the country, the state stands out as one of the states in the country poised to lose some of the most federal assistance — nearly $65 million, a 2024 report to the legislature found. Premiums for some families could increase nearly 300%. 
Vermont’s Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher outlined some examples of just what this means for families in the state during a mid-October legislative committee meeting. 
He said a family of three, for instance, earning $86,000 a year — 323% above the federal poverty level, would have paid $121 with the enhanced tax credits in 2025 for a standard Gold Plan through MVP and $330 for one from Blue Cross Blue Shield VT. This coming year, those same plans will cost $291 or $856, respectively.
Or, consider Cameron Chapman, a freelance writer and editor in Hardwick. 
In 2025, Chapman paid a little less than $500 a month for a Gold Plan through MVP, she told VTDigger. Next year, without the subsidies, the cost will increase to $1,135 a month for the same plan — more than she pays each month for housing.
Chapman is not planning on purchasing insurance at all next year and instead intends to put money aside each month and “keep (her) fingers crossed,” she said.  
At 41, she knows it’s a gamble, but one, for now, she is going to take. She plans to stop smoking this winter, eat more vegetables and get more exercise in an effort to keep her own healthcare costs down.
Her most expensive health care year, she says, was in 2022, when she was in and out of doctors’ offices trying to get a diagnosis for an ongoing issue. After 28 visits and nearly nine months of diagnostics, she estimates her care would have cost between $18,000 and $20,000 if she needed to pay out of pocket. That’s the same amount, she calculates, as what she would need to pay in 2026, counting $13,620 a year just in monthly insurance premiums, plus the plans’ $5,000 deductible. 
“I think for me, the biggest piece is not paying out money that I’m never going to see,” Chapman said. “I might as well take the money that I’ve been paying, put it into savings every month.”

‘A death spiral’
Insurers and policymakers expect that thousands of Vermonts will follow Chapman in her choice to forgo health insurance altogether. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has estimated that 3,017 members will drop their marketplace plans, while MVP (which operates in Vermont and New York state) estimates it will lose 22,052 members with the end of the enhanced tax credits.
That kind of shift not only hurts the individuals who go without insurance, but it impacts everyone else in the insurance pool, Fisher, the state consumer advocate, explained to VTDigger. The people who remain insured are generally those who cannot do without insurance and are less willing to take the gamble— individuals like Alison Mindel and her family.
“Health insurance is about spreading risk; it’s about all of us [being] in the same boat and only by all of us being in the same boat, that those of us who have real health care needs have a fighting chance of paying for it,” Fisher said. 
When fewer healthy people buy health insurance, insurers have to raise premiums to cover the costs of those remaining in the insurance pool. That’s because healthy people, generally, require less care and pay more money to the insurer than the insurer pays out for their health care. When insurers raise prices, more healthy people drop out. Policymakers literally call this a “death spiral.”
So, in addition to the loss of the expanded subsidies, people who buy their insurance on the marketplace are facing higher premiums that aim to accommodate this downward trend in enrollment. Nationwide, KFF, the health news outlet, calculates that —tax credits aside — the true cost of premiums across the country is increasing 26% in 2026.
In Vermont, for individuals and families, Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT plans will increase by 9.6%, while MVP’s will go up only 1.3%. Both increases are far less than what both insurers had initially requested from the state’s health care regulator. The difference in that increase is part of why MVP plans cost so much less than those from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which has struggled with solvency, on Vermont Health Connect.
When people lose or forgo insurance, hospitals suffer too, Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told lawmakers at the mid-October meeting. People will still face healthcare emergencies regardless of whether or not they have insurance. When they do, they show up in a hospital’s emergency room. When hospitals provide care to these patients, most cannot afford the entirety of an out-of-pocket bill. So, when patients they treat don’t have insurance, hospitals are more likely to not receive payment at all. 
For Vermont’s already precarious hospitals, the loss of that revenue could be catastrophic. UVM Health, though a network of some of the state’s healthiest hospitals when it comes to revenue and cash reserves, could stand to lose up to $80 million in revenue with the end of these subsidies, estimated interim CEO Steve Leffler during Friday’s press conference with Sen. Welch.
“It’s a difficult cycle that we’re really hoping to avoid,” said Addie Strumolo, the deputy commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, which oversees Vermont Health Connect. “But, that is a real concern when you have affordability challenges, like the ones we’re anticipating for open enrollment, or other obstacles to being able to remain in coverage.”

Enrolling in a precarious marketplace
Strumolo’s team is trying to help people navigate this steep change in affordability ahead of, and during, the open enrollment period on Vermont’s marketplace.
Open enrollment runs, as it does every year, from Nov. 1 through Jan 15. But to secure coverage that begins on Jan. 1, 2026, individuals need to buy their plans by Dec. 15. 
Congress may approve a measure before the end of the year to extend the enhanced tax credits for 2026 health insurance plans. Strumolo said her department is ready to act quickly to get those credits to people who have already signed up for plans.
The federal government may also enact those measures later in 2026. If that happens, the state has the power to authorize a special enrollment period, she said. 
For now, the department has a plan comparison tool up and running. The interactive webpage allows people to see what the costs of various plans will be in 2026, incorporating whatever subsidies they may still be eligible to receive. 
“We think it’s really important for people to have coverage,” she said, even if that coverage is at a lower coverage tier “and so I think just knowing that there are options (is important).”
Fisher similarly encourages people to explore their options and shop around for one that fits their budgets. “It’s good for Vermont and good for Vermonters to have coverage, and I am afraid that many Vermonters are in plans they can’t afford,” he said. 
“I worry that many Vermonters will be forced into an economic choice or financing choice when we really want them to be making a healthcare access choice,” he said.
Alison Mindel is going into 2026 making a healthcare choice for her family, and hoping the financial details work out somehow. Knowing that the ongoing care for her son is going to continue to be costly, she and her husband intend to keep buying the Gold MVP plan, just without the enhanced premium tax credits. It will cost more than their mortgage.
“I don’t know how we’re going to manage paying for this going forward,” she said. “But, at the same time, I didn’t know how we were going to get through the past year either.”

A Rhode Island federal judge ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) must use available contingency funds to cover food stamp funding while the lingering government shutdown leaves the program unsubsidized.
The federal government needs to submit a report by noon on Monday to the court, and explain how it will at least partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps, for the month of November. The agency must tap into $6 billion worth of contingency funding. 
“There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” Chief Judge John J. McConnell, Jr. said during a Friday hearing held over Zoom and livestreamed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.   
USDA also needs to explain if it will additionally cover the benefits by using Section 32 funding — an appropriated but flexible USDA fund created in 1935 that has been used to keep another food security program — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) — afloat during the shutdown. The fund had over $23 billion in it as of Oct. 8, according to court documents.  
“It’s clear that when compared to the millions of people that will go without funds for food, versus the agency’s desire not to use contingency funds in case there’s a hurricane need — the balances of those equities clearly goes on the side of ensuring that people are fed,” McConnell said. 
A need for haste prompted the virtual hearing Friday for the case, which was filed in the court by a 20-plaintiff coalition led by the Rhode Island State Council of Churches. 
“Its unusual in a [temporary restraining order] that we do hearings publicly,” McConnell said, but added that the expected shutoff of food stamps on Saturday gave a valid reason for broadcasting a hearing that would normally happen behind closed doors.    
The named plaintiffs include the cities of Providence, Central Falls, Central Falls, Pawtucket, plus national groups and cities such as Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Durham, North Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The East Bay Community Action Program, United Way Of Rhode Island, and Amos House, are also plaintiffs. The legal team for the plaintiffs included attorneys from DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens in Providence and Democracy Forward, a national group.

This just in from Boston
McConnell’s ruling came almost simultaneously with a similar outcome in a case in Massachusetts’ federal court. Near the end of the approximately hourlong virtual hearing, McConnell interrupted his own comments to remark that Judge Indira Talwani had just ruled on a case brought earlier this week by a coalition of states’ attorneys general, which also sought to reinstate SNAP funding, which is set to expire Saturday, Nov. 1, as it has not been allocated any emergency funding during the shutdown.  
Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders

“I’m sure you’re all anxious to read Judge Talwani’s opinion,” McConnell said before he granted his own temporary restraining order on the government agency’s actions.
Like McConnell, Talwani ruled that the agency must submit by Monday whether it “will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.” If so, the USDA also needs to submit a timeline for its plan, and whether the SNAP money will come from contingency funds or other sources.  
McConnell said he was already familiar with the Massachusetts case assigned to Talwani. So, at the beginning of the hearing, he first gave the floor to Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General Tyler Becker, who represented the feds. A representative for the USDA attended part of the hearing but did not speak during her time on camera.
Becker argued for the nonexistence of SNAP without funding. That which is unfunded cannot exist, Becker proposed, because SNAP’s funding is what constitutes the program — therefore, a nonexistent program cannot receive contingency funding. 
“The government may not provide those benefits because there is not a funding allocation, an appropriation for those benefits, as a result of the current shutdown in the government,” Becker said. “It would be an extreme remedy at this point to force SNAP, the government, to rely on a contingency fund.”
“Those are to maintain program operations when there is a program,” Becker said. “There is no program.”
The argument did not persuade McConnell, who pointed out that a government shutdown does not automatically make a program defunct. This narrative has played out before during previous shutdowns, the judge recounted, and to different results.   
“SNAP benefits have never, until now, been terminated,” McConnell said. “The United States has, in fact, admitted that the contingency funds are appropriately used during a shutdown, and that occurred in 2019.”
Like the vast majority of cases involving President Donald Trump’s funding mandates, there was much talk of the “arbitrary and capricious” from both parties — the legal labels frequently invoked in anti-Trump litigation to indicate the administration’s non-specfiic or wide-ranging rationale for its funding directives. The plaintiffs’ legal team further argued that the federal government, in rejecting the use of contingency funding to keep SNAP afloat, ignored the very purpose for which those contingency funds had been created. 
Michael Torcello, a senior staff attorney with Democracy Forward, said the statute which authorizes SNAP includes “mandatory language that Congress uses when it intends to create a duty.”
“Congress foresaw that there might be an emergency, and it designated specific funds to be used in that situation,” Torcello said. “So I think that completely undermines the government’s position that there’s no funds at all that we could use. I think Congress very, very clearly and very directly contemplated that when there is a contingency or an emergency, ‘Here’s $6 billion that is to be used for this vital program.’” 
USDA’s decision not to use the contingency money, Becker argued, was within the range of discretion allowed the agency, especially since the current lack of funding is not an emergency proper.
“This shutdown is not an emergency,” Becker said. “This crisis, to the extent it is a crisis or an emergency at all, has been created by Congress.”
“It is something that could be, by Congress reopening the government tomorrow, could be resolved,” Becker added. “There is no mandate that the SNAP program actually be funded on Nov.1. …The government cannot just add funding when no program exists.”
Torcello offered a retort later in the hearing: “Counsel’s contention that the shutdown is not an emergency, although I think counsel also said that this is a crisis. So their position is a bit inconsistent on this.”
But Becker urged the court to leave the matter to Congress, as only an appropriation can restart SNAP issuance. Forcing USDA to issue November benefits with contingency or Section 32 money would misallocate carryover balances and “actually cause immense harm to the SNAP system itself.” The use of Section 32 money could also affect WIC’s shutdown funding. 
“I don’t think we’re even transferring into WIC for next month at this point, because there’s just a lot of considerations that go into this,” Becker said.

Focus on food driving cities’ resources
The plaintiffs’ legal team, meanwhile, was concerned about the harm that would come from the cessation of SNAP benefits. Approximately a quarter of the population of Central Falls receives SNAP benefits, said Democracy Forward Senior Counsel Jyoti Jasrasaria. She mentioned a food drive being held Saturday to help mitigate the shutdown’s effect on food stamps.  
“Doing that is requiring [the city] to divert resources and staff directly from the police department, the Department of Public Works and the office of constituent services, and it will continue to do things like that,” Jasrasaria said.  
Another portion of the plaintiffs’ argument involved USDA’s move to end existing work-requirement waivers for able-bodied adults without dependents. Congress’ overhaul of SNAP eligibility in July still did not OK retroactive cancellation, the attorneys argued, but that’s what an Oct. 3 memo by USDA tried to do.  
The Justice Department countered that no irreparable harm would come from the new waiver rules, because no recipients would see a change in benefits until March 1, 2026.
“The failure to honor existing waivers is contrary to law,” McConnell ruled from the bench. His ruling orders USDA to keep those waivers in place through their stated end dates while the case proceeds.
Attorney Kevin Love Hubbard appeared on behalf of DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens — a stark change from July, when Hubbard still worked in  the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Division and defended the feds in court. Whether benefits expire in March or not does not make the time in-between any less important, Hubbard argued, as the time spent finding a job to satisfy the lack of a waiver cannot be returned. 
“Even if people are able to find jobs by March,” Hubbard said. “It eliminates their ability to use that time later on.”
“Time is our enemy here on so many levels,” McConnell said at one point.
Earlier in the hearing, he gave a “shoutout” to the courthouse staff who had stayed on with him to work on the case, which was filed less than a day before the hearing began.  
“I have two very, very tired law clerks, so I just want to publicly thank them,” McConnell said.

The group considered several kinds of mergers that would reduce costs across the state, including for school districts that provide families choice when there are public schools in neighboring districts.

Protect Vermont’s school choice system. That was the loud and clear message to the Vermont school redistricting task force during its Oct. 22 public forum at Rutland High School.
But some task force members see putting guardrails around school choice as one way to reduce costs for public education across the state.
At the same forum in Rutland, task force members also heard from Barstow school district board chair Debbie Singiser, who testified about the impact of school choice on her community. State taxpayers were “increasingly funding education for students with limited or only temporary ties to our community,” she told them.

Indeed, in the past five years, half of the 122 students who received public funding to attend private schools through Barstow Unified Union School District did not graduate from Barstow Memorial School’s 8th grade. And nearly half of the students using the tuition system from Barstow’s district in the past five years attended Killington Mountain School, a ski academy.
The data, compiled by task force members, supports Singiser’s comments at the public forum suggesting families are “moving into our school district to take advantage of that school choice and the tuition for high school.” That raises costs of taxpayers statewide, task force members argued.
“None of this is technically illegal. I mean, it’s just, is this what we want for our public school system?” Singiser said in an interview earlier this year. “We’re talking about how public education is getting expensive, and our property taxpayers are struggling, and when I look at that happening, I feel like we should fix that problem.”
During the task force’s Tuesday meeting, David Wolk, Gov. Phil Scott’s appointee to the task force, said it “shocked” him when he saw the data around tuition out of Barstow. He called it a problem that the Legislature “has got to change.”
“There has to be guardrails. There has to be some way to change this,” Wolk said. “It’s not right.”
As the state’s school redistricting task force continues its work to craft new school district maps, members are taking a microscope to the intricacies of the state’s 119 school districts and 52 supervisory union or supervisory districts, and highlighting some of the inefficiencies in school districts like Barstow.
The 11 members of the body have spent three months analyzing the state’s complex public education system, with one month left to go. The group is tasked with developing no more than three maps of new school boundaries for the Vermont Legislature to consider for the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January.
So far, the task force has three map proposals in development. One creates 13 school districts to emphasize broader access to existing career and technical education opportunities. Another focuses on creating regional comprehensive high schools for underserved (and over-served) regions.
The third seeks to organize merged districts around regional BOCES, or a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, a type of educational governance entity used widely in New York and other states to help school districts collaborate on services such as special education and transportation.
That map, drafted by task force members Jennifer Botzojorns and Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, takes the first stab at highlighting in detail where the state could target mergers and why.
Among other suggestions for mergers is Barstow, which Botzojorns and Holcombe said could be absorbed by the Rutland City School District as a way to control costs.
But time is limited. The task force has only two meetings left before it is required to finalize a report with three maps. Rep. Edye Graning, the co-chair of the task force, on Tuesday called it a “herculean” task for the body.

“I just keep coming back to the time crunch. We don’t have enough time,” Graning said. “We just don’t have the time to do the work … with the quality and level of detail that we would all love to be able to do it in. It makes me sad, because this is a big deal.”
‘Half baked’
At the task force’s meeting on Tuesday, Botzojorn and Holcombe discussed three examples of areas where enrollment and resources were either declining or not being used efficiently, and where the state could look to merge districts.
These different cases were meant to show the kind of detailed analysis needed to determine where specifically to draw district lines in a way that both reduces the cost to taxpayers and increases access to opportunities for students, they said. 
Those merged districts would then be overlayed with cooperative education service areas to allow collaboration on shared expenses like travel and special education.

One example is typified by the state’s capital region, which “has a unique opportunity to coordinate” high schools in Barre, Montpelier and Twinfield, Botzojorn said.
This kind of area has “stranded costs,” where student enrollment was dropping faster than the disparate school districts’ ability to decrease costs. Costs at these school districts remained the same despite enrollment declines, putting financial stress on the overall system.
Merging districts could also improve access and save costs in districts like the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union. There, public school funds are being used to pay tuition for private schools in choice systems, siphoning tax dollars spent by the state away from the public school, Holcombe and Botzojorn argued. 
In that supervisory union, the Winhall School District, a non-operating district, could be merged into the neighboring Taconic and Green School District to bolster overall enrollment and per-pupil-spending.
And in their third example, Holcombe and Botzojorn discussed areas with “sparsity loss,” where schools have become so small they may be considering closure. The proposal pointed to towns like Danville, Windham, West River, Twin Valley, Readsboro, Stamford and Halifax as examples. Merging in these districts would strengthen the isolated public schools, so they don’t close and potentially create regions with public school deserts.
Task force members on Tuesday also looked again at a map first proposed by Wolk and Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caldeonia, earlier this month. That map would create 13 school districts that closely mirror the state’s 15 career and technical education regions, each identified by the technical education center that anchors it.
The proposal aims to expand career and technical education opportunities to students and honor “school choice where it presently exists,” Wolk said.
A revised version tweaked some of the boundaries in existing districts, but little else was changed from the map’s first iteration. District sizes remained lopsided. One district covering Chittenden County and a part of Grand Isle County would have nearly 22,000 students, while the smallest, the River Bend Area District, would have just over 2,000 students.
Another proposal, developed by Holcombe and Jay Badams, would center a new map around comprehensive regional high schools.
By identifying and targeting construction aid at regional high schools, the state could incentivize neighboring districts to collaborate on the design and development of new regional high schools and potentially access state construction aid. Shared governance would then ensure communities retain a voice in how schools meet the needs of students, Badams said.
“If we were to designate the areas that we identify as likely sites for comprehensive public high schools, we could give (school districts) their own designation and give them priority in school construction funding and other things,” Badams said.
Badams, like the other presenters, called his proposal “half baked.” The exact number and location of the regional high schools has not yet been finalized. But he noted on Tuesday that the three map proposals shared so far all have elements that could be worked into each other. 
“I think if we could weave them together a little better, we might be on to something that can be actionable,” he said
All three proposals, however, have yet to address how new districts would be governed. Specifically, which district governance model would be used, supervisory districts or supervisory unions.
Both models provide back office functions such as accounting and payroll and may oversee the provision of special education services and curriculum coordination. But the two systems differ in their structure. Supervisory unions are made up of school districts that each have their own board of directors, while supervisory districts have only one governing board.
Badams called governance the task force’s stumbling block. “We have three maps on the table right now that don’t really get to the whole idea of governance in a way that was contemplated” by the legislature, he said.
“We’re tinkering,” he said. “We’re trying to make an omelette without breaking a single egg.”
The task force will continue to flesh out its proposals for their Nov. 10 meeting. Members are expected to vote on which maps to recommend to the legislature at its final meeting next month.
“None of us wants to upset anyone,” Graning said, “and at the same time, that’s what we’ve been asked to do, is to make recommendations.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A Pulaski County judge ordered House District 70’s special election moved to March 3, 2026, rejecting arguments from the state that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has complete discretion over special election dates.
On Oct. 10, Sanders called a special election for June 9, 2026, to replace former Republican Rep. Carlton Wing, who resigned on Sept. 30 to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.

HD70 RULING-103125 
In a lawsuit filed Oct. 21, the Democratic Party of Arkansas and four District 70 voters said Sanders violated the state’s special election laws when she scheduled the special general election for that date. They called it “taxation without representation” as it would prevent the district from having House representation during the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session, set to start in April.
The petitioners asked for the special election to be moved to March 3, which Sanders had set as the special primary, via a writ of mandamus. A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government official to perform a duty they are already legally required to do.
Under Arkansas law, the governor is required to schedule a special election date to fill a vacancy within 150 days unless she found it was “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election couldn’t be held within 150 days, it had to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
In Friday’s 18-page ruling granting the writ, Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson was not swayed by arguments from Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office that the governor has “complete discretion on how and when to set a special election — whether it is before or after the expiration of 150 days following a legislative vacancy.”
Johnson said that, while the governor was granted discretion to determine whether holding a special election within 150 days of a vacancy was “impracticable or unduly burdensome,” the exception required her to then schedule it on the “earliest practicable” date — not the “most practicable.”
And while “someone has to decide what date after the 150-day vacancy period is ‘as soon as practicable’ thereafter,” Johnson wrote, that person was not Sanders.
“If that were true, then it would render the statutory scheme meaningless. In other words, if the Governor has complete discretion over when to hold a special election — whether before or after the 150-day mark — then there would be no reason to have a 150-day limitation at all,” Johnson wrote.
Arkansas judge says ruling to come this week on second special election lawsuit

If the governor sets the date after the 150-day mark, the law takes away any discretion Sanders would otherwise have, Johnson wrote. After that point the special election date should depend on the ability of the locality to “well and capably accomplish the election.”
Johnson was also “not convinced” by Griffin’s office that state laws regarding absentee voting made the March 3 date proposed by the petitioners impracticable. He pointed to testimony from Pulaski County Circuit Clerk Terri Hollingsworth and other Pulaski County election officials, who stated they had successfully conducted a special election for House District 34 on nearly identical dates as those proposed by the petitioners.
“I am disappointed in the ruling and will expeditiously appeal the decision,” Griffin said in a text message via his spokesperson.

Johnson’s ruling is the second judicial decision to push back on Sanders’ recent special election proclamations. Another Pulaski County judge ruled against Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester earlier this month after a voter in Senate District 26 filed a lawsuit over an identical special election schedule, alleging that it violated state law and deprived the district’s voters of representation during the 2026 fiscal session.
However, that ruling did not go as far as Johnson’s did, only ordering Sanders to change the special election dates so it would occur prior to the April fiscal session.
‘Far-reaching ramifications’: Judge says special election dates violate constitutional rights

When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Sanders gave the same statement as was given after the SD26 ruling.
“Governor Sanders is confident that on appeal, the law clearly giving the Governor the authority to set special elections will be upheld and ultimately save taxpayer dollars and ensure the election is free, fair, and secure,” spokesperson Sam Dubke wrote in a text message.
DPA Chair Marcus Jones called the ruling a victory for HD70’s 30,000 residents.
“The time has come for Governor Sanders to move up the Special Election dates and give the hardworking taxpayers of North Little Rock and Sherwood the representation they deserve,” Jones wrote in an emailed statement provided to the Advocate. “The Democratic Party of Arkansas stands with Arkansans from across the political spectrum to oppose taxation without representation. Mark our words: We won’t stop fighting for every Arkansan to have a say in our state budget.”
Griffin’s office is appealing the SD26 ruling to the Arkansas Supreme Court as well, as is the plaintiff, who is asking the court to rule the 150-day exception unconstitutional, among other things.

Fort Wayne City Clerk Lana Keesling criticized the Allen County Democratic Party’s motivations in an open letter that revealed she plans to leave her city position soon — but not yet.
She ascended to the state GOP’s top job in February, becoming the party’s fourth chair in two years.

County Democratic Party Chair Chad Wierzbinski said that, at that point, it was expected that Keesling “would follow the precedent established by previous Indiana Republican Party chairs who also served as elected officials, by resigning her elected position and releasing taxpayers from the burden of subsidizing a high-level political official.”
Kessling pushed back.
“The Allen County Democrats are simply trying to divert attention from their party’s abysmal track record in our city, state and nation,” she wrote in a missive addressed to Fort Wayne residents, which she shared with the Capital Chronicle.

County Dems point to redistricting and roles’ demands
Wierzbinski cited an impending special legislative session — called primarily for Indiana lawmakers to redraw the state’s two blue congressional districts red — as the impetus for a Friday news conference.
“I felt it was important to call this press conference today to shed light on how … Keesling is playing a role in disenfranchising voters,” Wierzbinski said, according to a news release.
The criticism went beyond Keesling’s support for early redistricting.
He commended her for visiting all 92 counties in less than a year as party chair, but said it’s “not a task befitting of a local city clerk.”
“The citizens of Fort Wayne deserve a full-time city clerk whose attention is singularly focused on the city, not someone spending her time at political events across the state while maintaining taxpayer-funded employment,” Wierzbinski said.
State GOP leader says commitment to city ‘has not wavered’
Keesling’s letter indicated she’s been planning for her departure since the month she was named GOP chair.
“I will continue serving my community, finishing projects in the office, and moving the office forward,” the note concluded. “Since February we have been working on a transition plan, and I look forward to sharing that plan soon.
Keesling began, however, by calling it an “honor and a privilege” to have worked as clerk for about a decade.
In 2015, she became the first Republican city clerk of Fort Wayne since 1971. She also previously served as vice chair of the Allen County Republican Party and treasurer of the 3rd District Republican Congressional Committee.

“During my time in office, my staff and I have transformed the City Clerk’s Office to become more efficient, effective and transparent along with being an office our community can be proud of,” the letter continued.
She highlighted the modernization of downtown Fort Wayne’s parking system — parking meters that accept credit cards, mobile app payment options and more accessible parking for the disabled — as “one of the accomplishments I am most proud of.” Those changes were made without the use of taxpayer dollars, according to the letter.
Keesling — who has served on a variety of boards for transportation, civil rights and disabled advocacy groups — said she was “humbled by the opportunity to serve Hoosiers in a different capacity” when Gov. Mike Braun asked her to lead the Indiana GOP.
“My commitment to the residents of Fort Wayne has not wavered,” she wrote. “My office and I continue to provide the highest level of service to our community each and every day, and I could not be prouder of the dedication and accomplishments of my team over the past 10 years.”

,California,2025-10-31 20:52:00+00:00,CalMatters,Head Start programs begin closing in California due to shutdown,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/10/california-head-start/,"As funding deadlines approach, one Head Start program has closed and three others are about to. More closures are expected in the coming weeks.","In summary
As funding deadlines approach, one Head Start program has closed and three others are about to. More closures are expected in the coming weeks. 


One California Head Start program has closed and three others face imminent closure due to the federal government shutdown, affecting about 1,000 very-low-income children and 270 teachers. 
The closures would leave families scrambling for child care and teachers without income. The longer the shutdown drags on, the more programs are at risk of shuttering. 
“Losing a Head Start program has detrimental effects not just on children and families, but also has immense ripple effects on the community,” said Melanee Cottrill, executive director of Head Start California. “Head Start is far more than a safe place for children to learn and grow — it’s a community hub … The negative effect on regional employment and the local economy would be felt many times over.” 
A Head Start program in Santa Cruz County has already closed, upending child care arrangements for hundreds of families.
Encompass Community Services, a Santa Cruz nonprofit, was forced to close all 11 of its Head Start centers on Thursday because no one at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was available to process the group’s Nov. 1 grant renewal or send money.
“Head Start is part of the fabric of this community,” said Elaine Johnson, chair of the Encompass board. “This is about babies, children, and families not having access to basic needs.”
The centers, mostly clustered in the farmlands around Watsonville, serve some of the lowest-income families in the region. About 300 children are enrolled in its program.
3,000 children at risk 
Three more Head Start programs in California — in Los Angeles, the Central Valley and the far northern part of the state — also have Nov. 1 grant deadlines and face imminent closure. Another four programs with Dec. 1 deadlines would be the next to shutter if the government shutdown continues. 
In all, more than 3,000 children and hundreds of teachers at those eight centers would be affected within the next month if Congress fails to adopt a budget.
Nationwide, about 134 programs serving 65,000 children face closure this week due to the shutdown — with Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Missouri having the highest numbers of children affected, according to the National Head Start Association. Even if Congress agrees to fund the federal government this week, re-opening would not happen immediately: It could take up to six weeks for the money to reach individual Head Start centers.
Popular and effective
Founded in the mid-1960s, Head Start is a free child care program providing meals and a play-based academic curriculum for children from birth through age 5. Families can get prenatal visits, referrals for medical and dental care, housing and job assistance and other services. 
To qualify, families must earn below the federal poverty level — $26,650 a year for a family of three. In California, that bar is very difficult to meet due to the higher minimum wage. Last year, the state’s Head Start centers enrolled about 83,000 children at 1,835 centers.
Head Start, created to give low-income families a boost, has largely been successful: Alumni have higher graduation rates, higher college-going rates and are less likely to live in poverty as adults, one study found.
It’s also very popular. When President Donald Trump threatened to cut the entire program this past spring, Head Start supporters flooded Congress with urgent pleas to save it from the budget axe. They succeeded, although other government cuts have left a deep impact on the organization and its families.
Potential cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid would have an immediate impact on Head Start families, while other recent cuts have already hampered Head Start’s day-to-day operations, Cottrill said.
The U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which oversees Head Start., closed half of its regional offices in April, leading to long delays in processing paperwork. For Head Start centers, that’s meant months-long holdups for routine purchases such as dishwashers, Cottrill said, along with delays related to minor program changes.
Back-up plans
In Santa Cruz, Encompass was able to partner with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District in Watsonville to temporarily provide child care to most of the families enrolled in Head Start, starting next week. But the past few months of budget uncertainty have been nerve-wracking, Kim Morrisson, interim executive director, said.
The organization has been in talks with a slew of state and local agencies to come up with back-up plans for funding the $9-million-a-year program..
“We’re trying to roll with the punches and just focus on serving our families,” Morrison said. “Head Start is a big, national program. We just can’t imagine a world where it doesn’t exist.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/120924_RalphHawleyHeadStart_FM_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)North Carolinians who plan to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace are set to see significant cost hikes as the open enrollment period begins Nov. 1.
That increase could soon be twofold. Providers are raising premiums by an average of 28.6% in North Carolina, and the tax credits that significantly lower costs for many enrollees are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress decides to extend them.
Almost 1 million North Carolinians are enrolled in the ACA, which provides federally-approved private health care plans to those without employer-sponsored insurance.
Around one-third (34%) of uninsured North Carolinians are eligible for Medicaid or public coverage, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data. And more than a quarter (28%) are eligible for tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year.
Individual rates in North Carolina will increase between 16.88% and 36.4% in 2026, Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said in a statement Wednesday. Small group rates will increase between 12.66% and 17.5%.



Those hikes exceed national trends: the average proposed premium increase is 20%, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. That’s the highest rate change requested by providers since 2018, fueled by higher costs of labor, drugs and the uncertain future of tax credits.
“Increased costs in health care as well as the expiration of federal subsidies result in premiums going up for many on the individual market,” Causey said. “It’s more important than ever to begin researching your health insurance options early.”
A spokesperson for the NC Department of Insurance did not respond to inquiries about whether the department was seeing an increase in calls or concerns about rates ahead of open enrollment.
How politics have put ACA tax credits in peril
Providers have raised 2026 rates in part because of the looming expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. Those tax credits,established in 2021, were later extended through the end of this year. They have led to a massive expansion of the ACA marketplace, and drive down costs for many enrollees.
Earlier this year, Congressional Republicans voted to allow the tax credits to sunset on schedule, d saying they’re too costly to extend.
Congressional Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers, are using the budget continuation bill as leverage to convince Republican lawmakers to change their minds. In the Senate, Democrats are using parliamentary rules to block the passage of the spending bill unless it contains a provision to extend the ACA credits again.
So far, Republicans have refused to negotiate that issue. That’s what caused the current federal government shutdown standoff that has now dragged on for a month.
The standoff has fueled political battles around the country, including in North Carolina.
In a news conference Thursday, state Sen. Gale Adcock (D-Wake) said the majority party was “shutting down the government instead of fixing the health care crisis they created.”
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has called the tax credits “subsidizing bad policy.” He said GOP lawmakers “believe in the private sector and the free market and individual providers.”

Executives at the network said the change will make way for more news coverage throughout the day. 
The last broadcast of “Mississippi Edition” was Friday morning, according to a statement on MPB’s website. Starting Monday, MPB radio will air news segments at the beginning of every hour from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays.
Anna Neel, MPB’s chief operating officer, said the new approach will allow for more coverage of news as it develops.
“We’re hoping the new format gives reporters more flexibility to tell quality stories throughout the day,” Neel told Mississippi Today. “They’re not going to be as rushed to try to put together a 30-minute package.”
In July, the Republican-controlled Congress approved President Donald Trump’s request to cancel $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit organization that helped fund the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. The corporation shut down when the federal budget year began Oct. 1. 
Mississippi Public Broadcasting is one of over 1,500 locally-owned radio and television stations that lost money. Neel estimated that MPB lost about 15% of its funding with the federal cuts. She said state funding and donors pay for MPB’s locally produced content, including state news coverage.
MPB continues to air emergency weather alerts along with local programming and will change its mix of PBS and NPR programming sometime next year, Neel said Friday.  She said MPB plans to add more local programming in the future.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01164000/Mississippi-Public-Broadcasting-3.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Political analyst Amy Walter views the campaign by President Donald Trump to gerrymander congressional districts as a gamble unlikely to blunt historical precedent and prevent a Democratic takeover of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm election.
“I like to say in midterm elections there are three options if you’re the party in the White House. It’s going to be bad. It’s going to be really bad. Or, it’s going to be catastrophically bad. There is nothing else that is likely,” she told a crowd Thursday at Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.
Walter, publisher of Cook Political Report and a guest on PBS NewsHour, NBC’s Meet the Press, CNN’s Inside Politics and the Fox News Channel, said Trump would be a substantial motivator in terms of Democratic turnout in the midterm scheduled for one year from now. It’s unclear whether Trump could likewise inspire dramatic turnout among GOP voters in November 2026, she said.
“Midterm elections are a referendum on the party in power,” Walter said. “The challenge for a president is to turn out his winning presidential coalition.”
Walter said at this moment it might be possible for Republicans to expand by a half dozen or so the number of seats in the U.S. House through redistricting. Those gains are unlikely to compensate for anticipated losses by other GOP House candidates, she said, but politics of the midterm could be unpredictable.
Walter was interviewed at Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas by Jerry Seib, a journalist with The Wall Street Journal for almost 45 years. He said the unprecedented redistricting battle illustrated what Trump’s advisers expected in the upcoming election cycle.
“That tells you that the White House, Trump-world, is worried,” Seib said.
Walter said a Democratic Party majority in the House or Senate would use committees to challenge Trump’s use of executive power or investigate the president’s actions.
“The president also knows quite well the last time Democrats were in charge while he was there, they impeached him twice,” Walter said.
Trump’s plan for mid-decade redistricting has created political turmoil in Kansas, where Republican leaders of the Legislature want a special session to realign the state’s four congressional districts. The goal would be to pull the re-election rug out from under Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, who serves the Kansas City area.
 
‘Battle for control’
In the U.S. House, Republicans hold the smallest majority since 1931. If Democrats flipped three seats in the midterm, Republicans would lose control of the chamber.
The 53-47 U.S. Senate could change hands if Democrats secured four additional seats, but Walter said that Republican majority appeared to be solid because opportunities for Democrats were limited in 2026. If Democrats failed to grab the Maine Senate seat held by Republican Susan Collins, in a state won by Democrat Kamala Harris, there could be no path for Democrats, she said.
“The battle for control of Congress is something that is very consequential, especially if your party currently has all three branches and it’s a lot easier to get a whole lot done when you don’t have to negotiate with your opposition,” Walter said.
The historical record revealed in 18 of 20 midterms since World War II the party of the sitting president lost an average of 27 seats in the U.S. House during midterm elections.
The two exceptions came after the 2001 terrorist attack under President George W. Bush and amid President Bill Clinton’s impeachment controversy in 1998.
In those rare midterm elections, Bush and Clinton had robust approval ratings of at least 60%. Recent polling indicated 43% of Americans approved of Trump’s performance in the second term. That’s the statistical territory Trump occupied in the 2018 midterm when Republicans lost 40 seats in the U.S. House.
 
Feckless Democrats
Walter said the biggest wild card in 2026 was the gerrymandering of U.S. House districts to benefit either Republican or Democratic candidates. Texas and California would cancel each other out, so it could come down to the Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri and North Carolina.
Walter said another complicating factor in sorting out the next midterm was the Democratic Party lacked fervor of a decade ago.
The position of Democrats in the federal government shutdown was driven by criticism from Democrats who questioned what lawmakers were doing to push back against Trump, she said.
“That is driven in large part by pressure from rank-and-file Democrats who say, ‘What are our leaders doing? They’re feckless. Why don’t they fight back more against Donald Trump?’ There is this worry among Democrats that their weak party brand big and this intraparty friction may have an impact on turnout,” she said.
Another factor could be timing of a U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether the Voting Rights Act required districts with a majority of minority residents. The outcome could come too late in 2026 for states to adjust boundaries before candidate filing deadlines, she said.
 
Trump in 2028?
Walter said Congress wasn’t going back to a past era that included a spirit of bipartisanship.
“It’s pretty clear that more and more we do have two Americas,” she said. “The job of the parties now seems to be more of, ‘How can I make sure my America turns out to vote and crushes their America.'”
To put it another way, she said: “The idea of the two sides figuring out, ‘Alright, well, this is a priority and let’s work on a bipartisan bill to address it. It seems pretty far-fetched.”
In response to an audience question, Seib and Walter said they doubted Trump would have the audacity to seek a third term as president during 2028 in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
“I think this is a tease right now. I think that even for Trump it would be a bridge too far,” Seib said. “Why? If you think you’re having a wonderful second term and you’re going to go on Mount Rushmore, why would you want to tarnish your legacy by starting a fight with the Supreme Court you’re probably going to lose.”
Walter: “I absolutely agree with you.” She theorized there was no longer a Republican Party in the United States, because it should be regarded as a Trump Party. “Whether it is the name Donald Trump on the ballot in 2028, or someone else, they will come from Donald Trump and he will endorse that candidate and they will be the nominee.”
She went on to suggest it wasn’t probable Trump or the federal government could reschedule or cancel the 2026 election. She’s prepared for local and state governments, organized to diffuse power in election management, to conduct free and fair elections across the country.
“I’m still optimistic that, yes, that will be the case,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amy-Walter-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:16:32.267661

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Federal judges in two separate cases, including the multistate lawsuit that Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined on Tuesday, have rejected legal arguments made by the Trump administration against releasing emergency funding for November food assistance.
In Massachusetts District Court on Friday, Judge Indira Talwani said Clark and colleagues from 24 states and the District of Columbia were “likely to succeed” in their claims against the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Though Talwani stopped short of issuing the temporary restraining order sought by states against the USDA, in an order on Friday she found the USDA’s argument that existing contingency funding is not legally available for its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program “erroneous.”
“While this case isn’t over, today is a good day in our fight,” Clark said in a statement on Friday following Talwani’s order.
Talwani gave federal officials until Monday to “advise the court whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.”

In a separate decision in Rhode Island District Court, Judge John McConnell ordered the Trump administration to use its contingency funding to continue distributing food benefits. McConnell ruled in favor of a group of city officials and community organizations, who sought a temporary restraining order against the USDA’s actions along the same lines as Clark’s lawsuit.
“Two federal courts today told the Trump Administration what they are doing with SNAP benefits is wrong,” Clark said in her statement. “I couldn’t agree more and we will keep fighting.”
These decisions occur as Vermont takes steps to provide state-funded stopgap measures while federal funding remains in question for food assistance. 
On Wednesday, the state’s Emergency Board approved a $6.5 million plan that funds 3SquaresVT — Vermont’s version of SNAP — for the first half of November. The board will reconvene on or before Nov. 13 to weigh further steps.

Officials closed the Tangipahoa River following the Aug. 22 chemical fire at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. facility in Roseland. It took firefighters two weeks to fully extinguish the blaze. The disaster  contaminated nearby properties, land and waterways with millions of gallons of oil and other hazardous chemical products. To date, cleanup crews have recovered more than 11 million gallons of liquid waste, according to state estimates. 
Cleanup operations continue in other parts of the river north of Lees Landing, and oil absorbent boom will remain in place at select locations, the LDEQ statement said.

(Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)Leaders of New Mexico’s largest food banks said they’re seeing sharp increases in demand for food donations in distribution lines amid the looming disappearance of federal food assistance funding beginning Saturday.
Approximately 250 people lined up Friday morning at the weekly Roadrunner Food Bank distribution in Albuquerque ,about 100 more than usual, organizers told Source New Mexico. 
And earlier this week in Santa Fe, The Food Depot ran out of food after serving 135 people at a distribution that typically serves less than 100, Executive Director Jill Dixon told Source in a text message.
Organizers said the uptick in demand reflects the widespread uncertainty about what the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will look like beginning Nov. 1. 
Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders

Two federal judges issued orders Friday that block the Trump administration from cutting off SNAP benefits. In one case, the judge gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her findings. 
On Wednesday Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced $30 million in emergency funding to cover SNAP recipients through approximately the first 10 days of the month.
Over the weekend, the state’s roughly 460,000 SNAP recipients will receive a payment equaling 30% of their typical monthly food assistance benefit, Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told Source New Mexico on Friday in a phone interview. The money will arrive to all SNAP recipients, including those who typically receive their benefits later in the month.
Recipients can expect text messages soon with more details, as well as phone numbers to call in case issues arise, she said. 
“At this point we are not anticipating any delays,” she said. “We’re telling New Mexicans that if they don’t have their benefits by Monday, they should give us a call.”
As they stood toward the front of a growing food line around 9 a.m. Friday morning in Albuquerque, Keith Pounds struck up a conversation with Jeana Morgan and her son Jimmy about how they’re going to feed their families in November. They could be overheard planning how to make do with one-third of what they typically rely on in November amid rising grocery prices.

“Something’s better than nothing,” Jimmy Morgan said. “Yeah, it’s something,” his mother said.
But Pounds, who is disabled, said he is supporting his three brothers, who’ve been unable to get food assistance. He worried aloud about how they’ll all eat in November. 
“I try and catch every food bank I can, even with my feet and my legs the way they are,” he said. “Life is hard, dude. You can’t afford to eat.” 
Armijo also told Source on Friday following the federal rulings the state will still proceed with  payments because she anticipates at least a few days before the money arrives here, even if Trump accedes to the judicial orders.
“That could really eat into next week,” she said. “And so in order to make sure that New Mexicans have food on the table over the weekend, we’re going to issue those benefits.”
Even with those benefits, Joseph Greenwood, a programs manager at Roadrunner Food Bank, told Source that the food bank expects continued high demand through November. He looked over the growing food line Friday and said it reminded him of lines during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

He anticipated the food bank would give out an entire truckload of food by noon. 
He said the state’s $30 million stop-gap, along with an $8 million investment for statewide food banks the Legislature approved during a special session at the beginning of the month, provide a “shot in the arm” to help feed New Mexicans, but it’s doesn’t come close to satisfying statewide hunger needs.
But Edmundo Maestas, who grew up in the International District, was relieved to learn Friday morning from a reporter that the state would give him about $35 for food over the weekend. Even though it’s one-third of what he normally gets, he thought he wasn’t getting anything through Thanksgiving.

Phaneuf and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/trump-ordered-to-pay-snap-benefits-ct-officials-still-want-to-help/,The rulings didn’t stop CT state legislators’ demands to reserve hundreds of millions to shore up SNAP and other human service programs.,"Two federal judges ruled separately on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.
The judges, in federal courts in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program fully or partially in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to stop SNAP benefits entirely for 42 million Americans — including 360,000 Connecticut residents — starting Saturday.
Those rulings, though, didn’t stop Connecticut state legislators’ demands to reserve hundreds of millions in state funds to shore up SNAP and other human service programs harmed by stalled federal aid.
Gov. Ned Lamont and state legislative leaders indicated Friday they would continue negotiating a plan to use Connecticut resources to ensure all vulnerable residents are protected.
In U.S. District Court in Boston, Judge Indira Talwani ruled in a written opinion that the USDA must pay for SNAP, calling the suspension “unlawful.” She ordered the Trump administration to advise the court by Monday as to whether it would use the contingency funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds.
The SNAP program entered October with about $6 billion in contingency funds, though that reserve likely now stands between $5 billion and $6 billion, with some used to cover SNAP administrative costs in October. A partial federal government shutdown starting Oct. 1 has blocked any new funds into the program.
But Talwani noted federal agriculture officials could supplement those dollars with customs receipts on all imports, which might allow for full benefits to be paid in November.
Meanwhile, in U.S. District Court in Providence, Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case filed by cities and nonprofits that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds, and he also asked for an update on progress by Monday.
Still, it wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy food could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.
And the rulings are likely to face appeals.
Connecticut officials applauded the rulings Friday but acknowledged the SNAP crisis is far from over.
“Donald Trump now has a stark legal and moral choice before him — he can keep fighting this losing battle, he can insist on starving American families for political leverage, or he can release the funds now,” said Attorney General William Tong.
Connecticut, 24 other states and the District of Columbia filed the lawsuit heard in federal court in Boston, arguing the White House has a legal and a moral obligation to spend contingency funds at least.
“While this ruling may offer last-minute relief for the many who rely on SNAP, I urge the federal government to honor it now and for [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins to use not only the department’s contingency fund but also her transfer authority to increase benefits,” Lamont wrote in a statement shortly after the rulings, adding that state social services officials would issue November benefits as soon as the USDA authorizes payments.
“In Connecticut, we take care of our own and will continue to stand by our residents until this federal shutdown is resolved,” the governor said.
But state legislative leaders from both parties have chastised the Democratic governor this week, saying he did too little to prepare for a benefits stoppage that had become evident weeks ago.
Lamont dedicated $3 million for an emergency grant to support food pantries while governors in several other states dedicated tens of millions of dollars in provide state-backed food benefits to replace the vanishing federal aid to needy households.
State House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said they both remain committed to designating a huge state reserve, likely involving hundreds of millions of dollars.
This could be used to replace stalled federal SNAP benefits if federal court appeals lead to more delays, or if federal contingency funds eventually are exhausted. With the General Assembly expected to go into special session on Nov. 12-13, legislative leaders say they want to ensure enough state reserves as designated to protect programs, if necessary, until the regular 2026 legislative session opens on Feb. 4.
“This is about more than just SNAP,” Candelora said. “I think that we need to act as if this government shutdown is going to continue.”
And even after the shutdown is over and federal agency operations return to normal, Ritter said, many state legislators also want to review human service programs that face ongoing reductions in federal funding in 2027 and 2028 due to cutbacks ordered by Congress in July.
“The shutdown has only made it more important to do this [reserve] fund,” Ritter added. “It’s not just SNAP that’s at risk.”
Some state legislators already have said they want to bolster Connecticut’s winter heating assistance grants, which traditionally have been paid using only federal aid, with some state funding.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has traditionally objected to using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government, a stance that sometimes leaves him at odds with his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority.
State Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, who is challenging Lamont for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said Friday the fiscally moderate governor would find himself at odds with nearly the entire General Assembly unless he agrees to dedicate more state dollars to help feed hungry families and keep homes heated this winter. Simply giving $3 million to food pantries, Elliott said, won’t cut it.
“It would astonish me, given the amount of suffering that we’re hearing from our constituents across the board, that we wouldn’t have super-majorities in both chambers” ready to spend state funds on nutrition and home heating assistance, Elliott said.
The Hamden lawmaker said the legislature should even consider a state tax rebate if that is the only way to get extra resources in November to poor families that cannot afford groceries.
The average Connecticut household on SNAP receives about $324 per month, or about $81 per week.

(Photo courtesy of DMACC)Des Moines Area Community College has selected an interim leader with previous Iowa community college experience to fill the six-month gap between President Rob Denson’s retirement and the appointment of a new president.
During a special meeting Friday the DMACC board of directors appointed Liang Chee Wee as the college’s interim president, with his term set to run from Jan. 1 through June 30, 2026. The vote was nearly unanimous, with board member Angela Jackson abstaining because she said she didn’t have time to review Wee’s resume.
Some members of the board met with Wee earlier this week, board president Kevin Halterman said during the meeting, and they were impressed with his willingness to get involved in DMACC life and keep the institution moving forward during his tenure.
“I am very positive about his appointment as our interim,” board member Trish Roberts said.

When DMACC first launched a national search for President Rob Denson’s successor after his retirement at the end of 2025, the plan was to select a new president who would take over at the start of the year. However, after two of three finalists for the presidency dropped out, the board decided to extend the search into next year and hire an interim president in the meantime.

Wee has led multiple Iowa community colleges in the past, according to a news release announcing his appointment, including more than a decade of serving as president of Northeast Iowa Community College and two years of being interim chancellor of Eastern Iowa Community Colleges.
As he is currently living in Decorah, Halterman said during the meeting Wee will look for a residence in the Des Moines area to have “boots on the ground” at DMACC during the week. Wee will consult with the college’s senior team members on practices like hiring during his time at the college, Halterman said, and he will assist in representing the college and its needs during the legislative session.
He also agreed with board members that DMACC is a large institution and “we should not slow down the ship,” board member Felix Gallagher said during the meeting.
“DMACC is a remarkable institution with outstanding students, faculty, and staff,” Wee said in the release. “I am honored to serve in this interim capacity and look forward to supporting the College’s impactful mission of providing accessible, affordable, and outstanding educational experiences while working alongside the talented DMACC community.”

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansans purchasing health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are likely to see their premiums increase in 2026, some by as much as 34%, and that’s without calculating the additional dollars they will pay if subsidies aren’t reinstated by Congress. 
ACA marketplace open enrollment starts Saturday for 2026 insurance plans, and Kansans are concerned about what to expect after seeing national estimates that health insurance rates may double. 
Health insurance rates are going up across the board, and many factors contribute to that, including use, cost of care and advances in types of care, increased prescription costs and renegotiated provider reimbursement contracts, said Kyle Strathman, deputy chief of staff at the Kansas Department of Insurance. 
On the marketplace, Kansans also are being hit with the expiration of 2026 marketplace subsidies, said Maci Mishler, owner of Rural Health Advisors, a health insurance agency in Ness City and with an office in Nebraska. 
“I’m really concerned that people in the marketplace have their heads buried in the sand and they’re not realizing what’s about to happen,” she said, adding that she’s getting more calls from clients about Medicare rates than from those who buy marketplace insurance. 
 
 Kansas ACA

Of the seven companies offering ACA coverage in Kansas, one is new to the market and has no previous rates to compare. Another, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, showed an average rate decrease of 6.14%, according to the Kansas Department of Insurance’s 2026 overview of the health insurance market, released Thursday. 
The remaining five reported the following average rate increases among 2026 marketplace plans:

11.74% – UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co.
14.44% – Oscar Insurance Co.
16.65% – Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas Inc.
30.76% – Medica Insurance Co.
33.66% – Ambetter from Sunflower Health Plan insured by Celtic Insurance Co.

The four companies offering small business insurance plans through ACA reported that rates will increase, on average, from 8.4% to nearly 10%, the study found. 
The insurance market study also said the numbers of Kansans using the marketplace have steadily increased, topping 200,000 in 2025, up from 171,000 in 2024. In 2017, 98,780 people were enrolled. 
Strathman said it’s challenging to predict how the insurance market will be affected. National experts expect many people who see significant cost increases to go without insurance. 
“It is difficult to project as we do not know if people will leave the ACA for other options such as short-term limited duration plans or group plans, but projections of enrollment to the individual ACA plans are expected to decrease significantly,” he said. 
A decrease would negatively affect the market, as insurance companies depend on the number of people enrolled to decrease risk, Mishler said. 
Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association, said any decrease in the number of Kansans who have health insurance is concerning. 
“When they’re uninsured, that’s not good for their health care because they don’t get proactive health care,” she said. “It also means when they have urgent care, they’re going to come to the emergency room, and they’re uncompensated, so they have no insurance.”
When hospitals face rising uncompensated care costs, those challenges begin to affect the entire medical system. Kansas has the highest number of rural hospitals at immediate risk of closing of any state, at 25 hospitals, according to the March 2025 report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
 
Hitting Kansans’ budgets
Kansan Laura Mead is self-employed, and she’s nervous about what to expect from her marketplace plan when she sees rates on Saturday — that’s even after an initial exploration showed her annual health insurance cost may decrease. 
At age 60, she currently pays about $1,100 a month for health care through ACA, which she says has an actual premium of $1,427 a month. The additional $327 is covered by the ACA subsidies, which are ending unless Congress takes action. 
“For the first time in my adult life, I’m facing a real serious prospect of not having health care,” she said.
After researching, Mead said she expects that her insurance costs may double, which would leave her paying an unsustainable $2,000 each month. 
Mead is considering a catastrophic policy, which would cover her if a significant health problem occurred. She’s frustrated at how difficult it is to weigh her options. The ACA marketplace can be confusing, she said, and she’s finding that even Kansas U.S. legislators don’t understand what’s happening. 
She called one representative’s office and the staff person told her that “we’re trying to get people who aren’t working off those programs,” Mead said. 
Carolyn McKee, a small business owner in Holton, posted on Facebook Friday that she received a letter saying her private Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan would increase by $700 a month. Within an hour, her post had more than 40 comments, with some complaining they were also seeing their rates double. 
Many self-employed individuals like McKee and Mead, including an estimated 27% of farmers, get their health insurance through the marketplace. 
 
More than subsidies
Mischler said people need to also be aware of the “cliff” that’s part of ACA marketplace rules, as that will also affect many Kansans. 
“Pre-Covid, if you had income over 400% of the federal poverty level, you weren’t going to qualify for a subsidy at all,” she said. “Then during Covid, they expanded subsidies and even people who made a ton of money could qualify for some subsidies.”
Mischler said consumers have gotten used to paying those reduced rates for health insurance and that 400% requirement is now going back in place. 
“That’s going to hit hard, right now especially,” she said. “Even if we estimate their income as under that 400%, if they make one penny over that 400%, then they’re going to pay back all the subsidy that they’ve received at tax time.”
With farmers and others who are self-employed, it can be difficult to estimate income, and Mischler said she’s concerned about people needing to repay thousands of dollars in subsidies. 
 
Political chaos
The government shutdown is tied to the ACA marketplace subsidies, with Democrats saying they won’t support a spending bill until Republicans agree to continue marketplace subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. 
Republicans maintain the Democrats are fighting to keep undocumented immigrants on ACA marketplace insurance. The right-wing group Public Policy Solutions posted on Twitter — and Kansas Speaker of the House Dan Hawkins reposted — that “Democrats chose to shut down the government to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants and keep pandemic-era ObamaCare subsidies flowing to insurance giants.”
Anyone who isn’t in the country legally is not eligible for marketplace insurance.
Gov. Laura Kelly, during a press conference Friday in her role as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, called on Congress to return to session and reinstate ACA subsidies, as well as address Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that are delayed because of the federal shutdown. 
“We’re here today because our country is at a dire inflection point starting tomorrow,” she said. “Twenty-two million Americans will wake up to see their health care premiums increase by an average of 75%, and 42 million people will lose SNAP benefits and go hungry because DC Republicans sold them out at the behest of Donald Trump.”
Rural communities will be hit the hardest, she said, noting that “dozens” of rural health clinics nationwide have shut down. She also said that Freeman Health System’s plans in Kansas to build a new hospital in Frontenac have been dropped. 
In a statement three weeks ago, Freeman said conditions weren’t feasible to open the hospital at this time, pointing to changes in the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kansas-Ins-Dept-1024x562.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

On Monday, the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) announced that benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be suspended in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, said it would not pay benefits starting Nov. 1, and would also not tap into a contingency fund to pay benefits, even removing mentions of the plan from its website. 
More than 726,000 Alabamians rely on the service, according to DHR, about 15% of the state’s population.
A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the USDA to continue paying SNAP benefits through November. It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration would appeal the ruling. 
Local providers prepare
Elmore County Food Pantry has provided more than 25 emergency boxes to furloughed federal employees and SNAP recipients in the last two days, director Jade Skinner said on Friday. Typically, she said the pantry distributes one emergency box per week.
“Anytime someone comes in and says, ‘Hey, I really need help, this is what’s going on.’ We’ve got a box ready for them, for their family members,” Skinner said in an interview Friday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to data from DHR, about 8,100 (8.9%) Elmore County residents received SNAP benefits in September. The food pantry serves both SNAP recipients and those that make less than 185% of the poverty level. That’s an annual income of about $28,900 for an individual and $49,000 for a family of three.
The boxes come to the food pantry from Heart of Alabama Food Bank, each filled with 25 pounds of food for families. Skinner and volunteers add an additional 25 pounds of food to each box.
“In my opinion, that’s not enough for a family to get by with. It’s probably four or five canned goods, two cans of peanut butter, a big thing of applesauce,” she said. “What we’re doing is taking from our inventory and our supply and beefing those boxes up. We’re giving them like some rice, some pasta, dried beans, frozen meats, to supplement and get them by.”
The food pantry allows its customers to shop like a grocery store once every month for free, but there are limits on how much of each item can be taken. Skinner said the pantry usually has about 600 shoppers every month, with each one getting 150-165 pounds of groceries.
With the influx of need, Skinner said the pantry needs volunteers, donations, monetary and items, but to prioritize donating food that could be used more than once.
“When someone donates money to us, we can buy in bulk from the Heart of Alabama Food Bank, and $1 can provide five to six pounds of food. Whereas, if you or I were to go to the grocery store and buy just a simple can of food, it’s going to be $1 and some change,” Skinner said. “We accept food and monetary donations but, monetary donations go a lot further.”
A message seeking comment from the Heart of Alabama Food Bank was left Friday.
West Alabama Food Bank is another food pantry that has seen increased operations.
“We have increased our mobile pantries. Instead of doing three a week, we’re doing between five and six a week,” West Alabama Food Bank Director Jean Rykaczewski said Friday.
Rykaczewski also said grocery stores across the state are offering deals for SNAP recipients and said those who still have funds available will be able to use them.
“The SNAP machine doesn’t turn off in the state of Alabama. Some states it does. In the state of Alabama, it does not. So you can still utilize your funds. We urge everybody to get on the app and set their card up and lock it so that their funds can’t be stolen if they have money on there,” she said.
Laura Lester, the director of Feeding Alabama, who works with food banks across the state including West Alabama Food Bank, said Friday while food banks began preparing at the beginning of the government shutdown, they alone cannot supply enough meals to families.
“For every one meal we provide, SNAP provides nine, right? That is a gap that cannot be filled, and we will do what we can with what we have for as long as we can,” Lester said. “But I can’t tell you what’s going to happen, or how long you know we’ll be able to help feeding the communities, because we’ve never, ever thought about or experienced anything like this before.”
Lester also said holiday food items are already being used by some food banks.
“One of our food banks explained that the food that she had ordered and had on stock for the holidays, she’s already had to pull that to hand out earlier than they had anticipated, and she’s simply hoping that they can backfill it,” she said.

Alabama Democrats call for state aid

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Alabama officials were aware that federal funding for SNAP would be reduced in fiscal year 2027, increasing the state’s share. According to estimates in August, the federal cuts to the program would increase DHR’s budget request by $35 million in FY27 and $208 million in FY28 when the state is responsible for 10% of SNAP benefits. 
The suspension of benefits for the 100% federally-funded program comes amid a month-long federal government shutdown, which is primarily a dispute over health care. Republicans in Congress lack the votes to overcome a budget filibuster. Democrats say they want a bipartisan agreement to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. Republicans said they won’t negotiate that until a stopgap spending bill is passed. 
Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin announced Thursday he would pull $1 million from the city’s reserve fund to help the 86,318 Jefferson County residents, about 13% of the county, who receive SNAP benefits. 
“Birmingham will not sit around and let our children and families starve. We are taking immediate action because we have a moral obligation to take care of the general welfare of our residents,” Woodfin said in a statement posted to Facebook. “We are launching an emergency food relief fund and a citywide food drive starting next week in partnership with United Way, Christian Service Ministries, and faith and community groups across all 99 neighborhoods.”
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is giving the state’s food banks a $4 million boost from its DHR budget. 
Alabama Democrats are calling on Gov. Kay Ivey to use state emergency fund to feed those losing assistance. Gina Maiola, communications director for Ivey’s office, did not directly respond to a question about the emergency fund. 
“Gov. Ivey remains hopeful U.S. Senate Democrats will come to their senses and do their job to reopen the federal government,” Maiola said.
Democrats in the Alabama Legislature are holding a press conference Monday morning at the State House, urging Ivey to call a special session to address funding for SNAP in the state. 
“We all recognize that this is a federal issue, but we cannot ignore its impact on Alabama where over 750,000 of our neighbors could go hungry,” Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro said in a statement. “The governor needs to call a special session so that we can deal with this crisis immediately and then we can use our rainy day funds to feed families until the federal government reaches a solution.”
About half of SNAP recipients in the state are children, according to DHR.
“No kid should go to bed hungry in Alabama simply because politicians in Washington can’t reach an agreement,” House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville said in a statement. “As legislators, we have a moral obligation to address this crisis and use state resources to bridge the gap.”
Maiola said Monday that funding SNAP is not the governor’s job.
“As Alabama DHR noted, SNAP benefits are 100% federally funded, and therefore, U.S. Food and Nutrition Services controls the issuance of these benefits on EBT cards. While the state does not have extra money to do Congress’ job, Governor Ivey hopes to see U.S. Senate Democrats get on board to reopen the federal government,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761149882.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

Free.,"Effects of government shutdown spread on day 31, from health costs to food to flights","Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/effects-government-shutdown-spread-day-31-health-costs-food-flights,,"WASHINGTON — By Saturday, millions of Americans are expected to face a drastic spike in health care premium costs during open enrollment, though a hunger crisis may have been temporarily averted, both tied to the ongoing government shutdown.A federal judge in Massachusetts Friday afternoon found that the U.S. Department of Agriculture acted unlawfully in deciding to withhold billions in emergency funding for 42 million people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, amid a government shutdown.But while the ruling does not order USDA to immediately tap into its roughly $6 billion contingency fund, a separate ruling from a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the agency to continue the payments after a coalition of religious and advocacy groups sued.Prior to both rulings, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins defended USDA’s decision to not use the contingency fund during a Friday press conference at the U.S. Capitol with House Speaker Mike Johnson on day 31 of the government shutdown. “We are here today because SNAP benefits run dry tomorrow, so the truth has finally revealed itself, hasn't it?” Rollins said. “Democrats’ support for programs like SNAP is now reduced to cynical control over people’s lives.”It was not yet clear midday Friday how the two court rulings would be carried out by the administration.The move to cut off SNAP would leave millions hungry, nearly 40% of them children, and is an effort by the Trump administration to put pressure on Senate Democrats to accept the House-passed GOP stopgap spending bill to fund the government until Nov. 21. Senate Democrats have held out demanding action on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, hugely driving up costs. They have tried to spark negotiations, but Republicans have maintained that talks on health care subsidies will only begin after the government is funded. Flight delays, filibuster fate As the government shutdown continues, millions of federal workers are furloughed, or have continued to work without pay, including air traffic controllers. Flight delays and cancellations are starting to mount, with 3,739 delays within, into or out of the United States and 364 cancellations within the United States by midday Friday, according to the FlightAware delays tracker.Another shutdown complication emerged when President Donald Trump, who has spent most of the week abroad in Asia meeting with foreign leaders over trade and tariff talks, Thursday night urged Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold. “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote on his social media platform. Senate Republicans have been lukewarm on the idea, since Democrats then could do the same if they regain control of the chamber now held by the GOP with 53 seats.Lacking 60 votes, the Senate has failed 13 times to pass the House-passed stopgap spending measure and left Capitol Hill Thursday night. Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen from Nevada tried to keep the Senate in session, but was overruled by Republicans. Another critical deadline approaching Friday was pay for active duty military members. Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration would shuffle funds to ensure pay, but did not detail those plans. According to Axios, the Defense Department pulled billions from several accounts to ensure the troops could be paid. Rollins defends USDA refusal to pay benefitsCongress failed to fund SNAP and nearly every other discretionary federal program for the 2026 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.In order to receive SNAP benefits, a household’s gross monthly income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. A family of four would receive a SNAP maximum monthly allotment of $994, according to USDA.Rollins sought to justify her agency’s refusal to shuffle the contingency funds to pay for SNAP, saying that money “is only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded,” and “by law, a contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing.” The Agriculture secretary said that “even if it could flow, it doesn’t even cover half of the month of November.” USDA said in a memo earlier in October that it would not tap into the contingency fund to keep the program afloat in November, despite its since-deleted Sept. 30 shutdown plan saying it would tap into this reserve. The memo said the contingency fund “is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice.” Democrats have objected. Friday’s decision from a federal judge in Boston stems from a lawsuit brought by 25 states and the District of Columbia against the Trump administration to force USDA to use the contingency fund. USDA secretary recounts conversation with waiterAt the Capitol press conference, Rollins also recalled a recent encounter she had at a Louisiana restaurant with a “wonderful” waiter named Joe, who she said took on that job after being furloughed as a federal government employee due to the shutdown. “He didn't know who I was. And I said, 'Well, Joe, I can appreciate that. You know, I'm sort of in that world as well.' And I said, 'Where do you work?' And he said, 'Well, I work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in their New Orleans office as part of the financial team.'""Rollins said that encounter “just really brought home for me ... to echo what Mike (Johnson) said, just thanking so many thousands of federal workers who are showing up, who are still doing their job, who aren’t getting paid, those that are now concerned about putting food on the table and making their mortgages and paying their rent.” Rollins, along with the rest of the president's Cabinet, is still getting paid.Health premiums skyrocketAs open enrollment begins Saturday, those enrollees in the Affordable Care Act marketplace who currently receive a tax credit are likely to see their monthly premium payments more than double to about 114% on average, according to an analysis by KFF. For the last month, Democrats have warned of this, as the tax credits that help pay for individual health insurance are set to expire at the end of the year. The top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, said in a statement that many families will see an increase in their premiums on Nov. 1.“The sticker shock many families will face when they shop for health coverage is unacceptable, and it’s why Congress must act,” Pallone said.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that if Congress does not extend the tax credits, insurers expect healthy, younger people to drop their marketplace coverage plans, which will lead to increased premium costs. Anxiety over WIC programMeanwhile, USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, a program separate from SNAP, got a $300 million infusion from the agency, using tariff revenue, to keep the program running through October. The program provides nearly 7 million women, infants and children with healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and other resources. Advocates are calling on the administration to supply additional emergency funds for WIC. Led by the National WIC Association, more than three dozen national organizations signed on to an Oct. 24 letter to the White House urging the administration to provide an additional $300 million in emergency funding. Head Start affectedThe consequences of the shutdown are also hitting Head Start — a federal program that provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families and served more than 790,000 children in the 2023-2024 program year. The National Head Start Association estimates that 140 programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico serving more than 65,000 children will not receive their operational funding if the shutdown continues past Nov. 1 — a reality that appears certain.Six of those programs serving more than 6,500 children did not receive this funding on Oct. 1 and have had to look to outside resources and local funds to keep their programs afloat. SNAP, WIC and Native communities American Indian and Alaska Native communities are also scrambling to fill the anticipated gaps in food security and assistance due to funding uncertainties for SNAP and WIC. Advocates and U.S. senators across the aisle say these funding uncertainties for the key federal nutrition programs are putting particular pressure on Native communities. At an Oct. 29 Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing on the shutdown’s impacts on tribal communities, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said she is hearing from tribal nations in her state about people switching from SNAP to the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR, a separate USDA initiative.FDPIR is an alternative to SNAP and, per USDA, provides foods “to income-eligible households living on Indian reservations, and to American Indian households residing in approved areas near reservations and in Oklahoma.”",,,,2025-10-31 16:17:03.636531

(Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motors)General Motors is set to lay off 3,400 workers at facilities building electric vehicles, including more than a thousand employees at a plant in Detroit, according to a report from the Detroit News on Wednesday.
While GM, one of the Detroit Three automakers, did not respond to a request for comment, the News reported that 1,200 workers at the Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center would be left without a job, with cuts based on seniority.
Jesse Lee, senior advisor for Climate Power, a strategic communications organization focused on promoting progress on climate issues, laid the blame at President Donald Trump’s feet, with his administration working to eliminate federal support for electric vehicles.
“Trump’s full-scale assault on clean energy manufacturing is serving Americans with pink slips and skyrocketing energy bills, while giving China a competitive edge in the automotive industry,” Lee said, arguing that Republicans will answer for their support of Trump’s anti-electric vehicle policies in the 2026 midterm election.
Earlier this month, GM canceled plans for a $55 million hydrogen fuel cell factory in Detroit, which was set to create 140 new jobs. Crain’s Detroit Business reported that the decision was based on a lack of hydrogen infrastructure and longer-than-expected transition to electric vehicles, alongside the Department of Energy’s plans to eliminate funding awards supporting 223 unspecified projects.

(Photo courtesy of West Virginia Department of Health)Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s $60 million sale of West Virginia’s four long-term nursing homes closes Friday, placing the facilities under private ownership after many lawmakers for years have said no to the change.
The hospitals, which mostly serve elderly patients using Medicaid, were operating at $6 million annual financial loss to the state. 
The buyers, New York-based developer Marx Development Group and its subsidiary, Majestic Care, are contractually required to build at least three new hospitals on a set timeline, according to documents obtained through a public records request. The four hospitals need $3.9 million in deferred maintenance. 
Majestic Care could potentially build the new hospitals in undetermined locations because it isn’t required to rebuild at the current hospital sites. 
In Beckley, local officials still have many questions and concerns about the future of FRMS Health Systems that operates on the same property as Jackie Withrow Hospital, which is being sold. 
“FMRS is on the same tract of land, and I guess nobody even considered that when they decided they wanted to sell this thing to somebody,” said Raleigh County Commissioner Daniel Hall. “FMRS provides tons of valuable services through Raleigh County and three other counties. We just can’t allow this to just go away.”
FMRS offers adult and children’s behavioral health services, including outpatient psychiatric services. It’s one of the state’s 13 comprehensive behavioral health centers and includes crisis stabilization that helps people get stabilized to prevent them from being hospitalized. 
“We keep a lot of people out of the hospital and keep them functioning in the community,” said Randy Venable, chief executive officer at FMRS.
With the sale being finalized, Venable said it was unclear what would happen in the future.
“To have to relocate with short notice, it would be very difficult for sure, because I don’t know of an existing building that we could move into in short notice,” he said. “Of course, the financial strain would be pretty significant as well.”
“You don’t really know what’s going to happen with a private entity,” he added.
Majestic Care did not respond to an email with questions for this story. 
The Raleigh County Commission sent a letter to the governor earlier this month asking that the FMRS facilities be carved out from the sale of Jackie Withrow, but the sale wasn’t changed.
Del. Carl “Bill” Roop, R-Raleigh
“What I had proposed to the governor’s office is there’s 9.2 acres, what I call below the road that separated from the Jackie Withrow hospital, then that could easily be cut out of this sale,” said Raleigh County Attorney Bill Roop, who also serves in the state House of Delegates.
The state’s contract with MDG requires the company to assume the lease agreement between FMRS two years with the possibility to renew. If they terminate it, the company would have six months to relocate, according to Venable. 
“If two years from now they decide to use this property for something else, we’ve been given a six month period to try to figure out how to relocate, which would be probably next to impossible,” he said.
Jackie Withrow hospital also contains incarcerated individuals with the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The state’s jails are overcrowded, and DCR would have to absorb the inmates should Majestic Care decide that it no longer wants to operate a floor for corrections. 
Hall said Raleigh County officials spoke with the governor’s office over the issue ahead of the sale closing date. 
“They’ve listened to what we’ve told them … but, there’s been no response really, no direction of what’s going to happen,” he said.
Morrisey didn’t return a request for comment about communication issues surrounding the sale of Jackie Withrow.
“I think it’s very important that everybody knows what’s going to happen — FRMS and [corrections], because this is not something that we can just pack our bags and move out tomorrow,” Roop said. “I think the sooner that we have a permanent plan, the better. I mean longer than two years.”
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh, also hoped that there’d soon be a long-term plan for FMRS.
“With COVID and the challenges of society these days, I think, more than than ever, we need to have these kinds of facilities available so that we can help people with their mental health issues,” he said. 
Earlier this week, a judge ruled that Morrisey and Department of Health Facilities Secretary Michael Caruso had legal authority to sell the long-term care hospitals without the Legislature’s approval based on a 2023 bill that created the facilites department. 
During the hearing, lawyers representing Morrisey said around 90% of employees are staying on to work with Majestic Care. Additionally, the company has committed to keeping current patients. 
Morrisey told reporters that the sale “is a better deal for all the people that are getting care of those facilities.” “I’m excited about that,” he added.

The beginning of open enrollment comes as the federal government shutdown continues amid disagreements in Congress about the future of federal subsidies for these health insurance policies, which are available under the Affordable Care Act. 
These tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year without an extension from Congress. Democrats have refused to vote to end the shutdown without Republicans agreeing to extend the subsidies. 
Premiums for individual insurance bought on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange are rising an average of 21%, due in part to the loss of these enhanced tax credits, which started during the COVID pandemic. This increase is in line with similar hikes nationwide. The average growth rate last year was 10.7% in Washington.
The state Office of the Insurance Commissioner estimates the increase this year would be 6% or 7% less if the tax credits continued.
Though at this point, it’s unclear how ​​Congress deciding to extend the tax credits would affect premiums now that open enrollment is beginning. 
The Washington exchange’s CEO, Ingrid Ulrey, said last week that if Congress takes action, “we are committed to delivering that relief to our customers as quickly as possible.” 
Nearly 300,000 Washington residents buy insurance on the exchange. About three-quarters of them qualified for the federal tax credits, helping them decrease annual premiums by an average of $1,330. For seniors, those savings jump to more than $1,900 annually.
The exchange is used by people who do not have access to health insurance through their jobs or from government programs, like Medicaid. 
In some parts of Washington, enrollees who benefit from the tax credits could see their premiums double without them. The hardest-hit spots are in rural areas of eastern Washington, according to a report from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.
State officials expect 80,000 people to now forgo health insurance if the credits aren’t extended. Washington’s uninsured rate has been improving for years, to 4.8% in 2023. Officials worry the end of the subsidies will cause the state to backslide on that progress.
“That means higher costs and strains on our health care system as people put off preventative care,” state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer said Thursday. “These effects will be felt by people across the state, but will hurt some of our rural communities the hardest.”
Those who choose to go without insurance are more likely to be healthy, likely fueling further premium hikes for those who remain insured, as the insurance pool would be less healthy overall and more risky for insurers.
The state still offers options for financial help, including Cascade Care Savings for people who make up to 250% of the federal poverty line. The premium assistance program, launched in 2023, helps nearly 100,000 residents.
Washington’s exchange is seeking $130 million per year in state funding for Cascade Care Savings to mitigate the loss of the federal tax credits. This would require legislative approval.
Open enrollment will run through Jan. 15. To begin coverage by Jan. 1, enrollees should sign up by Dec. 15. Those who apply later will have their plans begin Feb. 1. Existing customers will be automatically renewed, but can still shop around and compare plans.

(Getty Images)Louisiana intends to step in for the federal government in November and provide food aid for most of the state’s needy. But those benefits will trickle out in weekly installments instead of all at once.
Plus, the federal government shutdown that will halt Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments starting Saturday has also led the state to furlough 786 employees who help distribute benefits, the Louisiana Department of Health announced Friday. They have been told not to report to work Monday. Another 298 LDH workers in its SNAP section are considered “essential” and will remain on the job. 
The elderly, disabled and children are typically first in line to have SNAP funds loaded on their electronic benefits transfer cards at the start of the month. Everyone else who qualifies for assistance then receives their assistant in numerical order based on their Social Security number. 
Starting Saturday, Louisiana will issue SNAP recipients 25% of their typical monthly benefits. An additional 25% will be loaded onto their EBT cards each week as long as the government shutdown continues.
Average monthly SNAP payments for an individual in Louisiana are just short of $400. A family of four receives around $950, with income and other factors impacting the amount.
Louisiana is poised to handle food aid for some 793,000 SNAP recipients as federal courts weigh in on lawsuits from Democratic state and city leaders and nonprofit groups against the Trump administration for withholding the benefits. 
In Boston, a judge ruled Friday the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause SNAP payments is illegal, but she gave the government until Monday to respond to her findings before she orders payments to be issued. A Rhode Island judge in a similar case has issued a temporary restraining order that requires the USDA to dole out SNAP starting Saturday.          
In an emergency declaration last week, Gov. Jeff Landry has directed the state health department to redirect $147 million of its resources to cover SNAP benefits for November. He said this week the benefits will be made available to the elderly, disabled and children from qualifying families, who together total about 793,000 recipients. Another 53,000 SNAP recipients, who the governor described as “able-bodied,” will not receive assistance and are being directed to food banks to meet their needs. 
Landry also encouraged those who won’t get SNAP benefits in November to apply for jobs, though his administration has not said how many people within the group of 53,000 are already working but still rely on food aid.    
Should the government shutdown last beyond November, Landry said he would draw from a state reserve revenue account to continue providing food benefits.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) speaks at a ""Yes to Wind"" news conference in Baltimore on Oct. 31, 2025. Van Hollen joined a group of elected officials and advocates backing Maryland's offshore wind project, which already has all of its federal permits, amid attacks by the Trump administration.Advocates and lawmakers gathered in Baltimore on Friday to punch back at President Donald Trump’s assault on offshore wind projects, including one planned for Maryland’s coast.
Until Friday, the battle had largely played out in warring court documents traded between the Trump administration and US Wind, the company behind the proposal for up to 121 turbines off the coast of Ocean City.
In September, Trump’s Department of the Interior told a federal judge that it plans to revoke a critical federal permit issued to the US Wind project in the dying days of President Joe Biden’s administration.
The permit had been challenged by the Town of Ocean City, which welcomed the permit reversal. But the judge is still considering the government’s request, which has been ardently opposed by US Wind.
The event in Baltimore was the first of several “Yes to Wind” events planned for states across the country, and attracted two Maryland Democrats: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski.

“What you’re seeing here is people power. Because what you’re seeing from President Trump in the White House right now is a tip of the hat to the Big Oil guys,” Van Hollen said. “They don’t like the competition.”
Earlier this year, a coalition of Maryland climate groups, labor unions and renewable energy advocates joined to form the Offshore Wind Alliance. They’ve squared up against the Stop Offshore Wind coalition, sponsored by the Town of Ocean City, Worcester County and business groups from the beach town.
But not everyone on Maryland’s Eastern Shore opposes the project, said Jared Schablein, chairman of the civic organization Shore Progress.
“This project injects new life into our local workforce by bringing real jobs, real investment and real hope into my community,” Schablein said. “It’s about making sure the next generation of shore kids don’t have to move away to find opportunities.”
Much of the messaging on Friday was focused on the economics behind the wind project, with supporters arguing that the project will lower utility bills by bolstering power supply.
“Offshore wind means lower utility bills. Let me say it again: Offshore wind means lower utility bills,” Olszewski said. “Blocking these projects will not lower costs, it will raise them.”
The project’s opponents have argued that, in addition to hurting Ocean City tourism and coastal fisheries, the project will raise power bills, partly because of construction costs.
Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said it’s possible that the wind farm could cause a “blip” for ratepayers, but urged Marylanders to take a long-term view of the project’s economics.
“With many of these energy projects, whether it’s rooftop solar or offshore wind, there’s an upfront cost, but it can get recovered fairly quickly, and once it’s recovered, the price drops considerably,” Pinsky said.
A January study from the Energy Administration indicated that Maryland is “below trajectory to meet its existing clean energy targets, in particular those renewable targets set for 2030.” The state has an overall goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2035.
The Trump administration began by halting the issuance of any new offshore wind leases off the coast of the United States. But the administration has since begun targeting projects that already received federal approval — and in some cases, had already started construction, unlike Maryland’s project.
The Trump administration has issued “stop work” orders to Empire Wind in New York (which was rescinded after negotiations with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul) and to Revolution Wind in Rhode Island (which was overturned by a federal judge).
In Maryland, the administration requested to revoke the project’s approval, citing a need to review impacts on coastal fisheries and search-and-rescue efforts in the area.
“It wasn’t enough to raise taxes on clean energy. It wasn’t enough for them to stop offshore wind leases,” said Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery). “They had to actually do stop work orders on projects that were 80% complete, because that’s how much their billionaire fossil fuel buddies are threatened by offshore wind.”

The administration also rescinded $679 million in grant funding for port projects in the U.S., including some tied to offshore wind manufacturing. That included $47.4 million bound for the Sparrows Point Steel turbine manufacturing hub planned for Baltimore County.
“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a news release at the time.
“This is an administration that has explicitly gone after clean energy projects in Democratic-led states and Democratic-led districts,” Olszewski said. “That is not who we are as Americans. We are better than that.”
Friday’s news conference was held at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24 office in Baltimore, which also includes a training center for future electricians.
The center trains about 600 apprentices each year, said Rico Albacarys, political director for the union. In high-voltage training courses taught toward the end of apprentices’ four years of study, the students work on the types of thick cables that run through wind turbines, Albacarys said.
To work on building Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, though, electricians will need a special certification that isn’t offered at the center on Patapsco Avenue in West Baltimore.
Called global wind organization training, the certification costs about $2,000 per person, and it only lasts for two years, Albacarys said. So the Trump administration’s efforts to slow the US Wind project have made it more difficult for the union to plan when it will train its members, Albacarys said.
“We’re trying to thread the needle,” Albacarys said. “We don’t want to start training them too early [so] that they have to get recertified before they actually are able to work on the turbines.”
Regardless of the recent obstacles, Albacarys said he’s confident that Maryland will eventually gain a wind farm on its Atlantic coast.
“It’s only a matter of time,” Albacarys said. “I know it doesn’t feel that way right now, but I think 20 years from now, we’re looking back at: ‘Oh, remember that speed bump?’”

The region already has a confirmed role in tournament play, with seven matches scheduled from June 13 to July 9 at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, which is roughly 30 miles from Bryant.
“I see this as a great opportunity for Rhode Island,” Gov. Dan McKee told reporters and officials gathered inside Bryant’s new 43,000-square-foot field house. “When we build things, excitement comes.”
Which team could call Bryant its temporary home will be made clear over the winter after FIFA’s World Cup draw at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 5. The draw will divide 48 teams into 12 groups of four. FIFA will then release a schedule of which teams will play at Gillette.
McKee and Bryant officials are certain FIFA will keep Rhode Island in the mix because of the $40 million field house that opened in August. 
Bill Smith, vice president of athletics and recreation for the university, highlighted the building’s glass-enclosed treatment rooms, classroom-sized film room, ample locker space, and easy access from the second-floor press box to Bryant’s grass soccer fields.
“I promise that whatever national team is fortunate enough to select us as their team base camp, we are going to bring that same energy and commitment to excellence as them as well,” Smith said.
McKee pointed to the university’s history as the New England Patriots’ training camp site from the late 1970s to 2002 and as the first home of Rhode Island FC before the state’s only professional team moved to Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket.
“We know that Bryant can get it done,” McKee said.

A team’s commitment does not have to be made until February, former Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Liz Tanner told Rhode Island Current after the press conference.
Tanner is heading Ocean State 2026, a nonprofit formed by the state in June to lead business sponsorship efforts on tournament-related activities in Rhode Island. State officials predict the Massachusetts matches will generate more than $330 million in local economic impact. Ocean State 2026 does not yet appear to have an active website.
But there’s a possibility the games won’t come to Gillette. 
President Donald Trump on Oct. 15 threatened to move World Cup matches out of the Boston area over what he called “street takeovers” in the city. FIFA has acknowledged that the U.S. federal government does ultimately have the final say on World Cup host cities.
Tanner said that despite those threats, the state’s World Cup nonprofit is continuing with the assumption that matches will continue in Foxboro.
“Contracts have been signed, commitments have been made,” she told Rhode Island Current.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley is already pitching the capital as a destination for visiting fans and athletes, with plans for citywide viewing parties and celebrations during the tournament.
“The hospitality that visitors will experience in our capital city, and really throughout Rhode Island, will be second to none,” he said. “They will know and experience our incredible restaurants, our amazing hoteliers, the arts and culture that define us as a city and a region.” 
“This is our moment to shine,” General Treasurer James Diossa, who also serves as chairman of Ocean State 2026, said.

Tate Reeves seeks ban on sugary food and drinks paid for with SNAP benefits,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/31/reeves-snap-benefits-sugar/,"Mississippi will seek a waiver that would restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves announced Friday.","Mississippi will seek a waiver that would restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves announced Friday. 
The announcement comes as thousands of Mississippi families face the loss of Supplemental Food Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits beginning Saturday as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
In addition, purchasing hot prepared chicken with SNAP benefits would be allowed if the federal government accepts the state’s waiver application. If approved, the changes will take effect in January 2027. 
“In a nation that is printing money daily just to make our debt payments, it doesn’t make sense to throw your tax money at anything other than the true necessities,” Reeves said in a statement. 
“So it makes no sense at all to fund sugar instead of hearty nutritious meals. That’s why we’re amending our food stamp rules to allow good sustaining food like rotisserie chickens and disallow sugary candy and drinks.”
Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Friday to use emergency funds to continue SNAP payments. It was not clear how quickly people would be able to access their benefits, a process that can take one to two weeks, according to the Associated Press.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services said it could not yet comment on how the ruling will impact distribution of SNAP benefits in the state for November.

Food assistance has continued to flow in past shutdowns, but the federal government has said it cannot use emergency funds to pay for the program during the ongoing shutdown. 
Reeves has not indicated he will move for Mississippi to bridge the gap in the food assistance program until the federal shutdown ends. Democratic and Republican governors in a handful of other states, including Louisiana, have pledged to use state funds to cover all or part of the program.
Dr. Patricia Tibbs, the president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she shares Reeves’ goal of promoting healthy eating, but believes that state leaders must first address the loss of benefits that will begin Saturday. 
“While efforts to encourage healthier food choices are commendable, restricting options without ensuring consistent access to food first risks worsening hunger in already vulnerable homes,” she said in a written statement to Mississippi Today. 
“It is difficult to talk about ‘healthy choices’ when families face empty refrigerators.” 
Twelve other states, overwhelmingly led by Republican governors, have been approved this year for waivers that ban the purchase of sugary foods and drinks by the United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the food assistance program. The approved changes will take effect next year. 
Some states have been approved for or requested waivers that allow for the purchase of hot chicken. SNAP benefits can not currently be used to buy any foods that are hot at the point of sale.
Mississippi’s waiver asks the federal government to approve the following changes to SNAP: 

Banning purchases of processed foods that list sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup as the first two ingredients. The restrictions do not include foods with granulated sugar, raw sugar, and other single-ingredient sugars used for cooking and baking listed as the first two ingredients.
Banning purchases of beverages that list carbonated water and sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup as the first two ingredients. Drinks that list aspartame or other low- or noncaloric sweeteners as the first two ingredients will remain eligible.
Making hot prepared chicken eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits, including items like rotisserie and non-fried, non-breaded chicken. The state also plans to collaborate with the Double Up Food Bucks Program to encourage people to buy fresh fruits and vegetables with purchases of hot prepared chicken.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pushed for the changes as a part of his “make America healthy again” agenda and encouraged states to apply for waivers. 
“For years, SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy — products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,” he said in a statement on Aug. 4. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — or about 400,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. Two thirds of participants are in families with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. 
An August report from state Auditor Shad White found that Mississippi taxpayers would save $22 million annually and improve the health of its citizens by restricting the purchase of certain junk foods with SNAP benefits.
“President Trump is focused on making America healthy again, so we need to make Mississippi healthy again,” said White in a statement. 
“That means a renewed commitment to exercise and teaching our children healthy habits, but it also means using a little more common sense in how we spend taxpayer money on food stamps.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05132428/3X0A8974.jpg,,,2025-10-31 16:01:31.338899

Oct. 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s projected budget hole just widened to approximately $451 million following new economic forecasts.
Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board met Friday to update state revenue projections for the current two-year budget cycle. Members lowered their previous tax revenue projections from April by about $367 million over the two years.
The current projected deficit listed in Nebraska’s general fund financial status stands at about $95 million, which would bring the new deficit up to about $462 million if the tally were added straight from Friday’s meeting.
However, Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said several other factors contributing to state finances mean the projected deficit is expected to rise about $355 million, to reach an estimated $451 million gap.
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said he expected the deficit would grow prior to Friday’s forecast, based on various signs. The state’s monthly tax receipts have been a mixed bag, and the Nebraska Department of Revenue released a report in September estimating that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two fiscal years.

“We can kind of do the math before we get here,” Von Gillern said after the meeting.
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a statement, acknowledged the lower receipts and said he had anticipated the need for belt-tightening, which is why he said he seeks “critical” work to trim $500 million a year from the budget over the next two years.
“It’s a big number, but it’s necessary as we work to fix the broken property tax system, end special interest carve outs and exemptions and balance our budget,” Pillen said.
In addition to the monthly tax receipts reported on the state Department of Revenue’s website, the forecasting board also got preliminary estimates for October’s receipts. Patent said October revenues are expected to be between $22-$40 million above forecasts.

While the increase in the projected deficit is significant, several board members said they were feeling more optimistic about Nebraska’s economic future than what the current signs indicate.
Some members said the recent decline in revenues are more linked to structural policy decisions than an economic slowdown, a read with which Von Gillern agreed.
“When you cut through the noise, things are actually, from my perspective, really stable and quite optimistic for the state as a whole,” said board member John Kuehn.
Patent and other state officials have noted that some declining revenues that have recently been reported is more due to the timing of when revenue is reported. Larger-than-expected claims of ImagiNE Act tax credits — an economic incentive program for businesses expanding in or relocating to Nebraska — contributed to lower corporate revenues in September, for example.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee, previously told the Examiner that the program was expected to dole out about $36 million in credits over 12 months, but instead it distributed roughly $22 million over the past three months.
Von Gillern said the ImagiNE Act credits are also expected to raise sales tax refunds in the coming months. Sales tax revenues were the only category that rose at all from the forecasting board’s April projections. The board’s sales tax estimates rose by $60 million for fiscal year 2025-26, but dropped $123 million for fiscal year 2026-27.
Regardless of the new forecast, Von Gillern said state lawmakers’ job remains the same when the next session convenes in January — balance the state budget by the time they adjourn in mid-April.
Lawmakers will have updated numbers while they are debating budget adjustments. Patent said the state’s Tax Rate Review Committee meets in November, which will update the exact projected deficit in Nebraska’s financial status. The forecasting board also meets once more, on Feb. 27.

(Photo by Galina Zhigalova/Getty image)Amid uncertainty over the availability of federal funding for food benefits for new moms and young children, Rhode Island is the latest state to tap into its own coffers to keep the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program afloat.
Gov. Dan McKee announced Friday that $600,000 in state funds will be used to ensure the benefit program, typically funded by federal dollars, remains available through November despite the government shutdown.  
“WIC provides essential nutrition and support for women, infants, and children across our state,” McKee said. “Whether it’s standing up for Rhode Islanders being cut off from SNAP by President Trump or protecting families who depend on WIC, Rhode Island will not stand by and do nothing while this crisis hurts the people we serve.” 
The program provides food, education and other resources to nearly 7 million at-risk pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding individuals nationwide — and 18,000 in Rhode Island —-  nationwide, as well as infants and children up to 5 years old. 
As a discretionary program, WIC is subject to congressional approval each year — making it particularly vulnerable to the ongoing funding lapse. A $300 million federal infusion, including tariff revenue, kept the program afloat through October. And as the shutdown extends into a second month, there are growing concerns that the initial appropriation will run dry.
Similar fears surrounded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps a broader swath of low-income and vulnerable residents afford groceries. On Friday, a pair of federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island separately ordered the Trump administration to tap government contingency funds to keep the food assistance program afloat, though compliance remains unclear. The court orders do not apply to WIC, leaving states scrambling to cover the gap.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Friday afternoon regarding the source of state funds. 
The initial state injection is expected to fund benefits for pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children through the end of November, according to McKee’s office.
If the shutdown continues past Nov. 30, the governor’s office said it will assess the situation.
Community nonprofits that serve as providers where applicants can sign up for the state program praised McKee’s decision in a series of statements Friday afternoon.
 “This program is a vital resource to families, and disruptions in their ability to receive benefits impacts their overall health and well-being,” said Alison Croke, president and CEO of Wood River Health, noting that the medical clinic is the only provider for WIC in Washington County.
Without the contingency funding, 1,400 infants and children who receive food assistance through Meeting Street’s early childhood programs would go hungry, John Kelly, Meeting Street president, said. 
“I am proud to live and work in a state that shares Meeting Street’s values of compassion, respect and inclusivity, by demonstrating — through its actions — that all children in our community have a right to basic nutrition,” Kelly said.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services expects to furlough up to 1,534 employees and temporarily close its local offices within the next week and a half if the federal government does not reopen, the agency announced in a Friday news release.
The government shutdown that began Oct. 1 remained unresolved this week after Congress failed to pass a proposed deal to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
If DHS cannot administer SNAP by Nov. 1, the agency will furlough 34 employees, “and multiple programs that receive federal funding through grants administered by DHS will have to cease those services,” according to the news release.

Food assistance funding cliff approaching as shutdown persists


Those programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) initiatives.
The 34 employees set for immediate furlough are in DHS’ Office of Payment Integrity; Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services; and Division of County Operations.
DHS furloughed 37 employees in the Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance on Oct. 1, and they remain furloughed, the news release states.
If the shutdown continues through Nov. 7, DHS will temporarily close its offices in all 75 Arkansas counties and furlough 1,500 Division of County Operations employees starting Nov. 10. All of those positions and operations are federally funded.
“The government shutdown has put enormous strain on many services we offer, and we are deeply concerned that important benefits Arkansans rely on will suffer as a result,” DHS Secretary Janet Mann said in the news release. “First and foremost, this will be painful for the beneficiaries we serve, and we regret that we have been placed in this position. It will also be painful for the hundreds of employees within our agency who will not be paid for as long as this shutdown continues.”
SNAP benefits will cease on Nov. 1 without federal action, but DHS’ electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system will still be operational in November in case SNAP recipients have some previous benefits saved, according to the news release.
More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to another DHS news release.
To alleviate the impact on families losing food assistance, Arkansas will distribute $500,000 among six regional food bank networks, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Friday morning.
Six Arkansas Head Start locations to close Nov. 1 due to funding loss from government shutdown

The government shutdown’s impact on Arkansas government services has not been limited to DHS.
The Pulaski County locations of Arkansas’ federally-funded early childhood education program, Head Start, will temporarily close Saturday due to a lack of funding, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences announced last week. The six facilities in Little Rock and North Little Rock serve 446 children from low-income families, and 130 employees will be furloughed.
Another impact of the shutdown on child care is the Department of Education’s lack of access to funds supporting the School Readiness Assistance Program, which helps low-income families access child care. The program was already financially insolvent and had a waitlist of over 1,100, department officials said in September. That waitlist has grown to 1,569, according to the program’s website.
An emergency working group of child care experts proposed a months-long financial solution that the department will decide Friday whether to accept.
The Arkansas Department of Health will continue administering Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) benefits until mid-November if the shutdown does not end by then, department officials said last week.
The eventual reopening of the federal government is expected to cause delays in processing SNAP cases, according to Friday’s DHS news release.
Medicaid benefits will continue uninterrupted because the program is federally funded through the end of the calendar year.

A version of this story by Adora Brown was published on Oct. 29, 2025 by NOTUS. Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
In Washington, Democrats and national advocates are warning about the growing consequences that the government shutdown will have on Head Start programs across the country.
On Saturday, another wave of funding lapses is set to affect nearly 60,000 more children across 41 states, according to the National Head Start Association.
In Vermont, none of the state’s seven Head Start programs will need to shutter in November, according to Christy Swenson, the Head Start Director at Capstone Community Action and board chair of the Vermont Head Start Association. 
However, several will face temporary closure in early December if the shutdown wears on, Swenson said. Leaders of programs serving two Vermont regions — the Champlain Valley and the Northeast Kingdom — anticipate running out of federal funds by then, they said. 
The federal Head Start program, which provides child care and nutritious meals to more than 700,000 children across the country, and around 1,250 in Vermont, has already faced funding lapses that forced some locations in other states to close completely and others to look for interim funding elsewhere. 
Head Start, together with Early Head Start, aims to serve children from birth to age 5 living in foster care or households with incomes below the federal poverty line, or who are experiencing homelessness. In Vermont, almost one-fifth of children enrolled are unhoused or experiencing housing insecurity, according to an analysis of federal data by a national advocacy group.
“It’s an absolute tragedy,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who caucuses with Democrats, said about the upcoming lapses. “And it is beyond comprehension that you have a Republican House, which is now in its fifth week of vacation. Maybe they want to come to work and help us resolve this crisis.”
Head Start is funded on annual cycles, which have starting dates that vary from program to program, Swenson said. Once the commitment is renewed, the process of “drawing down” federal funding as it becomes necessary is not affected by the shutdown, she added.
Champlain Valley Head Start in Burlington is only guaranteed funding through Nov. 1, which means their grant ends on Saturday, Sandra Graves, the program’s director, said on Friday. Her program would be able to stay open through November under a continued shutdown, although only by exhausting its financial reserves, she said.
The program, which is operated by the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, serves Chittenden, Addison, Franklin, and Grand Isle counties. Graves’ staff of 63 provides care and programs to 233 enrolled children and their families, she said.
On Dec. 5, in the absence of federal funding or other support, all of the program’s offerings will need to pause, and all staff will be furloughed, Graves said. The annual grant from the federal Office of Head Start is roughly $7.2 million, she said, which represents the program’s entire operating budget save two small state-level grants.
The Head Start program run by Northeast Kingdom Community Action, or NEKCA, has a Dec. 1 funding cycle, but does not possess the financial cushion that Champlain Valley has available, said NEKCA Executive Director Jenna O’Farrell. The program may be able to keep running for a short time after Dec. 1 with a fraction of its previous capacity, but O’Farrell said that isn’t guaranteed.
That program operates eight physical locations across the rural Northeast Kingdom. It serves 160 children and their families, and employs 78 staff members.
Champlain Valley Head Start filed its annual federal funding application on time in August, Graves said. Ordinarily, the request should have been approved in September. But the Office of Head Start has seen cuts to staffing under the Trump administration, and every aspect of Graves’ interaction with federal officials has slowed, she said.
Even once the government opens, Graves has been told her organization’s funding approval might take several weeks. It may be hard to avoid the Dec. 5 deadline even if the shutdown ends in mid-November, she said.
Graves has not heard from the federal Office of Head Start since the shutdown began. Even though reimbursement for stopgap measures would be customary, she said recent federal actions toward other service programs have made her nervous.
The program’s closure would be a “huge, huge loss for our children and families,” Graves said. Apart from being a source of food and services for kids, Champlain Valley Head Start provides child care that allows parents to stay in the workforce, Graves added.
Graves has applied for temporary state funding from the Vermont Emergency Board, which on Wednesday approved a state-funded stopgap for lost federal food assistance. Champlain Valley Head Start will need about $1 million to remain stable over the next two months, Graves said.
O’Farrell said she too plans to apply for funding from the state’s Emergency Board. NEKCA’s Head Start program’s monthly expenses total roughly $450,000.
A closure would cause an “immediate, severe impact on low-income families across our service area,” O’Farrell said. 
Federal finger pointing
Outside of Congress, pressure from nonprofit groups is starting to pick up as Head Start programs look for solutions elsewhere.
“They are working with their states, working with their counties, working with their school districts, looking within their agencies, talking to philanthropic partners, just really trying to do everything that they can to avoid children and families being the collateral damage of the political fights in Washington,” said Tommy Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association, a nonprofit that represents Head Start organizations and programs in Washington, D.C.
“They’re not gonna be able to hold that back forever,” Sheridan added.
Across the country, some Head Start programs already lost funding on Oct. 1 when their fiscal year ended, but the Saturday Nov. 1 deadline will have an even bigger effect because programs in the vast majority of states will lose their federal funding.
More than 100 organizations signed a letter released Tuesday, led by the First Five Years Fund, a nonprofit that supports child care and early education programs. In it, they asked Congress to end the shutdown.
“We cannot allow political gridlock to take away opportunities from our youngest learners and their families,” the letter reads.
But the pressure appears to have little effect on Republicans on Capitol Hill, even though lawmakers are aware that programs in their states could close. The Florida Head Start Association wrote in a press release that seven grantees won’t get a federal check on Saturday, bringing the total number of affected children in the state to almost 9,000.
“Isn’t it awful that the Democrats are doing this?” Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla., told NOTUS. Her comment is in line with Republicans’ messaging strategy of placing blame on Democrats for the shutdown as they withhold votes due to expiring health care subsidies.
In a statement to NOTUS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also tried to place the blame on Democrats.
“More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” a spokesperson for the federal department said in a statement to NOTUS.
Despite the fact that many programs for low-income families are barrelling toward losing federal funding, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and WIC, senators seem no closer to ending the shutdown stalemate.
The home state of Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., would be one of the most affected by Head Start funding lapses. 
When asked what people in Florida are saying about losing programs that help low-income families, Scott said, “They’re fed up with the Democrats shutting down the government.”

Coming the day before federal nutrition support is set to be suspended on Saturday, Horhn said the city is pledging $150,000 for meals and targeted food assistance throughout the metro area. The funding will chiefly support two nonprofits – the Community Foundation of Mississippi and supper meals provided by Jackson Public Schools.
“When neighbors are in need, we rally,” he said. 
The mayor also called on Jacksonians with the means to donate nonperishable goods and money to these efforts, noting he had already pledged $1,000 of his own money. The city funds will come from a suspended program, he said. 
“Let’s make sure no one faces an empty refrigerator or dining table,” he said. 
Fire stations throughout the city will accept donations of nonperishable goods. The National Folk Festival, set for Nov. 7-9, will also have a donation box next to the guest services booth. 
City leaders said food pantries in the metro area need volunteers. 
“One of the things that will constrain us most is if we don’t have the staff and the manpower to meet the needs,” said Jill Buckley, the executive director of Stewpot Community Services. 
In an example of the coordinated effort, Karla McCullough, executive director of the Juanita Sims Doty Foundation, said the nonprofit has over 250 volunteers who can help the pantries process food donations. She also thanked Horhn for his leadership. 
“Youth and community, those are our north stars,” she said. “So wherever they go, whatever they need, this is where we go and we provide what we can to fill the need.” 
In a press release, JPS said it was expanding its supper meal program beginning on Monday. Meals will be available from 4-5:30 p.m. at eight schools in the metro area. Students can eat for free at the schools, and adults can take a meal to go for $4.
“We have long known that our work does not end with the education of our scholars in our classrooms,” Superintendent Errick Greene said at the press conference.
Horhn called on federal lawmakers to “come to their senses” and end the government shutdown. 
“You hear the news about what’s going on with the federal shutdown, but a lot of times we don’t really connect with the impact the shutdown is having on people, on citizens, everyday folks who are just struggling from day to day to make ends meet,” he said. 
Even in times without a crisis, food insecurity is an issue in Jackson, with 33,000 people in Hinds County relying on SNAP, the mayor said. With the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill mandating changes to food assistance to include work requirements for older people and more parents with teenagers, some Jacksonians could lose SNAP even after the federal shutdown ends.
But the wholesale pause of SNAP benefits in November is an extraordinary moment, said Bill Washington, the food pantry manager at New Horizon Church, one of the largest pantries in the metro area.
“So we’ve got to do extraordinary things to overcome this situation,” he said. 
About $6.5 million comes into Hinds County every month because of SNAP, and every dollar spent has nearly double the impact on the local economy, said Jane Alexander, president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Mississippi. This means Hinds County is facing a potential loss of nearly $18 million. Grocery stores will be impacted by the SNAP suspension. So will the city’s sales tax collection. 
To counter this, Alexander said the Community Foundation of Mississippi is looking at restarting an initiative from the pandemic in which they provide about $25 on bulk grocery cards. She has already been in touch with grocery stores throughout the metro area and hopes the foundation will be able to offer the cards as soon as it has the funding. 
“The one single tenant of disaster emergency response is to try to keep the money flowing through the local economy as much as you can,” she said. 
Many food pantries in the metro area limit residents to one box a week, Alexander said, and will be quickly overwhelmed by the need. 
“For an economy that’s very fragile, it has very narrow margins already,” she said. “We want to make sure that when benefits are restored and when some of these efforts pay off, that these outlets are still available in our community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31130306/DSC_0549.jpg,,,2025-10-31 16:01:31.338899

William Lawrence, Democratic congressional candidate in Michigan’s 7th District, is holding a 30-hour vigil and food drive outside of the district office of U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), in protest of the expected lapse in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, starting on Nov. 1. 
Lawrence’s team is collecting food to donate to the Greater Lansing Food Bank, and as of about 1 p.m. Friday, had raised an additional $800 in online and cash donations since the vigil began, at that point about 19 hours prior. 
“We’re here in front of Barrett’s office because he is responsible for the SNAP benefits expiring, along with the rest of the Congressional Republicans,” Lawrence said. “If he’s not going to do his part to keep Michigan families fed, we’re gonna do so.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Tom Barrett would rather take food from the hungry than provide care to the sick,” he added. “The easy solution here is to save the Affordable Care Act and keep necessary food assistance.”

“People are going through far worse,” Larence said as it started to rain. “I’m more than happy to sit in the cold for a few hours to call attention to the fact that other people are going hungry and are going bankrupt because of their medical bills. That’s what’s at stake here, and it’s a real pleasure to draw attention to these issues.”
Another Democrat in the race to unseat Barrett, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, stopped by the vigil, which will last until midnight on Friday, to donate food. 
“I’m really happy to see all of the candidates come out in support of this, on the Democratic side, to call out Tom Barrett and ask him to show leadership with the Republicans in D.C., because all of these things are hurting the people of our community,” Brink said. “We should and we must take care of our most vulnerable.”
Kimberly Phillips, a retired nurse in the Lansing area, also brought food donations to Lawrence’s event. 
“Whatever we can do to get food out there for people who need a helping hand,” she said as to why she came out.

Around Lawrence’s food drive, messages in chalk were scrawled on the sidewalk, which were there when Lawrence and his team arrived. The chalk messages were condemned by Barrett’s office in a statement, where he said, “my congressional office in Lansing was vandalized by a group of trespassers during a political rally of left-wing activists.”
“There is a clear distinction between peaceful protest and harassment, and this failed attempt to intimidate me crossed a line and will not be tolerated,” he continued, adding that the vandalism had taken place during a rally held by Climate Action Campaign, Michigan Families for Fair Care, and Sierra Club Michigan.

Messages in chalk included “Don’t let our kids starve Tom!” and “Show your face Tom.” 
Lawrence noted that he had not yet seen Barrett while hosting his food drive, but that the Congressman’s staff had called the police on Lawrence and his team, who were seated on public property.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Most students who applied for South Carolina’s private K-12 tuition aid program this year were either already attending private school or homeschooled, according to data from the Department of Education.
The law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May provided $7,500 scholarships to 10,000 students this school year. It’s unknown exactly how many parents received state aid for tuition they previously paid for themselves. It appears the education agency didn’t actually collect that information.
Instead, the Education Scholarship Trust Fund application asked whether students were entering kindergarten, attended a public school last year, or something else — officially, “other.” Parents selected that “other” category on 59% of the 16,127 applications submitted by mid-August, according to agency data provided to the SC Daily Gazette through a public records request.
They likely attended a private school, though some may have been homeschooled, said Felicity Ropp, whose job with Palmetto Promise Institute involves helping parents sign up for the program. The law does not allow state scholarships for homeschooling.
Also unclear is how many — and which — students ended up on a waitlist. This year, the 10,000 slots were filled on a first-come, first-served basis. According to the application data, at least 10% of parents reported making too much to qualify. But the education agency has not provided a breakdown of how many applicants were deemed ineligible or other specifics about students accepted into the program, including their previous schooling.


Applicants for 2025-26
By mid-August, parents submitted applications for 16,127 students. Here’s the type of school they attended in 2024-25:

None — incoming kindergartener: 2,078
Public school: 3,692
Public charter school: 775
Other: 9,582

Source: S.C. Department of Education


It makes sense that parents of students in private school were quick to apply, said Patrick Kelly, lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
Private schools and private choice advocates were providing information to parents, and getting a scholarship would save them money, he added.
But public schools weren’t spreading the word. The details were also unknown when sign-ups started in mid-January under the previous law — just as debate on the legislation started.
“No one’s going to apply for a program they don’t know exists,” Kelly said, adding that public schools should do a better job of telling parents the money is available.
Application windows
For students getting a scholarship this year — as well as any of their siblings — the early application period for slots next school year opens Saturday, as required by the law passed in the spring. Legislators put priority windows in the law for first dibs on the state-funded scholarships.
The next application round starts Jan. 15 for students attending a public school this year, families making up to 300% of the federal poverty level, and/or children of active-duty military personnel stationed in South Carolina.
Everyone else who’s eligible can start applying Feb. 9. For next school year, that means all families with incomes up to 500% of the federal poverty level. A family of four, for example, qualifies as long as the parents’ income is no more than $160,750, according to the latest poverty guidelines, which increase annually.
By law, at least 15,000 students will be enrolled for aid in 2026-27. The scholarship amount, which rises with state increases in public school spending, is expected to be at least $7,600, according to the Department of Education.
How many students get the taxpayer aid will likely be part of next year’s budget debate. The law set 15,000 as the minimum availability for 2026-27 and beyond. If more eligible students apply, as occurred for this year’s 10,000-student cap, legislators can fund more scholarships.
Up to 1,000 ineligible SC students booted from voucher program, report finds

That is, unless another legal challenge brings payments to a halt.
A state Supreme Court ruling in September 2024 stopped payments for private tuition soon after the program’s start. Justices found those scholarships violated the state constitution’s ban on public money directly benefiting private education. Private donors paid tuition for about 800 students so they could stay in their private schools last school year.
Republican legislators made passing a law to restart the state aid their top priority for 2025. Whether the law signed in May legally skirts the constitution’s rule will likely again be a question for the state’s highest court.
Another lawsuit is coming, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association, which sued last time.
Its lawyers are still gathering and reviewing data as they seek to prove the money still provides a “direct benefit” to private schools.
“Who’s getting the money?” Crews said about the aid. “Is it truly going to families who want to move their child from public school to private school, or is it helping out private schools and their budgets?”
She had no estimate for when the association will file the suit.
Who applied
Under the previous law signed in 2023, students entering the program had to be leaving a public school or entering kindergarten.
The new law threw those limitations out the window.
As long as families meet income eligibility rules, they can apply. For the 10,000 slots this school year, families couldn’t earn more than 300% of the federal poverty level, which is $96,450 for a family of four.
SC House passes bill to revive K-12 vouchers. The bulk of this year’s money will go unused.

The scholarships will be a big help to many parents with students in private school, Ropp said.
Just because they were paying for tuition doesn’t mean they’re well off financially. They may have been scraping by to put their child in private school, she said.
The state aid can also be used for other expenses, such as tutoring and computers, she noted.
“Having any kind of financial relief is just a huge deal for these families,” Ropp said.
According to the application data, just over half of the students, or 8,500, were eligible for Medicaid. That means their parents made less than 210% of federal poverty levels, or $66,900 for a family of four. For over 10% of students, or 1,700, their parents reported incomes above this year’s limits, according to the data.
When legislators passed the 2023 law, supporters presented it as a lifeline for poor children stuck in a failing school because their parents couldn’t afford any other option. But opening it up to existing private school students changes the mission, said Sen. Russell Ott, who opposes the program.
“This is clearly not about trying to help poor kids escape failing schools,” the St. Matthews Democrat said. “What this has morphed into is subsidization of private schools and doing it with public dollars.”
Sen. Wes Climer said his support was never limited to any income bracket. He wants to expand the program even further to make all children eligible for a state scholarship — what’s known as universal school choice.
“The purpose of the program is to provide for robust competition in the education arena,” said the Rock Hill Republican, who’s running for Congress.

According to the application data, the parents of about 70% of the students reported their children would attend a private school this year. Less than 15% reported wanting to use the money to enroll in a different public school. The rest marked “other,” without clarifying.
If most of the students accepted into the program used it to pay private tuition, those schools might increase tuition, pricing out the students least able to pay the difference, Kelly said.
During debate on the legislation, Republicans repeatedly rejected proposals to cap tuition or bar price hikes on students in the program.
“This time next year, no one should be surprised that the average private school tuition went up in South Carolina,” Kelly said. “That’s the next step.”
Where the money went
For the first half of last school year, Best Buy received far more money than any other single vendor, with families spending nearly $1.4 million there. Another $240,000 went to Staples, according to data from the education agency, which stops on Jan. 17.
That’s the date Rep. Neal Collins, R-Easley, requested a report to share for debate on the House floor. The SC Daily Gazette asked for spending figures through the end of the school year, but the agency wanted more than $2,300 to provide it.
About half of the report’s spending came after the state Supreme Court’s Sept. 11, 2024, ruling, which immediate stopped payments to private schools. The rest of the law stayed intact, allowing families to use their money for other eligible expenses, such as computers.

Even though payments for private tuition had to stop just one month into the school year, a handful of private schools were among the top recipients of money the first semester.
Among schools, Westgate Christian School in Spartanburg topped the list at $63,236, indicating a lot of its students received scholarships. Tuition at Westgate ranges from $5,600 for elementary school to $5,800 for high school, according to the school’s website. Administrators did not respond to a request for comment.
“It’s up to the parents to decide where to send their students,” Ropp said.
Who’s running the program
The new law added a trustee to oversee the program as a response to the state Supreme Court’s concerns. Putting a third-party trustee in charge of scholarship transfers, supporters argued, gets around the constitution’s ban of a “direct benefit” to private schools. Whether justices agree will be for them to decide.
The Department of Education selected Columbia accountant Mark Hobbs on May 28, just three weeks after the law was signed, according to a contract the SC Daily Gazette obtained through a public records request.
It shows that accountants at Hobbs’ firm, The Hobbs Group, will receive $400 per hour to work on parents’ accounts. All other staff will make $125 to $200 per hour.
The agency did not respond to a request for Hobbs’ resume or answer questions about how many people applied.
The law allows the trustee to take up to 5% of the trust fund as payment for overseeing the accounts. The agency must report the actual dollar figure to the Legislature’s budget writers by Dec. 31.
Parents access the scholarship money through an online portal. They do not actually receive any dollars, and they can’t get reimbursed. They must direct through the portal where to send the money.
Hobbs’ job is to move the money to parents’ accounts through four equal installments and then pay the approved vendors, according to his contract.

A retired state judge on Friday denied requests from embattled McKinley County District Attorney Bernadine Martin for an extension in her case. Rather, Martin must respond by early November to the New Mexico Department of Justice’s petition to remove her from office in advance of a three-day trial starting Dec. 1.
The state Supreme Court ruled earlier this month it would move forward with a trial in response to Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s August petition, which cited alleged violations of state law by Martin, among other concerns.
For instance, the petition alleges Martin created a hostile workplace environment; failed to prepare or subpoena witnesses in McKinley County; breached procurement law, despite a prior settlement with state ethics officials; had an “improper reliance” on contract attorneys; and said she continued to work in private legal practice while serving as district attorney, in violation of state law.
In September, New Mexico Department of Justice attorneys took over prosecution of two cases in the Eleventh Judicial District, alleging Martin had improperly dismissed the cases and failed to send them to an outside prosecutor.
State law for the removal of public officials requires a trial without a jury before the Supreme Court justices and establishes the court’s decision as final.
The state’s Supreme Court appointed Special Master Alan Malott, a retired Albuquerque district judge, to act as a trial judge.
In a virtual hearing on Friday, Malott told Martin’s attorney Kathryn Hardy that the court could not accommodate the request for an additional 30 days to respond to the state’s requests for documents, saying the case, which he called a matter of “extreme public interest, has “very tight timelines.”
Malott also noted that any formal objection to the Supreme Court’s order to hold a three-day trial in Santa Fe beginning on Dec. 1, or any other deadlines, would be due by Tuesday, Nov. 4.
Martin has denied all allegations in court filings. A voicemail and text message to Martin were not returned before publication.
In court filings, Martin has argued that the state law allowing for removal of district attorneys should only apply to her current term, which started in January of 2025, after her reelection to office in 2024. She argued it would be “obviously unjust” for the New Mexico Supreme Court to hear evidence “for misconduct [that] may have occurred during a previous term.” She further said the removal of district attorneys should be left either to the state Legislature or voters “when the public official stands for reelection.”
The New Mexico Department of Justice has disagreed, citing state laws that district attorneys may be removed from office in a court proceeding, for certain reasons including: “failure, neglect or refusal” to perform the duties of the office.

“This is an opportunity for all of us together as Iowans, to care for our neighbors in need,” Gov. Kim Reynolds said Friday about the state’s decision to help Iowa food banks as they support Iowans impacted by the anticipated lapse in federal nutrition funding. 
Due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, have been informed they would not receive November benefit allotments, if the shutdown persists. 
Iowa food banks said they anticipate “unprecedented” need, across the state, as SNAP benefits cards are empty. Reynolds said the state’s pledged match, along with plans to deploy National Guard troops to help with food distribution, will provide “interim support” to Iowa’s six food banks.

Reynolds joined other GOP lawmakers in blaming the shutdown on congressional Democrats, who have withheld their votes on Republican stopgap spending measures in an effort to address the expiration of tax credits that help reduce the cost of health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act.
“Dems in the United States Senate don’t seem to care that everyday Americans are suffering while they force the shutdown into another month,” Reynolds said. “We do care here in Iowa, and I know that Iowans do too.” 
Beginning Saturday, existing state funds from the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services will be used to match monetary donations to Iowa food banks, up to $1 million.

Reynolds said she believes the $1 million match will be met based on the “generosity of Iowans and corporate partners” in the state. 
Already, several local businesses like Big Grove Brewery, Hy-Vee, Fareway and Iowa Pork Producers Association have contributed, or pledged, more than $130,000 in cash and food donations to food banks. 
Iowa’s three Medicaid managed care organizations have each committed to donate $100,000 across the six food banks. 
Some states plan to utilize their funds to continue issuing SNAP benefits during the government shutdown. Asked why she chose to match food bank donations instead of using emergency state funds for SNAP, Reynolds pointed to the ongoing shutdown.
“It’s ridiculous,” she said. “Democrats could have voted to keep the government open, and they did not,” the governor said. 
Reynolds opposed the Senate Democrats’ use of a government shutdown as a “negotiating tactic” to try and extend funding for the Affordable Care Act, which she called the “unaffordable” care act. 
“We need to get the government open, we need to continue the budget as is, and then come to the table and negotiate what they want to talk about moving forward,” Reynolds said. 
Democratic attorneys general from nearly two dozen states have sued the Trump administration, urging it to use U.S. Department of Agriculture contingency funds to keep the program afloat during the shutdown. Reynolds also called this lawsuit “ridiculous.”
Iowa alone receives close to $45 million in SNAP benefits each month, according to USDA. 
“We can’t just shift it to the state,” Reynolds said. “States don’t have the funds to be able to do that.” 
Iowa Democrats submitted a letter Thursday to Reynolds and Attorney General Brenna Bird, urging Reynolds to take “immediate action” to protect SNAP benefits in the state and Bird to join other states in the lawsuit calling for the use of contingency funds.
Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, Republican leaders are “playing political games” with the country’s well-being.
“Legislative Democrats have spoken in unison and outlined to Gov. Reynolds and Attorney General Bird a plan for state government to step into the gap and prevent Iowans – our friends and neighbors – from going hungry.”
National Guard deployment 
In addition to matching monetary donations to the food bank, Reynolds said National Guard troops will be deployed “as needed” to conduct food distribution missions. 
Adjutant General of the Iowa National Guard Stephen Osborn said the guard will take direction from HHS, but he anticipated the soldiers would help with the movement of food across the state and packing boxes of food for distribution. 
Osborn said he will first ask for volunteer soldiers, but will bring soldiers and airmen onto active state duty. 
While National Guardsmen on federal missions are unpaid during the government shutdown, Reynolds said these soldiers would be paid since it is a state mission. 
In addition to soldier support, the state’s Volunteer Iowa division is working to gather volunteers for food banks and pantries across the state. 
Reynolds has advocated for reform to the SNAP program in the past. In May, her proposed waiver to eliminate foods like candy and soft drinks from SNAP eligible food items was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Reynolds said Friday that SNAP, and other federal support programs, have “so much fraud and abuse” that there is a risk of not having the funds to “help those who really need it.” 
According to USDA, nearly 42 million Americans, or 12.3% of residents, received SNAP benefits in 2024. The program serves nearly 270,000 Iowans each month. 
Reynolds said a program of that size needs a “comprehensive review.” 
“My hope is that first of all, the Senate Democrats will stop keeping the government closed and open it back up and really start having those kind of conversations about what we do moving forward,” Reynolds said.

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]POINT PLEASANT — Fox News host Sean Hannity riled up a crowd in this Ocean County town Thursday by reading off polls that show the governor’s race in New Jersey is a dead heat between Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill. 
“I came up here because this is a huge political earthquake. It will rock the nation. It will reverberate all across the country. I really believe it, and I’m fascinated by it, and the country’s fascinated by it,” Hannity said ahead of the taping of a town hall for his nightly show at the Crystal Point Yacht Club. 
Once Ciattarelli joined him on stage, Hannity asked the gubernatorial hopeful how he’s feeling going into Election Day on Tuesday.
“All I can tell you is when I go around the state, the energy is electric. The reception of minority communities has been overwhelmingly positive. And when Democratic mayors across the state are endorsing the Republican nominee, it does a world of good,” Ciattarelli said. 
Hannity’s appearance attracted an enthusiastic crowd. The influential conservative commentator told the crowd before the taping began that he had spoken to President Donald Trump and confirmed Trump would be watching the town hall later.
Hannity asked the crowd of 200 people if they could trust Sherrill. They booed and said “no.” He also referenced allegations that Sherrill was caught up in a cheating scandal during her time at the Naval Academy (she did not participate in her 1994 graduation ceremony, an act she says was punishment for not turning in her classmates).
“We invited Mikie Sherrill on this program to respond to these allegations, but her team just never gets back to us. They must be very busy,” Hannity said.
A spokesperson for the Sherrill campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Most public polling shows Ciattarelli trailing behind Sherrill by single digits. They’re vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat who will leave office in January.
Both campaigns have brought out big names for the final stretch of the election cycle. Ciattarelli has made stops with Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Florida) and Vivek Ramaswamy of Ohio, and held a tele-rally with Trump last week. Sherrill is set to appear with former President Barack Obama in Newark on Saturday.
Throughout the hour-long taping with Hannity, Ciattarelli repeated much of his regular stump speech, touting his plans to do away with the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, get rid of cashless bail, pull out of the regional greenhouse gas initiative, and prevent wind turbines from being constructed off the Jersey Shore. 
“Executive order No. 1, on day one, no town in this state will be a sanctuary city. We will not be a sanctuary state,” Ciattarelli said. 
He added that many of Murphy’s policies were done by executive order, like the Immigrant Trust Directive, and never became law, which means he can do away with them immediately.
“Having sanctuary cities and us being a sanctuary state encourages illegal immigration, and it handcuffs our local police in certain ways. We’re not doing that,” he said.
Hannity criticized New Jersey’s high taxes, reading off the corporate business tax, gas tax, inheritance tax, and top individual tax rate. 
“I refuse to be the governor of that state. We’re going to change that when we win, I’m telling you that right now,” Ciattarelli said.
The two men were joined by Harris Faulkner, a Fox News anchor and New Jersey resident. She said New Jerseyans are worried about affordability, lamented about her utility bills, and griped about a gas station in Edgewater that charges $5 a gallon. The Lukoil on River Road in Edgewater was charging $4.55 a gallon for premium gas on Friday (regular was $2.89).
“It feels like they’re trafficking in high taxes, because the current governor said when he ran the last time, ‘If taxes are your issue, then New Jersey is not for you,’” she said.
Ciattarelli stressed the importance of attracting independent voters and people who typically only turn out for presidential elections every four years.
“We say to them, ‘Do you love this state? Are you angry about everything that’s going on? You got to turn out in the governor’s race too,’” he said. “We’ve done a magnificent job.”

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Pat Hurley Thornburg, a former state legislator from Randolph County, wants state government retirees to get cost-of-living adjustments, often called COLAs. 
As a member of the boards that make recommendations on state and local government pensions, she’s in a position to push for them. 
Thornburg came to the trustees meeting Thursday prepared with a chart showing that retired state employees and teachers received COLAs nearly every year from 1981 to 2008. From 2009 on, they’ve received small increases, one-time bonuses, or nothing at all. 
“I don’t understand why it happens,” she said. “It really bothers me.” 
Retirees have lost purchasing power to rising inflation, she said. 
The state pension trustees could be in a position to recommend that the legislature grant state retiree cost-of-living increases in the next budget. It all depends on how pension fund returns perform through December.
Before 2008, it was easy for the pension fund to reach its earnings targets. That allowed the financial breathing room to increase pension checks for retired state government employees and teachers. 
That changed with the 2008 financial crisis. 
“We were in a very different economic environment,” said Sam Watts, executive director of the NC Retirement Systems. 
For years, North Carolina’s pension returns ranked at or near the bottom compared to other states’ pensions. But earnings have improved since January, with investment returns hitting 10.8% through Sept. 30. That’s close to the average performance of other large public pension plans. 
The state and local pension funds have separate trustee boards, but the boards meet at the same time and some members serve on both boards. 
The state pension board tells the legislature whether there’s enough money to finance cost-of-living adjustments from the fund for state retirees and teachers. It makes the recommendation, but legislators don’t have to accept it. 
The local government pension board makes decisions on COLAs for those retirees. 
Trustees must balance a number of factors in determining whether the respective funds can afford to pay COLAs, including investment returns, liabilities, and salary increases for people still working.
The boards will make those decisions in January. 
State Treasurer Brad Briner says as it looks now, it’s more likely that the state pension trustees will be able to recommend the legislature include COLAs in the next state budget than it is for local pension trustees to give local government retirees cost-of-living increases.
Neither the state retiree pension plan nor the local government retiree plan are what’s called “fully funded,” meaning that they have enough to pay current beneficiaries as well as meet future obligations to people still working who will qualify for pensions. But the local government plan is a few points further from the mark than the state retiree plan. 
Tim O’Connell, whose Retired Government Employee Association represents both state and local retirees, reminded trustees that local government retirees have gone nearly 20 years without COLAs.
“It’s been a tough 15, 20 years,” he said. 
“Everything you can do in this room, please do it for the retirees,” he said. “We’re working for the future as well, but the current retirees really bear the burden of some tough times.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4832-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-10-31 15:17:06.194158

The lawmakers’ request, sent in a letter to the Virginia Office of the State Inspector General Sept. 29, stems from campaign ads for Miyares and public events that seek to tie specific reoffenders to Democratic opponent Jay Jones’ past vote in favor of a law that allows inmates to trim their time behind bars. 
The letter was signed by Sens. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, and Dels. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, and Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax. Together, they expressed a series of concerns: whether Miyares had access to confidential information and if it violated laws to disclose the details, whether the information sharing was a “use of state resources” for campaign activities, and whether public confidence could be undermined that release decisions and sentence credits are determined by law, “not by political convenience.” 
The inclusion of a particular offender’s status, “coupled with the Attorney General’s claims regarding earned sentence credits, suggest information not otherwise available to the public,” the lawmakers wrote. “This position clearly indicated that the information could not be disclosed under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act.”
Dubbed Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits, the five-year old law has allowed inmates with good behavior the ability to be released early. Though it passed in 2020 — when Miyares and Jones were both members of the legislature — its implementation was blocked for years by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, at Miyares’ request. With last year’s reconviction rate at 19% and reincarceration rate at 5%, the program is under fresh scrutiny this year amid the Miyares and Jones matchup. 
Despite the lawmakers’ request, OSIG said that it can’t investigate the data sharing between VADOC and Miyares because Miyares, the governor or a grand jury would have to request such an inquiry, per state code. 
“We were trying to get them to investigate the VADOC side of it,” Simon said in a recent call. 
 Inconsistent information

In ads and on the campaign trail, Miyares claimed that 70 Virginians had died as a result of the program, but a Cardinal News analysis of data from his office refutes that claim. 
Miyares spokesperson Shaun Kenney told Cardinal that absent a state-directed study, “VADOC remains partially equipped with the tools or resources to accurately measure the full impact of EESC and is only able to offer a fractional view by which the public can ascertain its impact.”
What data has been shared with Miyares and the media offers some insights, however. 
VADOC data shared with The Mercury by House Republican Caucus communications director Garren Shipley shows percentages of EESC recipients who reoffended broken down by different types and whether or not they were reincarcerated — but it does not identify specific offenders by name. In that data, reoffenses for murder or manslaughter were minimal, much like the Cardinal inquiry found.   
Records requested by The Richmond Times-Dispatch — which prompted lawmakers’ letter to OSIG — yielded a response from VADOC that qualification for EESC was a “protected record” and that a list of recipients’ names “does not exist.” 
The Times-Dispatch had been looking into reoffender Tabias McClain, who should have been disqualified from using EESC due to a malicious wounding charge from when he was a minor, but was able to use the program because the charge didn’t transfer over when he aged out of Department of Juvenile Justice and into VADOC. Miyares singled McClain out during a July press conference hosted with the family of a woman McClain hit and killed with his car while speeding through a residential neighborhood after his release.
Meanwhile, The Mercury had asked for information about serial sex offender Daniel Vanover, a man also mentioned at Miyares’ conference and the subject of advertisements for Miyares’ re-election campaign. The ads claim was Vanover was able to rape a minor “because of Jay Jones’ law.” 
When asked by The Mercury, VADOC confirmed that Vanover received EESC while serving a 2022 sentence for a probation violation — the year the sex crimes happened after his release. However, court sentencing records indicate the rapes occured between May 9, 2022 and Dec. 8, 2022 — over two months before VADOC confirmed his Aug. 17, 2022 release date in emails. 
Additional court records that are available in an online database also indicate Vanover’s sexual assaults of a minor began on May 9, 2022.
Spokespeople for VADOC did not further elaborate when asked about the discrepancy in the dates, but said that the record “reflects the data of the offense for all 11 counts of rape as a range” for those dates. No additional documentation was provided and calls to VADOC director Chad Dotson went unanswered. Multiple calls to Vanover’s defense attorney from that time also went unanswered. 
While further details about the discrepancy could not be gleaned by the time of this publication, there still may have been a reason, American University professor TaLisa Carter explained.
She said “the first and last dates don’t necessarily sync with the first and last incidents” and noted how the criminal justice system is “inclusive rather than exclusive.” 
 Politics vs. people

Though questions have lingered among journalists and lawmakers alike, the highly politicized early release program still stands as campaign fodder — to the dismay of EESC beneficiaries who have successfully reformed their lives and worry the door they walked through could eventually be closed behind them. 
Lynchburg-area resident and former inmate Reece Neenan, who used EESC, previously described the new chapter of life as a “whirlwind of goodness” as he’s landed a stable job, reconnected with family and started college. 
“Of course” there are fellow EESC beneficiaries who have reoffended, Neenan said. 
“But for the most part, people I know out here are staying out of trouble because it’s easy now.”
Hampton Roads resident Sam Harris, who started a nonprofit and was recently hired in Suffolk’s public defender office to counsel people navigating the criminal justice system, told The Mercury that he wants to “be a face for second chances.” 
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, has previously suggested Miyares and the governor may have tried to “undermine the effectiveness of the program” to fit political narratives.
When The Mercury recently examined the program’s effectiveness since fully implemented in the past year, neither Jones or Miyares followed through on requests for interviews.
In his own letter to Dotson earlier this summer, Surovell suggested the legislature explore ways to ensure EESC functions appropriately rather than dismantle it. As courts have previously ruled that VADOC unlawfully kept certain inmates behind bars in violation of EESC, paired with Miyares’ and Youngkin’s previous blocking of the program, Surovell posited that the “whipsawing” had made it difficult for VADOC to “plan and implement the existing system.”
Democratic colleagues Simon, Ebbin, Watts and Locke wrote in their letter to OSIG that they are “deeply concerned” Miyares may have pressured VADOC “to adjust its practices in ways that advantage” his campaign. 
“If true, this would represent a profound breach of the public trust,” they wrote.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Indiana philanthropic organizations and an anonymous donor have pooled $1 million to launch a food aid fund, the United Way of Central Indiana announced Thursday — with federal grocery benefits for low-income Americans set to run dry Nov. 1 amid a government shutdown.
“Food is not a privilege; it’s a basic human right,” said Fred Payne, United Way of Central Indiana’s president and CEO. “United Way is proud to stand alongside its partners and other funders to respond to this critical need and help hard-working families put food on the table.”
GOP squashes food aid for Hoosiers impacted by SNAP disruption

More than 571,000 Hoosiers were receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as of September, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
Approximately 150,000 SNAP recipients reside in central Indiana alone — Boone, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Marion, Morgan and Putnam counties — according a news release. About half of participants are in families with children.
Beginning next week, the new Central Indiana Food Relief Fund will distribute the money to groups that supply food to hundreds of pantries across the region and state: Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Midwest Food Bank of Indiana and Second Helpings.
The fund was launched with a $500,000 donation from an anonymous donor, which was intended to encourage the community to match or exceed that amount, according to the release.
The Indianapolis Foundation, Lilly Endowment and the Lilly Foundation contributed, quickly meeting that match.
Indiana residents are also encourage to donate to the fund directly — United Way will manage the account, but 100% of gifts will be distributed — or to the three food organizations.
“Philanthropy alone cannot fill this gap,” Payne said. “But we are calling on our community right now to join us, support our food banks and help our neighbors in need.”
Those in need of food assistance can use Indy Hunger Network’s Community Compass to find free food and groceries near them, along with other resources.

In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the cutoff would be effective for November benefits.Talwani, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, called the administration’s conclusion it can’t provide SNAP funding “erroneous,” and said the reserve fund was sufficient for SNAP benefits to flow to states and the vendors that add money to debit-like cards issued to the program’s beneficiaries that are used to purchase groceries. The law creating the program mandated that benefits continue, she said.“Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds,” Talwani wrote.Talwani ordered the administration to say by Monday whether it would provide at least partial benefits for November.The 25 states that sued were Massachusetts, California, Arizona, Minnesota, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state, Wisconsin Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. The District of Columbia also sued. In Rhode Island, where the judge granted a temporary restraining order, the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which was among those bringing the suit, praised the move.“A federal court today granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful effort to halt the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the ongoing government shutdown,” the group said.”The decision ensures that millions of children, seniors, veterans, and families will continue to receive essential food assistance while the case proceeds.”The judge in that case, John James McConnell Jr., said the administration’s actions violated a key federal administrative law against arbitrary and capricious executive action and federal spending laws “by disregarding Congress’s direction that SNAP must continue operating,” Democracy Forward said.McConnell also was appointed by Obama.Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.This is a developing report and will be updated.",,,,2025-10-31 14:57:04.840890

Idaho Attorney General’s Office asks judge to dismiss fired attorney’s whistleblower lawsuit

In September, Idaho 4th District Judge Jonathan Medema dismissed Huang’s lawsuit, preventing the case from going to a jury trial. In his ruling, the judge wrote “no rational juror could find” that Huang “had proven any of her claims.” 
Many of her lawsuit’s claims revolved around Labrador’s investigation into the Department of Health and Welfare’s handling of $72 million in child care grants. 
In her appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court filed on Oct. 23, Huang’s attorneys wrote that the ruling “erred by holding that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact” related to her lawsuit’s claim under the state’s whistleblower law, called Idaho’s Protection of Public Employees Act. 
Labrador’s spokesperson, Damon Sidur, declined to comment on the appeal. The Attorney General’s Office has argued Huang was fired for misconduct.
Hours before Huang’s firing in March 2023, she expressed ethical concerns about the ethics of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office new management, according to records released in the lawsuit. 
Before firing her, Labrador didn’t look into Huang’s concerns, he said in a deposition. 
“I had no concerns. It was clear that she was not acting in good faith. And it was clear that she was already preparing for litigation,” Labrador said.
Huang filed her lawsuit in September 2023.

To understand the resolve of salmon advocates — and the frustration so many of us felt when the federal government recently reneged on a historic agreement, reigniting litigation — it’s helpful to review the legal history associated with protecting Columbia Basin salmon.
In a recent story about plaintiffs returning to court to protect Columbia Basin salmon, the Washington State Standard described the court battle as “long-running.” So true. 
The initial shot was fired in 1991 after Snake River sockeye salmon became the first Columbia Basin salmonid to be listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act . That listing requires federal agencies to ensure the protection and recovery of the fish. 
Federal agencies involved with the federal dams in the Columbia Basin include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (which operates dams on the lower Snake and lower Columbia rivers), the Bonneville Power Administration (which markets power from the dams), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which issues rulings on whether fish protection and recovery plans comply with the Endangered Species Act).
Since 1992, they’ve put forth no fewer than eight plans for operating the hydropower system while ostensibly protecting threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin. (By 1999, 12 more salmon and steelhead stocks had been listed under the Endangered Species Act.)
Over three decades of litigation, three different federal district judges have declared six different federal dam management plans illegal for their failure to protect salmon and steelhead. That includes every plan since 2000. The very first plan was invalidated in 1994 by U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh, who proclaimed that the “situation literally cries out for a major overhaul,” but found that the federal plan failed to deliver any such fundamental change.
Fast forward to 2005, when District Court Judge James Redden struck down a 2004 federal plan, a plan he later called a “cynical and transparent attempt to avoid responsibility for the decline of listed Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead.” 
In the following years, new plans were issued by the federal agencies in 2008, 2010, and 2014. Each was promptly struck down. After Redden’s retirement, Judge Michael Simon struck down the 2014 plan. Twice, the federal agencies tried appealing the district court rulings to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twice, the circuit court upheld the district court.
The most recent plan, issued in the waning days of the first Trump administration, was promptly challenged, and was headed for the same fate as the prior plans, when the Biden administration decided not to defend the indefensible and entered into settlement talks with plaintiffs and Northwest states and tribes, with input from other stakeholders as well.
Those talks led to the adoption in 2023 of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, a package of investments, changes in dam operations, and studies on replacing the services of four especially lethal dams on the lower Snake River (so that the dams could be breached and 140 miles of free-flowing river restored). Litigation was stayed while that agreement was in place.
In June of this year, the second Trump administration unilaterally renounced the agreement, leaving nothing to replace it save the illegal 2020 Trump salmon plan. So, it’s back to court.
In various rulings over the years, the courts have ordered modest changes in dam operations, but the federal agencies have repeatedly refused to produce the “major overhaul” Judge Marsh called for 31 years ago. 
As a result, not one of the 13 listed populations is on a path to recovery. Despite misleading claims from federal agencies, public utilities, and other river user groups, most of those stocks are on a path to extinction.
It’s past time for the court to find a way to end more than three decades of stubborn evasion of the law by the federal agencies and direct them to, finally, produce a plan that will lead to restoration of abundant, harvestable populations of these iconic creatures.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/salmon.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 14:57:04.840890

The fiscal impact in fiscal year 2027 is $340.5 million.
House Bill 1389 expands insurance coverage for diagnostic mammograms.
Stitt vetoed the measure, but lawmakers overrode it.
Another measure, Senate Bill 1019, prohibits insurers from putting a time limit on the use of anesthesia during a medical or surgical procedure. It also bars insurers from restricting coverage or payment for time under anesthesia.
Senate Bill 176 gives women access to a six-month prescription of birth control.
House Bill 2263 makes it illegal to use a cell phone in a school zone or work zone. It has  exceptions for hands-free or voice-operated functions and to communicate with emergency or medical personnel.
Violators are subject to a fine of not more than $100.
Lawmakers overrode Stitt’s veto of the measure.
House Bill 2674 creates the Statewide Official Compensation Commission to set the salaries of statewide elected officers, such as the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. The commission is prohibited from reducing salaries that were in effect as of Jan. 1, 2025.
Senate Bill 50 provides for a sales tax exemption for firearm and gun safety devices. Safety devices include a gun safe, lock box, trigger lock and barrel lock.
Lawmakers return to the Capitol on Feb. 2. 
It will be Stitt’s final session due to term limits.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As Trump administration officials move to suspend federal food assistance for 42 million Americans starting Saturday, New Jersey residents looking to food pantries for help have plenty of options.
About 813,000 low-income New Jersey residents across more than 436,000 households are expected to lose benefits they receive under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps.
Need help? New Jersey food banks can connect you to a food pantry near you:

The Community Food Bank of New Jersey partners with more than 800 agencies and community groups that run food pantries in Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, and Union counties. Search by zip code for food pantries in those counties here.
The Food Bank of South Jersey has a searchable map here of over 150 food distribution sites in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem counties, as well as a list of locations of mobile and school food pantries.
Fulfill provides food to nearly 300 pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, group homes, and more in Ocean and Monmouth counties. Check out Fulfill’s list of food pantries and soup kitchens here and mobile food pantry sites here.
Mercer Street Friends in Trenton partners with more than 100 pantries in Central Jersey. They have a free food-finder tool here.
Norwescap provides supplies for food pantries, soup kitchens, and child care and senior centers in Warren, Hunterdon, and Sussex counties. For Warren, look here, Sussex here, and Hunterdon here.
To find food assistance through the Southern Regional Food Distribution Center, which is based in Vineland, call 856-327-3145.

The state lists food pantries in 18 of New Jersey’s 21 counties here.
Many universities — including Rutgers, Rowan, and Ramapo — have food pantries on campus. Many are open to staff and administrators, as well as students.
Several counties direct residents to food assistance on their websites, including:

Bergen County lists food pantries in about 40 towns here.
Camden County lists pantries, home-delivered meals, related resources, and even a bagel cafe offering free bagels during the federal government shutdown here.
Cape May County offers this list of pantries.
Essex County lists eight pages of food pantries and soup kitchens here.
Gloucester County lists 10 churches and groups that provide food assistance here.
Hunterdon County’s pantries are listed here.
Middlesex County has a 29-page list of food assistance resources here.
Morris County lists its food pantries, meal services, and volunteer shopper programs here.
Somerset County offers this list of food assistance programs.
Union County lists about 50 pantries and kitchens here.
Warren County has more than 25 pantries, from Allamuchy to Washington, here.

Catholic Charities also runs food pantries in Dover, Franklin, Trenton, Brick, Burlington, Paterson, Phillipsburg, and more.
The New Jersey Food Council has also put together a list of groups and agencies that provide food assistance information and resources for shoppers affected by the SNAP funding lapse.
People who need assistance are recommended to call first, because hours vary. While some sites welcome walk-ins, others require appointments and may ask for proof of residency and/or income. Some distribute pre-packed bags of groceries, while others are set up more like supermarkets, where visitors can select what they want.
Most food pantries, soup kitchens, and other programs that help people in need welcome both financial donations and volunteers to stock shelves, distribute food, serve meals, and help with holiday drives.
The government’s SNAP suspension comes during the fifth week of the government shutdown. The Trump administration has held a hard line on funding for the program, refusing to release contingency funds meant to ensure payments continue through shutdowns, as a way to force Democrats to agree to a GOP plan to reopen the government.
State officials rushed $42.5 million in already-budgeted state funding to the state’s six biggest food banks on Friday to better prepare for the surge of visitors expected at food pantries and soup kitchens. 
A coalition of states, including New Jersey, has sued the federal government over the SNAP lapse.
The fate of federal benefits paid through the federal Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, program also remains uncertain. But New Jersey Department of Health officials said this week they expect funding for WIC benefits and services will continue without interruption through November. About 186,000 women, infants, and children were enrolled in WIC in New Jersey in 2024, according to Advocates for Children of New Jersey.

(Photo courtesy of Tiger Rag) LSU is parting ways with its athletics director hours after Gov. Jeff Landry publicly blasted him at a news conference and in a series of local and national media appearances this week.  
Scott Woodward is the sixth top administrator at the university to leave amid tense political circumstances. His exit follows that of President William Tate, Provost Roy Haggerty, LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, chief administrative officer Kimberly Lewis and general counsel Winston DeCuir. 
Tate, Lewis and DeCuir are Black and left their posts as Landry pushed to remove the university away from diversity, equity and inclusion policy. Their departures constituted a purge of nearly every top Black administrator at the university. Several deans have also left, including Alena Allen, the first Black dean of the LSU Law Center.

Woodward’s downfall had been rumored for months. 
While adept with those on both sides of the aisle, Woodward’s own political history, having begun his career as a lobbyist, placed him at odds with the arch-conservative Landry, observers noted. 
Landry hit Woodward with both barrels after the weekend firing of football coach Brian Kelly after a resounding loss to Texas A&M. Kelly’s dismissal put LSU on the hook for the $54 million buyout provision in his contract. 
Landry hosted several board members, university officials and athletics administrators Sunday at the Governor’s Mansion to discuss Kelly’s contract. Neither Woodward nor interim LSU President Matt Lee were included in those discussions. 
“No, I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting the next coach,” Landry said at a news conference Wednesday. “Hell, I’ll let Donald Trump select it before I let him do it.”
LSU Board of Supervisors member John Carmouche, a Landry appointee who chairs the board’s athletics subcommittee, denied Landry’s involvement in the decision to fire Woodward. 
“The governor is worried about the state of Louisiana. His concern had to do with the state contract,” Carmouche said.
Landry has said his interest in LSU’s coaching search protecting Louisiana taxpayers. He’s pointed to language in Kelly’s contract he said “makes the State liable for any debt” if private donors can’t or won’t cover the $54 million buyout.


As a public university, Landry is correct that the university, as a subdivision of the state, is ultimately liable. LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said Friday private donors and self-generated athletics revenue would cover Kelly’s buyout. 
While not tax dollars, the athletic department’s self-generated revenue is public money. All public universities in Louisiana like LSU are primarily funded with self-generated revenue, such as tuition and fee revenue. The spending of that revenue has to be approved by the legislature. Of the LSU System’s $1.2 billion budget for the current fiscal year, more than $800 million comes from self-generated revenue. 
Significant concern has been voiced recently at LSU over growing buyouts for college coaches. 
At a September meeting of the Board of Supervisors, Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Landry appointee and major campaign donor, brought up the financial impact to the university of buying out poorly performing coaches. It cost $17 million for the university to part ways with Ed Orgeron in the middle of the 2021 season. Mallet argued LSU should be the first to break the mold and drop the buyouts.
Landry has suggested LSU use an incentive-based contract to hire its next football coach, rather one with a guaranteed payout if the person is fired before their deal expires.  
Verge Ausberry, who was named interim athletics director Thursday, said the LSU board has not placed any constraints on him with regards to contract structure when tasking him to find Kelly’s replacement.
“I was told to get the best football coach there is, and don’t worry about that at all,” Ausberry said. “So my thing is, we’re going to go out there together as a team and get the best contract, get the best coach we have, and whatever it takes to get that person here, we will do.” 
Ballard said the search for Kelly’s replacement would not slow down for the hiring of the next president. The winning candidate for that position is slated to be announced Tuesday after three days of campus visits by the three finalists: McNeese State President Wade Rousse, former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins and University of Alabama Provost James Dalton. 
“Verge is going to move forward and knows what he needs to do,” Ballard said. “But depending on how that works out and when the new president starts … the new president will absolutely have input and hopefully hit the ground running.” 
Though he said his only focus is on hiring a football coach, Ausberry is considered to be a contender to replace Woodward on a permanent basis. A former player on the LSU football team in the mid-1980s, he has risen through the ranks of the athletic department over 24 years, the past six as its executive deputy director.
LSU suspended Ausberry from his job for 30 days without pay in 2021 for failing to properly report that LSU football player Drake Davis had admitted to Ausberry in 2018 that he had punched his girlfriend. 
Before that suspension, Ausberry was part of an LSU presidential search committee in 2020 but resigned when questions arose about what consequences he might face as part of his role in Title IX violations at the university. 


Landry’s involvement in forcing out Woodward and Kelly is not the first time he has taken an interest in LSU athletics. 
Last year, the governor called for universities to strip scholarships from athletes who didn’t participate in pregame national anthem ceremonies. His stance came after LSU women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey was criticized in conservative circles when her team was not on the floor for the anthem before a high-profile NCAA Tournament game against Iowa. It is commonplace for college basketball and football teams to be in their locker rooms at that time.
Mulkey, who Woodward hired away from Baylor University in 2021, did not appear for a routine postgame recap with reporters after her team’s Thursday night exhibition game against Langston. In her place, assistant coach Bob Starkey was asked by a reporter to explain her absence.
“Yeah, she’s heartbroken,” Starkey said.    
Also in 2024, Landry called on LSU to resume its tradition bringing its live mascot, Mike, to the sidelines of Tiger Stadium for football games. When LSU declined, Landry arranged to rent a tiger, named Omar Bradley, from a Florida wildlife center to attend the LSU-Alabama game. The Crimson Tide wallopped LSU, 42-13, and Landry was criticized by fans who said he brought bad luck to the team. 
Landry was also displeased with Woodward’s refusal to rehire men’s basketball coach Will Wade, who Woodward had fired in 2022 amid a recruiting scandal, Yahoo Sports reported. Wade was hired at McNeese State, which played twice in the NCAA Tournament during his stay, and he is starting his first season this year at North Carolina State.

Ibarra, Deborah Brennan, Phoebe Huss and Chrissa Olson",,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/cal-fresh-snap-november-cliff/,More than five million low-income Californians are expected to lose their CalFresh food assistance benefits starting Saturday. States are suing the Trump administration to reinstate aid.,"In summary
More than five million low-income Californians are expected to lose their CalFresh food assistance benefits starting Saturday. States are suing the Trump administration to reinstate aid.


Each Thursday, food pantry workers in the city of Bellflower sort through breads, fresh produce and canned goods. Early risers line up with their bags, cardboard boxes and carts outside St. Dominic Savio Catholic Church, ready for distribution at 8 a.m.
For some, that routine became more urgent this week. Five-and-a-half million low-income Californians are enrolled in CalFresh, the state’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. With the federal government shut down and the Trump administration refusing to tap funds to keep food assistance on schedule, refrigerators are emptying, cupboards are running bare and fears are rising.   
“Without these food banks providing, I don’t know what we’re going to do,” said Miriam Hernandez, a Paramount resident who rushed to St. Dominic’s after dropping her children at school. 
Around the state, food pantries expect demand for goods to surge over the next several weeks. To help meet the need, California, county agencies and private groups are pouring in tens of millions of dollars in backfill funding. California Attorney General Rob Bonta this week joined other states in suing the federal government, seeking to restore federal financial support for SNAP programs, including CalFresh. The program was formerly known as food stamps, and now functions through debit cards. 
For about 3.5 million senior citizens and children who use CalFresh, food planning has already changed. 
Waiting in line, tote in hand, Hernandez said she’s been feeling nervous. To prepare for delays in receiving CalFresh benefits, she’s stopped by multiple food pantries in Los Angeles County, grateful for anything she can get her hands on.
Hernandez has six children, four of whom are still in school. Her husband is the main breadwinner, and with the rising price of groceries, she said CalFresh has been a huge help in her household — it’s largely how she buys meat and poultry. She is hopeful benefits will return soon, but in the meantime, she’ll have to make do with what she can find at pantries. Items like rice, lentils and beans can go a long way, she said. 
“Moms, we work it out with the little that we have, and we try to make a meal no matter how little it is,” she said. 
California, counties intervene
California has released $80 million to support food banks across the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom has also sent the California National Guard to help food banks pack and distribute food. 
Bonta joined National Guards and volunteers packing bell peppers and potatoes at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank to make a point on Thursday. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture says it lacks funding to provide SNAP benefits to 40 million Americans, Bonta said the federal government has more than $5 billion in contingency funds earmarked for the program. A multi-state lawsuit demands that the federal government use those funds to avoid shutting the program down for the first time since it began in 1964. 
“Those funds are sitting there unspent and it is unconscionable, it is immoral, it is illegal,” Bonta said.

A federal judge in Boston has signaled that she may intervene. 
Even if the judge sides with California, Bonta said it could take “about a week” before benefits are reinstated to electronic debit cards.
Counties and local governments are also working to gather resources and aid. In San Francisco, supported in part by a private donor, the city will provide gift cards to CalFresh members to fully cover their November food benefits.
With millions of families across the state and country in limbo, food banks and pantries are becoming a lifeline for many more people. 
In North County San Diego Thursday, hundreds of families showed up to Interfaith Community Services in Escondido for an emergency food distribution with a regional partner, Feeding San Diego.
People waited in their vehicles for the drive-through food bank in a snarl of traffic that backed up outside the center. Each family received one or two boxes filled with fresh strawberries, apples and cucumbers, along with peanut butter, bread, canned beans and tuna, and a few treats, such as fruit popsicles and chocolate cake pops.
The organizations expected to serve 250 families, but stretched that to 270. On a normal day the Interfaith food pantry might serve 30 to 40 families.
“Today, people are panicked,” said Carissa Casares, a spokesperson for Feeding San Diego. “They’re thinking, how am I stocking my fridge? How am I filling my pantry?”

At the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, which partners with organizations across the county to bring pantries to churches, senior centers and schools, several factors have contributed to increased demand this year, said CEO Michael Flood.
In January, historic wildfires devastated Los Angeles communities. “And because those fires were so huge, that ripple effect is still there,” Flood said. Then in October, federal workers who aren’t getting paid because of the shutdown began requesting food boxes. Now with the suspension of CalFresh benefits, that need is likely to surge. About 1.5 million Angelenos rely on food assistance. 
His food bank is planning large distribution events for thousands of people similar to those organized during the pandemic. “This is a disaster type of situation for us here in Los Angeles County, throughout the state of California, and throughout the country,” he said. 
College students, recent graduates seek stability
Beyond the senior citizens and children who make up the majority of program participants, veterans, people with disabilities and young people are also trying to make ends meet. 
About 200,000 college students use the assistance program, and some continue to do so even after they graduate.
A third-year international development student at UCLA, Jade Duarte, said her entire family relies on CalFresh. 
“My grandfather just had open-heart surgery,” she said. “He’s dependent on good nutrition to recover, right? So things like this would hinder, essentially, his way of recovery, because they’re cutting his money.”
For her own needs, Duarte seeks support beyond her family’s CalFresh. A food pantry at UCLA offers quick meals like ramen. But demand exceeds what food banks can provide, she said. “It’s not going to be able to take care of the whole situation.”
On college campuses around the state, demand is growing at basic needs centers that serve as resource hubs, connecting students with food assistance and other support programs. At UC Berkeley on Wednesday, the online queue to access free food opened at 1 p.m. It was full by 1:01 p.m. The pantry also opened another time slot on Mondays.

While basic needs centers are meant as a short-term solution, some students return again and again. Temuujin Sarangerel, a second-year Berkeley City College student studying business administration and finance, stops at his school’s center one or twice a week as one of his main sources of food. 
He and his mom share a CalFresh debit card, and they will have to cut back on meat and other foods if their benefits don’t come in. The prospect makes him “sad and stressed.”
In Los Angeles County, 22-year-old Dante Thomas, a recent graduate of the University of San Francisco, stopped by St. Dominic’s food pantry for the first time. Living now in South Gate, Thomas said he knows how to stretch CalFresh benefits strategically to last the entire month. 
Under the pressure of student debt and keeping up with rent, Thomas said food assistance supports his mental well-being: It’s one less thing to worry about. 
“It’s a little demoralizing as a young person,” he said. “Benefits are being cancelled and I can’t find a consistent role in my career, so things are definitely a little hard right now.”
Preparing for the possibility that CalFresh won’t come through starting Saturday Thomas said he has been even more judicious about what he buys. “I’d go to the store and get a salad or something … and now I don’t even think that’s something that makes sense to do financially,” he said. “It’s very hard.”

Annette Sweeney, left, Mike Klimesh and Sarah Trone Garriott heard public comments on a bill related to pharmacy benefits managers. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s law putting new regulations on pharmacy benefits managers is temporarily blocked from enforcement for Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield health plans and insurance policies.
Chief U.S. District Judge Stephanie Rose issued a temporary injunction Wednesday in the case, brought earlier this month by Iowa’s largest health insurer against the state insurance commissioner. The case challenges enforcement of Senate File 383, the measure signed into law in June that regulates certain business practices by PBMs, the entities negotiating prescription drug costs between manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies.
The law restricts PBMs’ ability to set certain cost-sharing rates, fees, or other financial means to incentivize a person to fill their prescription at a certain pharmacy. It also requires independent pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average national acquisition cost of a drug plus a $10.68 dispensing fee.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The law was supported by many advocates and business owners of small and rural pharmacies. Pharmacists and some health care advocates said the PBM practices targeted by the Iowa law contributed to the closure of more than 200 rural and independent pharmacies across the state, including 31 pharmacies that closed in 2024.
But business leaders and health insurance companies have said the measure will lead to higher health care costs for Iowans. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry warned the measure could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans, resulting in an increase of $169 for the average insured Iowans’ pharmaceutical costs each year.
The Iowa Association of Business and Industry also filed a lawsuit in June to block enforcement of the law. Rose, who also oversaw this case, issued a temporary injunction on July 21 applying to plaintiffs of the ABI lawsuit.
In that decision to issue a temporary injunction, Rose wrote that several parts of the PBM law exceed state authority in regulating health care plans, conflicting with the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. She also found the law could conflict with First Amendment protections for commercial speech “without adequate constitutional justification.”
Wellmark’s October lawsuit referenced Rose’s decision in the ABI case, saying the injunction order brought into question whether Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen can legitimately enforce the state’s PBM law if it conflicts with federal ERISA regulations. The lawsuit specifically pointed to guidance Ommen issued in September that stated he planned to enforce the new law “in its entirety” against entities that are not plaintiffs in the ABI lawsuit.
Rose’s temporary injunction in the Wellmark case pauses the $10.68 dispensing fee for prescriptions filled at pharmacies in Iowa under Wellmark covered plans and policies, including those working through CVS Caremark, the PBM that works with Wellmark.
In a news release on the decision, the company said the preliminary injunction provides benefits like offering “clear compliance guidance” on the law, and shielding more than 1 million Iowans from “significant increases in prescription medication costs” under the law. The company had estimated individuals covered by Wellmark policies would face increased costs of nearly $40 million annually.
The Iowa Insurance Division did not respond a request for comment Friday on the injunction. Provisions of the law not blocked under the court order will continue to be enforced. The temporary injunctions blocking parts of the law, set in the Wellmark and ABI lawsuits, will remain in place until a decision is made on in the cases about the law’s constitutionality.

Public Service Commissioner Annie Bukacek, also a doctor in private practice, is using state equipment to copy medical records unrelated to agency work, a complaint filed this week with the state ethics watchdog alleges.
A photo of Dr. Annie Bukacek (Photo via Annie Bukacek for PSC website).
Bukacek, elected in 2022, declined Friday to address the question and directed the Daily Montanan to the Public Service Commission director.
Public Service Commissioner Brad Molnar filed the complaint, dated Wednesday, with the Commissioner of Political Practices, which monitors and enforces ethical standards for public officers.
In the complaint, Molnar, recently ousted as president, asks the Commissioner of Political Practices to estimate the money Bukacek owes ratepayers for her alleged abuse of state resources and levy penalties accordingly.
Bukacek is a licensed physician based in Kalispell, according to the Montana Board of Medical Examiners. She is on the Logan Health Medical Center receptionist directory.
In the complaint, Molnar said he has observed Bukacek “dragging a valise or an even larger suitcase” into the PSC office building after returning from her home in Kalispell.
At the office, Molnar said he often couldn’t use the copier because Bukacek was using it “for long periods of time.” One night, looking for a document he thought he might have thrown out, Molnar discovered “the first tranche of evidence” under fax cover sheets, the complaint said.
In a phone call, Molnar said the cover sheets largely show correspondence to Logan Health from other medical offices, such as Walmart Pharmacy or the Deer Lodge Medical Center.
“It became obvious the suitcases contained her business documents so she could perform her business functions while at the PSC offices,” the complaint said.
Until last week, Molnar served as president of the Public Service Commission. The PSC regulates public utilities and has five commissioners elected by district.
Molnar was ousted as president after his colleagues alleged he repeatedly interfered with an internal investigation into professional misconduct, and the PSC needed a reset.
Molnar himself announced the investigation in July and has admitted only to being unpolished.
Molnar said he was still president when he first discovered the medical printouts sometime the first week of April.
“I’ve got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these,” Molnar said.
He said he didn’t want bad publicity under his watch, and Bukacek had refused to talk with him, so he asked Commissioner Jennifer Fielder, vice president, to talk with her.
But he said Bukacek continued the practice.
In a phone call, Fielder said she recalls Molnar pointing out “a stack of trash” to her, but she believed Bukacek had been cleaning out her office.
Fielder said she doesn’t recall asking Bukacek directly about whether she was using state equipment for personal business, but she has in general offered that guidance to all her colleagues.
Fielder also said Molnar himself was free to talk with Bukacek himself or send her an email.
In state law, rules of conduct for officers state that they may not “use public time, facilities, equipment, state letterhead, supplies, personnel, or funds for the officer’s or employee’s private business purposes.”
Molnar himself was found to have violated that ethics law multiple times by using public facilities and equipment in his first stretch as a member of the Public Service Commissioner, according to a 2010 decision by the Commissioner of Political Practices.
In the current complaint, Molnar said Bukacek “dragging her bags of business documents has diminished” since the legislative session adjourned.
However, Bukacek still “uses the copy rooms exponentially far more often than I,” even though as president, Molnar said he needed more copies than most commissioners on most days, the complaint said.
“Apparently, she’s short on toner where she works,” Molnar said.
Molnar said “it’s not like I’m a dumpster diver,” but the bins can be overflowing with cover sheets, and he has collected a stack of them that’s as thick as a ream of paper.
Just a couple of days ago, Molnar said he went to throw away some bad copies, but the waste basket was overflowing, and he realized it had more medical facility cover sheets.
He said he believes Bukacek is copying the records, tossing out the cover sheets, and keeping many more pages of documents that are printed with them — on state equipment and taxpayer time, he said.
“You can hear the printing machines whirring for a frickin’ hour in there,” Molnar said.
He said he believes some of the documents include private patient information, potentially in violation of HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, because some cover sheets state, “Confidential,” and some include prescription information or reference EKGs, for example.
In response to a voicemail requesting comment, Bukacek sent a text message directing the Daily Montanan to the PSC executive director.
Bukacek did not answer a follow-up text message asking if she used equipment in the PSC office for private medical business.
Fielder, however, said she believes Molnar is disgruntled with his ouster, and the allegations against Bukacek are motivated by his dissatisfaction.
“I think Commissioner Molnar has started trying to besmirch other members of the commission and the department who don’t necessarily go along with his views, particularly related to his removal from office and his conduct,” Fielder said.
The internal investigation into Molnar is pending, as is a request Fielder made to Gov. Greg Gianforte on behalf of an internal “response team” to temporarily suspend Molnar, alleging interference with the investigation.

Molnar has argued he has only availed himself of his free speech rights in speaking out about the allegations.
His lawyer argued Molnar’s recent demotion made the suspension request to the governor moot, but the response team said he can still be disruptive, including through “media activity.”
In a phone call, Molnar said he volunteered to provide the cover sheets to the Commissioner of Political Practices as evidence, but he was told to hold off at this point in the complaint process.
“When Commissioner Bukacek is at the commission, she is supposed to do commission related work,” the complaint said. “Instead, she is doing personal business-related work.
“Since she is often in the office for only one or two hours per week … she is paid about $2,000 per hour of actual commission core functions and treating her elected position as a side hustle.
“Therefore, the time she spends at the commission working on her personal agendas is an insult to the ratepayers as the time would be far better spent doing her public job.”
Fielder said she believes Bukacek works at her medical practice Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and otherwise, works long hours at the Public Service Commission, as evidenced by her deliberations at public meetings.
“She’s demonstrated that she studies the material, she studies the law, she studies the evidence in the record,” Fielder said.
In a phone call, Commissioner of Political Practices Chris Gallus said he is still conducting an initial evaluation on the complaint, which includes confirming whether his office has authority in the matter.
Gallus said he can request additional information from either the complainant or the respondent, assess whether he or a previous commissioner has issued a decision in a similar case, and then issue a summary decision or proceed to a hearing.

Kelly Ayotte said she is “deeply committed” to pushing for state investments in child care amid ongoing funding obstacles and workforce shortages. 
During a forum on investing in child care Thursday in Manchester, Ayotte told child care advocates, stakeholders, and business owners that despite the “challenging budget environment,” New Hampshire remains committed to the recently expanded Child Care Scholarship Program. The state reported that as of summer more than 5,000 families were enrolled in the program, which is a state-federal partnership.
“There’s so much work to do on this issue,” Ayotte said of child care in general. “It goes hand in hand with our housing issues when it comes to our quality of life here in New Hampshire. I want to be a partner, and I want to work with the ideas that come out of this group.”
While government investments like the scholarship program aim to make child care more affordable, supply does not meet the current demand. Families across the Granite State struggle to enroll in and afford early education and care for their children, and providers are often unable to find the workforce necessary to boost capacity. A New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute study published in January found that between 2019 and 2023, the state was short of an average of more than 9,000 child care slots annually.
Ayotte said it is “exciting” that more Granite Staters are using the scholarship program, and that she will continue working with the Department of Health and Human Services to keep the program funded. 
She said that while the state tries to improve the workforce pipeline through its education system, she is also looking to expand incentives for businesses and nonprofits to invest in child care. 
“We need everyone at the table to bring more affordable child care options to our state,” Ayotte said. “Together, we’ll make sure New Hampshire stays the best place to raise a family.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ayottechildcare-1024x610.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:16:32.345056

Like many parents, dropping off her children there in the mornings allows her to keep her job as a human resources worker. She trusts the teachers, and the kids have made friends. And, equally as important, she can afford it.
But, at pickup time on Tuesday, a daycare staff member handed her a letter informing her that Salt Lake County’s daycare programs had been terminated, scheduled to shut down at the end of the year.

“That was the first I had heard of it. The staff seemed also in shock about it. I mean, everyone seemed very emotional and in shock,” Walker said. “We had received no prior notice, anything, that this was even up for debate.”
That notification came through just hours after the Republican-majority Salt Lake County Council voted 5-4 to end the $2 million annual subsidy that kept four centers, mostly located on the west side of Salt Lake County, afloat.   
Why did the Council shut the program down?
Council member Aimee Winder Newton led a presentation during the Tuesday council meeting arguing that the county isn’t legally mandated to provide daycare — but it’s also not its role. Those who need help affording these services, she said, can apply to the Utah Department of Workforce Services’ child care stipend. 
Quoting a report the county commissioned earlier this year that evaluated the child care programs in the county, Winder Newton said, “the programs face mounting operational and financial challenges. Each center operates with limited coordination, leading to inconsistencies in staffing, budgeting and service delivery.”
Rates in county-sponsored centers are 50% to 60% below market averages, she added, which forces the county to subsidize $2 million a year for about 270 children. 
“I know sometimes it feels nice when you can try to help other people, but we’re not being equitable in how we’re helping people with this program,” she said. “We’ve got $6,000 to $10,000 a child subsidy that we’re giving, and it’s not helping enough kids in the valley.”

Monthly rates for the program are about $200 per child, depending on ages. Walker, for example, pays $1,014 a month for her three kids aged 11, 8 and 5. Other programs she has considered would be at least twice that amount in the school year, and even more during the summer. 
“I don’t see a way that we can afford it. To be honest, it’s not even ‘it’ll be tight, but we can make it work.’ We don’t have double the budget for daycare, and to also be able to afford groceries and things like that that are also getting more expensive,” Walker said.
With a two-month notice, she doesn’t have much time to save up for it either. She worries many parents are in her position and will have to forgo child care altogether.
Dozens of parents are organizing online to take action, contacting their council members and planning to attend next council meeting on Tuesday.
“I just want people to know that they’re affecting real families and real people, that we’re not just a list of names in a center, that we are real families, and this will impact us all very negatively, and we were not given a voice in this decision at any point, or any heads up that it was even up for debate,” Walker said. “So I think we just want to make sure that we’re heard.”
‘It’s mean’
The news of the termination shocked and disappointed Utah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, who has advocated for more child care resources in the state. She said she’s actively working to find solutions to help the affected families.
Utah won’t expand child care access this year

“At the very moment families are losing SNAP benefits and working longer hours just to feed their children, the council’s recommendation to eliminate childcare options creates even greater barriers for working families trying simply to survive,” Escamilla said in a statement.
She added that suggesting families find other providers ignores that neighboring nonprofit providers have month-long wait lists, and they may not offer the same services.
“These centers offered more than supervision; they provided quality, affordable care with wraparound supports like transportation and meal services,” Escamilla said. “Expecting parents to find comparable care within a month is not just unrealistic, it’s mean.”
For-profit centers say they can fill the gap
Johnny Anderson, a Utah Private Child Care Association board member and president of Great Beginnings Academy — which owns nine daycare centers in the county — told the council that licensed child care centers are between 50% and 60% occupancy in the area, and they have plenty of space for any family looking to fill the gap the termination will leave.
He also highlighted that for-profit child care centers are struggling after taking several hits — first when the state implemented full-day kindergarten, and then when unlicensed home providers were allowed to have eight unrelated children in the home. 
“Those of us that are in the for-profit child care business, we are paying property taxes to this county to fund county services, and of course, the county is running child care programs that compete with us,” he said. “So I think that’s worth pointing out and recognizing, as you deliberate this with that.”



Let us know what you think...


 


However, Democratic council members expressed concern about the affordability dilemma families are about to face. 
Council member Jiro Johnson said that while for-profit child care centers have the capacity to fill the gap, they aren’t really available to families that can’t afford them. 
The decision also comes at the same time county leaders have proposed a nearly 20% tax property tax increase, which has drawn criticism across the valley.
Even if the state-sponsored stipend covers most of the bill for families switching child care centers, some of them may still not be able to cover even a $100 or $200 monthly increase in daycare bills.
“If we’re getting so much heat about $88 for the average family household per year,” Johnson said about the volume of public comments on the proposed tax increase, “imagine what that means to a family who now has to make similar payments per month to get child care, which may be absolutely necessary for that family to survive.”
