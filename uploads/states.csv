Irrigators reject accusation of $1.6M “conflict of interest” payment for reservoir they say will allow profitable crops in Hyattville.
The post Mounting dam costs include moving private landing strip appeared first on WyoFile .","As debate over rising cost estimates for the proposed Alkali Creek Dam continues, one critic asserts that the sponsoring water district is entangled in a conflict of interest after paying a board member $1.6 million.
A neighbor to the proposed dam site is upset that the Nowood Watershed Improvement District paid the Paint Rock Angus Ranch — owned by the Martin Mercer family — the hefty sum for land and easements while Martin Mercer sat on the district board.
Tim Gardiner, owner of the Twisted Tippet Ranch that lies just below the proposed dam site, called the payment “a massive conflict of interest,” involving “good old boy” politicking.
“We’ve got the president and vice president [of the Nowood district] crafting their own deal,” Gardiner said. “It’s a lot of money without the light-of-day overview.”
Mercer and Nowood District President John Joyce rejected the allegation, saying the 35-member association is small, doesn’t have a lot of board candidates and is following its charter.
“Nobody has run against me,” Mercer said of board elections. He signed up for board duty because, “I always felt I could bring something to the table.”
“We followed all the rules”martin Mercer
Irrigators anticipated spending the state funds to buy reservoir property, and studies determined that Mercer’s land was the bestideal site.
“We followed all the rules,” Mercer said. “Everything was voted on by our peers. It’s been transparent. It’s been democratic.
“I don’t know there’s any conflict of interest.”
Joyce agreed with Mercer but said he realizes the optics are bad.
Despite public perception, he said, “it’s been done correctly and above board.”
Five times more
As Wyoming advances plans to construct the dam, lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by cost estimates that have climbed from $20 million to more than $100 million even before a spade of dirt has been turned.
The state of Wyoming would pay for all but about $2 million of the 100-foot-high, half-mile-long earth embankment. The dam would hold a 9,000-acre-foot reservoir to provide 6,000 acre-feet of supplemental irrigation to 35 irrigating families.

Some of the anticipated expenses are understandable for a reservoir that would cover 312 acres. A contract for just some of the required dirt carries a nearly $900,000 price tag.
As engineers worked on the project, they discovered the dirt, or fill, they had counted on for the structure would not meet the specifications. So they would need more, would have to truck it farther and would have to make the dam larger than originally planned.
Engineers also found another costly problem.
A porous geologic formation under the dam site proved to be an issue. It would require grouting — injection of cement underground — to seal off any potential leaks.
Another hiccup came when some neighbors questioned why they should provide easements for an undertaking they didn’t consider a benefit. To bring them on board, water developers may have to spend more than anticipated to upgrade a principal feeder canal, and even bury it in a pipeline.
Wyoming may also buy pivot irrigation systems for neighbors, a conservation expense that’s an exception to state policy.
Then there is inflation, supply-chain challenges and other unseen developments in a shifting economic environment.
And the expense of relocating a private airstrip.
A private airstrip
The dam and reservoir would make a private airstrip on Mercer’s ranch inoperable. So plans call for relocating it, along with “an existing metal building … used as an aircraft hangar.”

Water developers “will accommodate the proposed [replacement] airstrip in the Project design and construction, including performing rough grading for 1,200 feet of airstrip,” according to a legal agreement between the Mercer ranch and the Nowood district. The water district will also pay Mercer and the ranch $140,400 to build a replacement hangar and supply it with a water line.
The Wyoming Water Development Office looked at 41 sites before settling on the Mercer ranch. Developers believed that locating a new reservoir on the nearby Bighorn National Forest or even property managed by the Bureau of Land Management “is not something that would be successful,” Joyce told WyoFile.
Consultants compared the fees, delays and other aspects of dealing with federal agencies to buying Mercer property and easements, moving the airstrip and more, Joyce said.
“All that was put on paper,” he said. “It was just math at that point.”
Mercer added that the project “wound up landing here as far as being cost-effective.”
Gardiner is also upset because the Water Development Commission and the Nowood district paid for the Mercer property before they had all the necessary easements secured. Wyoming officials have said they would not condemn private property for the dam, only secure easements on a willing-seller basis.
But some landowners, Gardiner included, are holding out for assurances that will protect their property. Gardiner, for example, wants the reservoir flows moved away from his house, other design improvements and insurance against a potential flood.

Others want an enlarged Anita Ditch, which would feed the reservoir, buried in a pipe, a costly proposition. The Water Development Office would install pivot irrigation sprinklers to aid those who won’t directly benefit from reservoir flows.
The Mercer purchase was putting the cart before the horse and putting taxpayer funds at risk, Gardiner said. The proper course would have been to secure options — legal agreements for easements and land purchases that are contingent upon first securing all necessary project elements. Only then should money have been spent, he said.
Now, state funds are in danger of being stranded if the project collapses, Gardiner said.
He also accused the state of “poor financial management,” arguing that money that’s now sitting idle should instead have been accruing interest.
Over-adjudicated
A fifth-generation rancher, Mercer said the Nowood drainage has been “over-adjudicated” — that the state allocated rights to more water than was available. “We learned how to live being short of water,” he said.
“They always figured on a reservoir,” he said of area settlers. Instead, ranchers and farmers now watch spring runoff flow by, then scratch what they can out of Alkali, Paint Rock and Medicine Lodge creeks.

“As much water as goes by in the spring, you just dream of a chance like this,” Mercer said.
When first envisioned by a steering committee, a reservoir was estimated to cost as little as $15 million to $20 million, Joyce said. Now, legislators say a $100-million-plus price tag puts the acre-foot cost in the stratosphere.
It’s unfair to compare today’s dam projects with those in the heyday of water development decades ago, Water Development Office Director Jason Mead told water officials in November. Major on-channel dams that block rivers, “you just can’t build those anymore,” he said.
As a result, “you really don’t get the economy of scale … like you did back in the ’50s and earlier,” he said.
Also, storage projects now consider needs on a watershed scale, Mead said, which means addressing wildlife, irrigation efficiency, water quality, fisheries, recreation and other factors. The reservoir would always have at least a 132-acre pool for recreation.
The 6,000 acre-feet of stored water would be used as “supplemental irrigation” to ensure and boost crop yields, Joyce said.
“This area has very little rain — five to six inches [of] moisture all year,” he said. “Everything we grow is irrigated. When the snow melts, we’re done.”
That limits the types of crops that ranchers and farmers can grow. With more water, crops that are more valuable than livestock grass can be cultivated. “Corn, beets and alfalfa are more profitable,” Joyce said.
The dam fits with Wyoming’s overall plan to take earnings from the one-time extraction of resources like coal and invest them in renewable endeavors like water storage, ranching and farming, Joyce has said.
Heart of the ranch
For Mercer, the decision to sell part of his family ranch was wrenching. Homesteading family members in the late 1800s “sacrificed to own this piece of ground,” he said.
“It’s not easy to sell the heart of your operation,” he said. “Not everybody is excited in the Mercer family.”
The next generation of Mercers who are involved in the Paint Rock Ranch business gives him hope, he said.
“That sums up Wyoming,” he said. “Any kid you can keep in the state is a plus.”

While Securix cameras no longer record license plates to cite uninsured vehicle owners, the Mississippi Department of Transportation has a live traffic camera at the intersection and there's a Flock camera for public safety.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
A Chancery Court judge has agreed to dissolve a partnership formed to profit from uninsured motorists whose license plates were captured by traffic cameras in Ocean Springs, Biloxi and other Mississippi cities. 
A politically prominent trio of Mississippians formed QJR LLC to run the uninsured motorist program in Mississippi with Jonathan Miller, chairman of Georgia-based Securix LLC. Miller and his company have a proprietary system that randomly checks license plate numbers against state databases to identify uninsured vehicles and ticket their owners through law enforcement agencies.
Miller and Securix started the program in Ocean Springs, signing a contract in May 2021 with the city. Miller then teamed up with QJR, whose members are Quinton Dickerson and Josh Gregory of Frontier Strategies advertising firm in the metro Jackson area, plus attorney Robert Wilkinson of Pascagoula. 
Frontier manages high-profile state and local political campaigns, while Wilkinson was city attorney for Ocean Springs when the partners formed Securix Mississippi to spread the potentially profitable program to more cities and states. Miller was supposed to manage the technology, while an operating agreement between his company and QJR stipulated that only QJR would handle marketing and direct contact with Mississippi customers.
Motorist ticketing program unravels 
The partnership began to unravel within a month, Josh Gregory testified in Chancery Court before Judge Harris. Miller failed to show up for the trial. He was representing himself after Harris excused Miller’s attorney from the case in October, when the attorney-client relationship had completely broken down.
 QJR filed its lawsuit against Miller and Georgia Securix in September 2024, asking that Harris dissolve Securix Mississippi and order Miller to stop defaming QJR and its members and levy punitive damages against him. The lawsuit was sealed for more than a year, although Harris did not follow established procedure for removing the case from public view. He unsealed most, but not all, records in the case after statewide media company Mississippi Today, later joined by the Sun Herald, objected to the sealing. 
Harris decided that Securix Mississippi bank records would remain sealed — again without establishing a need to prevent public access to the entire bank record. 
By the time QJR filed its lawsuit, the state Department of Public Safety had cut off Securix Mississippi’s access to the database of uninsured motorists after receiving at least one complaint from Miller about how Securix Mississippi was operating. 
Gregory testified that Miller was not supposed to be communicating with public officials, according to their operating agreement. He said Securix Mississippi had ceased operations by 2025 and has no remaining assets. The company had previously pulled in $1.3 million in a year, according to records in a federal case that motorists filed in August 2023 against Georgia Securix.
MS partner testifies about Securix 
Gregory testified that Miller was spreading false rumors of criminal wrongdoing against him and QJR. Miller sent emails and letters to public officials, including Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell, and others. Miller claimed QJR was misusing sensitive personal information about vehicle owners that only law enforcement officers were supposed to access. 
“Pretty much everything he wrote, via email, letter or post, was untrue,” Gregory testified. “ . . . If he didn’t get his way, he would send email after email, to the point that we had to block his emails. They were excessive.”
 Gregory said that QJR had attempted to keep Miller out of day-to-day operations in Mississippi because the program Miller and Georgia Securix ran in Ocean Springs was “such a disaster.” One of Miller’s later allegations was that Wilkinson was involved in the Ocean Springs program and shared in its profits, which Gregory testified was “completely untrue.” 
Commissioner Tindell pulled Securix access to the uninsured motorist database in August 2023, court records show, after a letter from Miller alleged the program was being mismanaged. 
Gregory testified that Miller did not provide documentation of the wrongdoing that he alleged. 
Judge Harris has found Miller in contempt of court multiple times, but Miller has not returned to Mississippi and still owes more than $63,603 in attorney’s fees that Harris ordered the businessman to pay QJR’s attorney, Jaklyn Wrigley. Harris ordered the fees paid after finding that Miller had wrongly tried to move QJR’s case to federal court. The federal judge sent the case back to Harris.
In addition to dissolving Securix Mississippi, Harris also could consider QJR’s request for punitive damages against Miller and Georgia Securix, along with other relief QJR is seeking. 
“While the other side did not show up for court yet again, we continued to provide the facts about this matter and are glad to be moving toward the resolution we’ve been advocating for since the start of this process more than a year ago,” said Jaklyn Wrigley, attorney for QJR.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/18161106/Securix-traffic-intersection.jpg,,,2026-01-19 13:57:10.431154

But when she found out she’d need three separate permits — one to grow, one to ship plants in or out, and one to sell plants grown somewhere else — she was overwhelmed by the paperwork each permit required and the more than 150 pages of rules that came with them.

“We got enough together to buy our own property and build our own building. And we were so excited. We thought the sky was the limit,” Nicholls said. “The sky’s not the limit. The rules and regulations are the limit. You can only go as far as they let you go. There are license after license on the books.”
Wouldn’t it be easier, she thought, if state regulators combined them into a single certification.
“They dollar you to death,” Nicholls said. “Five here, five there, 10 here, 15 there.”
That’s why Nicholls and others are pushing for legislation to increase scrutiny of the state’s more than 80,000 regulations.
More oversight
State law already provides for oversight of the rules state agencies put on businesses operating in the Palmetto State. But the South Carolina chapter of Americans for Prosperity believes legislators should do more to ensure they actually review them.
Getting the bill, which passed the House unanimously last March, through the Senate and across the governor’s desk is the top priority of the political advocacy group founded in 2004 by libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.
At top of mind for the group is making sure legislators sign off on any costly regulations.
Legislators are supposed to give final approval to all agency regulations, minus those required by federal law. But there’s a loophole.
If the General Assembly neither approves nor denies a rule within 110 days, it takes effect automatically. That’s what happened in 2024 with the Department of Education’s regulation on age-appropriate books in schools. Senators were incensed it skipped their review entirely. Last year, legislators voted unanimously on a law to automatically pause the clock on regulatory reviews from mid-May to mid-January while they’re not in session. The law also shortened the total days, from 120 to 110.
Americans for Prosperity wants to stop automatic approvals altogether for any regulation that boosts business expenses. Under the bill, if the estimated cost to businesses across an industry exceeds $1 million over a five-year period, legislators would have to take an up-or-down vote.
Six of the 77 regulations automatically approved in the last seven years would have been subject to the $1 million threshold, according to the group’s state director, Matt Humm.
In Nicholls’ case, the annual cost of the permits she needed vary by the size of the business — ranging from free for small operations to $300 for a large one. The cost of shipping plants in and out varies based on the number of plants transported — $17 for a batch of 25 or $280 for 10,000 plants.
That doesn’t include costs she might face for things like pest or disease control. Stopping their spread is the primary concern of those regulations.
One in, two out
State law requires other layers of review before any proposed change to a regulation gets to the Legislature, including public hearings and a fiscal impact analysis.
And existing rules must go back before legislators for re-approval every five years. Still, Humm said, outdated regulations tend to linger and don’t always keep pace with modern technological advancements.
The legislation combats that with a pair of blanket requirements meant to cut the overall number of regulations. One calls for a 25% reduction in the number of regulations each type of small business faces.
The second is a two-for-one provision, forcing agencies to cut to rules for each new one they propose.

It’s a measure Kathleen Stevens supports.
“I’m not saying we don’t need them. I’m just saying we don’t need all of them,” she said. “There’s just garbage on the books.”
While raising her sons, Stevens ran a side business painting and restoring furniture. After her children graduated, she decided she wanted to open a space where other small craft and antique vendors like her could hawk their wares in downtown Chester.
She opened Rainbow Rooster Boutique four years ago with plans of operating a small cafe in the back of the store.
“I just wanted to serve a little coffee and pastries,” Stevens said.
The cafe space remains empty, she said, because she doesn’t have the money to install all the equipment regulators told her she needed. She pulled the application. 
“I was overwhelmed,” she said. 
‘Lose our entrepreneurship’
Business owners including Nicholls, Stevens and Zack Holt say they’re not opposed to regulations, but they want reassurances that they’re up to date and absolutely necessary.
When Holt purchased an existing restaurant space in Hartsville a couple of years ago for a new location of Holt Bros BBQ, state highway regulators told him the sign that had been in place under previous ownership was too close to the state road.
While Holt didn’t put it there, the state still required him to move it. That, along with permitting delays at the city level, held up his grand opening for nine months, he said.
“That’s nine months’ worth of lost revenue and income,” he said.
And he had to send the new employees he had hired to work at other locations.
Americans for Prosperity and the small business owners it’s representing argue small companies don’t have the same financial wherewithal as big ones to comply with these rules.
“We’re going to lose our entrepreneurship to large corporations,” Stevens said.
Still, state law has had carveouts in place since 2004 meant to address that as well.
When a new rule has a big impact on small businesses, it must go before a special, 11-member committee housed at the state Department of Commerce and made up of small business owners. Part of that process must include financial studies and plans by agencies to reduce the burden on those business owners or exempt them from the rule altogether.
The proposed law would require the same cost-benefit analyses for all new and re-approved regulations. It would also send that information to more people, including the small business panel, for review.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5C9F5BD9-47B0-47FC-AF5B-6742DE67478C_1_201_a.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 12:57:03.516501

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The prospective buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital missed the final, court-ordered deadline to close the deal, leaving the fate of the two safety net hospitals in the hands of the state.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha confirmed in a statement on Saturday that The Centurion Foundation failed to meet the Jan. 15 deadline to cement its purchase of the two hospitals in Providence and North Providence. The due date was set under a Dec. 9 agreement between Neronha’s office and the attorneys representing the bankruptcy estate for their existing owner Prospect Medical Holdings. 
Buyer of Roger Williams, Fatima hospitals ‘will work like expletive deleted to get this done’

The missed deadline now puts the onus on the state to take over hospital operations — and pay for the costs associated with payroll, taxes and insurance — by Jan. 30, as laid out in the December agreement. Neronha hinted previously that a court-appointed state receivership was possible if the Centurion deal fell through, but provided little detail.
“Centurion is free to continue to try to close, but we now have work to do and a deadline by which to do it,” Neronha said in an email Saturday afternoon. “My Office is working hard in consultation with other state leaders and I expect you will hear more about that next week.”
Preserving the pair of hospitals — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a top focus of Neronha’s office, and, as scrutiny over the sale intensifies, Rhode Island officials more broadly. But none have put a price tag — at least publicly — on what the state is willing to pay to keep the hospitals running.
Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed fiscal 2027 budget, unveiled on Thursday, one day before the Jan 15 deadline, did not include any money for the hospitals. 
Meanwhile, Centurion appears not to have given up, still courting the investor-backed bonds needed to finalize its purchase.
“We are keenly aware of the bankruptcy court timetable,” Ben Mingle, Centurion CEO and president, said in a statement Friday night. “Our financing team…has had daily interactions with potential investors over the last several weeks with significant progress. This includes site visits by new, industry-leading investment groups just this week with very encouraging results. At the same time, we have been briefing State leaders almost daily on the status of these efforts and our plans to meet the bond sale target. The Team remains optimistic and we hope to provide a formal update next week.”
It’s a familiar promise for those following the yearslong saga of the local hospitals, where operational and financial mismanagement under Prospect and its former majority stakeholder, private equity firm Leonard Green, were well-documented.
The Centurion Foundation appeared to be a way out. The Atlanta nonprofit pledged to return the cash-strapped health care facilities to local control while injecting $80 million into immediate operations under the terms of the state’s June 2024 conditional approval. 
But investors have been reluctant to back the bonds needed for Centurion to close, with credit rating agencies’ noting Centurion’s lack of experience in hospital ownership and the dismal outlook for health care facilities nationwide amid federal funding cuts.
The prolonged state of limbo frustrated hospital workers, health care advocates and public officials. But it proved most problematic for the more than 100,000 creditors owed up to $10 billion collectively from Prospect at the time it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025. The bankruptcy estate initially signaled a desire to close the hospitals in October, but an interim agreement with funding partially provided by a state-controlled escrow account kept the doors open through Jan. 30.
But as of that date, the hospitals are coming off Prospect’s asset list, with all liabilities, costs and responsibilities transferred to the state of Rhode Island.
How the state will afford its new guardian duties is unclear.
Rhode Island officials have been on high alert for the pending sale, with Senate President Valarie Lawson calling it “the most pressing issue facing Rhode Island” in an interview after McKee’s State of the State address on Jan. 13. McKee briefly addressed the hospitals during the hourlong speech, pledging his administration will “do everything in our power” to keep the hospitals open.
Neronha and union leaders with the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,500 workers across both hospitals, have criticized McKee for failing to proactively take control of the uncertain situation, contrasting his leadership with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey. 
Healey in 2024 offered a multimillion dollar state incentive package to entice buyers — including Brown University Health — after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold its Massachusetts facilities. 
Brian Daniels, director for the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget, said Thursday the governor’s administration was working closely with Neronha’s office and the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services on “contingency planning.”
“We are monitoring what happens,” Daniels said. “We have some ideas.”

(Photo courtesy of DNR nest monitoring volunteer, Randy Cook)Peregrine falcon reproduction in Iowa “likely remains stable” following successful reintroduction efforts in the 1990s, but the Iowa Department of Natural Resources said monitoring is still warranted due to the threat of the bird flu on the recovering bird population.
According to the 2025 peregrine falcon report, four peregrine falcons died from the highly pathogenic avian influenza outside of nesting season that year. 
“Overall, Iowa’s nesting population of Peregrine Falcons appears to be stable, with birds generally returning to historic nesting sites each year, but this recovering population continues to warrant annual monitoring,” the report reads. 
The highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has notably killed millions of commercial poultry and egg-laying birds, also spreads among wild migrating birds. The virus primarily infects waterfowl and shorebirds, but can also reach birds of prey like peregrine falcons, osprey and eagles that feast on the other birds.

Volunteers and trained surveyors monitored 20 nests in 2025, of which 13 were deemed successful, meaning the nests raised young birds to the fledgling stage. Volunteers, some of which are employees at power plants since the birds like to nest on energy plant towers, observe the nests several times throughout the year and record if the birds have mated and how many young are in the nest.
There were three more nests monitored in 2025 than in 2024, however the report said none of the 2025 nests were new nests. In 2024, DNR reported peregrine falcons had an above average year for reproduction with an average of 2.77 young per nest and a total of 36 young birds fledged, or surviving to the age of flying.
Reproduction statistics in 2025 were lower, with an average of 1.87 young per nest and a total of 28 fledged, but DNR said the 2025 statistics are similar to the three years prior, which indicates falcon reproduction is stable. Of the 20 monitored nests, one was inactive and four had an unknown outcome.

The birds of prey have dark colored caps, a stripe under their eye and slate blue colored backs with white, speckled chests. The crow-sized birds tend to be monogamous, according to DNR, and will reuse nest sites for several years. 
Many peregrine falcon nesting sites in Iowa have their own livestreams, like the nest on the Dubuque County Courthouse.
In Iowa, the birds tend to nest primarily in eastern Iowa on Mississippi River cliff faces, urban settings or on electrical towers. 
Peregrine falcons disappeared from Iowa in the 1950s as they – like many other birds – were impacted by pesticides like DDT. A total of 169 peregrine falcons were released in Iowa between 1989 and 2003 in an effort to reintroduce the bird to the state. 
Information on peregrine falcon and other wildlife monitoring programs can be found online.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation grew at 2.7% during 2025, while wage growth outpaced it at 3.8%.
  Venezuela 

Downing said that he supported Trump’s use of force to remove Maduro, calling him “a narco-terrorist.” He also told listeners that Maduro’s regime in Venezuela was supporting Cuba, China and Russia and was a threat to the “Monroe Doctrine,” which he referenced several times.
The Monroe Doctrine is a policy established by the Presidency of James Monroe that asserted that the United States of America should be in control of what happens in the western hemisphere.
“I personally believe the President had Article Two (of the U.S. Constitution) authority because there were exigent circumstances that were harming Americans and totally support that,” Downing said. “I don’t believe this was anything more than protecting American authority.”
Downing said what Americans have missed is that previously even the Biden administration had put a bounty for Maduro.
“I don’t see this as being an act of war. I see this as a Department of Justice action to bring a criminal to trial,” he said.
Downing also claimed by taking out Maduro, America had freed the Venezuela people who were grateful.
“I think we need to be more diligent about what happens in the Western Hemisphere. We need to start looking at other adversaries, starting to do this. I do believe that this has greatly increased the security in the Western Hemisphere,” Downing said.
  ICE, Renee Good and Minneapolis 

Downing said that he supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and the work the department is doing in U.S. cities. He also said that he believes the conflict in U.S. cities is happening for a number of reasons including social media and biased news reporting.
The Congressman vacillated between calling the shooting of resident Renee Good “tragic” and asserting protestors are interfering with federal law enforcement.
“Calmer heads should prevail,” Downing said. “Interfering with federal law enforcement is a crime. It appears there were big attempts at interfering with federal law enforcement and when that happens, you put everybody at risk — law enforcement, the people that they’re trying to interact with, the folks that are doing the interfering. And while we all understand that Americans have a First Amendment right to protest, we need to be really careful when that protest crosses the line with interference in law enforcement operations.”
No evidence has substantiated that Good was trying to interfere with law enforcement herself.
Several callers had questions about ICE and the possibility of government overreach. A caller identified as Caitlin from Billings asked, “My question specifically refers to the authoritarian federal overreach that seems to be existing in the organization of ICE and the way they are impacting citizen life.”
While she admitted that there are serious criminal problems, she questioned the cost, especially because of civil unrest in places like Minneapolis and Portland.
“First of all, I don’t subscribe to authoritarian overreach. I don’t agree with that at all,” Downing said. “Immigration, immigration enforcement and federal law enforcement is a tool that’s been around for a long time, used by presidents of both parties. This is not anything new. You look at the news cycles, you look at social media and you look at how they try to make you angry.”
The Congressman leveled the blame at both media and social media, saying that the combination is “blowing it out of proportion.”
“Because they’re angry, because they’re watching social media, they’re starting to say, ‘I’m going to take this beyond doing a demonstration, and I going to start block them from doing their job. And that’s a federal crime to keep them from doing their job,” he said. “This is not a partisan issue. I think that it has gotten as frosty as it has again because a lot of people have been angered because they’re getting one side of the story.”
  Federal reserve 

Last week, news broke of the U.S. Department of Justice investigating Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for allegedly making false claims to Congress about the renovation of the Washington, D.C., office.
The Federal Reserve system was established more than a century ago to maintain independent federal fiscal policy and make apolitical decisions in the best interests of the economy and U.S. monetary policy.
Downing, who serves on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, said he believes Powell is “an honorable person.” He also said he supports the Fed remaining independent.
“So, first of all, nobody — nobody’s above the law,” Downing said. “It is of paramount importance that we maintain an independent Fed. Without having an independent Fed, a lot of things that make this country great, that make the dollar the global trading currency that has really fostered innovation and growth and the American dream — a lot of that depends on an independent Fed.”
  Healthcare troubles 

Downing also heard from a number of constituents about the expiration of healthcare subsidies that were begun during the COVID-19 pandemic. While Downing said he sympathized with some of the callers and their lack of insurance, he told listeners he couldn’t support a broken system. Downing voted against renewing the subsidies and they expired at the end of 2025.
He blamed sky-rocketing costs of pharmaceuticals and a shrinking pool of healthy citizens contributing to the rising rates.
“What we’ve seen now is more than a decade of adverse selection, meaning healthy young people keep coming off the plan, and it’s concentrating that risk, which pushes the expenses up, which then gets repriced the following year, and causes the whole thing to circle again,” Downing explained.
He said the answer is reforming the law to by expanding Health Savings Accounts, increasing tax credits, and focusing on drug prices.
“It’s going to be completely unaffordable and collapse under its own weight if we don’t do something,” Downing said.
He said that concerns about healthcare and prices are among the highest volume of calls to his office.
“The subsidies only affected about 7% of the population,” Downing said. “What me and my colleagues want to do is start addressing the things that are causing healthcare to go up.”
He cited that 25% of all insurance costs related to prescription drug costs and he sees that as a way to bring the cost down.
“I don’t not believe if you have a broken system, the response should ever be write a bigger check to hide it. I think we need to actually roll up our sleeves and start dealing with some of the things that we’ve actually identified as contributing to the costs,” Downing said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/G77nYVkWgAAXcCZ-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 11:57:54.770503

Senate Republican leaders have declared the House school-choice bill -- at least the part about using tax dollars for private schools -- dead on arrival.,"The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Republican Speaker Jason White got his omnibus education overhaul/school-choice bill through the House last week, but it was a squeaker for the speaker. 
The vote was 61-59 with 17 of White’s GOP supermajority peeling off and voting no, and two either absent or “taking a walk” and not voting.
White put on a full-court press in whipping reluctant Republicans to vote for the measure, which would, notably, allow families to use state tax dollars for private schooling. 
Last week White invoked President Donald Trump and secured a social media endorsement for the bill from Trump Education Secretary Linda McMahon. White has touted letters of endorsement from the state’s Catholic dioceses and other religious groups supporting school choice that could garner their school systems public money. And famed football star Tim Tebow is coming to Mississippi this week to promote the “Tim Tebow Act” part of the House bill that would allow homeschooled kids to play public-school sports.
But opposition to the bill appears more grassroots, and lawmakers are getting calls from their school superintendents and teachers back home urging them to oppose it.
Can White keep his razor-thin vote together for what promises to be an uphill battle for House Bill 2? Senate Republican leaders have declared the House school-choice bill — at least the part about using tax dollars for private schools — dead on arrival.
A win-one-for-the-Gipper campaign, even with Trump as the Gipper, might not be enough to keep the bill alive through a battle with the Senate, especially if House supermajority votes are needed to do so later in the session.
When Trump says jump, Republican Mississippi politicians typically only ask “how high?”
But so far, this appears to be the odd occurrence where a majority of Republicans in the 174-member Legislature in ruby red, Trump-supporting Mississippi are prepared to buck a proposal from his White House.
Quote of the Week

“If little Johnny’s momma is on crystal meth, and little Johnny’s daddy is a pimp, can you tell me how they (are) gonna be able to choose that little Johnny is getting the right kind of education services when that’s not even on their plate?” — Rep. John Hines, during debate over accountability for private schools if the Legislature approves letting parents use tax dollars to pay tuition.

In Brief
Legislation would support nuclear expansion in MS
State officials have signaled they are open to expanding nuclear power development in the state. 
Bills to support this have been proposed in the House and Senate, driven in part by demand for power created by data centers popping up all over the South and Mississippi to support the artificial intelligence boom. 
A bill authored by Sen. Joel Carter, a Republican from Gulfport, would provide $10 million to the Mississippi Development Authority to spend on “future nuclear development” for the upcoming fiscal year. A House bill by Rep. Jody Steverson, a Republican from Ripley, would create a special fund for MDA to administer nuclear site development grants, including reimbursement for some expenses. – Katherine Lin
Antisemitism bill would exempt reporting from DEI ban
Mississippi captured international attention last week after a 19-year-old Madison man allegedly set fire to the state’s largest synagogue, allegedly for its “Jewish ties.”
In the Legislature, Rep. Lee Yancey, a Republican from Brandon, has introduced a bill to combat what he says is a “historic rise in antisemitic violence, harassment and discrimination targeting Jewish students” at K-12 schools and in the higher education system.
The bill would require public schools to prohibit and report antisemitic discrimination and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of antisemitism, which has been adopted by several other state legislatures. Notably, the bill exempts all its provisions of a law the Legislature passed last year to ban DEI statements. This could mean that public school might be required to implement measures that might otherwise be considered DEI-related. – Michael Goldberg
Senate considering pieces of House ed plan
Senate leaders have started filing education bills that mirror portions of the massive education package the House passed Thursday. 
This includes a bill that would allow homeschooled children to play public school sports and another that would establish a math program modeled after the 2013 literacy act. It’s a sign that the Senate is going to kill the House bill — after they pick the sections that they like.
Another education issue showing up in both chambers: cellphone bans. Both the House and the Senate have filed multiple bills that restrict or prohibit the usage of cellphones in school.
Youth mental health concerns have resulted in similar bans in at least 11 other states. A bill that would have required Mississippi school boards to create cell phone policies died last year, but several Mississippi school districts have since passed their own policies, including Jackson Public Schools and Madison County. – Devna Bose
More money for career coaching proposed
Rep. Donnie Bell, a Republican from Fulton, has proposed a bill to provide $20 million to expand a career coaching program for middle- and high-school students. 
The career coaching program under Accelerate Mississippi, the state’s office of workforce development, helps students figure out their post graduation paths. 
In a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting last week week, Courtney Taylor, director of Accelerate Mississippi, said there are currently 204 career coaches that serve 209 schools. The office has identified healthcare, advanced manufacturing and construction as priority career fields. – Katherine Lin
Sales tax exemption for farmers considered
Farmers are being squeezed from both sides with high input costs and low crop prices. 
While there are larger economic forces at play, a bill authored by Sen. Neil Whaley, a Republican from Potts Camp and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, would exempt commercial farmers from the 1.5% state sales tax on some agricultural and logging equipment. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has also championed this exemption. – Katherine Lin
Stand-alone tourism department considered again
A bill to create a Department of Tourism has once again passed the Senate. 
A bill authored by Sen. Lydia Chassaniol, a Republican from Winona and chair of the Tourism Committee, would remove tourism from the purview of the Mississippi Development Authority.
Last year, a similar bill was vetoed by Gov. Tate Reeves over funding issues, and the issue has been debated for years. In 2024, tourism contributed over $18 billion to the state’s economy and provided 136,094 jobs. – Katherine Lin
Bill would create Bobby Gentry Day
Rep. Sam Creekmore IV, a Republican from New Albany, has filed legislation to designate June 3 as Bobby Gentry Day in Mississippi — a nod to the date that Gentry once described in a song as “another sleepy, dusty Delta day.”The bill would honor Gentry, born Roberta Lee Streeter, a singer-songwriter from Woodland in northeastern Mississippi’s Chickasaw County.Gentry rose to national prominence in 1967 with her hit “Ode to Billie Joe,” a haunting song in which an unnamed narrator learns that Billie Joe McAllister has died after jumping from the Tallahatchie Bridge.Gentry has not made public appearances for decades and has largely avoided speaking with fans or the media, including in her home state. – Taylor Vance
Workers’ Compensation exemption proposed
A new exception to the workers’ compensation law would allow employers to not pay workers’ compensation for death or injury when an employee deliberately breaks a safety regulation.
The measure, authored by Rep. Donnie Bell, a Republican from Fulton, places the onus on the employer to prove that they had clearly communicated safety rules to the employee. – Katherine Lin
By the Numbers
$162 million
Estimated first-year cost of the House’s omnibus public education bill, including providing tax dollars for parents to use for private schooling or homeschooling.

Hammer, of Minot, said Republican incumbent Rep. Julie Fedorchak hasn’t delivered on campaign promises of addressing affordable housing and health care costs. He also said Fedorchak and Republicans in Congress have failed to provide a check on President Donald Trump’s power on tariffs and his perceived war powers.
“There’s a lot of disappointment going on in North Dakota,” Hammer said in an interview Monday with Joel Heitkamp on KFGO.
In 2024, Hammer received 30% of the statewide vote while Fedorchak received 70%.

Hammer said while affordability issues are not being addressed in Washington, actions in Venezuela and discussions on acquiring Greenland are instead taking center stage.
“We have wrecked ag markets,” Hammer said. “There’s a lot of consternation out there, and a lot of people aren’t getting what they voted for.”
One of the only ways to fix those problems is for Congress to take back its power, he said.
“By being so silent, by never being out there to criticize what the administration does, our delegation actually fails to help Trump be a better president,” Hammer said.
Hammer has diverse work and military experience, which included the Naval Academy where he became a Marine helicopter pilot, and a deployment to Iraq in 2003 as a platoon commander. Hammer also worked in the Bakken oil field and as a science teacher in Granville.
He also worked as a train conductor in Minot before taking leave to make his congressional run.
Hammer had unsuccessful runs for the North Dakota Public Service Commission in 2022 and the North Dakota Legislature in 2020.
Fedorchak previously announced plans to seek reelection. Trump endorsed Fedorchak’s reelection bid in a social media post last summer.
Alex Balazs, who received the North Dakota Republican Party endorsement in 2024 but lost in the primary, also announced he’s running again this year.

(Photo courtesy of Luann Dart/GS Publishing)The fate of a rural hospital, over 100 jobs and health care in southwest North Dakota communities might hinge on a bill lawmakers will consider this week.
The Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center in Elgin, North Dakota, could be forced to close its doors and the area’s only ambulance service if it doesn’t obtain immediate financial assistance, Chief Operating Officer Kristin Heid said. 
“We are in serious financial trouble,” said Heid, who has been serving as the hospital’s administrator since November. “We’re kind of payroll to payroll right now, just hoping that enough revenue comes in to make the next payroll.”

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott, has drafted a bill that would give the health care facility an out. He’s proposing legislation creating an emergency low-interest loan program for nonprofit hospitals and asking legislative leaders to allow the bill to be heard during this week’s special session.
Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott. (Photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
“This is a special caveat for somebody in dire trouble,” Schaible said. Without help, “They would fold. It’d be a very massive effect on the community. They’re the largest employer by far.”
The $10 million loan program would be administered by the state-owned Bank of North Dakota under an existing program that awards low-interest loans to support medical facility construction projects. The potential loan amount for any hospital would be capped at $5 million and would require the hospital to demonstrate a business plan to return to solvency. 
“It can’t be a gift,” Schaible said. “They have to have a decent business plan. They have to go through criteria that makes them prove that they’re sustainable and have a future going forward.”
The closure of the critical access hospital would force local residents to travel more than an hour to the nearest facilities in Dickinson, Hettinger or Bismarck. The closure would include health care clinics in Elgin, Richardton and Glen Ullin. The hospital also hosts 21 patients in long-term swing beds, akin to a long-term care facility, who would have to be transferred to nursing homes elsewhere if operations cease, according to the chief operating officer.
The community would also lose the ambulance the hospital leases, staffs and operates, Heid said. 
“We are in a health care desert,” Heid said. “The nearest ambulance would be 30 miles away.”
Assistance is not guaranteed. Legislative Management must agree to allow the bill to be introduced during the special session. Then the Legislature must hold a hearing and vote on the bill. If approved, eligible hospitals like Elgin’s would then have to apply for a loan through the Bank of North Dakota and provide documentation of the need and ability to repay the loan. 
The hospital’s financial crisis has been growing for years. Internal Revenue Service filings show the nonprofit reported deficits of $822,000 in 2022 and $1.5 million in 2023. Audit findings from 2023 identified “material weaknesses” in the hospital’s internal checks and balances necessary to detect and correct any errors in financial records. The weaknesses were attributed in part to the small size of the staff. 
Heid said the hospital is $3.8 million in debt, but the board was not alerted to the dire financial situation until August or September of last year. The CEO’s employment was terminated in November and the position will not be filled, said Heid, who now serves as the hospital’s lead administrator. 
The board has since initiated several internal reforms to get the hospital’s finances back on track. 
North Dakota lawmakers poised to act next week on federal rural health spending

The hospital is still operating on a thin margin despite those reforms, and used a line of credit from a local bank to make payroll around the holidays, Heid said. A low-interest loan from the state is key to keeping the hospital open, she said. 
“I’m not sure if we can continue forward without that money,” Heid said. “Our facility is just very important to the community and our service area. We hope that we can continue to be there to serve our community in the future.”
The hospital plans to host a community meeting in February to share information about the financial situation, a new strategic plan and how the Rural Health Transformation Program funding from the federal government could help the area. 
Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, supports the bill and said he believes it will serve as a good solution to help Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center return to safe operating margins. 
“It’s structured very well,” Blasl said. “They have to pay these dollars back. So it’s not like a handout or a grant.”
He said some rural hospitals in North Dakota are financially struggling, but they are not in the same degree of trouble Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center is. 
Schaible said if the program is successful in helping Elgin or other community hospitals, it could serve as a pilot program that could be expanded in the future.

(Brett Bowers via Getty Images)In recent weeks, the U.S. government punched a hole in Venezuela’s national defense and kidnapped its president, pirated an oil tanker and continued to threaten Greenland in a move that could destroy NATO, the only organization standing between an aggressive Russia and the European Union. 
This recent spate of colonialist jingoism feels like a wall in a byzantine maze crumbling and connecting a different but similar past to a present that follows tragic behavioral patterns. Recent events may feel different, but they carry echoes from generations past. 
Nearly 60 years ago, in a sermon entitled “The Drum-Major Instinct,” the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached on the mentality at the center of such violent international escapades. As he said in the sermon: “The parallels are frightening.” 
This instinct we all share — a desire for recognition, distinction and greatness — gets perverted in a most sinister way in the quest for international dominance. What troubled the world then, King said, stemmed from nations engaging in “a bitter, colossal contest for supremacy.”
He did not spare the United States in his critique.
“This is where we are drifting, and we are drifting there because nations are caught up with the drum-major instinct: I must be first, I must be supreme, our nation must rule the world. And I am sad to say that the nation in which we live is the supreme culprit,” he said. 
He continued: “And I’m going to continue to say it to America, because I love this country too much to see the drift that it has taken. God didn’t call America to do what she’s doing in the world now. God didn’t call America to engage in a senseless, unjust war as the war in Vietnam. And we are criminals in that war. We have committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world, and I’m going to continue to say it. And we won’t stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation.”
But King encouraged listeners to hold onto the desire for greatness, saying that “it’s a good instinct if you use it right.”
He continued: “Keep feeling the need for being important. Keep feeling the need for being first. But I want you to be first in love. I want you to be first in moral excellence. I want you to be first in generosity.”
His advice still rings true but has gone widely unheeded.
World events can feel linear, particularly to the historically uninitiated absorbing current events without context. Every development feeling like some fresh new outrage.
America’s colonial past spans continents and centuries. Current threats to Venezuela and to Greenland seem fresh. But the history and wisdom used to explain it can take on a circular shape or even an figure eight balanced on its side, a reflection of timeless complexity and timeless continuity.
I once had a younger — but in some ways wiser — boss who introduced me to a Lucile Clifton poem about the Mississippi River emptying into the Gulf and the Gulf entering the sea, “all of them carrying yesterday forever on their white-tipped backs, all of them dragging forward tomorrow.”
The past is always flowing Clifton said, and every water “is the same water coming round.” 
But as remains true today, “someone is standing on the edge of this river, staring into time, whispering mistakenly: only here. Only now.” 
Whispering “only here, only now” under current circumstances registers as a lack of alarm. It’s devoting more attention to symptoms rather than to core issues, issues that really should transcend conservative or progressive labels. 
President Trump has said his own morality “is the only thing that can stop me. … I don’t need international law.” He’s suggested that Renee Good’s “disrespectful” attitude justified her fatal shooting at the hands of an ICE officer. 
Insipid “news” reporting focused on the Seal Team’s precision in capturing the Venezuelan leader, rather than on what the shattering of norms means in a world where frayed cables sustain a fragile balance of power.  
They may as well have asked, “Where did Maduro and his wife have the couch?” at the time of the overnight raid. 
Not enough people evaluate events transpiring around us with the requisite alarm. As King said, the parallels to the past are frightening.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-19 15:28:19+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: CT towns weigh speed camera benefits with privacy concerns,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/19/podcast-ct-speed-cameras/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Emilia Otte discuss her article about the increased prevalence of speed cameras in Connecticut towns.,"As Connecticut municipalities look for ways to promote safe driving, some are turning to speed cameras. However, some advocacy groups have privacy concerns.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Emilia Otte to discuss her article, “As CT speed cameras bring in millions and more towns sign up, concerns linger,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Emilia’s story here.
WSHU: Hello Emilia. Last July, Middletown, Connecticut became one of the first towns in the state to install speed cameras at some strategic locations. It raked in about $1.8 million in fines in six months. Is that what prompted you to do a deep dive into this?
EO: Yes, it was. I pass that speed camera on Route 66 on a regular basis, and slow down on my way.
WSHU: So basically, could you just tell us how the speed camera works?
EO: Essentially, towns have requested to place them in certain strategic locations where people tend to speed, and the cameras will capture when someone goes over 10 miles per hour, over the speed limit, or if they run a red light. And once the cameras have done that, a citation will go out to the person whose car has run the light or sped and then there’s a process for contesting that citation if the person feels they were unfairly given it, or they can simply pay the fine.
WSHU: Yes, for instance, in the situation with Middletown, it was $1.8 million collected, but they charged $2.8 million and this was just in six months.
EO: Yes, it’s true. It does take a little bit of time. There’s a delay between how long it takes to actually collect the fines versus when the citations go out.
WSHU: Okay, now you say that other towns are now looking into this. Initially, some people, especially the ACLU, expressed significant concern about privacy. How has that worked out now that cameras have been installed in certain towns?
EO: So the concerns about privacy, particularly with the ACLU, a lot of that came out of concerns about a particular company called Flock, which there was some concern about data sharing from license plate readers, which are sometimes in towns used by police departments. And there was some concern about that data being shared with federal law enforcement and then being used, particularly around immigration enforcement. That is different from speed or traffic cameras, but the ACLU is still concerned about the use of speed and traffic cameras just for privacy. I will say that Connecticut’s law is extremely strict regarding how the data from speed and red light cameras can be used. It can only be kept for 30 days. So even if say that the camera captures a crime being committed, that data cannot be used as evidence for that. So Connecticut’s law is very strict about how that can be done.
WSHU: Now you say other towns are now looking into setting up their own speed cameras. Which towns are looking at this? And is there a difference between urban communities and rural communities?
EO: There is a large mix of towns looking into this. 11 have been approved by the state so far, because the state has to approve any plan that a municipality makes. So far, I believe Beacon Falls, Fairfield, Stratford, Milford, Greenwich and New Haven have been just approved. Stamford was just approved. So it’s a real mix of small and large towns, and Hartford is still waiting on approval. But towns all over the state are looking into this. Many of them want the traffic cameras in areas around schools.
WSHU: Okay. And there’s also a situation here where you talk to some people in Litchfield County and how it’s working out over there. Could you just give us a little bit of what’s going on there? And they’re not bringing in as much money, but they feel very happy with the way it’s worked out, right?
EO: Yes, the first town to install traffic cameras was a little town called Washington in Litchfield County. They have three cameras. They brought in, you know, $662,000 they issued in fines. That’s pretty good for it’s a small town, but what is really key, they’re saying, is that people are actually slowing down, which was the only thing the first selectman told me that actually worked to get people to slow down.
WSHU: And a large city that’s looking at this right now is Bridgeport, but there’s still some hesitancy, right?
EO: So Bridgeport is in its very, very early stages. I went to a meeting of their public safety committee, where they were really just starting to discuss what would happen if we put some cameras in. And yes, there’s some concern in Bridgeport about, is this the place we want to put our money? Should we be investing in more policing rather than this? There are so many things we need. Why should we be doing this? And I think also in Bridgeport, there has been some concern, because they recently installed traffic cameras on school buses to monitor when cars do not stop for school buses. There’s also been a big controversy over the use of drones to alert emergency responders. So I think in Bridgeport, there’s a bigger context around the use of technology in general and whether or not that’s a good thing and whether or not it really works.
WSHU: But overall, it seems as if we’re going to have a lot more speed cameras in a lot more communities going forward.
EO: Indeed.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0115_SR_SpeedCamera_071-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

(Photo via Google Earth) The Iowa Board of Pharmacy has sanctioned a pharmacist for dispensing drugs without a prescription, and lifted restrictions on a physician convicted of felony narcotics distribution.
The board alleges pharmacist Joshua Davis of Corydon self-reported dispensing a variety of prescription medications to a friend without any legitimate prescription from a health care provider. There were about 23 fraudulent prescriptions dispensed by Davis “over a period of a few years,” the board alleges — although the board has not disclosed when that was or where Davis was working.
The board also alleges that in pharmacy records that Davis altered the name and birthdate of his friend to conceal the fraudulent nature of the drug dispensing.
The board charged Davis with knowingly making misleading, deceptive or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public; diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution; forging or altering a prescription; and practicing outside the scope of his profession.
To resolve the case, Davis and the board agreed to a settlement that calls for his license to be placed on probationary status for two years, during which time he will be subject to some form of worksite monitoring. Davis also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and complete 10 hours of education on law or ethics.
State and federal records indicate that for the past several years, Davis has worked at Your Neighborhood Pharmacy, an affiliate of Wayne County Hospital, in Corydon.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Davis for comment Friday.
Other pharmacy board actions
Other Iowa health professionals whose disciplinary cases recently came before the Board of Pharmacy include:
— Dr. Troy Adolfson, 55, of Ankeny, a physician who sought reinstatement of his Controlled Substances Act registration allowing him to prescribe narcotics.
In 2019, Adolfson surrendered his South Dakota medical license, as well as his Drug Enforcement Administration license, after being criminally charged with felony narcotics distribution.
In that case, Adolfson admitted that between January 2017 and April 2017, he knowingly and intentionally distributed oxycodone by writing prescriptions for 60 to 140 pills to a co-worker and two other people, who then had the prescriptions filled at a pharmacy. Adolfson said the three individuals gave him the oxycodone in exchange for $50 each and a portion of the pills. “I estimate I prescribed approximately 1,400 pills of oxycodone in this manner,” Adolfson told the court.
Adolfson was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison and ordered to pay a $20,000, according to the court records. More than two years after Adolfson admitted his conduct, the Iowa Board of Medicine issued Adolfson a warning and placed his medical license on probation for five years, during which time he was barred from prescribing, administering or dispensing controlled substances for the treatment of chronic pain.
In 2024, Adolfson entered into a voluntary restriction of his CSA registration. In 2025, the Iowa Board of Medicine lifted its restrictions on Adolfson’s medical license, after which Adolfson sought reinstatement of his CSA registration without restriction.
After Adolfson provided the Board of Pharmacy with a letter explaining his past conduct and rehabilitation, the board concluded he had provided sufficient evidence of rehabilitation to warrant reinstatement of the registration. Adolfson, the board said, had “demonstrated he is committed to maintaining his sobriety and is passionate about continuing in his profession as a physician.”
The reinstatement requires Adolfson to participate in the Iowa Professional Health Program or, if he is deemed ineligible, he must submit to board monitoring for three years.
The board records make no mention of the fact that in February 2025, Adolfson was arrested and charged with drunken driving. Police alleged he was driving through a Costco parking lot when he collided with another vehicle. The other party to the accident summoned police, citing concerns that Adolfson appeared to be drunk.
Police alleged Adolfson admitted to drinking and had a blood-alcohol level of .270 — more than three times the legal limit for driving. He later pleaded guilty to first-offense drunken driving and sentenced to one year of probation. He was discharged from probation after six months, court records show.
— Alexander Goodwin, 32, of Camanche, who recently agreed to surrender his pharmacist’s license to the board. The board alleges Goodwin admitted stealing “two Adderall tablets” from a Walgreen’s store in Clinton where he was employed, as well as an unspecified amount of other drugs from the Clinton store and a Walgreen’s store in Dubuque.
The board charged Goodwin with knowingly making misleading, deceptive or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public; diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution; and habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs.
As part of the recent settlement in which Goodwin agreed to surrender his pharmacist’s license, he also agreed he will not be eligible to seek reinstatement for at least one year.
Court records show that in June 2025, Goodwin was criminally charged with theft and prohibited acts for the alleged misappropriation of drugs from the Clinton store. Police alleged that an internal audit identified 60 missing oxycodone pills from the pharmacy’s inventory.
According to police, surveillance footage from the store indicated that on one occasion, Goodwin stole, and then swallowed, an oxycodone pill while on duty at the store, and that an inventory showed losses at the store involving 80 different types of medications.
Police also alleged Goodwin admitted that he had been previously caught on video attempting to steal medications while working at the Hartig Drug store in Savanna, Illinois.
The Iowa criminal charges were later dismissed when Clinton County prosecutors said they couldn’t locate the general manager of the Walgreen’s store to testify.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Your-Neighborhood-Pharmacy.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

(Staff and submitted photos)TOPEKA — Four candidates for Kansas governor loaned their campaigns at least $1 million to bolster the bottom line on year-end finance reports and support claims of political momentum eight months from the August primary election.
Former Gov. Jeff Colyer started his campaign with a $50,000 loan in May and followed with three loans in December to push his personal commitment to $1.05 million at the end of the reporting period Dec. 31. He raised an equivalent amount from donors, his report said, and had $1.8 million in cash after expenses.
“Matching that support personally shows I’m fully committed to winning this race and delivering results for Kansas again,” said Colyer, who was governor from 2018 to 2019 after resignation of Gov. Sam Brownback.
Businessman Philip Sarnecki, with no previous experience in electoral politics, personally loaned his campaign a jaw-dropping $2 million. That left $2.3 million in his account — the largest cash-on-hand total of any 2026 candidate for governor.
“Our campaign has raised the most money in Kansas gubernatorial history and we did it in far less time than every other Republican candidate in the field,” Sarnecki said. “There’s an incredible energy around our campaign. Kansans are tired of losing and they’re tired of career politicians.”
Scott Schwab, the Kansas secretary of state, loaned his campaign $1.045 million. Overall, Schwab raised $1.4 million, spent $365,000 and held $1.05 million cash-in-hand.
The million-dollar club included Joy Eakins, a former Wichita school board member who loaned herself an even $1 million. She raised $1.1 million overall and spent $116,000. Eakins said the United States was on the cusp of a “golden age” under President Donald Trump, but Kansas could miss out on that good fortune if it failed to elect a conservative governor.

Other borrowers
Former Johnson County Commission member Charlotte O’Hara approved a personal loan of $485,000 to her campaign. At year’s end, she had $510,000 in her gubernatorial account.
State Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, a former Topeka state senator, loaned herself $81,500 and closed the year with $928,000 in cash. She said she was grateful for “confidence Kansans are placing in this campaign — and we’re just getting started.”
Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover didn’t make a loan to his campaign in 2025. He ended the year with $687,o00 in his account, which was less than five of his GOP competitors.
Masterson said nearly all of his donations arrived in the final three months of 2025 after he overhauled his campaign staff by dropping Axiom Strategies and hiring consultants more closely aligned with Trump. He said his nonprofit organization Take Back Kansas, which didn’t have to identify donors, entered 2026 with $700,000 in its account.
“We’re building a movement of everyday Kansans who are fed up with being taxed to death and watching their state fall behind,” Masterson said.
In the Democratic Party’s race for the gubernatorial nomination, neither Sen. Ethan Corson nor Sen. Cindy Holscher, both of Johnson County, made loans to their campaigns. Holscher raised $397,000 and had $179,000 at end of the year. Corson reported contributions of $902,000 during 2025, but had $526,000 in cash on Dec. 31.
“That’s one of the largest hauls for any non-incumbent Democrat running for governor in Kansas history,” Corson said in a fundraising appeal. “That’s why I am the only candidate in this race who has what it takes to go toe-to-toe with extremist Republicans and their large fundraising hauls.”

Attorney general contest
In the campaign for attorney general, incumbent Republican Kris Kobach of Lecompton began 2025 with $217,000 in his campaign account. He added $337,000, spent $52,000 and reported cash of $502,600 at the close of 2025. He said the previous high in terms of cash-on-hand at this juncture of a Kansas campaign for attorney general was $501,300 by Democratic Attorney General Steve Six in 2009.
Kobach said he didn’t make a personal loan to his campaign in 2025. He formally filed for reelection on Jan. 8.
“From day one, my focus has been on protecting Kansas families, upholding the rule of law and fighting for our Kansas values,” Kobach said.
Kobach’s likely Democratic opponent in the November election, Chris Mann of Lawrence, submitted a report showing he raised $536,000 last year. He spent more than half of the total and retained $257,000 in cash. In 2022, Mann lost the attorney general’s race to Kobach by less that 2 percentage points.
“Kansas families are anxious, frustrated and fed up. They deserve real change. Instead, they get Kris Kobach, an attorney general more focused on pushing his personal agenda than on helping the people of Kansas,” Mann said.
Three candidates for Kansas secretary of state — Schwab chose to seek the GOP nomination for governor — made loans to their campaigns. Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, loaned himself $134,000 to bring his campaign receipts to $312,000. By the end of 2025, he’d spent $102,000 on the race.
“This record-setting support is not about numbers on a spreadsheet,” Proctor said. “It  reflects a growing movement of conservatives who want secure elections, accountable government and leaders who put Kansas first.”
His primary opponent, Rep. Ken Rahjes, R-Agra, said he received $24,000 in contributions, including an $8,000 personal loan.
Democratic candidate Jennifer Day, a former Kansas House member from Overland Park, said she raised $84,000 from more than 700 donors. In addition, she loaned herself $43,000. During the period, she spent $69,000.
Day said the stakes were high in the election because Kansas Republicans were engaged in “backroom meetings to eliminate early voting and weaken longstanding mail ballot protections.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/millionairesGOP-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

Some legislators are listening,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/19/desoto-school-board-wants-to-oust-peer/,"Audience members express emotion as public comments are given during the DeSoto County School Board meeting in Hernando, Miss. on Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
HERNANDO — Some DeSoto County School Board members want a legal process by which an elected peer — another school board member — can be ousted for concerns including malfeasance and abuse of power. They passed a resolution in November formally asking lawmakers to consider granting that authority in the current legislative session.
A new law “would give school boards more authority when situations arise that cause concern in the community,” school board President Jerald Wheeler said in a statement to Mississippi Today.
For now, there is no legal mechanism for a school board to remove one of its members, said Jim Keith, attorney for the DeSoto County School Board.
The board members may get their wish to change that, at least in terms of a bill.
Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, has filed Senate Bill 2068, which would allow a school district’s local governing authority, by majority vote, to remove a school board member for breach of public trust, neglect of duty and abuse of authority. The school board would first have to vote on a recommendation. Rep. Kimberly Remak, a Republican from Olive Branch, is the primary author of House Bill 573, the House version of Blackwell’s bill. The bill now has multiple coauthors and bipartisan support. Remak did not respond to requests for comment.
On Dec. 30, Sen. Michael McLendon, a Republican from Hernando, announced on Facebook plans to introduce the Whiteside Accountability Act, a separate bill that, if passed into law, would provide “a statutory recall process for school board members who engage in conduct that undermines student safety, including actions that defend or minimize sexual crimes against minors.” The bill would give the power to school board members to remove other board members. 
McLendon introduced the Education Leadership Accountability Act on Jan. 14.
DeSoto County School Board members’ interest in ousting another elected board member stems from public calls for Michele Henley to resign after she wrote a letter and testified on behalf of Lindsey Whiteside, a former volunteer assistant girls’ basketball coach at DeSoto Central High School who had already pleaded guilty to sexual battery of a minor. At least nine other district employees wrote letters of support for Whiteside.
On Oct. 13, a judge sentenced Whiteside to three years of house arrest and seven years of probation — a much lighter sentence than the 30 years that prosecutors sought. The sentence divided the tranquil Memphis suburbs in Mississippi, where Whiteside was also a youth pastor.
Whiteside pleaded guilty earlier that day to committing sexual battery against a minor who attended her church. Some people, disturbed by Henley’s testimony and that some school district staff also wrote letters vouching for Whiteside’s character, began calling for Henley’s removal from the school board. They took to social media and spoke out at school board meetings. 
“Disappointment, outrage, neglect of power” are a few reactions McLendon has heard from constituents since the conclusion of the Whiteside trial.
“It’s one thing to write a letter on the character of a person that you know, but writing the letter on official letterhead and using your elected title carries weight as an authoritative figure,” McLendon said of Henley.
Henley did not respond to multiple requests for comment by Mississippi Today.

In a statement posted to Facebook on Oct. 15, Henley said the letter she wrote did not express support for Whiteside’s actions “or endorse her behavior.” The letter, shared in the post, describes Whiteside coaching and supporting Henley’s daughter in basketball.
As for her testimony, Henley wrote, “Contrary to what has been claimed, I did not testify for the defense. I was subpoenaed by the District Attorney to appear in court. While on the stand, I was asked whether I condoned Lindsey’s actions. My response was no. When asked about what her sentence should be, I stated that such a decision was for the judge to determine.”
‘A mechanism is necessary’
A half-dozen DeSoto County residents told Mississippi Today they believe Henley abused their trust when she wrote a letter of support on Whiteside’s behalf. The victim’s family said they felt Henley exercised poor judgment in supporting Whiteside over a district student.
The family members also said they felt Henley’s actions should be grounds for removal from the school board. After making a statement condemning Henley’s actions, the school board passed a resolution formally asking the legislature for legal recourse to grant them the power to oust one of their members, due in part to public outcry.
“The Board of Trustees of the DeSoto County School District firmly believes that a mechanism is necessary for the removal of school board members … to ensure a safe and supportive learning environment for students,” read the Nov. 20 resolution by the DeSoto County School Board.

Every board member save Henley, who abstained, voted in support of the recent motion.
Katie Sasso, the mother of a DeSoto County School District student, said Henley’s departure would allow for the community to heal. Aubrie Johnson, a concerned community member, said, “It was shocking to see (someone) support a real-life predator.”
DeSoto County District Attorney Matthew Barton wrote Henley in October that “when an elected official chooses to protect the abuser rather than the abused, she ceases to serve the public good.” Barton said he called for Henley’s resignation so integrity and confidence could be restored to the school board.
On Nov. 6, at Henley’s first school board meeting appearance since the hearing, two members of the victim’s family called for her resignation. Pam Pegram, the victim’s grandmother, asked that Henley look at her during their exchange, pausing for Henley’s response. Pegram was met with nearly two minutes of silence. 
“You heard the brave young girl read her victim statement and tell everyone in that courtroom about the vile and evil things that the predator had done. You heard the despair in the victim’s mother’s letter. You heard the frustration and the anger from the victim’s stepdad,” Pegram said. “You could have any time said, ‘I’m so sorry. I can no longer support this.’ But you cowardly refused to stand up for a child that attended school in your district.”
At that meeting, the school board voted to replace Henley as its president. Henley remains a board member. 
In conversation with the public
DeSoto County Parents for Accountability, a parent group that found a broad audience on Facebook, is also pushing for Henley’s resignation.
The effort included organizing a protest of the school board on Oct. 17. The group has also criticized the school board, saying it meets at times when parents can’t attend.
The parents’ rights group helped organize a boycott of the school district the week after the Whiteside verdict. They protested what they called a lack of transparency and response by district leadership.

Nancy Kemper, grandmother of a DeSoto County student, said during the public comments section of the meeting that she was unable to attend past meetings because they were scheduled during school pickup time. She said she felt the meeting schedule gave Henley the opportunity to dodge accountability.
“I know a lot of people that wanted to come here today and they feel like it was really convenient — especially for (Henley) — that they couldn’t come and speak because they are in line picking up their children.”
Seeking a legislative response
The bills introduced this legislative session aren’t the first attempts to extend school boards’ authority, including their power to remove other school board members.
In November, the DeSoto County School Board voted to support HB 817, which Remak introduced during the 2025 legislative session. HB 817 would have allowed school board members, by a majority vote and through the local governing agency, to remove a colleague for “malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance,” breach of public trust and abuse of authority.
The DeSoto board’s vote was symbolic; the bill had died in committee.
Another bill filed this session, authored by Kabir Karriem, a Democrat from Columbus, would also allow for the removal of a school board member for misconduct and “breach of public trust.” House Bill 521 would also limit a school board’s power to request a hike in property tax.
Karriem said he hoped to prevent school boards from triggering “irresponsible” property tax increases or other rash actions. He was inspired to reintroduce his bill from the 2025 legislative session because of his constituents’ concerns in Columbus.
“When you have school board members that feel like they have complete autonomy that creates problems for the community,” Karriem said. “And there always needs to be checks and balances.”
“There needs to be the opportunity to remove bad actors.”
If one of the bills to let school boards oust another board member becomes law, Mississippi will be one of the first state to grant that power. New York allows school board members to vote out their peers for “official misconduct.” Indiana allows removal by a circuit judge, while Virginia and Alabama give that right to governors. Illinois grants the power to a regional superintendent. In 24 states, excluding Mississippi, an elected school board member can be removed by a recall vote.
There is a lot of support for the bills before the Legislature this session, McLendon said. “It’s a nonpartisan bill that holds everyone accountable for their actions when it comes to protecting children.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10112358/3X0A2787.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

The headlines are making clear, big and important debates and actions – especially several controversial actions of the Trump administration and its allies — have continued to roil American policy and politics in the New Year. From the health care wars to the widespread immigration crackdowns to a bevy of contentious foreign policy moves, Americans are concerned about the present and future and, in many instances, deeply divided.
It’s the kind of moment that keeps political scientists and pollsters busy as they work to assess the state of public opinion and how it’s likely to impact voting patterns and upcoming elections, and one especially trustworthy monitor of the situation in North Carolina is Meredith College political science professor and pollster David McLennan. And recently, we caught up with McLennan for an extended interview in which we dug into several of these matters.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation with Meredith College political scientist and pollster David McLennan, we examined some of the top issues making political and policy news in the New Year and how they relate to the latest developments we’re seeing in American public opinion and voter registration numbers.
In Part Two of our chat, we continued this conversation, and looked more closely at some of the most controversial issues – including the Trump administration’s national crackdown on immigrants and its controversial foreign policy actions and statements — as well as how these controversies might impact the 2026 elections and, in particular, North Carolina’s highly anticipated U.S. Senate race between former Gov.

(Photo by Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Two dog-walking Soldotna residents are fighting a pair of unusual federal fines after getting in an argument with a fur trapper in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge last year.
Laura McIndoe and Trafford Evanoff appeared in federal court Tuesday this week to enter “not guilty” pleas and formally challenge $280 per-person tickets issued by a refuge officer for interfering with an authorized trap line. Further hearings are scheduled for later in the spring.
McIndoe did not return a phone call Friday afternoon. 
Conflicts between dog walkers and fur trappers are not unusual in Alaska despite efforts to avoid them, but federal citations are rare, according to a search of online court records. 
The citations facing McIndoe and Evanoff do not identify the trapper, who was not fined. The injured dog also was not named.
According to the citations, the trapper called a Fish and Wildlife Service officer after McIndoe’s dog became caught in one of the trapper’s foothold traps and McIndoe became “very upset and cursed at him, telling him to stay away.”
“He said the woman told him that her sons were in their 30s and big men, and if they see him, they will kill him,” said the affidavit, signed by officer Shay Hurd. 
Two of the trapper’s other traps were destroyed, and the trap that snared the dog was lost. 
According to Hurd’s affidavit, McIndoe said “the dog was doing better” two weeks after the incident, “after a large vet bill.”
The trapper had a permit to work within the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, correctly marked their trap line with a warning sign, and placed the trap line in a valid area more than one mile away from the road, according to Hurd’s account.
McIndoe was cited for “interfering with persons engaged in authorized activities” in the refuge, as was Evanoff, who was identified as her son.

Commemorative services are planned across the state Monday as the nation pauses for a federal holiday in observance of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. MLK Day is a national day of service to encourage all Americans to volunteer and improve their communities.
Bishop William Barber – president of Repairers of the Breach and architect of the Forward Together Moral Movement – will mark the day with a series of speeches encouraging people of all backgrounds to come together and sound the alarm against unjust policies that have led to healthcare cuts, gerrymandered districts, reduced funding for public schools, and increased aggressive actions by ICE agents.
Barber and a coalition of North Carolina religious leaders and advocacy organizations recently announced plans for a memorial march in mid-February to speak out against regressive policies while highlighting what they believe is a better path forward for the nation. NC Newsline sat down with Bishop Barber to discuss the upcoming march and his thoughts as we mark the 2026 MLK Day. Barber shared with us one of the key objectives of the upcoming February march is to lift up a vision of what caring and thinking people are for, more than just the policies that they’re against.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260109_104338-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-19 09:57:09.650315

(Photo courtesy of Sam Stukel/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Emails obtained by clean-water advocates show the state of South Dakota declined $290,000 of federal funding for zebra mussel decontamination stations at Pactola Reservoir, which the advocates say is evidence that the state isn’t taking the invasive threat seriously enough.
The state agency tasked with fighting aquatic invasive species said it declined the money because it was only for equipment, without additional ongoing funding needed for the equipment’s operation and maintenance. The agency defended its approach to zebra mussels, saying it’s focused on the most practical steps it can sustain with available staff, emphasizing boat inspections and education aimed at slowing the spread.
Zebra mussels are tiny invasive shellfish, originally found in Asia and Europe, that spread by clinging to boats. They clog pipes, water intakes and hydroelectric power equipment, cut swimmers’ feet, and change the native aquatic ecosystem.
The number of zebra mussel-infested lakes in South Dakota grew from one in 2014 to 32 now.


State Department of Game, Fish, and Parks Secretary Kevin Robling said while testifying to lawmakers last January that he was unaware of any missed zebra mussel funding opportunities.
“I am not familiar with any money that we reverted back or did not spend or did not use,” Robling said.
South Dakota Lakes and Streams Association board members had heard otherwise. They obtained emails, reviewed by South Dakota Searchlight, that show federal agencies and the state discussed Pactola Reservoir containment options in 2022 and 2023, and that the state ultimately declined U.S. Bureau of Reclamation funding for decontamination equipment at Pactola. The reservoir, a key Black Hills water source and recreation site, was confirmed to have zebra mussels in July 2022.
South Dakota Lakes and Streams Vice President Deb Soholt, a Republican former state senator from Sioux Falls, said the emails reflect a broader lack of urgency on the part of the state.
“We’ve made a policy decision that there’s nothing we can do to stop this, no matter how much money we pour at it,” Soholt said. “That’s a flawed premise. Other states are fighting. We should be, too.”
Game, Fish, and Parks spokesperson Nick Harrington said the agency is doing what it can.
“Our inspection numbers have continued to increase throughout the years,” he said. “If they want to say that between a certain year there was a funding lapse, well, inspections were increasing. The program was operating. The program was funded.”
He said there were 14,556 boat inspections in 2021, 18,582 in 2022, 18,642 in 2023, and 22,165 in 2024. Inspectors ensure boaters have cleaned off any plants, mud and debris, drained live wells or tanks that hold water, and dried everything completely before launching in another waterbody.  
Harrington said Robling did not recall the declined funding when he was asked about it last year during a legislative hearing.
What the emails show
At Pactola Reservoir, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation operates the dam, the U.S. Forest Service manages the surrounding land and recreation sites, and the state Department of Game, Fish, and Parks oversees fishing and boating regulations and invasive species control. 
The emails show the bureau, Forest Service, and Game, Fish and Parks convened multiple meetings in July 2022 to discuss management options “for preventing the spread of zebra mussels from Pactola Reservoir to surrounding waterbodies.”
On July 19, 2022, a state employee summarized the state’s approach to zebra mussels at Pactola.
“After reviewing our current resources and limitations that exist with staff and equipment, it is very evident that there is no way we can implement a comprehensive containment approach on Pactola Reservoir,” wrote GF&P Fisheries Supervisor Jake Davis.
Davis wrote that the state would “focus on outreach and education,” adding that “inspections will still occur.” 
The emails referenced decontamination units, which are hot water, high-pressure sprayers used to clean boats by killing and removing zebra mussels.

Davis said in the emails that there was already a decontamination unit at Pactola.
In February 2023, the bureau drafted Pactola Reservoir zebra mussel containment recommendations. They describe goals to educate the public and contain the spread. They also note that the bureau had secured funding “for two additional decontamination units at Pactola Reservoir.”
On March 7, 2023, the state’s fisheries program administrator informed the bureau that, “after discussion with Senior Administration,” the department did “not desire to enter into an agreement” for the $290,0000 of federal funding to purchase two additional decontamination units at Pactola.
The proposal included another $200,000 for the Forest Service to help pay for the equipment, according to emails obtained by Lakes and Streams. 
“These were one-time funds, and no additional funds were going to be made available for future operation and maintenance of these pieces of equipment,” Harrington said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. “As a result, we requested that the funds be used to help cover the costs of labor at current inspection stations, as that is where they could be used to best support” the state’s aquatic invasive species program.
“Unfortunately, due to the way the funds were requested, their purpose could not be altered,” Harrington said.
Game, Fish and Parks spent $4.65 million to combat aquatic invasive species in the state from 2021 to 2024, with $3.7 million coming from outside the department (predominantly from federal agencies).
Harrington said the department focuses its resources on public outreach and inspections.
“Our goal is to slow the spread of these species,” he said. “Our message is clean, drain, dry.”
Harrington said compliance at inspection stations is high. 
“People know the rules, and they’re following them for the most part,” he said. “Ninety-eight percent compliance is better than seat belts — and those save our lives.”
Advocates say ‘not enough’
Soholt said the compliance rate is less when no official is waiting at the shoreline to inspect a boat. She wants lawmakers to convene a public-private working group to develop a new statewide strategy, including options like seeking private donors or adding a small license fee per boat to help fund more zebra mussel containment.
“We could fiercely protect the remaining reservoirs and lakes if we acted now,” she said. “Instead, we’re saying, ‘It’s inevitable.’”
Dan Loveland, also with Lakes and Streams, said watercraft inspections are the most effective tool, and South Dakota’s inspection effort is weak and under-resourced. He said “clean, drain, dry” isn’t enough without enforcement to back it up.
Loveland, too, wants a statewide stakeholder process and a dedicated funding source to fight aquatic invasive species.
“Get all these stakeholders together and go through what is happening to our state, and let’s talk about different ways that we can approach this,” he said. “Let’s find a funding source that we can dedicate to fighting the aquatic invasive species all across South Dakota.”
Robling gave a presentation to lawmakers on Thursday that included information on zebra mussels. He showed lawmakers a time-lapse map of the species’ spread since the late 1980s to underscore that South Dakota is not alone.
Asked about research, Robling said genetic approaches aimed at reducing zebra mussel reproduction are still in early stages and have seen “very little success” so far, though Minnesota remains a research hub.
Rep. Tim Goodwin, R-Rapid City, said he plans to propose a legislative summer study on zebra mussels.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/52136145384_962964e6e4_k-e1768767999912-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-19 09:57:09.650315

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah lawmakers will be returning to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for their 45-day 2026 legislative session — and already the list of issues they plan to tackle is long, with the number of bills filed growing by the day. 
Because the Utah Legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority, the state’s GOP legislative leaders often set the agenda while Democratic lawmakers try their best to fight against legislative efforts they oppose. 
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper — told Utah News Dispatch in wide-ranging interviews last week what bills and issues are top of mind for them for 2026. 
Meanwhile, the state’s Democratic leaders — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla and House Minority Leader Angela Romero, both Democrats from Salt Lake City — say they’re bracing for a legislative session that’s expected to be tough on many different fronts.
Not only is the state’s more than $30 billion budget expected to be tight due to federal tax cuts — along with pressure from Republican legislative leaders to continue their streak of income tax rate cuts. But also, 2026 is an election year for all 75 seats in the House and 15 in the Senate, likely to add an extra layer of political calculus and gamesmanship.

And already, bills are stacking up that target groups including undocumented immigrants and transgender people that Democrats and community advocates are gearing up to fight. 
It remains to be seen what legislative proposals survive both the House and Senate — but insights from Adams and Schultz help shed light on what they’re more likely to prioritize. 
Utah advocates, faith leaders call on lawmakers to take more action on homelessness

Here are some of their top priorities, along with issues that are expected to be among the most contentious this year: 

 More tax cuts:

	 A sixth year of an income tax rate cut — on top of more than $500 million already slashed in 2026 and 2027 from the state’s budget due to federal tax changes under the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act — and an effort to rein in property taxes. At the same time, legislative leaders have directed all state agencies to propose ways to cut 5% from their budgets as part of a statewide efficiency exercise. 


 Judiciary changes:
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Schultz and Adams are all supportive of expanding the Utah Supreme Court from five justices to seven. They say it’s to bring Utah in line with other states and help speed up decision-making, but Democrats question the timing of the move and whether it’s in “retaliation” for several court rulings that Republicans have vehemently opposed, especially in the state’s redistricting court battle. Schultz is also supportive of increasing “transparency” on judges. Several other bills have also been filed, including SB57 which would increase the number of judges for the district court, juvenile court, and the Court of Appeals. HB262 would increase the threshold of votes needed for a judge to be retained. Additionally, lawmakers have filed at least three proposed constitutional amendments related to the judiciary. HJR5 would allow the governor to select any qualified candidate to fill a judicial vacancy, even if the candidate isn’t nominated by a nominating commission. And HJR13 would empower the Legislature to initiate a “special” retention election if the Legislature decides “that judge is unfit or incompetent.”

Utah lawmaker wants to cut off resources for undocumented immigrants to get them to ‘self-deport’


 Another attempt to solidify lawmakers’ ability to change ballot initiatives:

	Also tied to the state’s redistricting lawsuit — which traces back to a 2018 ballot initiative for an independent redistricting process known as Proposition 4 — Utah’s Republican leaders are expected to propose another constitutional amendment to ensure the Legislature has the ability to change laws enacted by voters. The language of what that proposed amendment would be, however, is unknown.


 Homelessness:

	Gov. Spencer Cox has proposed lawmakers set aside $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding for “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.” At the same time the governor has been supportive of a controversial proposal to build a 1,300-bed homeless campus in northwest Salt Lake City. Adams and Schultz have said they’re open to discussions around homelessness but they didn’t commit to fully funding Cox’s recommendations. Schultz said he wants cities and counties to do more to provide funding while also saying the state wants to remain a partner. 


 Immigration issues:

	Adams and Schultz did not name any specific immigration-related bills they’re supporting as of yet, but some of the most controversial proposals to surface so far ahead of the session look to cut off publicly-funded resources for undocumented immigrants, restrict their ability to legally drive, and criminalize providing housing for people without legal status.

Anti-transgender bill among ‘most harmful and outrageous’ Utah LGBTQ+ advocates have seen


 Anti-transgender legislation:
LGBTQ+ advocates are opposing a list of bills already filed, including one that would strike the word “gender” from Utah code, effectively erasing transgender anti-discrimination provisions for housing, employment and crime victims. That’s among the “most harmful and outrageous” bills advocates with Equality Utah have seen — but that bill may run into issues in the Senate. Adams said he’d be hesitant to make any changes to Utah’s 2015 law that enacted LGBTQ+ protections while balancing religious freedom. However, other bills are in play — including one to make permanent Utah’s indefinite moratorium on prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors. Schultz said he’s supportive of turning that moratorium into a ban. 


 Elections: 

	Last year, the House and Senate clashed over a sweeping bill that originally would have drastically restricted voting by mail. The Legislature ultimately passed a watered-down version to slowly phase out automatic voting by mail in 2029, but Schultz said he wants to revisit that legislation — including enacting in-person ID requirements. Adams said he’s open to more changes, but he’s supportive of keeping voting by mail while reinstating vote-by-mail signature verification, which would under the current law phase out by 2029. Both Schultz and Adams also said they want to add additional requirements to ensure people without legal immigration status can’t vote (which is already illegal). Democrats question whether that’s needed, since instances of that happening are rare. 

That’s not an exhaustive list. Lawmakers are also expected to continue efforts to focus on issues including energy development, critical minerals, water, housing, artificial intelligence regulations and more. 
Almost half of Utah’s third graders don’t read at grade level, report says

The governor is also pushing a bell-to-bell ban on cellphones in schools, and improvements to the state’s lagging K-3 literacy, including encouraging a policy to hold back third graders unless they pass a reading test to advance to fourth grade. 
Here’s a full list of Senate Republicans’ priorities, and here’s the House GOP’s. Senate Democrats’ priorities, Escamilla said, are aimed at going “back to the basics” by focusing on unmet needs for education, health care, child care, housing and other issues while “defending democracy.” And House Democrats’ priorities, among other issues, promote inclusion and representation, education and environmental protections. 
Another income tax cut — plus an effort to limit property taxes
For a sixth year in a row, the Senate president and House speaker want to cut the state’s income tax rate, currently sitting at 4.5%, as part of an effort they say is to help keep Utah affordable, competitive with other states, and a place where people will want to live, work and do business. 
But the governor notably didn’t include an income tax rate cut in his 2026 budget recommendations, pointing out that Utah already won’t collect about $300 million of corporate and individual income tax in 2026 and $200 million in 2027 due to federal changes to tax policy in Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act . 
That’s on top of the more than $1.4 billion in tax cuts lawmakers have approved over the past five years, much of which has come from income tax reductions. Under the Utah Constitution, income tax is largely required to fund the state’s public education system, which advocates and Democrats have argued continues to go underfunded. Despite significant increases in education funding in recent years, Utah is still among the lowest-ranking states for per-pupil education spending.
Utah Legislature OKs another round of tax cuts, totaling $1.4 billion in 5 years

Meanwhile, lawmakers on the powerful budgetary oversight body, the Executive Appropriations Committee, last month directed budget subcommittees to propose 5% cuts across state agencies as part of a statewide efficiency exercise. 
“You know, will those 5% cuts stick across the board? No. But I think it’s good for everybody to go in and look at their budgets,” Schultz said. 
The Legislature won’t put its finishing touches on the budget until the final days of the session, scheduled to end March 6, so it’s not yet clear what programs will or won’t get funded, but Democrats including Romero and Escamilla are concerned about Republicans prioritizing yet another tax cut while needs for child care, education, deeply affordable housing, homelessness and others continue to go unmet.
“I have major concerns about what’s going to be cut and how that is going to impact our most vulnerable,” Romero said.
In past years, the Executive Appropriations Committee has preemptively set aside a pot of money ahead of the session for a tax cut — but this year it didn’t. House Republicans, however, listed in their priorities $200 million for a tax cut. 
Adams said $200 million is the number needed to reduce the state’s income tax rate from 4.5% to 4.45% — but he acknowledged that whether lawmakers are able to do that depends on how the budgeting process goes. 
Under Trump tax cuts, Utah won’t collect $500 million in income taxes in 2026, 2027

“We’ll be scraping the top of the paint can lids to try to find a way,” Adams said, but he added it’s a “high priority.” 
“We want to do it smart. We want to be responsible. We want to make sure all the state needs are being met. That’s super important,” Schultz said, but he added that reducing “cost of living” is a top priority for House Republicans, and that includes lowering the income tax rate again. 
Escamilla argued Utah can’t keep up its streak of foregoing hundreds of millions of income tax revenue year after year. 
“We’ve been consistent in opposing any income tax cuts. That’s problematic,” Escamilla said. “I mean, I really do not know where they’re going to get the funds from.” 
Additionally, Schultz said he’s supportive of efforts to reign in property taxes at the local level and prevent the tax burden shifting away from commercial properties and on to Utah homeowners. 
He pointed to a proposed constitutional amendment and accompanying bill being sponsored by Rep. Jill Koford, R-Ogden, that would increase the percentage of the fair market value of a home that is exempt from property tax, from 45% to 60%. He said that’s expected to drop people’s property taxes “a couple hundred bucks a year.” 
While state agencies look for 5% cuts, Schultz said he also thinks local governments should go through a similar exercise, so he’s supportive of legislative efforts to limit their ability to enact property tax hikes. Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, also has a bill to limit taxing entities from adopting a budget that exceeds 5% of the previous year’s property tax budgeted revenue, excluding new growth. 
Are Utah homeowners paying more than their fair share of property taxes? What an audit found

Pointing to Salt Lake County’s recent 14.65% property tax hike to address inflation and rising costs, Schultz said “people are losing their minds over that.” 
“If our local governments don’t recognize what’s happening and get their budgets in order instead of just increasing property taxes, they’re going to see more and more of these types of bills,” Schultz said, though he added he’s not sure what bills will pass. “But I’ll tell you, it’s widely popular, and it’s something that we absolutely need to consider.” 
Romero expressed concerns with limiting cities, counties and school districts’ ability to oversee property taxes, both as a matter of encroaching on local control but also how that could impact services and school districts. 
Moe Hickey, executive director of the advocacy group Voices for Utah Children, expressed similar concerns, but especially when thinking about pairing that with income tax reductions. 
“If you’re cutting income tax, which leads to cuts in services, which local communities want to keep, then they have to raise their property tax,” he said. “They don’t operate separately. There’s a relationship there … If you cut the income tax enough, you’re either going to lose services or you’re going to have to increase local tax, plain and simple.” 
Expanding the Utah Supreme Court and other courts
When asked why it’s a priority to expand the Utah Supreme Court from five justices to seven, Adams responded with a question: “When did Proposition 4 pass?”
That was in 2018, more than seven years ago. “Do I need to say any more? We’re in 2026,”  he said, arguing it’s taken far “too long” to litigate the state’s lawsuit over redistricting, which alleged lawmakers overstepped when they repealed and replaced the independent redistricting voter-approved law. 
So far, the courts have agreed, which led to a restoration of Proposition 4 as law, but also a new court-ordered map that included one Democratic-majority district and three heavily Republican districts — a ruling that Republicans including Adams have ardently opposed. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Adams also said expanding the court may lead to more nuanced decisions. 
“I haven’t seen many split decisions come out of our court,” he said. “And the other side, even if you disagree with it, deserves at least a minority opinion. And I believe having an expanded court probably gives an opportunity to have maybe a little bit of diversity there.” 
The Senate president said also he thinks more justices will help speed up court decisions. That’s even though Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that adding more justices could lead to more deliberation, delaying timelines further. 
“I think it will actually help them,” Adams said. “I can’t imagine it’s going to bog it down.” 
Adams also said part of that conversation will include increasing funding for the Utah Supreme Court, as well as more money to expand the appellate courts, which he noted has been a “high priority” for the judiciary. 
Schultz is also supportive of expanding the courts, but he said he also wants to increase “transparency” on judges so it’s easier for Utahns to look up their rulings. 
“We want them to have the same type of transparency to the public that we as legislators have,” he said. “When we look at retention elections, the No. 1 thing I hear from constituents is ‘We have no idea who these judges are … we can’t find any information.”

Escamilla said she’s concerned about expanding the Utah Supreme Court in a time when Republican lawmakers have clashed with the courts on their redistricting rulings. 
“It’s an issue of timing. It feels like retaliation,” Escamilla said, adding that her constituents have said “they don’t want to see retaliation against the judiciary as they’re exercising their responsibilities and checks and balances of our government.”
Lawmakers’ power over ballot initiatives
While vowing to appeal Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map to the Utah Supreme Court, Adams and Schultz in November also said lawmakers would consider proposing another constitutional amendment — subject to Utah voter approval — that would “clarify” when lawmakers can change voter-approved laws enacted by ballot initiative. 
It won’t be the first time Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature has tried to do this — but the last attempt failed, voided by the courts. 
After a groundbreaking Utah Supreme Court ruling in 2024 made clear that the Legislature’s power over “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits, Utah lawmakers put a question known as Amendment D on the 2024 November ballot to sidestep that ruling and rewrite the Utah Constitution. 
Amendment D still void: Utah Supreme Court upholds district court decision

Had it been approved by voters, Amendment D would have enshrined in the Utah Constitution the Legislature’s unfettered power to repeal or alter any type of ballot initiative, including Proposition 4. 
However, the ballot language posing the question to voters — written by Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — did not explain that in plain language, prompting critics to sue. They claimed Amendment D’s language was “false and misleading.” 
Third District Court Judge Dianna Gibson agreed, while also determining officials failed to meet constitutional publication requirements — so she voided the question. State attorneys appealed the decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which affirmed the district court’s decision.
Adams, however, balked at characterizing their new attempt as Amendment D 2.0.
He said the goal is to make clear that laws passed by the Legislature and enacted by ballot initiative are on a “level playing field” or “co-equal.” 
“We just want to reinstate the co-equal status,” he said. “It’s really important people understand that there’s no intent to do away with initiatives. It just needs to be co-equal status.” 
Adams argues that the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling that says the Legislature must satisfy “strict scrutiny” or assert a compelling government interest in order to change “government reform” ballot initiatives was too ambiguous and left the door open to a flood of ballot initiatives that lawmakers can’t change. That, he argues, could doom Utah’s future. 
“The Supreme Court ruling will destroy Utah. It’s basically changed our entire form of government,” he said. “We live in a republic. … (U.S.) Supreme Court (Thurgood) Marshall said the difference between a democracy and a republic is order and chaos. We have chaos right now.” 
5 key Utah redistricting issues to watch in 2026

Pressed on what the language of the proposed amendment will be, Adams said “we’re not anywhere close” to determining that, “but there will be a constitutional amendment.”
“And we will find a way,” he added, “to make sure that we put together language that our Supreme Court is happy with.” 
Escamilla said Senate Democrats will be on guard for any attempt to weaken voters’ ability to enact laws via ballot initiative. 
“That is a top priority,” Escamilla said. “Protecting citizens’ initiatives is critical.”
Escamilla argued the Utah Supreme Court’s interpretation of the existing Utah Constitution made clear that lawmakers can change “government reform” ballot initiatives — but they can’t undermine them. 
“It’s when it gets ridiculous, actually undermining the entire intent behind what the citizens of Utah voted for,” she said. 
She added that she’s concerned about any attempt to change the Utah Constitution in ways that could empower the Legislature to make changes to voter-approved laws in more ways than they already have the ability to do. 
“You’re either going to say we will change and undermine, or not,” she said. “If you’re going to allow that, I think there will be opposition. The public is exhausted and tired of being undermined by the government when it comes to citizen initiatives and decisions being made by the public.”

The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,400 men in Alabama will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year. It also estimates that about 10% of those will die from the disease. That is 400 less than the ACS’s 2025 estimation of diagnoses. 
Jane Adams, government relations director for ACS Cancer Action Network in Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday that early screenings help improve outcomes and eliminating cost-sharing allows more patients to get screened.
“We’ve been doing a lot of activity with survivors, making sure that lawmakers are hearing about how important the screening is and how important eliminating barriers is to getting the screening,” Adams said. “I think a lot of those efforts have led to it being a priority, and we’re always appreciative of that.”
The bill was the second passed by the Senate. 
According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are at higher risk for the disease. The mortality rate for prostate cancer was 18.7 per 100,000 men in 2022, half of what it was in 1993. The 5-year survival rate for the disease is 100% for the majority of men diagnosed with localized- or regional-stage prostate cancer, but drops to 37% for those diagnosed with distant-stage disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The 10-year survival rate for all stages combined is 98%.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s workforce shortage and federal limitations on a $189.5 million infusion of cash are making some lawmakers worry about the feasibility and sustainability of the state’s plan to strengthen rural health care.
The funding comes from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Lawmakers aren’t able to amend the state’s approved spending plan to address their own concerns, they learned in a presentation Thursday in Pierre. Laura Ringling, senior policy adviser for Gov. Larry Rhoden, told lawmakers the state can only make “some minor budget shifting” going forward.

The role lawmakers play is to authorize the state to spend the $189.5 million. Lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee will be the first to consider a bill authorizing the funds.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, has questions and frustrations about the funding. She told South Dakota Searchlight she intends to ask more questions of state officials during what will be “a long process.”
“It’s a matter of if this is something taxpayer dollars should be spent on,” Howard said. “If it’s not, then it’s our job to deny authority.”
The problem, Howard added, is that if the Legislature doesn’t spend the money, another state will spend it instead. 
South Dakota’s plan outlines 10 initiatives, including creating a “data atlas” for providers and facilities to share local and state agency data, improving the rural health care workforce, improving chronic disease management, establishing regional maternal and infant health care hubs, and regionalizing behavioral health care, among other projects.
Ringling told lawmakers that one-time incentives will bolster the rural health care workforce so that it is sustainable and long-lived years after the one-time funding ends.
Federal government awards $189 million to South Dakota from new rural health fund

Incentives will include sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance and rural service stipends for health care professionals not already covered by the state’s rural assistance program, such as nurses, doctors and physician assistants. The federal government requires that people who are awarded workforce funding must commit to five years in the rural community.
“Nothing we do with these funds will matter if we don’t have the trained people in our communities to provide the care,” Ringling said.
Several lawmakers asked questions on Thursday about workforce needs and how those would be addressed outside of the incentives mentioned.
Howard told officials during the presentation that she’s skeptical about the proposal and its sustainability. The programs, especially the behavioral health and maternal and infant health care hubs, she said, could require more than one-time funding to operate in financially strapped rural communities.
Ringling said the programs, operated by non-state government organizations, must submit a sustainability plan to be considered for funding. Howard took that to mean taxes and fees could be raised at the local level.
“It doesn’t help the local citizens if the state says, ‘Well, the program is done. We wash our hands. We didn’t increase your taxes and fees,’ but then the sustainability model of the local entity increases our taxes and fees. They’re still feeling that pinch,” Howard said.

Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Searchlight that the presentation didn’t address the consequences of the One Big Beautiful Bill’s changes to Medicaid, including work requirements. Muckey called the one-time funding “a Band-Aid over a bullet wound.”
“There is excitement to be had about rural communities receiving the investments they deserve,” Muckey said. “But this still doesn’t answer the question about how to sustain quality health care going forward because of massive cuts to Medicaid.”
South Dakota’s award was short about $4 million of the $193.3 million it requested for the first year of the program, and it was less than the amounts received by neighboring states. The state does not know why it received less funding.
Ringling said the state requested nearly $213 million for the next year. She expects to receive that amount if “we’re doing what we said we were going to do.”
“If for some reason we’re delayed, we’re not able to get going, we’re not able to show that we’re performing and meeting the things that we said we would do in our application,” Ringling said, “we risk a lower dollar amount and losing those funds.”
Once the authorizing bill is signed, departments will begin finding organizations to carry out the initiatives in the state’s Rural Health Transformation Program application. The money must be spent by October.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A new report says investors own 24.84% of Nevada’s single-family homes, equating to about 303,000 properties. That’s 6% higher than the national average and the seventh highest share in the nation behind Wyoming (30.9%), Maine (29.76%), Montana (26.78%), Alaska (26.65%), Hawaii (25.96%), and New Hampshire (25.04%).
“Like most of those other states, Nevada’s economy depends heavily on tourism, which suggests that many of the investor-owned homes are probably vacation homes and short-term rentals,” national analyst Rick Sharga said via email of the Q3 2025 Investor Pulse report from BatchData.  
Efforts abound at the local and federal levels to limit investor purchases of single-family homes. 
In 2023, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a bill that would have limited corporations to buying no more than 1,000 homes a year. Last year, the governor enlisted a Republican ally to kill a similar measure.  
Now President Donald Trump wants to ban the largest institutional investors – those who own more than 1,000 homes. 
The report says such policies miss the mark. 
Small investors (those who own between one and five properties), hold nearly 92% of the investor-owned market, while large investors (those owning six to 10 properties) hold just under 4%. 
“Mega-investors with 1,000+ homes control just 2.1% of the inventory,” or about 0.4% of housing stock, the report says. “Wall Street isn’t the dominant force.” 
Some experts contend the effect of institutional investment on prices is negligible. By one estimate, prices increase 1.7% for every percentage point of housing stock owned by institutional investors, who currently hold less than 1%. 
Public dialogue about investor home purchases “is full of misconceptions,” says the report, which contends investors “aren’t necessarily competing with traditional homebuyers. …. They target lower-priced, older homes in need of work rather than the move-in ready houses most families buy.”  
Investors add inventory to the market, rather than competing with traditional homebuyers, the report suggests.
In the third quarter of last year, the report says, investors paid an average price of $449,981, “well below the national average of $512,800.” 
Investors buy and sell homes at below market prices, the report found, because they are concentrated in areas with prices lower than the national average, and because investors tend to buy older homes in need of work. 
The average price of a home sold by an investor In the third quarter of 2025 was $412,517— which is below the national average sales price of $512,800, the report says. 
Purchase and sales prices for investors “dipped slightly from the previous quarter, which had the highest average purchase price and sales price in the five plus years covered in the Analysis.”
Additionally, the report found 40% of investor sales are to other investors.
In Las Vegas, investors own 26.29% (about 172,000) of single family homes. Of those, about 6% (10,445) are owned by institutional investors. That’s 1.6% of all single-family homes.  
“These percentages are well above the national average of 2% and 0.4% respectively, and suggest that large investors view Las Vegas as an attractive market for single-family rental homes,” says Sharga. 
In Reno, investors own 23.17% of all single-family homes (about 43,000). Institutional investors own about 265 homes in the area, or just 0.6% of investor-owned homes, and 0.14% of all  single-family homes.
Investors own approximately 18% of the 86 million single-family homes in the U.S.
In five states – Texas, California, Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia – investors own 5 million properties, accounting for one-third of all investor-owned homes in the U.S., reflecting “strategic capital deployment in high-population, high-growth and high-yield markets,” the report says. 
The states with the lowest share of investor-owned homes are Minnesota (9.15%); Connecticut (10.16%); District of Columbia (11.1%); Wisconsin (11.43%); and Rhode Island (11.78%). 
“Low-share states typically feature strong local economies, high homeownership rates, or regulatory environments that discourage investor activity,” the report says. 
Investors were on the buying end of 34% of all single-family home purchases in the third quarter of 2025, marking the highest share in the last five years, according to the report. That’s up one percentage point from the second quarter and up nearly eight points from the third quarter of 2024, when investors purchased 25.5% of residential homes. 
“Q3 2025 was the seventh consecutive quarter where the largest investors sold more properties (5,798) than they bought (4,663),” the report says, calling it an indication that investors are divesting. 
The report reveals “two seemingly incongruous trends,” says BatchData president Ivo Draginov, who notes while the percentage of homes purchased by investors is at a five-year high, the number of homes sold in the third quarter last year plunged by 23,000 from a year earlier. 
“This suggests that the higher percentage of homes being purchased by investors is due at least in part to fewer home purchases by traditional homeowners rather than by overly aggressive investor activity,” Draginov said. 
Investors are “essential market stabilizers rather than speculative disruptors,” the report concludes. “At a time when traditional buyers are sidelined by financing constraints and limited inventory, investors provide critical liquidity in an otherwise constrained market.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2229115449-1024x714.jpg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

Challenges remain,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/19/house-legalize-mobile-sports-betting-mississippi-legislature/,"This year's proposal would direct state online gambling revenue to the government employees' retirement system, in an effort to win over the Senate.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Mississippi House will try for the third year straight to legalize mobile sports betting with new provisions aimed at winning over Senate lawmakers who have opposed the measure, the House Gaming Committee Chairman said.
This year’s legislation — in a key change from last year’s proposal — would direct all state revenue from online betting to the state’s government pension system, Casey Eure, a Republican from Saucier who chairs House Gaming, told Mississippi Today.
The House and Senate are still at loggerheads over how to shore up the Public Employees’ Retirement System, which has unfunded liabilities of about $26 billion. 
The new proposal will also contain other “compromises” for those who have previously opposed legalization.
The persistence of a thriving black market in Mississippi and an estimated tens of millions a year in tax revenue that legal sports betting could generate has prompted a fierce push from some lawmakers to legalize the practice.
“By legalizing mobile sports betting, we can eliminate much of the illegal market — including protecting underage bettors — and provide real consumer safeguards in a regulated environment,” Eure said. “This legislation will also give our brick-and-mortar casinos a new revenue stream to ensure their continued success, while the state revenue generated will help close the gap in funding for our public employees’ retirement system.”
The effort also has a strong and well-funded lobby from sports betting companies. But the legalization effort could again face significant headwinds, from skeptical state lawmakers in both parties and federal regulatory changes since the election of President Donald Trump.
Senate Gaming Chairman David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson who has thus far opposed mobile sports betting legalization, told Mississippi Today he wouldn’t take a position on Eure’s bill until he read it. But he said directing the revenue to PERS wouldn’t be near enough to justify legalization. 
“These are the same people who abolished the income tax last year, which generates more than $2 billion a year to the state budget. If we legalized mobile sports betting tomorrow, it would take more than 1,000 years to pay off the unfunded liability in the retirement system,” Blount said. “The amount of money that we’re talking about is infinitesimal compared to the $26 billion unfunded liability of the retirement system.”
Eure has said legalizing online betting could generate as much as $80 million a year in tax revenue. Blount said the estimates he’s seen max out at about $30 million. Either way, the total would not pay off the system’s unfunded liabilities in the near term.
The Senate has already sent the House a bill to put half-a-billion dollars of the state’s current surplus into PERS, in addition to putting $50 million a year over the next decade. House leaders have proposed a recurring revenue stream for PERS, either from the state lottery or by legalizing mobile sports betting.
Blount also pointed to the rise of “prediction markets,” exchanges where people bet on the outcomes of future events. These markets, dominated by platforms such as Kalshi, are different from traditional sports betting because traders set prices. Also, prediction markets try to make money by letting people trade against each other to reveal how likely an event is, while sports betting companies make money by setting odds so the bookmaker always takes a cut.
Under the Trump administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has taken a lax approach to regulating prediction markets, allowing platforms to expand their offerings in states around the country, including states such as Mississippi, where mobile sports betting remains illegal.
“Predictions markets have essentially legalized nationwide mobile betting,” Blount said. “Whatever amount of money was promised last year, that number is reduced, maybe greatly reduced. Because due to the actions of the current administration, no state can tax or regulate prediction markets, which are effectively gambling.” 
Traditional sports betting giant DraftKings, which has lobbied Mississippi House Speaker Jason White to legalize online betting, launched its own prediction market product last month.
Two U.S. Senate committees could take up a bill later this month to establish new rules for the cryptocurrency industry, and some on Capitol Hill are pushing to include language that would tighten regulations on prediction markets. 
In addition to the role PERS and prediction markets might play in the debate over mobile sports betting legalization in Mississippi, a proposal this year would likely need to assuage the concerns of lawmakers from districts with casinos. Some brick-and-mortar casinos have feared the legalization of online betting could undercut their profits.
To protect smaller casinos from revenue losses, Eure’s bill last year would create a pot of money that establishments could draw from for the first five years after online sports betting becomes legal. It also included safeguards to prevent people from placing bets with credit cards. 
Eure still believes legalization would be an economic boon for Mississippi.

No, not that one.
I’m talking about the address he delivered on April 14, 1967, titled “The Other America.”
It lays out King’s political and economic thinking in a way that should dispel any “well-actually” attempt to turn the civil rights leader into a secret conservative. (Among other proposals in “The Other America,” King called for a guaranteed universal income.)

But I want to focus on a story King told about meeting a white man on a plane. This man, King said, claimed that Black Americans protested too much, saying “you aren’t doing anything for yourselves.” The white man, King said, noted that many groups of immigrants had managed to move from the margins into mainstream American society over generations. “Why don’t you teach your people to lift themselves by their own bootstraps?” the man said.
King reminded the man that white people took Black people to this country as property and denied them the opportunities other groups had.
“And I finally said to him that it’s a nice thing to say to people that you oughta lift yourself by your own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he oughta lift himself by his own bootstraps,” he said. “And the fact is that millions of Negroes, as a result of centuries of denial and neglect, have been left bootless.”
Correcting that wrong, King said, meant nothing less than rethinking American governance. The nation needed more than “a romantic or aesthetic something where you merely add color to a still predominantly white power structure.”
“Integration must be seen also in political terms where there is shared power, where Black men and white men share power together to build a new and a great nation,” he said.
This seems especially true in Alabama, a state with a terrible history of white people denying power to Black Alabamians and responding to those demanding it with violence. Like King, who survived a segregationist bombing of his Montgomery parsonage in 1956.
Today, the efforts of King and other brave Americans mean we have far more Black representation at the federal and state level than we did 70 years ago.
But we have a still-larger white leadership that all too often appears to consider Black political participation inherently illegitimate. That criminalizes attempts to help Black men and women vote. And fights tooth and nail to prevent Black Alabamians from having a meaningful voice in their governance.
This simulacrum of freedom means suffering and inequality. The median income of a white household in Alabama is $76,092. For a Black household, it’s $46,756.
In 2021 — in the middle of one of the best job markets in recent memory — the unemployment rate for white people in Alabama was 3%. For Black Alabamians, it was 5.6%. And for Black men, it was 7.1%.
The poverty rate for white people in Alabama in 2024 was 11.5%. For Black Alabamians, it was 23.4%.
I can go on. Infant mortality for Black Alabamians is more than double that for white people. Cervical cancer rates are higher for Black women, and survival rates are lower.
Would democracy — real democracy, reflective of people and not conservative propaganda — solve these problems? Probably not. But it would make it a lot easier to focus on solutions. Because our leaders would be responsible to the people living here, not a right-wing news channel or the shifting convictions of a White House occupant.
It’s trite on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to say that his work is not finished. It feels more precise to say that it’s barely gotten started. Until we secure genuine political power for Black Alabamians — not subject to the whims of white politicians — none of us will live in a democracy.
And all of us will pay the price.
We will continue to live under severe property tax caps — imposed by white planters who hated the idea of educating Black children — that kill our schools, sustain our poverty and benefit no one but the wealthiest landowners.
We will live with paranoid nonsense about election fraud that makes it harder for everyone to vote.
And we will continue getting lawmakers who feel no obligation to the people they represent. Who spend their time putting immigrants, Muslims and transgender people in danger.
Changing it, as King said, will be a decades-long process.
“Somewhere we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability,” King said in that 1967 speech. “It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals. And without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation.”
Those forces robbed King of his time. And if we do nothing else today, we may consider how they keep us from that dream in his other famous speech.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Martin-Luther-King-monument-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

This year’s legislative session, which is Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s last in office, kicks off Jan. 20, 2026, amid signs of economic downturn. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s final regular legislative session starts at noon on Tuesday (don’t rule out the possibility of a special session before she leaves office at the end of the year, though—she’s called eight during her two terms in office).
While other lame-duck sessions have produced slugfests between the branches (see the 2010 food tax fight with Gov. Bill Richardson and the lawsuit over Gov. Susana Martínez’s 2017 vetoes), top lawmakers said they remain optimistic that the session will end on a high note. 
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a call Friday lawmakers “are going to start with something different” this session, and both chambers will push an expedited agenda of four bills to the governor’s desk within the first two weeks.
Those proposed bills include bipartisan legislation for the state to enter two medical compacts for doctors and social workers; a bill to provide $1.5 billion for the state’s roads; a bill to define the terms “harm to self” and “harm to others” to state laws for involuntary commitment; and finally legislation to ban New Mexico public entities from participating in immigration detention.
These are bills that “have agreements between the House, Senate and governor’s office,” Wirth said, and are similar to versions brought in the 2025 session.
“We said we were going to work on these bills for the 30-day session,” Wirth said. “We’ve done the work, we’re ready to go.”
On the House side, Democratic leaders gathered Friday at the First Choice Community Healthcare clinic in the South Valley, an institution House Speaker Rep. Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) said represented the culmination of years of work from local community organizers as well as local, state and federal elected officials. As a result, he said, the clinic exemplified functional government, a contrast with the dysfunction in Washington. 
He and other Democrats said how proud they were that New Mexico can backfill federal cuts to health care, Medicaid and other federal programs, even as they prepare to craft a budget that’s relatively tighter than years’ past. 
“As we go into the 2026 legislative session, we go in with a renewed sense of hope,” he said.
Five takeaways as the lawmaking begins

It’s all about the money
New Mexico’s Constitution limits even years to 30-day sessions focused on developing the state’s budget, along with bills sanctioned by the governor and ones that were vetoed in the prior session. 
Some of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s stated priorities for her last session include: health care, public safety and immigration issues, though full messages on those topics will not be available until the start of the session.
The governor can also issue messages throughout the session, in order to make a bill “germane” or relevant to the agenda. 
Competing budgets
While the governor sets out the priorities and puts out a budget recommendation, it’s the Legislature that doles out the dollars. 
The two proposals are pretty close to each other: Both seek to spend a little over $11 billion from the state’s general fund. 
By the #s: See where the New Mexico governor, Legislature disagree on $11B in budget priorities

But there are a few big differences, particularly around funding for the state New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
Lujan Grisham asked for about $160 million more than the Legislature is seeking, funding she said is necessary to pay for free childcare for New Mexico families regardless of their income.
House leaders told Source that they are open to negotiating, but want to exercise fiscal restraint in light of tightening economic conditions while also ensuring childcare is free for those who most need it. 
Martínez said Friday the Legislature “will make sure that New Mexico delivers on its promise for a fully funded, affordable, high quality, universal child care system that puts the workers at the forefront.”

Crime and punishment
In recent years, Lujan Grisham has focused intently on public safety, urging legislative proposals in a 2024 special session on criminal competency, crime reporting, gun violence, drug overdoses and more. The special session adjourned after a matter of hours without lawmakers hearing any of the bills on her agenda.
On the final day of the 2025 session, Lujan Grisham lambasted lawmakers for what she called “appalling and unacceptable” inaction on juvenile crime after the March 21 shooting in Las Cruces that killed three people and injured 15.

Martínez said Friday he expects debate and potential action on the issue of Legislature “modernization,” which could mean paying lawmakers, extending session lengths or other changes to avoid cramming so much important work into a 30-day session.
“I believe in the ability of my colleagues to get things done, but I don’t think 30 days is enough. And so we’ve got to modernize the Legislature,” he said. 
Constitutional amendments only require a simple majority in both Houses to pass, and do not require a message from the governor, nor a governor’s signature, according to the legislature’s rules and terms.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-19 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Still interested in solar despite expiring tax credits? What to know,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/19/solar-tax-credits/,"With tax credits worth up to 30% of the cost of a new solar residential system no longer being offered, companies predict a drop in sales.","Big changes are underway for Connecticut’s residential solar market as a result of recent policy shifts at both the state and federal level. What that means for homeowners interested in going solar depends on the type of system they’re interested in, household usage and personal finances.
As of Jan. 1, the federal government is no longer offering tax credits worth up to 30% of the cost of a new solar residential system. Those tax credits were enacted under President Joe Biden’s administration and eliminated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald J. Trump in July.
With a typical rooftop solar setup in Connecticut costing upwards of $30,000, those credits were worth $9,000 or more on a system purchased up front by a homeowner.
Systems that are leased or subject to third-party power purchase agreements are still eligible for a separate, commercial tax credit until Dec. 31, 2027.
However, in order to qualify for those incentives, solar systems will have to comply with new rules put in place by the OBBA limiting the amount of foreign-manufactured parts from countries like China. Those rules are expected to increase the price of panels, in addition to the loss of any available tax credits.
How has the loss of the federal incentives impacted the solar market in Connecticut?
Jason Calabrese, the operations manager at Middlebury’s Ion Solar Pros, predicted that sales would drop between 20% and 25% in 2026 as a result of those changes and the uncertainty they have brought to the solar market. 
“A good portion of it’s based upon customer confusion,” Calabrese said. “Some people think that solar is ending altogether, that there’s no opportunity now to go solar. It’s created some uncertainty in the marketplace, which uncertainty in any marketplace is not good for sales.”
In the aftermath of the OBBA’s passage, several solar installers and financiers around the country shut down or filed for bankruptcy. In Connecticut, the fallout has been limited to two companies — PosiGen and Sunnova — according to Mike Trahan, the executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association.
Trahan noted that even before the law, more than two-thirds of new solar systems being deployed in Connecticut were owned by third parties. For those residents who still want to own their own systems, Trahan said the loss of the federal tax credits had forced developers to work with banks to create new financing options.
“It’s become an interesting time, I’ve been hearing from people and how they are trying to figure out new products, new lending, loan and sales products, to consumers,” Trahan said.
What state-level policies are changing?
In addition to the loss of federal tax credits, Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority in December approved several changes to its residential and commercial solar programs. One of the most notable changes was a 704% increase in the charge assessed on the output of residential solar systems, from half-a-cent per kilowatt hour to more than 4 cents a kWh.
That increase was dictated, in part, by state lawmakers in order to better align the cost of rooftop solar incentives with the state’s rising price of electricity. Their legislation, Senate Bill 4, was passed before the changes to the federal tax credits.
While PURA did consider offering additional incentives for individually-owned systems to offset the loss of the federal tax credits, the commissioners ultimately opted not do so due to the cost and administrative effort required to create those incentives for a limited time period. 
Trahan said that he is planning to ask PURA to reconsider its decision in early 2026.
If the new state charges go into effect along with the loss of federal tax credits, the result for system owners is that it could take another four or five years to recoup their initial investment, according to Sean Riel, the director of residential sales at Ellington’s Earthlight Technologies. Still, he said he remained optimistic that leasing would be seen as viable alternative for customers over the next two years.
“If you’re going with a lease, the pitch there remains the same: that you’re going to be locking in a lower rate for power through purchasing solar energy versus paying the utility,” Riel said. 
PURA did increase price caps and other incentives for non-residential solar systems in 2026 in order to account for the loss of the federal tax credits.
Another change taking effect on Jan. 1 is a new state law dictating that most condo complexes can no longer “prohibit or unreasonably restrict” owners of single-family, detached units from installing solar panels on their roofs. Complexes that wish to opt out of the new requirements must do so by Jan. 1, 2028 with a three-quarters vote of their board.
Andrew Belden, vice president for renewable programs and strategy at Eversource, said that it remains to be seen how customers and the solar industry react to the shifting state and federal policies.
“The industry hasn’t metabolized a change like this, ever,” Belden said. “So, 2026 will be a year when we’re going to find out a lot about how the market is going to react to changes. What we always suggest for customers is to treat solar installation as you would any other home improvement project: shop around, ask questions. There are likely good deals to be had, but there are also challenges.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP23349541550576-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Avery Ping had a knack for noticing who in a room might be having a bad day and checking in on them. He wanted to be a psychiatrist. 
But the Olympia teen was addicted to his screen, his father Aaron said. He wanted to get away from his phone, and Aaron was adamant about limiting his screen time. 
“For a developing teenage brain, it’s going to be training that brain for impulsive behavior,” Aaron Ping said. “Dopamine reward schedules, it has a really harmful effect on the developing mind.”
Aaron Ping feels that effect is what led Avery to seek out the hallucinogenic drug MDMA on Snapchat in late 2024, leading to his overdose death. He was 16.
Now his father is pushing for a measure in Washington state to set up safeguards for children online.  
House Bill 1834 aims to protect youth in multiple ways. 
It would block companies like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok from providing “addictive feeds” to minors. Youth consumers would still have access to the platforms to search for specific content and follow users they’re interested in.
Under the bill, companies also couldn’t send push notifications to minors overnight or during school hours without parental consent
“It’s really the first step that has to happen before we can start to make it safe online,” Ping said in an interview.
The Senate passed its version of the legislation last year with some bipartisan support, but it stalled in the House amid constitutionality and privacy concerns. The bill comes at the request of state Attorney General Nick Brown. It also had Gov. Bob Ferguson’s support last year.
As attorney general, Ferguson sued TikTok and Meta over the platforms trying to reel in youth users and get them hooked. Both cases are ongoing.
Lawmakers and advocates, including former tech executives, are renewing their push for the state guardrails this year. 
The tech industry isn’t happy.
Rose Feliciano, the executive director of TechNet in the Northwest, said in a statement that the organization “and its member companies are committed to providing safe, age-appropriate online experiences for young people.”
“But we are concerned that the bill, as currently drafted, would limit companies’ ability to offer the full range of parental controls needed to help keep children safe,” said Feliciano, whose organization is made up of a bipartisan network of tech executives. She also noted constitutionality concerns.

TechNet members include Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Meta and Google. 
In a letter to lawmakers Thursday, the tech lobbying group NetChoice said the issue should be left to parents, and that legislation like this replaces “parental judgment with state diktat.” 
Amy Bos, the group’s vice president of government affairs, argued the proposed regulations violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. NetChoice prefers focusing on digital literacy and helping parents guide their children’s internet use to address the problem.
Children’s Alliance Executive Director Soleil Boyd said advocates have worked hard to ensure the legislation is “legally defensible and really will make a difference.”
“You bring in these algorithms that really are targeting young people, children and kids to make sure that they stay online for as long as absolutely possible,” Boyd said. “It’s more than most parents can do to really fight and combat that.”
View from the inside
Kelly Stonelake worked at Meta for nearly 15 years, including leading the expansion of the company’s virtual reality software, Horizon Worlds, to kids and teenagers.
For much of her career, Stonelake, who also worked at Apple, believed that her company was going to do right by its consumers. She would’ve argued against overregulation.
But she said it was an open secret within Meta that with Horizon Worlds, children were using a product they weren’t allowed to without parental oversight, meaning the company was collecting their data in violation of federal law. The only concern was for how issues would affect the company, not the young users of the products, she said.
“The executive team got into the product to play test it and kind of understand it better ourselves, but we could not even hear one another over the sounds of screaming children,” Stonelake said.
Stonelake, who lives in Normandy Park, believes she was laid off from Meta in retaliation for raising concerns. She is suing the tech giant over the alleged retaliation and gender discrimination. (Meta didn’t respond to a request for comment.)
She’s now become passionate about working on bills like Washington’s, which she calls “common sense regulations that we need to protect kids.”
“Because I’ve seen firsthand that these companies won’t,” Stonelake said.
In 2023, about 70% of Washington 10th graders reported using social media several times a day. Those students were likely to have worse grades.
Nearly half of 10th graders were at risk of what is called “problematic internet use” that could be risky or impulsive and lead to bad consequences. Those students were likely to get less sleep than their peers. And 8% reported increased social anxiety due to internet use.
“If we can get way upstream and we can prevent it from happening in the first place, and this is exactly that,” said bill sponsor Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah. “Let’s prevent some anxiety and depression from happening in the first place.”
In 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General recommended policymakers limit social media access to keep youth safe and better protect their privacy online. 
Another bill under consideration in Olympia looks to protect young people online by requiring kids age 16 and younger to get parental consent to make social media accounts. Last year, Democratic lawmakers proposed a new tax on social media companies to fund youth behavioral health care.
The legal state of play
A number of states have enacted legislation tackling this issue, but such laws have faced legal challenges. 
Washington’s measure is modeled after a California ban on addictive feeds that has withstood court scrutiny. Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law’s requirement of parental consent for minors to access addictive feeds. Meta, Google and TikTok have since sued to block the California law. 
Tech groups like NetChoice argue regulating internet content and restricting what feeds minors can have is unconstitutional. 
Seann Colgan, a state assistant attorney general focused on consumer protection, argued the Washington bill doesn’t run afoul of freedom of speech protections. 
“It doesn’t restrict kids’ access to speech,” Colgan told a state Senate panel Thursday. “Kids can still access the speech, they just need to look for it themselves instead of having it fed to them in an addictive manner.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/instagram-concept-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

In negotiations, Henry Ford has insisted on many concessions, but one is particularly painful on this Martin Luther King Jr. Day: eliminating recognition of the holiday for Rochester Hospital employees.
For me, as a Black woman in Metro Detroit, this is not just about a day off. It is about recognition.
Dr. King’s fight for dignity, justice, and economic fairness is the bedrock of the labor movement. To erase this holiday is to dismiss the profound connection between civil rights and workers’ rights.
But this is more than a symbolic insult; it’s a practical misstep that will hurt our hospital. Our Metro Detroit community is already facing a health care staffing crisis. We are struggling to recruit and retain nurses, technicians, and support staff. Telling staff and potential hires, especially in a region as diverse as ours, that we do not value this cornerstone holiday sends a clear message: your values are not our values. It tells my colleagues of color that their heritage and the community’s history are an afterthought.
Henry Ford is pushing for many other concessions that will strain an already stretched workforce. While MLK Day and Good Friday are on the chopping block entirely, hospital executives also want to reduce holiday pay when we work any other holiday, eliminate daily overtime, and reduce paid time off. While the affordability crisis continues to make it harder for hospital staff to make ends meet, Henry Ford has proposed wage increases that leave many behind and, for some, freezes wages for the next year.
Exhausted, undervalued staff cannot provide optimal patient outcomes. Dr. King said, “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.” By devaluing the workers who are at the heart of this hospital, Henry Ford executives risk perpetuating the very inequalities we strive to heal.
This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we call on Henry Ford to reconsider.
Show our community, your employees, and every patient who walks through these doors that you truly honor Dr. King’s legacy. Not with empty statements, but with just practices that attract and retain the dedicated staff our patients deserve.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hopsital-image-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

The marchers set out after the original, solo marcher, James Meredith was shot and wounded by a white gunman. Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images. Your Majesty, your royal highness, Mr. president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at a moment when 22 million Negroes of the United States of America are engaged in a creative battle to end the long night of racial injustice. I accept this award on behalf of a Civil Rights Movement which is moving with determination and a majestic scorn for risk and danger to establish a reign of freedom and a rule of justice. I am mindful that only yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, our children, crying out for brotherhood, were answered with fire hoses, snarling dogs and even death. I am mindful that only yesterday in Philadelphia, Mississippi, young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered. And only yesterday more than 40 houses of worship in the state of Mississippi alone were bombed or burned because they offered a sanctuary to those who would not accept segregation. I am mindful that debilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung of the economic ladder.
Therefore, I must ask why this prize is awarded to a movement which is beleaguered and committed to unrelenting struggle; to a movement which has not won the very peace and brotherhood which is the essence of the Nobel Prize.
After contemplation, I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of that movement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time — the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression. Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts. Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have demonstrated that nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation. Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.
The tortuous road which has led from Montgomery, Alabama to Oslo bears witness to this truth. This is a road over which millions of Negroes are travelling to find a new sense of dignity. This same road has opened for all Americans a new era of progress and hope. It has led to a new Civil Rights Bill, and it will, I am convinced, be widened and lengthened into a super highway of justice as Negro and white men in increasing numbers create alliances to overcome their common problems.
I accept this award today with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind. I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history. I refuse to accept the idea that the “isness” of man’s present nature makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal “oughtness” that forever confronts him. I refuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life, unable to influence the unfolding events which surround him. I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. I believe that even amid today’s mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood-flowing streets of our nations, can be lifted from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of men. I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits. I believe that what self-centered men have torn down men other-centered can build up. I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed, and nonviolent redemptive good will proclaim the rule of the land. “And the lion and the lamb shall lie down together and every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree and none shall be afraid.” I still believe that we shall overcome!
This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired feet new strength as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom. When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization struggling to be born.
Today I come to Oslo as a trustee, inspired and with renewed dedication to humanity. I accept this prize on behalf of all men who love peace and brotherhood. I say I come as a trustee, for in the depths of my heart I am aware that this prize is much more than an honor to me personally.
Every time I take a flight, I am always mindful of the many people who make a successful journey possible — the known pilots and the unknown ground crew.
So you honor the dedicated pilots of our struggle who have sat at the controls as the freedom movement soared into orbit. You honor, once again, Chief Lutuli of South Africa, whose struggles with and for his people, are still met with the most brutal expression of man’s inhumanity to man. You honor the ground crew without whose labor and sacrifices the jet flights to freedom could never have left the earth. Most of these people will never make the headline and their names will not appear in Who’s Who. Yet when years have rolled past and when the blazing light of truth is focused on this marvellous age in which we live – men and women will know and children will be taught that we have a finer land, a better people, a more noble civilization – because these humble children of God were willing to suffer for righteousness’ sake.
I think Alfred Nobel would know what I mean when I say that I accept this award in the spirit of a curator of some precious heirloom which he holds in trust for its true owners – all those to whom beauty is truth and truth beauty – and in whose eyes the beauty of genuine brotherhood and peace is more precious than diamonds or silver or gold.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-800885663.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

Each year on the holiday that bears his name, Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered for his immense contributions to the struggle for racial equality. What is less often remembered but equally important is that King saw the fight for racial equality as deeply intertwined with economic justice.
To address inequality – and out of growing concern for how automation might displace workers – King became an early advocate for universal basic income. Under universal basic income, the government provides direct cash payments to all citizens to help them afford life’s expenses.
In recent years, more than a dozen U.S. cities have run universal basic income programs, often smaller or pilot programs that have offered guaranteed basic incomes to select groups of needy residents. As political scientists, we have followed these experiments closely.
One of us recently co-authored a study which found that universal basic income is generally popular. In two out of three surveys analyzed, majorities of white Americans supported a universal basic income proposal. Support is particularly high among those with low incomes.
King’s intuition was that white people with lower incomes would support this type of policy because they could also benefit from it. In 1967, King argued, “It seems to me that the Civil Rights Movement must now begin to organize for the guaranteed annual income … which I believe will go a long, long way toward dealing with the Negro’s economic problem and the economic problem with many other poor people confronting our nation.”
But there is one notable group that does not support universal basic income: those with higher levels of racial resentment. Racial resentment is a scale that social scientists have used to describe and measure anti-Black prejudice since the 1980s.
Notably, in our research, whites with higher levels of racial resentment and higher incomes are especially inclined to oppose universal basic income. As King well knew, this segment of Americans can create powerful opposition.

 Economic self-interest can trump resentment

At the same time, the results of the study also suggest that coalition building is possible, even among the racially resentful.
Economic status matters. Racially resentful whites with lower incomes tend to be supportive of universal basic income. In short, self-interest seems to trump racial resentment. This is consistent with King’s idea of how an economic coalition could be built and pave the way toward racial progress.
Income is not the only thing that shapes attitudes, however. Some of the strongest supporters of universal basic income are those who have higher incomes but low levels of racial resentment. This suggests an opportunity to build coalitions across economic lines, something King believed was necessary. “The rich must not ignore the poor,” he argued in his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, “because both rich and poor are tied in a single garment of destiny.” Our data shows that this is possible.
This approach to coalition building is also suggested by our earlier research. Using American National Election Studies surveys from 2004-2016, we found that for white Americans, racial resentment predicted lower support for social welfare policies. But we also found that economic position mattered, too.
Economic need can unite white Americans in support of more generous welfare policies, including among some who are racially prejudiced. At a minimum, this suggests that racial resentment does not necessarily prevent white Americans from supporting policies that would also benefit Black Americans.
 Building lasting coalitions

During his career as an activist in the 1950s and 1960s, King struggled with building long-term, multiracial coalitions. He understood that many forms of racial prejudice could undermine his work. He therefore sought strategies that could forge alliances across lines of difference. He helped build coalitions of poor and working-class Americans, including those who are white. He was not so naive as to think that shared economic progress would eliminate racial prejudice, but he saw it as a place to start.
Currently, the nation faces an affordability crisis, and artificial intelligence poses new threats to jobs. These factors have increased calls for universal basic income.
Racial prejudice continues to fuel opposition to universal basic income, as well as other forms of social welfare. But our research suggests that this is not insurmountable.
As King knew, progress toward economic equality is not inevitable. But, as his legacy reminds us, progress does remain possible through organizing around shared interests.

In 1967, King argued, “It seems to me that the Civil Rights Movement must now begin to organize for the guaranteed annual income … which I believe will go a long, long way toward dealing with the Negro’s economic problem and the economic problem with many other poor people confronting our nation.”
But there is one notable group that does not support universal basic income: those with higher levels of racial resentment. Racial resentment is a scale that social scientists have used to describe and measure anti-Black prejudice since the 1980s.
Notably, in our research, whites with higher levels of racial resentment and higher incomes are especially inclined to oppose universal basic income. As King well knew, this segment of Americans can create powerful opposition.
Economic self-interest can trump resentment
At the same time, the results of the study also suggest that coalition building is possible, even among the racially resentful.
Economic status matters. Racially resentful whites with lower incomes tend to be supportive of universal basic income. In short, self-interest seems to trump racial resentment. This is consistent with King’s idea of how an economic coalition could be built and pave the way toward racial progress.
Income is not the only thing that shapes attitudes, however. Some of the strongest supporters of universal basic income are those who have higher incomes but low levels of racial resentment. This suggests an opportunity to build coalitions across economic lines, something King believed was necessary. “The rich must not ignore the poor,” he argued in his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, “because both rich and poor are tied in a single garment of destiny.” Our data shows that this is possible.
This approach to coalition building is also suggested by our earlier research. Using American National Election Studies surveys from 2004-2016, we found that for white Americans, racial resentment predicted lower support for social welfare policies. But we also found that economic position mattered, too.
Economic need can unite white Americans in support of more generous welfare policies, including among some who are racially prejudiced. At a minimum, this suggests that racial resentment does not necessarily prevent white Americans from supporting policies that would also benefit Black Americans.
Building lasting coalitions
During his career as an activist in the 1950s and 1960s, King struggled with building long-term, multiracial coalitions. He understood that many forms of racial prejudice could undermine his work. He therefore sought strategies that could forge alliances across lines of difference. He helped build coalitions of poor and working-class Americans, including those who are white. He was not so naive as to think that shared economic progress would eliminate racial prejudice, but he saw it as a place to start.
Currently, the nation faces an affordability crisis, and artificial intelligence poses new threats to jobs. These factors have increased calls for universal basic income.
Racial prejudice continues to fuel opposition to universal basic income, as well as other forms of social welfare. But our research suggests that this is not insurmountable.
As King knew, progress toward economic equality is not inevitable. But, as his legacy reminds us, progress does remain possible through organizing around shared interests.

This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Detroit was the first place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered an early version of what would become his “I Have a Dream” speech. He recited it on June 23, 1963, at the end of Detroit’s Walk to Freedom, a march that happened weeks before he spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
This piece of Detroit-first history sharpens what Martin Luther King Jr. Day asks of the city. It’s harder to treat the holiday, celebrated on Monday, as a slogan when the dream was first spoken aloud in Detroit. It’s also harder to see it as a day off when a lot of people choose to mark it every year as a day on.
The Lambda Pi Omega (LPO) chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, is one of the Detroit institutions built around that belief.
Their members measure the weeks before Martin Luther King Jr. Day in labor. They assemble toiletry kits for Detroiters without stable housing, volunteer their time to youth programs focused on combating hunger and fostering leadership skills, and step into the gaps families are already navigating, like hunger and lack of resources. Crystal Sewell, the chapter’s president, said the work is rooted in service that isn’t just a once-a-year thing.
“Our work really is about uplifting our community; that is really at the heart of what we do,” Sewell said. “It is sisterhood and service for the betterment of our local community, that’s really the essence and the spirit of our chapter.”
This year, LPO will spend Martin Luther King Jr. Day at Third New Hope Baptist Church on Detroit’s west side for its annual “We Are One” AKA Day of Service. Sorority members plan to assemble 1,908 toiletry bags for Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a local nonprofit that provides emergency shelter and support services, including housing programs for families and people working toward recovery. The specificity in the number of kits is intentional: 1,908 reflects AKA’s founding year, 1908. After the event, the bags will be delivered to the rescue mission’s family shelter and recovery housing sites.
The chapter’s service calendar stays full throughout the year, Sewell said.
“If I were to add it up, I would say we participate in at least 10 volunteer opportunities per month,” she said. “So, you’re talking 100 to 150 volunteer service opportunities per year. There are several hours that go into our volunteerism, over 2,000 hours per year.”
LPO is part of the Divine Nine — nine historically Black fraternities and sororities under the National Pan-Hellenic Council, founded when Black students, excluded from White Greek systems, created their own organizations around scholarship, leadership and service.
Dr. King was part of that tradition.
He was initiated into Boston’s Sigma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in June 1952. Alpha Phi Alpha (APA) was founded in 1906 as the first Black Greek-letter fraternity; AKA is the first Black Greek-letter sorority.
AKA’s purpose statement includes a directive members repeat as a standard: to be of “service to all mankind.”
Jacqueline Newman has spent decades living by that. She became an AKA member in 1970 at Wayne State University. When the sorority’s LPO chapter was chartered in Detroit in 1977, she became a founding charter member. She now serves as the chapter historian.
“What we do is we try to help, whenever we can, wherever we can,” Newman said. “We love children, so we are in different schools to help feed students. We’ve clothed students. We’ve given Thanksgiving baskets. We’ve given scholarships, and it was not only to women or girls. It has been to men also. And no matter your race. That’s what I look at as service to all mankind, to all people that are in need. That’s what we do.”
Newman’s own timeline begins in the South. She was 13 and living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when Dr. King spoke in Detroit in 1963.
“I was part of the South that he was trying to free from civil rights injustices,” she said.

She moved to Detroit in 1965 with her family. “My mom and my dad were teachers and the employment was better here in Detroit,” Newman said. Her mother became a member of AKA in 1962; Newman described her own membership as legacy. “So, it was mainly a legacy for me. I followed in my mom’s footsteps.”
Her history of service began before she joined AKA. In the South, she said, “I saw so many injustices done, especially to our people. I was marching and doing civil rights things when I was 11, 12, 13 years old before I came here to Michigan.”
Those experiences compelled her to action — “you don’t want anybody else to have to go through what you went through,” Newman said.
“When you have seen a man hung on a tree, it hits you a little more,” Newman said. “If you have lived through it, it’s different.”
Detroit remembers Dr. King’s dream speech because it heard it early. Lambda Pi Omega is betting its Martin Luther King Jr. Day on a simpler goal: what gets done, who gets served, and whether the work continues when the holiday ends.
As Sewell said, service is about direct support and long-term civic work.
“Service for me is about uplifting others within our community who are of greatest need,” she said. “It is advocating for social justice, making sure our community is informed and educated and registered to vote and getting out to vote, thinking about the whole of the individual, from cradle to senior.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AKA-service03-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Since 1983, when President Ronald Reagan signed Martin Luther King Jr. Day into law, many Americans have observed the federal holiday to commemorate the life and legacy of the civil rights leader, Baptist minister and theologian.

MLK Day volunteers typically perform community service that continues King’s fight to end racial discrimination and economic injustice – to build the “beloved community,” as he often said.
King does not fully explain the phrase’s meaning in his published writings, speeches and sermons. Scholars Rufus Burrow Jr. and Lewis V. Baldwin, however, argue that the beloved community is King’s principal ethical goal, guiding the struggle against what he called the “three evils of American society”: racism, economic exploitation and militarism.
As a Baptist minister and theologian myself, I believe it is important to understand the origins of the concept of the beloved community, how King understood it and how he worked to make it a reality.
Older origins
Although King popularized the beloved community, the phrase has roots in the thought of 19th-century American religious philosopher Josiah Royce.
In 1913, toward the end of his long career, Royce published “The Problem of Christianity.” The book compiles lectures on the Christian religion, including the idea of the church and its mission, and coined the term beloved community. Based on his readings of the biblical gospels, as well as the writings of the apostle Paul, Royce argued that the beloved community was one where individuals are transformed by God’s love.

In turn, members express that love as loyalty toward each other – for example, the devoted love a member of the church would have toward the church as a whole.
While Royce often identified the beloved community with the church, he extends the concept beyond the walls of Christianity. In any type of community, Royce argued, from clans to nations, there are individuals who express love and devotion not only to their own community, but who foster a sense of the community that includes all humankind.
According to Royce, the ideal or beloved community is a “universal community” – one to which all human beings belong or will eventually belong at the end of time.
‘Beloved’ diversity
Twentieth-century pastor, philosopher, mystic, theologian and civil rights leader Howard Thurman retrieved Royce’s idea of the beloved community and applied it to his life and work, most notably in his 1971 book “The Search for Common Ground.”
Thurman first used the term in an unpublished and undated article: Desegregation, Integration, and the Beloved Community. Here, he argued that the beloved community cannot be achieved by sheer will or commanded by force. Rather, it begins with transformation in each person’s “human spirit.” The seeds of the beloved community extend outward into society as each person assumes the responsibility of bringing it to pass.
Thurman envisioned the beloved community as one that exemplifies harmony – harmony enriched by members’ diversity. It is a community wherein people from all racial, national, religious and ethnic backgrounds are respected, and where their human dignity is affirmed. Thurman was convinced that beloved community was achievable because of the dedication he saw from activists during the struggle for racial integration.
During his lifetime, Thurman sought to build this beloved community through his activism for racial justice. For example, he co-founded the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples, an interracial and interfaith community in San Francisco, which he co-pastored from 1943 to 1953.
Thurman’s writings and activism deeply influenced King. Burrow argued that it is not entirely clear when and where King first learned the concept of beloved community. Yet King emphasized its importance in much of his writing and political action.
Love and action
In simplest terms, King defined the beloved community as a community transformed by love. Like Royce, he drew his understanding of love from the Bible’s New Testament. In the original Greek, the Gospels use the word “agape,” which suggests God’s self-giving, unconditional love for humanity – and, by extension, human beings’ self-giving, unconditional love for each other.

According to Baldwin, however, King’s understanding of the beloved community is better understood against the backdrop of the Black church tradition. Raised in the Ebenezer Baptist Church of Atlanta, King learned lessons on the meaning of love from his parents, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. – Ebenezer’s pastor, who was also a leader in the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People – and Alberta Christine Williams King.
One of the distinctions in King’s thought is that he believed the beloved community could be achieved through nonviolent direct action, such as sit-ins, marches and boycotts. In part, he was inspired by Thurman, who had embraced the nonviolence at the heart of Mahatma Gandhi’s resistance against the British in India. For King, nonviolence was the only viable means for achieving the United States of America’s redemption from the sin of racial segregation and white supremacy.
For King, therefore, the beloved community was not merely a utopian vision of the future. He envisioned it as an obtainable ethical goal that all human beings must work collectively toward achieving.
“Only a refusal to hate or kill can put an end to the chain of violence in the world and lead us toward a community where men can live together without fear,” King wrote in 1966. “Our goal is to create a beloved community and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.”
King’s idea of the beloved community has not only influenced people affiliated with the Christian tradition but also people from other faiths and none.
For instance, scholars Elizabeth A. Johnson, bell hooks and Joy James have reflected upon the meaning of the beloved community amid ongoing challenges such as global climate change, sexism, racism and other forms of structural violence.
People around the world continue to draw insight and inspiration from King’s thought, especially from his insistence that love is “the most durable power” to change the world for the better. Questions remain about whether his beloved community can be realized, or how. But I believe it is important to understand King’s ethical concept and its continuing influence on movements that seek an end to injustice.

(Photo by STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — With two months to go before candidates must file to be on this year’s ballots, the state Democratic Party made a plea.
“RUN FOR OFFICE in 2026,” reads the top of an email sent Jan. 7 from state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain.
Democrats have announced bids for just two of the seven elected constitutional offices on the ballot this November: governor and state superintendent of education. The party is still talking with potential candidates, Spain told the SC Daily Gazette.
In her email, she pointed to that week’s slim margin of victory for Republican Greg Ford in a special election for a state House seat representing Dorchester County. He defeated Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani by just 21 votes, as determined by an automatic recount.
Ogletree Satani “ran one heck of a race,” Spain wrote, noting that President Donald Trump won the district by over 6 percentage points in 2024. (Statewide, he won by 18 points.) “The lesson to all of us is that we can compete and win if we run!”
The email was successful, Spain told the Gazette on Wednesday.
In one week, more than a hundred people filled out the candidate interest form attached to that email. “Dozens” of them checked a box showing interest in seeking a statewide office, according to Jon Burton, a party spokesperson.


Upcoming deadlines
To compete in the June 9 party primaries, candidates must file the forms and pay the required fees between March 16 and March 30.
The fee is 1% of the job’s salary over the entire term.
For constitutional offices, that ranges from $4,243 for gubernatorial candidates to $8,560 to run for state superintendent.


It’s been 32 years since a Democrat competed for every statewide elected office in the South Carolina constitution. And back in 1994, there were two additional offices on the ballot.
The party has come close to having a candidate for every office since.
In 2006, a Democrat ran for every statewide office except attorney general. Then-Attorney General Henry McMaster ran unopposed for re-election that year.
In 2002, the only constitutional office without a Democrat running was adjutant general, the leader of the state’s military department. Maj. Gen. Stan Spears ran unopposed that year. He easily defeated a Democrat in 2006 for his fourth and final term before retiring. In 2014, voters approved taking that office off the ballot and making it a governor-appointed position.
Also in 2014, McMaster was the last lieutenant governor elected separately, as per a change voters approved two years earlier.
Asked about Spain’s email, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said Democrats’ problem “isn’t a lack of candidates.
“It’s that voters simply aren’t buying what they’re selling,” he said in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
Two races with both parties on the ballot
A Democrat last won a statewide office in 2006, when Jim Rex was elected state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
This year, two Democrats, Lisa Ellis and Sylvia Wright, are running for the job overseeing the state agency for K-12 public schools. Whoever wins the June 9 Democratic primary will likely face Superintendent Ellen Weaver, who’s running for her second term. So far, no Republican has announced a challenge.
In 2022, the race for superintendent was the most crowded: Six Republicans and three Democrats ran to replace outgoing Superintendent Molly Spearman.
Ellis was a first-time candidate then. The 25-year veteran teacher of Richland 2 high schools, who in 2018 founded the online teachers’ group SC for Ed, won a three-way primary outright without needing a runoff, then lost to Weaver by 16 percentage points. In 2023, SC for Ed announced an indefinite pause to its lobbying efforts, four years after organizing a teachers’ rally at the Statehouse attended by an estimated 10,000 people.
Wright, who has two decades of classroom and administrative experience, resigned from her job last fall as a district coordinator for Dorchester 4 in order to campaign full-time.
Among all the statewide races on the ballot this year, the wide-open governor’s race has by far gotten the most attention.
It’s been 16 years since no incumbent ran for governor. Five Republicans and two Democrats have announced bids to replace Gov. Henry McMaster, who first ascended to the job nine years ago when then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined President Donald Trump’s first administration. So, when voters first elected McMaster to the job in 2018, he’d already been governor almost two years.
In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms. Other constitutional offices have no term limitations.
Two other offices are wide open
Two other statewide offices that have gotten little attention are wide open for the first time in over two decades.
Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is not seeking a sixth full term. It’s been 16 years since a Democrat challenged him.
Voters first elected Weathers in 2006, two years after Gov. Mark Sanford appointed the Orangeburg County dairy farmer to the job following the indictment of Charlie Sharpe, who was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe to protect a cockfighting ring.
Weathers endorsed Republican Fred West to replace him, The State newspaper reported last March. West retired in 2023 after 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms and his since become director of market development at the Department of Agriculture.
So far, West is the only candidate to announce a bid to lead the agency with duties that include promoting one of the state’s top industries, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The job of comptroller general is open for the first time in 28 years, when then-Sen. Jim Landers replaced the retiring Earle Morris Jr.
That 1998 election was also the last time a Democrat won the post as the state’s chief accountant. In 2002, Republican Richard Eckstrom ousted Landers and kept the job for 21 years. Eckstrom resigned in 2023 amid mounting pressure over his office’s $3.5 billion accounting error. (The error was strictly on paper. No money went missing. The office mistakenly double-counted some agencies’ revenue.)
McMaster made history in appointing his budget director, Brian Gaines, who by agreeing to run the office temporarily became South Carolina’s first Black constitutional officer since Reconstruction. Gaines said at the time he had no interest in running in 2026.
One Republican has announced a bid: Mike Burkhold, a Charleston County businessman who founded Equiscript, a health care technology company.
For two other statewide offices, Republicans are seeking re-election without any announced competition.
Secretary of State Mark Hammond, first elected in 2002, is seeking a seventh term leading the office that registers and helps regulate businesses and charities operating in South Carolina. (Unlike in other states, South Carolina’s secretary of state plays no role at all in overseeing elections.)
Treasurer Curtis Loftis, first elected in 2010, also came under fire recently for accounting problems. Senate investigations into the comptroller general’s office led to discovery of a $1.8 billion error in the treasurer’s office — also a blunder on paper that didn’t affect state revenues or the Legislature’s budgeting process. An outside accounting firm found that all but $200 million never existed. But senators were incensed, voting 33 to 8 last April to remove him. The House, however, never took up the case.
Amid a grilling from senators, Loftis initially pledged that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he later reversed course and announced he’s seeking a fifth term. He maintains that he did nothing wrong.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Sahra Sharif, a mother of 16 and owner of an apparel shop at Madina Mall in Minneapolis, said her new routine is to open at 3 p.m. and stay open for about four hours, hoping to cover the month’s rent. 
Due to a fear of immigration agents, “The entire shopping mall is completely empty because people rarely come out of their homes,” she said. 
With the food, utility, and rent for both the shop and her flat looming, Sahra picked up a side job caring for a person with a disability. The job also went unpaid, however, after the state’s latest anti-fraud effort delayed payment to home care agencies.  
“I was hoping to get a few checks already, but I haven’t gotten even one yet,” she said.
She said she started her business 10 years ago and never thought she would go back to being an employee.
This is life for many Minnesota immigrants these days in President Donald Trump’s America. 
Since the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stepped up raids and random stops last month, three of Sharif’s family members have been arrested. Her son was deported to Somalia; a cousin is a permanent resident who was released; and the other is still in custody, she said.  
“In my family, people rarely go outside unless it’s absolutely necessary; and if anyone does, it is considered a reckless thing to do,” she said.
Imam Yusuf Abdulle, executive director of the Islamic Association of North America, said fear of ICE has changed many immigrants’ daily routines.
Social gatherings have vanished, parents advise their young adult children to stay home, and short walks and unnecessary trips have become a thing of the past.

“The Somali community heavily depends on each other’s mutual support, so if people remain indoors, that will impact everyone,” Abdulle said. “That’s why we encourage people to come together and support each other.”
Moreover, most Somali Minnesotans are U.S. citizens, so Abdulle and other community leaders are encouraging people to resume their normal routines.
But because ICE’s approach seems to be “detain first, identify later,” no one wants to take a risk, even U.S. citizens.  
For many young Somali Americans, the stress caused by ICE has led to confusion and doubt about why they and their family are being stopped, questioned and at times detained.  
“Some of them worry if their parents will return home,” Abdulle said.
Many young people born and raised in the U.S. are forced to carry their passports, while white teens do not. The implicit racism takes a toll on them, Abdulle said.
Despite the confusion and fear, the immigrant community is finding strength by helping each other through ride-sharing, picking up groceries, paying rent, and running errands for those who lost their jobs due to fear of being detained, are afraid to go out or don’t have proper documentation. 
For the newly isolated, however, their struggles are unseen. Abdulle is urging them to contact their nearest mosque or community center for help.
‘Workers don’t come to work anymore’ 
The Latino community is also struggling under the federal glare, especially because their rate of citizenship is far lower. 
Jerardo Rivera, an owner of a painting company, said fear has rippled through the community. 
“Workers don’t come to work anymore,” he said. After ICE repeatedly showed up at construction and other job sites, many in his community are in hiding due to fear of being arrested and thrown out of the country overnight. 
“Everyone in my family is a U.S. citizen, but we are still scared. Because if ICE is killing a white U.S. citizen, do you think an immigrant would stand a chance?” he asked, referring to the recent killing of Renee Good by federal officer Jonathan Ross.
Rivera said he worries about his family and community given ICE’s near limitless power to detain and deport. 
A truck driver watches a city suffer under federal weight
Mohamed Ali, a truck driver, said he is not always in the cities, but in the past month or so, he was shocked by how Minneapolis went from a vibrant city with businesses, cafes and social gatherings to a place that now looks unfamiliar. 
“I went to Karmel Mall to get a haircut at 3 p.m., the busiest time in the mall, but I couldn’t find a single barbershop open,” he said.
Mohamud Abdi, a Minneapolis resident, said that the new community norm is to stay hidden because even those with documents are reluctant to interact with ICE for fear of something going terribly wrong. 
“They call it law enforcement, but there is nothing lawful about the things that they are enforcing,” Abdi said.
Abdi compared the current situation to the administration of former President Barack Obama, which deported 3 million people from the U.S., more than any other president in American history, but as Abdi noted, Obama did so without hurting so many innocent people or putting a city like Minneapolis under siege.
Voting for Trump — and regretting it
Sharif, the Madina Mall shop owner who fears she may have to return to the bad old days of having a boss, gave out an exasperated sigh. 
“Would you believe if I told you I voted for this man?” she said, referring to Trump.
Sharif is not politically active, but in 2024, some campaigners came to her shop and told her that Trump would be good for business and against the LGBTQ agenda. 
“I was immediately hooked,” she said. She voted Republican for the first time.
Now, chagrined, she said, “I never thought the man I put in office would come for my family, make me financially struggle and cause me so much fear that I carry my passport when I go to the bathroom,” she said, pointing at the mall’s bathrooms.
“I feel as though the weapon I built is coming to kill me and my people,” she said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NN251208_223-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office are dissecting dozens of Missouri’s Targeted Regulation of Abortion, or TRAP laws, as a judge decides which, if any, should remain in place. The safety of abortion is at the heart of the debate.
As the trial enters its second week on Tuesday in Jackson County, the state is trying to make the case that the potential for complications justifies strict regulations on abortion providers. 
“The risks associated with abortion don’t just exist in the abstract,” said Assistant Solicitor General Alexandria Overcash. “Real women, Missouri women have suffered.”
Experts called by Planned Parenthood say that’s not the case. Abortion, they said, presents less risk than many medical procedures, including child birth.
“But there’s nothing like sitting in your patient’s pool of blood as she’s bleeding out four liters of blood to realize that a healthy term pregnancy has a whole hell of a lot of risk,” Dr. Jennifer Smith, an OB-GYN in St. Louis, testified Friday.
Jennifer Smith, an OBGYN, speaks about medical challenges without legal abortions in Missouri in 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2024 overturning the state’s abortion ban and enacting protections for reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri quickly filed a lawsuit seeking to repeal abortion regulations it argues now violate the new constitutional amendment. The 10-day trial in the case began last week.
Among the laws being challenged is a requirement that only doctors provide abortions, a ban on prescribing medication abortion through telehealth, facility licensing requirements, admitting privileges and a written transfer agreement at a nearby hospital and a state-approved complication plan for medication abortions. 
These regulations eventually halted nearly all access to abortion in Missouri as more and more women seeking to terminate a pregnancy sought care in Illinois and Kansas. By the time Missouri’s abortion ban went into effect in 2022, thousands of Missourians were already leaving the state each year to end their pregnancies. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office is seeking to access records for patients who traveled to Planned Parenthood clinics in Illinois and Kansas for abortions and experienced a complication.
In December, the state tried to impose sanctions to force Planned Parenthood to turn over these patient complication reports. Planned Parenthood refused, saying the records would violate patient privacy. A separate judge intervened, ordering the clinics to only turn over a summary chart outlining the complications. The state is appealing this decision.
Over the past decade, nearly 29,000 Missourians had abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Kansas, Overland Park, and Pittsburg, Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, testified Tuesday. Of 28,764 who had abortions between 2015 and 2024, 248 had complications as defined by the state, bringing the complication rate to .86%, according to data later provided by Planned Parenthood to The Independent.  
“We are significantly better when it comes to complication rates than the national average,” Wales said, noting that the complication rate for Missouri women at each of the three clinics is regularly under 1% and has been for the past decade. 
Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue asked if some patients had to have follow-up procedures at local hospitals, and if Planned Parenthood Great Plains has advised patients to go to the ER? 
Yes, Wales said, but they’ve never had to transport a patient from a clinic to a hospital.
Abortion trial details how laws drove providers from Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics

Under state law, Planned Parenthood must report any abortion complications to the health department. But how the health department and how Planned Parenthood defines complications differs.  
In 2022, the most recent year Department of Health and Senior Services data is available, 115 complications were reported. Fifty-five involved procedural abortions, which happen in-clinic, and 60 were the result of medication abortions.
Gillian Wilcox, litigation director for the ACLU of Missouri, said state attorneys were misrepresenting the safety of abortions and said the practice doesn’t necessitate special regulations. 
“All medical care carries risk of complications. And when you look at it in isolation, you don’t get a full picture,” Wilcox said in an interview. “Because when you get the full picture it is that they are providing thousands of abortions. And the complication rate actually percentage-wise is very low.” 
Complications associated with abortion included hemorrhaging, fever, uterine perforation, pregnancy tissue left in the uterus, cervical lacerations, incomplete abortion and failed abortion. 
The latter, which is a circumstance where the abortion doesn’t work and the pregnancy continues, is not generally considered a complication, but rather a possible outcome, Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health based at the University of California-San Francisco, testified Tuesday.
State-mandated complication reporting requirements “create the impression that abortion is riskier than it really is,” said Grossman, who is a liaison to Planned Parenthood’s National Medical Committee.
Missouri is one of 27 states that requires providers to submit complication reports.
Grossman pointed to a section on the complication report marked “death.”
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects of both medication and procedural abortions. Hemorrhaging and infection are among the rare complications. 
Since mifepristone was approved for use in medication abortions 28 years ago, 32 deaths have been associated with its use, according to the Federal Drug Administration. The FDA evaluated data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Ingrid Skop, an OB-GYN in Texas and a board member at the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute, was called to testify Friday by the Attorney General’s Office. She has treated dozens of women for abortion complications, Skop said, and she believes national data is lacking.
“It appears safer than it actually is,” she said.
That’s because abortion clinics are not generally mandated to report complications, Skop said. 
Complications can happen after women leave clinics, and women presenting in hospital emergency rooms do not always tell doctors about their abortions. Skop said abortion providers do little follow up, unlike a routine doctor that has built a relationship with their patients. 
“The assumption seems to be no news is good news,” she said of abortion providers who may not hear from patients after procedural or medication abortions.
On cross examination, a plaintiff’s attorney noted that Skop has never performed abortions and disagrees with mainstream medical associations like the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists. Skop was also questioned about the fact that several of her articles were retracted for methodology issues from peer-reviewed journals, though she maintained those were politically motivated moves.

On Thursday, Overcash questioned Margot Riphagan, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers president and CEO, extensively about complications.
Overcash entered into evidence a spreadsheet summarizing complications reported among the nearly 24,000 Missourians who traveled to Planned Parenthood’s clinic in Fairview Heights for abortions in the last decade. Planned Parenthood later told The Independent there were 418 complications among 24,350 Missourians at the clinic between 2015 and 2024, or a 1.72% complication rate as defined by the state.
Overcash then highlighted nine instances of ectopic pregnancies, a dangerous condition in which a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus that, if left untreated, can lead to death. 
Doctors testifying on behalf of Planned Parenthood said taking mifepristone doesn’t increase a patient’s risk of dying from an ectopic pregnancy. The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including abdominal pain, would disqualify someone from being able to be prescribed medication abortion without first seeing a doctor in-person.
Two people over three decades have died from ruptured ectopic pregnancies after taking mifepristone, according to the FDA. The FDA reported an additional 95 cases of mifepristone taken during an ectopic pregnancy. The patients were hospitalized in a majority of those cases. 
Overcash also pointed to several cases documenting failed or incomplete abortions in which the patient later chose to stay pregnant. 
“So once again, a woman decided to continue her pregnancy?” she asked.
“It’s critical that women make decisions about their own bodies, yes” Riphagan responded.
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who was appointed to the job in September, made her first appearance at the trial Thursday afternoon. 
“There are real concerns about the safety for women if these treatments are not medically supervised in the appropriate way,” she told The Independent. 
Asked whether the state viewed abortion as unsafe Hanaway said: “Remember, we all have a job, which is to represent the state. And these are the laws that were adopted by the state, and we’re defending them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0807-1024x596.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

A Highway Patrol trooper’s sexual abuse of a fellow officer at a work conference. A lawsuit between prominent St. Louis attorneys.
All of these cases were removed from Missouri’s public court database. Searching for them online, it appeared as if they never existed.
Cases assigned a high enough “security level” can’t be viewed by the public through Missouri’s online courts database or in person at courthouses. Judges who assign a security level of five, for example, have needed virtually no justification to make these cases disappear.
“Sometimes, the parties might request security level five as part of a settlement, or something like that,” said Dan Curry, an attorney for the Missouri Press Association. “Because one or both, plaintiff and the defendant, don’t want to have whatever happened in the court be easily found.”
Curry said unless the news media or members of the public are following a security level five case, it’s a “whole lot harder” to see what’s happening.
A case can also be removed for days before trial to prevent jurors from accessing documents. While people involved with the cases can still get access, a lack of clarity surrounding how the system works leads to reports of people missing hearings and wrongly thinking charges were dropped.
When cases are sealed at a certain security level, members of the public and journalists can’t even verify their existence. Some unsealed examples identified by the Columbia Missourian contain information pertaining to public servants and officials. The mere existence of these cases — and any related allegations — was previously hidden.
This can conflict with the idea of open courts that Curry said is important to democracy.
“Especially if you read through some of the case law in Missouri and what’s in the constitution about open courts and open records, then I think (lawyers) would know … not only is it a good idea for a democracy, but also legally in Missouri, these things should be open as a default setting,” he said.
 What are security levels?

Missouri court cases are given a security level ranging from one to nine. A level one means the case or document is fully open to the public, whereas a level nine is reserved for cases made confidential after expungement.
The meaning of each security level is specified on The Missouri Bar’s website. Cases might be confidential because they involve juvenile matters. Or maybe they were entered in error. Many levels have a list of three possible scenarios they could be used for.
Security level five is an exception. The only explanation written for level five is “cases under court order.”
When a case is assigned a security level of five, it disappears completely from Missouri’s public court database. That includes information such as the name of the case, scheduling for future hearings and the final judgment.
In an order published Dec. 16, the Supreme Court of Missouri outlined new requirements for sealing cases set to take effect July 1. The standards state sealing records should “overcome a presumption that judicial records should be open for public inspection.”
Curry outlined his thoughts on the order in a column for the Missouri Press Association. He wrote certain changes could make it easier to access records by specifying rules that were previously open-ended.
However, one rule change may make access harder. The order lists 19 types of records that are automatically confidential. Curry wrote the first 18 items are specific and consistent with state law, but the last is a “catch-all” that appears to not require judges to find compelling justification for closure.
The specific wording of record type 19 is: “Any other record sealed, expunged, or closed by statute, Supreme Court rule, or order of a court of record.”
“The worry is this — in some ways the new rules make it easier for a court to close files than before,” Curry wrote. “If a judge desires to make case records confidential, the rules place no conditions or constraints on that decision. This could lead to case files continuing to disappear.”
In a news release, court officials said “over the coming months, the Court plans to provide additional information to help ensure consistent and successful implementation of the rule revisions.”
Under the current rules, if one tries to search using a level five case’s number online, a red error pops up reading, “Your query returned no matches to be viewed at this site. Please try another search or contact the court directly.”
Contacting the court directly yields similar results. On a phone call attempting to get information and documents, court staff repeatedly told Columbia Missourian reporters they couldn’t know anything as the cases were under security level five.
One employee said to a reporter, “I’m not even sure how you got the case number.”
Cases under security level five are hidden unless a judge unseals them. Sometimes, this happens as a situation draws media attention.
One example involved a 2023 lawsuit between political candidates. Former state Rep. Justin Hicks sued Max Calfo, who was running for his seat, for publishing images from a 2010 case in which Hicks was accused of grabbing a woman by the neck and choking her.
Judge Christopher McDonough sealed the politician’s lawsuit at a security level of five, according to court documents. The judge’s order contained the reasoning that “permitting public access to this cause would invariably reveal the existence of the confidential records.”
The case was later unsealed after garnering significant media attention.
Years ago, one of Curry’s clients was offered money in a settlement agreement. A condition of the agreement was raising the security level. Curry said especially if someone has hospital bills, they can be incentivized to accept conditions like raising the security level despite being proponents for open courts.
“If it’s a big enough money, a big enough amount of money for the plaintiffs, for the victim or the injured party, you know, maybe they need that money for medical care,” he said. “Maybe they need that money for housing. There’s real life consequences.”
 Upcoming jury trials

Judges sometimes raise the security level on cases shortly before a jury trial is scheduled. The reasoning is often that if public, jurors could look up information before the trial.
One example from Boone County involves a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper found guilty of sexually abusing a police officer and preventing her from leaving a hotel room during a work conference.
According to the Missouri courts database, this case was put under a security level of three for 10 days around the time of the trial.
While different from level five, William Hux, court administrator for Missouri’s 13th judicial circuit, wrote in an email level three also prevents the public from viewing cases. Involved parties retain access, he wrote.
People involved with cases can still be negatively impacted by a lack of clarity around the security level process. Finding specific information can be difficult when the mere existence of cases disappears from public searches online.
Amanda Mendez, editor-in-chief of the Howell County News in rural, southern Missouri, said she’s had several community members reach out after cases disappeared from the public courts database.
One woman told Mendez she missed her divorce hearing because her case’s security level was upgraded. The woman, Mendez said, was unable to view her case online and didn’t know how to find information on scheduling.
In another instance, Mendez said the family of a victim of child sex abuse was spun into panic, thinking charges were suddenly dropped.
As for cases disappearing before trial, Doug Thomson was previously a trial judge in Nodaway County, which has roughly 12% the population of Boone County. He said jurors accessing cases or even driving to crime scenes is an elevated concern in rural counties.
Much of that is due to the fact rural counties simply have fewer cases, so jurors are either told or can figure out the specific cases they’re being summoned for ahead of time.
“You simply have to understand that if we’ve got a jury trial coming up, and it’s a small county, it’s kind of a big deal,” Thomson said.
When jurors looked up cases ahead of time, Thomson said they were questioned by the court during the selection process to decide if they should be allowed to stay in the jury.
Thomson sits on the Missouri Press-Bar Commission, a group intended to “foster better communications between the media and the bench and bar,” according to its website. He said through that work, the disappearing cases were recently brought to his attention.
“All of a sudden, there’s just simply nothing there,” Thomson said. “But there is a reason sometimes, you know, at least in my experience in a small county.”
In the Dec. 16 order, the Missouri Supreme Court updated rules to say future cases will not be restricted ahead of jury trials without a “court order setting forth specific written findings supporting a compelling justification to restrict access.”
 Inconsistent labeling

Identifying what security level a case was set at can be difficult due to inconsistent documentation. In the example of the former Highway Patrol trooper, Missouri’s public court database lists in plain text the case would be at security level three and on what specific days.
Finding the security level of the politician’s lawsuit is a little harder. It’s not written anywhere on the case’s online profile. Instead, the case level is listed in the judge’s order to seal, which ends with, “This Cause is to remain under seal, at level five.”
Those are both situations in which the security level could be identified by the public after the case was unsealed. Many times, it can’t.
In a suspected security level five or three case from St. Charles County involving a murder, no level was listed online or in any available documents. Columbia Missourian reporters got access to both the motion to increase the security level and the judge’s order granting it.
However, neither document mentioned the specific level — just that it was raised. The court employee who provided the documents wrote in an email there was no way to determine the level.
A similar situation exists in a 2022 lawsuit against prominent St. Louis attorney Jerome Schlichter.
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, all traces of the lawsuit were completely removed from the Missouri public courts database. Even so, no documents related to the sealing or unsealing are linked online, such as was the case with the politician’s lawsuit.
Paper copies of the motion to seal, order to seal and order to unseal received from the Civil Courts Building in St. Louis once again do not list the specific security level, only that it was raised and dropped back down.
Because of the freedom judges have to assign these levels, Curry said their use can vary greatly court-to-court. Some judges do not seal cases ahead of upcoming jury trials, like Thomson did.
Whether the newly revised court rules will make a significant difference in the sealing of records won’t be known until they go into effect in July and could depend on what additional guidance is provided.
“Throughout the extensive analysis we have undertaken, our ultimate goal has been to clarify the nature of confidential information and to simplify the redaction process,” Chief Justice W. Brent Powell said in a news release. “We believe today’s order will result in better access to public court records while protecting any truly confidential information they may contain.”
Under the current use of the guidelines, sometimes judges ordered security levels to drop after attracting media attention. Sometimes, the cases unsealed after a trial concluded. And in some cases, they still remain closed to the public.
“Judges are such a wide array of personalities and perspectives and thoughts on the matter,” Curry said. “I’m sure there’ll be some judges who would say, ‘Hey, if this gets this case resolved and the parties are all agreement, then no skin off my back to give you guys what you want.’”

Trump used his executive powers to change the observance of MLK Day by cancelling it as a free-admission day for those who wish to visit our national parks during federal holidays.
The order also applies to Juneteenth. Access to the national parks on those two days will no longer be free as it is with other federal holidays. However, free admission days this year will include June 14, Trump’s birthday, which is also Flag Day and is not a federal holiday.
Obstructing the commemoration or MLK Day is just one more step in mitigating, minimizing or outright undoing the place and role of Black Americans.
Targeting and removing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives in both the public and private sectors has been a high priority during the second term of the Trump administration.
Trump’s most recent declaration is that the Civil Rights Act hurt white people, resulting in “white people being treated very badly.” What will be next?
Will there be ongoing efforts to bury, erase and recast all of the Black experience — the inhumane and inequitable treatment across generations, as well as the contributions to this country despite it?
Is the desire to bury everything about Black people in a time capsule, never to be found.
As we pause to commemorate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr., we should take notice of the stark and diabolical efforts to undue everything he worked and paid the ultimate price for: equal treatment, access and opportunities, not only for Blacks but poor whites and all the down-trodden among us.
Clearly, the work is not done.
There are concerted efforts in every aspect of American life to undue the progress made so far and stop the march toward equality.
Martin Luther King Jr. believed in America’s promise — the ideals, principles and laws on which this country was founded and promoted. He mobilized others and appealed to elected officials and policymakers at every level of government to ensure that laws, rights and privileges of the land applied equally to all citizens, irrespective of skin color, gender or station in life.
That was his dream. His life’s work. His ultimate sacrifice.
When remembering King the famous “I Have a Dream” speech, which he delivered during the march on Washington, D.C. in 1963, is often referenced.
But the fire that burned within King’s soul, that led him to dedicate his life toward eradicating social evil and injustice, started long before — nearly 20 years earlier when he traveled to Dublin, Georgia as a senior in high school to deliver “The Negro and the Constitution” in an oratory contest.
Perhaps, King’s dream was just a flicker back then. But as you follow King’s life through college and the seminary, you see that flicker grows into a flame. The more he saw and heard, the more he could not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear. He set out on a life-long journey to eradicate human injustice.
What issues or conditions tug at your heart and soul deeply enough to spend time to change them, make things better for the disenfranchised among us?
It is never too early or too late to do something.
America needs dreamers today like Martin Luther King, Jr. to fix some of its greatest social, racial challenges and inequities.
Many we thought were behind us, only to realize the resurgence of many anew.
While besieged by the current hyperbolic and unpredictable political environment perpetuated by the Trump administration and his state and local cohorts, we could easily lose sight of the ground we have lost in recent years in the quest for equality and equal opportunity — many of the things King fought and died for.
Schools across America are still segregated, some more than ever.
Voting rights continue to be challenged in many states, making it more difficult for Blacks and other minorities to exercise their right to vote.
There is still discrimination occurring in the job market, access to housing, and access to higher education whether it involves admission to colleges, universities of technical vocational institutions.
Discrimination is still rampant in the justice system when it comes to racial profiling, traffic stops, or issuing the same punishments for the same crime. There are injustices even among how schools discipline Black children and white children for the same misconduct.
The pronouncement, executive orders and other actions of the Trump administration have only fueled racial inequity and discord, bringing it front and center in almost every aspect of our daily lives.
Is this your dream for America?
Doing something, continuing to root out inequality and injustice where we encounter it, is the greatest tribute we can pay to Martin Luther King Jr.
When King took up the fight to realize America’s promise for all of her citizens, he knew  change would not come overnight.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Democratic candidates for Michigan secretary of state clashed at a Sunday night forum that included Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist apologizing for past comments on the war in Gaza, as rivals questioned his judgment and focus after he ended his gubernatorial campaign to enter the race.
Gilchrist announced last week that he would be suspending his campaign for governor, saying in a video that “the time for me to serve in that role may come, but now is not that time.”
Former Michigan Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli took aim at Gilchrist during Wednesday night’s candidate forum, saying the next secretary of state will need to be “laser focused” on elections.
“This office is too important to be treated as a consolation prize or a steppingstone for anybody,” Shkreli said. “I’ve known the lieutenant governor for the past seven years. Having worked with him, we really can’t risk this office landing in the hands of somebody that’s going to use it to elevate their political future. There’s just too much on the line.”
But Gilchrist said he has experience making it easier to access government services, pointing to an automatic criminal record expungement program he championed and an app that allows Detroit residents to report issues to the city from their phone.
“Now more than ever, we need that kind of problem-solving approach as the energy of the secretary of state’s office,” Gilchrist said. “To be efficient, to be responsive and to be a 21st Century office that’s going to protect and strengthen democratic process from the dangers and threats, both rhetorically, legally and physically, of the Trump administration.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie dropped out of the race to be the Democratic nominee for secretary of state after Gilchrist announced his campaign, saying that for the sake of party unity, he was endorsing the lieutenant governor.
That leaves Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum as the only candidate with experience administering elections, and she was quick to note voters have gone to the polls 42 times since she took office.
“I run tough elections, and I win tough elections,” Byrum said.
Former state Sen. Adam Hollier, a paratrooper who ended his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives to run for secretary of state, said threats to the election process motivated him to seek the office.
“I jump out of perfectly good airplanes and run into burning buildings as a volunteer firefighter,” Hollier said. “I have always opted into an opportunity to serve where this stuff is happening the most. And as everyone here recognizes, secretary of state is a space where, that’s where the fight is.”
Democrats will use an April 19 endorsement convention in Detroit to rally support around one candidate before officially selecting a nominee in the fall.
Gilchrist apologizes for Gaza comments
Gilchrist started the forum, which was hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party’s Jewish Caucus, by apologizing for saying in the fall that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was committing a genocide of Palestinian people and that he would not accept campaign contributions from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States.
“I heard you loud and clear that the nature of some of my comments and campaign rhetoric has been taken as antisemitic. I want to apologize for that,” Gilchrist said.
Gilchrist said he has met with the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.
“I firmly stand against antisemitism, and I vow to continue an open dialogue with this community,” Gilchrist said. “I also believe in my heart that there is a place in the Democratic Party for the entire spectrum of the Jewish people and Jewish community, and I’ll make sure that that door remains wide open to them.”
Michigan has both the largest Arab American community and one of the largest Jewish populations in the country.
Divisions within the Democratic Party over the war in Gaza erupted during the 2024 election, and Gilchrist’s comments last fall were met with raucous applause from the audience members in Dearborn.
Shkreli, without naming Gilchrist, said statewide leaders must consider the impact of their words.
“I think that elected officials need to be very mindful about, you know, what they say,” Shkreli said. “And in times of antisemitism and a rise in what we’ve seen, strong leadership is needed so people feel supported and know that the communities have their back.”

Byrum also stopped short of naming Gilchrist, but said it is important for Democrats to have a ticket that can unite the party.
“I think it’s the responsibility of the secretary of state, and any statewide office holder, to push back against hate, and to continue to be supportive of all constituencies and unite the party,” Byrum said. “You will never have to worry about my words or actions being used as a reason for certain constituencies not to feel loved and welcomed in the Michigan Democratic Party.”
Hollier said “the Black community and the Jewish community have always stood together, because no one else would stand with us.”
“That’s what you should expect from me as your secretary of state,” Hollier said. “You should expect not an ally, not a friend, but somebody who understands that we share in their struggle, that we rise together, that we are fighting this fight together, because we always have been.”
Preparing for election challenges
Byrum said the possibility of attempts to overturn the results of upcoming elections is one reason why the next secretary of state should have experience walking the line between being elected politically but serving in a largely nonpartisan way as an election administrator.
“We need to make sure that we are mitigating any risk,” Byrum said. “One of the ways we can mitigate risk is by having an election official as the Secretary of State.”
She said other candidates, who may not be as familiar with election processes, could be more prone to saying something in error that could have legal consequences down the road.
“Anything a candidate for Secretary of State says today or on the campaign trail can very well show up in pleadings claiming that the elections were rigged,” Byrum said. “If someone misstates an election process, that can be used in court later against them.”
Gilchrist said the Trump administration is leading “the creative destruction of our democracy” and said having “robust” legal teams to challenge the administration in court is “one of the most aggressive and important functions” that the next secretary of state will need to prioritize.
Shkreli said the state must “have a posture of legal preparedness,” including building a “litigation playbook.”

“We’ve got to work with relevant stakeholders, such as the attorney general and the Bureau of Elections, to ensure that we have the best litigation strategy possible to fight any unconstitutional attacks on our electoral process,” Shkreli said.
Hollier said reducing ambiguity in election law could help eliminate some challenges.
“There are too many spaces for people to fight over the details that are not being adequately enforced, and, most importantly, too many spaces for people to make mistakes,” Hollier said.
Gilchrist said state and local leaders are already running tabletop exercises to predict possible lines of attack ahead of the 2026 midterms.
“That preparation work is already underway for this election, and we’re going to have to start it almost immediately after this election in preparation for the elections that are going to happen in 2027 and 2028 across Michigan,” Gilchrist said.
Digital IDs, data privacy and other priorities
Overseeing elections is only half of the secretary of state’s job, with branch offices throughout the state handling things like vehicle registrations and state IDs also falling under their purview.
Hollier said the process of going to a Secretary of State office, only to find out you brought the wrong paperwork to prove your identity, can be frustrating.
That’s why he said the Department of State should be able to collaborate with other departments, like the Department of Health and Human Services, to retrieve the documents they need.
“State employees want to be able to say yes and be as helpful as they possibly can, and too often, our systems do not allow them to do so,” Hollier said.

The proposal highlights the amount of personal data the state has about each resident.
Gilchrist said he would make it a priority to protect the privacy of that personal data “from big tech companies that are hungry to mine it and the Trump administration that is thirsty to surveil it.”
“The Trump administration has been suing state after state after state to try to get access to that information so they could use it to attack people, to weaponize it against communities, against minorities, to make them less safe, to feed it to ICE so they can go in with Gestapo tactics and threaten and kill people, as we’ve seen in other parts of this country,” Gilchrist said.
“I’m deeply concerned about that, but I’m also concerned about what the tech companies want to do with this information, to feed it into an AI model without your permission, to run it through a data center that we don’t want to see here in the state of Michigan,” Gilchrist continued.
Hollier said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations being carried out in states like Minnesota highlight the need for every resident to have access to a state ID.
“Especially at a time within a country where people can ask you for your papers, we have to make sure that every single Michigander has a valid ID,” Hollier said.
He said formerly incarcerated individuals can face challenges in obtaining a state ID with just their prison documents, but a pilot program with the Department of Corrections that he advocated for makes the process easier.
Shkreli said she wants to make it possible for Michigan drivers to add their licenses to digital wallets on iOS and Android devices.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said when Apple announced the feature in 2021 that she wanted Michigan to be among the first states to enroll. So far, 20 states and Puerto Rico have some form of digital ID available. Michigan legislators introduced a bill in 2023 to allow digital state IDs, but it stalled in the Legislature.
Byrum said kiosks allowing some business to be conducted without ever stepping foot in a branch office should be expanded, noting that some areas of the state do not have Kroger or Meijer locations nearby, making it just as inconvenient to find a kiosk as it would be to go to the branch office.
Gilchrist said the secretary of state’s customer service role makes the branch offices throughout the state “the front door to people’s interactions with state government.”
“Too many times when people are interacting with state government, they’re doing so at a time when they need something, and they need it fast. It gets frustrating when it doesn’t happen, or it’s not easy, or it’s cumbersome,” Gilchrist said. “It’s imperative that we make sure that is not the experience people have. Because people who lose trust in government processes are ones who lose faith in democracy, and ones who check out from democratic processes and, ultimately, may end up less likely to vote.”

(Getty Images)I’ve been watching with considerable interest as hundreds of Broken Arrow residents fight against a plan that would rezone a parcel of agricultural land to make way for a proposed mosque and retail development in their community.
It’s not the project itself that’s captured my interest. It’s the fact that this is the second such high profile fight pitting developers against residents in just a few months.
Late last year, Edmond residents were fighting against a developer who wanted to build a Walmart on a piece of undeveloped land in the north part of the city. The Walmart developer plans to erect a neighborhood market on a busy two-lane road that already suffers from traffic congestion and flooding. The store would sit alarmingly close to an existing housing development and is not far from a major natural gas junction.
It was during that Edmond fight that I learned about Senate Bill 647, which would weaken a city’s ability to deny developments, neuter the input of residents and voters and empower developers to get their way regardless of whether their project is welcome or a good fit.
The Republican-led measure was one of those bills that flew under the radar during the 2025 session, but alarmingly cleared both legislative chambers. It would have made it to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s desk but for the fact that, thankfully, the House and the Senate could not agree on the final language.
Insultingly, the measure contains a clause that “decisions on land use application shall not be based solely upon the presence, numbers or magnitude of opposition or protests in the absence of objective and relevant facts.”
It seeks to deem municipal zoning decisions as a done deal unless the challenging party proves the ordinance lacks a substantial relation to public health, safety or general welfare or if a zoning decision “constitutes an unreasonable, arbitrary exercise of police power.”
And it would require planning commissions and governing boards to approve plats as long as they’re in compliance with a city’s subdivision regulations. Compliance with a city’s comprehensive development plan would not be required for approval under the measure.
Had this been law, the concerns of residents in both cities and of those elsewhere across the state fighting developers probably wouldn’t have mattered. The developers probably would have won the day.
Residents at the Broken Arrow City Council meeting last week expressed reasonable concerns about increased traffic congestion, and the impact of the development on storm water runoff and septic tanks if a 42,000-square-foot Islamic center and a 20,000-square-foot retail space and a parking lot were built.
The Tulsa World reported that last month much of the opposition initially “was voiced in anti-Islamic terms,” but in recent days those who opposed the development and city leaders have shifted the conversation to more practical issues.
Edmond residents, meanwhile, who live in the area told their planning and zoning commission and city council that even though the area is technically zoned commercial, they didn’t believe the acreage and infrastructure at the corner of Coltrane and Covell can support a 43,000-square-foot development on 9.7 acres.
And as someone who drives through that congested Edmond intersection, who has sat in 40-car traffic jams at the traffic light, and who has witnessed a semi-truck get stuck trying to make a turn onto a two-lane road, they’re probably right.
The problem is under the proposed law they’d have to prove that objectively. Their lived experiences wouldn’t count. And how does a resident objectively prove traffic congestion without a traffic counter or cooperation from a city?
And how can someone objectively prove that storm water won’t drain in an undeveloped flood plane without a parking lot there?
The city councils in both cities ultimately rejected the developers’ plans. In Edmond, Walmart’s developer is appealing. The Islamic Society of Tulsa, which is backing the mosque, is also expected to appeal.
Watching both fights play out, I’ve learned there is a lot of gray area when it comes to planning, zoning and platting. There is subjectivity to approving plats and developers’ plans. Local residents don’t pay attention to platting and zoning until the time comes to develop property.
Other times, designations no longer fit the land as communities evolve or grow or our environment or weather patterns change. Bureaucracy can be slow, and it takes time for things to catch up. And just because land is zoned or platted a certain way doesn’t mean every sort of business or development belongs there.
Until last session, lawmakers have been smart enough to realize that, and they’ve given municipalities broader discretion to act in the best interests of their residents and communities. 
To even consider passing a law that indicates city leaders are making decisions solely on the size of crowds or opposition is insulting not only to those officials, but also the voters who elect them. It also indicates that our legislators don’t understand how this works.
And it’s astounding that lawmakers are seemingly trying to strip their constituents’ rights at the expense of developers, who do have a lot of lobbying power at our Capitol.
Last I checked Republicans were supposed to champion local control and believed that residents generally know what’s best for their local communities.
I don’t know if we’ll see this bill — or a similar iteration — rise from the dead when lawmakers reconvene in February. But heaven help us all if we do. 
Because it will signal the death knell to citizen input in proposed developments impacting our families and the rise in power of developers. And it will harm everyone’s ability to work together to make their communities better.

Now a bipartisan group of Nebraska state senators wants to write into law that new members of the officially nonpartisan Legislature take a 20-question civics test — and publicly post the scores.
A passing grade would not be required, and individual answers would remain confidential. But the “raw scores” would be listed on the Legislature’s official website and also on the lawmaker’s official public biography.
Results would not affect the ability of any lawmaker to hold or continue to serve in a public role, according to Legislative Bill 1066, which should not “be construed to add to or alter the qualifications for office established in the Constitution of Nebraska.”

The introducer of LB 1066, State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, said the effort was inspired by conservative and progressive constituents alike who have questioned the level of understanding and appreciation lawmakers have of U.S. government and responsibility to steward institutions that protect them.
With the country’s 250th birthday approaching, Fredrickson thought it was a good time for the civics test law. The measure is co-sponsored by lawmakers from diverse political backgrounds: State Sens. Stan Clouse of Kearney, Tanya Storer of Whitman and Paul Strommen of Sidney are Republicans; State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha is a progressive independent. Fredrickson is a Democrat.
“We have a very serious job,” Fredrickson said of all 49 state senators. “We create, we amend, and we repeal laws. So ensuring that folks who are in that position are continually educating themselves on our responsibility to uphold the Constitution … felt like an important step to take.”
Fredrickson said he has at times heard colleagues say things like, “Well the governor is the boss.” He recalled a couple of recent situations when the Legislature voted to approve a bill then, following the governor’s veto, certain senators flipped their votes and buried the proposal.

One such occasion came last year when, despite three consecutive bipartisan votes to lift a lifetime ban on public food aid for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies, the Legislature did an about face. The only change was Gov. Jim Pillen’s veto.
That prompted Fredrickson’s debate remark: “We were elected to lead, not to follow, and certainly not to flinch.”
He reminded colleagues that the Legislature is a separate and coequal branch of government to the executive and judicial arms. Such occasions gave rise to his thought: “How do we refresh our memories of the basic principles of how our country works and how our role as legislators should be exercised.”
Storer said she was encouraged to back a bill she believes should get universal support.
She said that while lawmakers come to the Legislature with different experiences, political backgrounds and home districts that represent rural, urban and suburban neighborhoods, a common ground should be a foundational grasp and appreciation of civics and the country’s road to democracy.

“It’s not a partisan issue. It’s an American issue,” she said. “We don’t know where we’re going if we don’t know where we’ve come from, right?”
Admittedly, not everybody loves test-taking, Storer said. She chuckled and said her palms even got a bit sweaty thinking about the process, though not to the point of doubting its value. She said public posting of raw scores might be a deterrent for some, but underscored that a failed grade won’t get anyone removed from office.
“If anything, it would prompt us all to be more intentional about studying civics and basic principles of government,” Storer said.
Fredrickson said he is unaware of any past efforts to require a civics test of Nebraska lawmakers, and believes the law would be a first for a state. A public hearing will be scheduled for LB 1066. 
Exam questions could be pulled from the civics portion of the test administered to naturalization candidates by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or an equivalent designed by the Nebraska Secretary of State or Nebraska Department of Education.
The Clerk of the Legislature would provide the test, within 90 days of a state senator taking office, that would include 20 randomly selected questions about U.S. history and civics. A lawmaker who doesn’t reach a passing score would be invited, not required, to attend a voluntary civic literacy seminar conducted by the Nebraska State Historical Society or Legislative Research Office.

For Nebraska students, answering questions from the civics portion of the federal citizenship and naturalization test is one of three options Nebraska school boards have to fulfill the state legal requirement aimed at ensuring students are prepared “to be competent and responsible citizens who engage in public debate knowledgeably and in a civil manner.” Other suggested options for students include a project on an important American figure or attendance at a public meeting. 



 How’s your grasp of civics?

Test your own civics knowledge with some questions from the U.S. citizenship and naturalization test. During that exam, a federal officer asks an applicant up to 10 questions from a list of 100. Six correct answers are needed to pass. 

What does the Constitution do? 
What is the economic system in the U.S.?
To whom does the Constitution grant the power to declare war?

Martin Luther King Jr. delivers a speech to a crowd of approximately 7,000 people on May 17, 1967, at UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza in Berkeley, California. (Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of workingAmericans first, our leaders in Congress and the WhiteHouse have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5 percent — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4 percent. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business
Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses. As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households. The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

Phil Murphy signed the family leave expansion bill just days before he leaves office after two terms as governor. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill over the weekend that will expand family leave benefits to workers at smaller companies, just days before he leaves office after two terms.
Murphy, a Democrat, called the legislation “historic.” It allows workers at firms with as few as 15 employees to take job-protected paid family leave, down from 30 workers in the state’s prior family leave law.
“By amending the eligibility requirements for job-protected leave, we are ensuring newer employees and employees of small businesses are not excluded from the protections of the New Jersey Family Leave Act. Now, employees will not have to work as long before being able to utilize their leave with the assurance that they can return to their job once the leave concludes,” he said.
Murphy leaves office at noon on Tuesday when his successor, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), becomes governor.
As new legislative session begins, some major bills go back to starting line

Existing New Jersey law permits workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to bond with new children or care for a sick or injured loved one. Workers on family leave can earn up to 85% of their weekly pay, to a cap of $1,119 in 2026.
To be eligible under current law, an employee must have worked at a given employer for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,000 hours in the preceding 12 months. The bill Murphy signed cuts those qualifications in half, requiring workers to be with their employer for at least six months and slashing the hours requirement to 500.
Bill sponsor Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) called the legislation “good for the workforce, good for babies and families, and good for our state as a whole.”
“By reducing the amount of time someone has to be on the job before becoming eligible for family leave, this legislation recognizes the realities of today’s workforce and makes sure more parents can care for and bond with their newborn without fearing they’ll lose their job. No one should be penalized for needing time to care, and this bill helps make sure the vast majority of workers never will,” he said.
Existing law bars employers from retaliating against workers for using family leave benefits. The legislation Murphy signed says workers are entitled to be restored to their previous position or one with equivalent pay, benefits, and seniority upon returning from family leave. It also explicitly allows workers to use family leave, temporary disability benefits, and earned sick leave in the order of their choosing.
Business groups had opposed the bill, warning that expanding family leave eligibility could make New Jersey small businesses less competitive.

Idaho’s $14 million in federal funds — approved by the Legislature in 2025 as an addition to the Idaho Child Care Program — hadn’t even been spent yet, because the state didn’t dole out the money to providers, Charron wrote in a Jan. 12 letter. But she told the lawmakers that the agency “shares your unwavering commitment to rooting out any potential fraud, waste, and abuse in all public programs (that the agency) administers.”
Idaho’s efforts come weeks after a conservative social media influencer made viral fraud allegations about Minnesota’s child care programs. The video’s claims — which spurred the Trump administration to crack down on child care funding — were largely misleading, according to a fact check by national news outlet The 19th. 
Fraud hasn’t recently been alleged in Idaho’s program, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Welfare said. And Idaho’s governor defended the state’s track record of running public assistance programs.

 After Idaho didn’t promise to pause spending, Idaho lawmaker mulls next steps

Idaho lawmakers ask state to freeze child care grants program

But the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare director’s letter didn’t explicitly say if the state would do what the lawmakers asked: Freeze the new child care expansion funds until more safeguards are in place. It also came two days after a deadline the lawmakers had requested.
Tanner, one of the lawmakers who asked for Idaho’s pause and who is the new co-chair of the Legislature’s powerful budget committee, said he didn’t feel like the agency fully addressed his concerns, and he’s mulling what comes next.
“We just want to make sure that any funds going out … that we are making sure that we have things in place to prevent fraud, as much as we possibly can,” he told the Sun in an interview Thursday. “We don’t want to be a Minnesota. We do not want to be any other state. We want to make sure that  we learn from other people’s mistakes, and make sure that we have things in place that prevent that.”
Asked if the Department of Health and Welfare would comply with the lawmakers request, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement Wednesday that the agency is “working with the Governor’s office to determine the next steps.”
 Governor says Idaho has strong track record of running public assistance programs

Early this month Gov. Brad Little called what’s happening in Minnesota “abominable.” But asked about concerns about Idaho’s program to-be, Little touted Idaho’s management of public assistance programs.
“I’m always concerned about fraud. I mean, but if you look at our programs, you look at SNAP, you look at Medicaid, you look at all the programs … Idaho’s compliance rates are one of the highest,” Little told reporters on Jan. 8.

Last week, McWhorter told the Sun there had not been complaints about fraud, waste or abuse in Idaho’s program to expand child care availability. But he said in the coming months, the agency is planning unannounced visits to child care facilities and other investigative actions. 
Tanner said he isn’t sure if there is fraud in Idaho’s program.
“I really don’t know,” he said. “I mean, I’ve not seen blatant fraud, but I think there’s always question(s), because there is a system — there was a gaming system that was going on — that was not necessarily being looked at from, I would say, pretty much most states, and I think that’s that’s something to go back and revisit and relook at.”
 What grant oversight work is the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare planning?

In her letter to Tanner and Lenney, Charron pledged to shore up more safeguards — including to review all past providers in the program within the next two months to ensure that additional funding does “meet our rigorous standards of compliance.”
 
But in more than 1,000 random audits of a quarter of the state’s providers, only 45 resulted in providers being removed from the program, or having their licenses suspended or revoked, Charron wrote.
“Safeguarding taxpayer dollars that support working families and vulnerable children is critical and an issue of public confidence we do not take lightly,” Charron said in a written statement included in a news release last week. “Every effort devoted to proactive prevention and detection efforts saves in recovery costs, ensures program integrity, and preserves vital services for those who truly need them. Any bad actors will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Prosecutor pushes back on defense assertion that state law allows the capture, hunting and destruction of predatory animals in ""any manner whatsoever.""
The post Wolf torment defendant Cody Roberts wants animal cruelty case tossed appeared first on WyoFile .","Cody Roberts has doubled down on his push to have his felony animal cruelty case dismissed.
Robert Piper, Roberts’ attorney, on Tuesday filed a second motion arguing that Roberts’ case should be tossed. Sublette County Prosecutor Clayton Melinkovich’s case rests on ignoring the plain language of a state law allowing wildlife to be hunted, captured, killed or destroyed “in any manner not otherwise prohibited by law,” he said.
The case relies on an “unconstitutionally broad reading” of the law, Piper said.
In February 2024, Roberts captured a wolf and brought it into the Green River Bar in Daniel on a leash and with its mouth duct-taped. The incident ignited global outrage. In the aftermath, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department cited Roberts for illegally possessing the wolf, and issued him a $250 fine, but declined to pursue further charges. In August, Melinkovich convened a grand jury, which indicted Roberts for felony animal cruelty.
Roberts has pleaded not guilty.
Piper’s motion filed this week was the third in a back-and-forth between Piper and Melinkovich over the legitimacy of the case. Piper filed a motion to dismiss in mid-December, arguing that state statute creates a “blanket license” to capture, hunt and destroy predatory animals in “any manner whatsoever.”
Melinkovich responded in late December, writing that the statute in question is only relevant to how animals can be captured and killed. The case, however, is not about how the animal was captured or killed, but what happened to it in between, Melinkovich said.
In the warring motions, the attorneys have argued over the Wyoming Legislature’s intentions in drafting the statute.
Melinkovich argued that lawmakers obviously didn’t intend to permit wildlife to be treated in any way. That would permit torture and bestiality, which is “absurd” and not the intention, Melinkovich said.
In the most recent filing, Piper said the Legislature’s decision to pass a law last year prohibiting people from causing living wildlife, including predators, “undue suffering” demonstrates that was not the intent of the earlier statute.
A pretrial hearing to consider the motions is set for Jan. 28. The trial is set to begin on March 9.
Melinkovich also filed a rebuttal of his own this week, in response to filings by Piper seeking to exclude some evidence.
Piper asked Sweetwater County District Court Judge Richard Lavery to prohibit including as evidence of prior acts of wrongdoing, hearsay and expert testimony from Ken Mills, a Game and Fish large carnivore biologist. Piper said Mills would unscientifically analyze a video of the wolf and tell the jury what to think about it.
Melinkovich responded that he intended to follow the rules of the court vis-a-vis hearsay and prior acts of wrongdoing.
The state does not intend to “engage in prosecutorial misconduct,” Melinkovich said.
Mills’ testimony would use his specialized knowledge of wolves to help the jury make a determination about whether Roberts “maliciously allowed the undue suffering” of the wolf to continue, Melinkovich said. Mills will help determine whether the animal was suffering, Melinkovich said.

Legislators took a first crack at a measure that will establish major components of Wyoming’s $205M plans. Representatives of facilities like Riverton's new hospital are encouraged by proposed funding opportunities. 
The post Rural health care dollars buoy Wyoming hospitals, providers as lawmakers get on board appeared first on WyoFile .","RIVERTON—Clad in a hard hat and neon safety vest, Corte McGuffey walked across floors coated in drywall dust, pointing out what’s to come in this unfinished building. A radiology lab here, clinical exam rooms over there, a walk-up pharmacy near the back and on the second floor, hospital beds and two labor and delivery bays. 
McGuffey was leading a tour of Riverton’s new hospital, which is the result of a seven-year effort to fundraise, design, build and staff a community-owned health facility in this western Wyoming town of roughly 11,000. 
Construction broke ground in late 2024. Over the past year, a 70,000-square-foot building has risen on a plot of land on the north edge of town. Crews recently installed exterior walls and most of the windows. The hope is to finish construction by September, and begin accepting patients before year’s end. 
The hospital spawned from local displeasure with consolidation and loss of services under SageWest, which operates its own hospital in Riverton. It represents a rare area of growth in Wyoming’s health care landscape, which has experienced widening service gaps in recent years as hospitals and clinics struggle to retain workers and maintain financial stability. 
The Riverton Medical District Board still needs to complete construction, hire staff and implement billing and record systems — and would like to raise additional money. Once open, the facility will face financial realities that make hospital viability so challenging in Wyoming. Things like low volume and high fixed costs.
Overcoming those challenges may become more feasible for Riverton’s and other health care facilities now that Wyoming will receive $205 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Funds in 2026 — and up to $800 million beyond that over the consecutive five years.

As part of its plans to deploy the funds, Wyoming proposes to spend a big chunk on supporting hospitals. The Riverton Medical District Board pooled its own rural health recommendations with fellow Billings Clinic affiliates in Wyoming and submitted them to the state, and has been closely following the process. Though there are few details at this early stage about fund deployment, Riverton hospital officials see promise not only for their facility to benefit, but also the broader state health care network. 
“Wyoming has a real opportunity to use these funds, and hopefully not just a one-time shot, hopefully to create a way to use the money for a long period of time,” McGuffey, who chairs the Riverton Medical District board, said amid the din of construction. 
Rapidly unfolding 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The program will funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. 
The application and award process unfolded rapidly this fall. Wyoming Department of Health staff gathered input through stakeholder conferences and public meetings starting in September. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey. Staff prepared an 84-page application and submitted it in early November.
The application proposed an array of initiatives to bolster health care. Those include incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to boost the industry. There were also programs designed to promote healthy habits, expand technology like telehealth and bolster EMS services.
Wyoming applied for an initial budget of $200 million. When awards were announced Dec. 29, the state was given $5 million more than it requested and received the second-largest award per capita, behind Alaska. 
Now, the work begins. It will entail drafting contracts, hiring staff, crafting bills and gaining legislative approval. The vision is that initiatives will be available to an array of health care services, providers and programs. 
Staying inside the lines
On Thursday, the Joint Appropriations Committee considered a draft bill to establish the perpetuity investment fund, create an advisory panel and launch programs for implementing many of the state’s Rural Health proposals. 
Though many of Wyoming’s state lawmakers are small-government conservatives wary of growing agencies, appropriations members appeared to support the bill — a necessary step in receiving the Trump administration funds. 
One notable initiative not in the bill is the state-run insurance plan, which appropriations committee members previously frowned upon. 
Wyoming does anticipate some amount of flexibility to opt out of the application’s approved initiatives, Wyoming Health Department Director Stefan Johansson told the board. However, “adding programming to this effort is likely not allowable at the federal level.”
Anything outside of the approved purposes in the application risks clawback from the federal government, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. 
“I don’t want it to be a situation where we color outside the lines, to the point where we find ourselves without lines and maybe without a fund,” said Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland.

The bill will play a key role in the rollout of the rural health fund proposals.
“This is, in my view, a generational opportunity to make some very smart, conservative, but practical investments in our rural and frontier communities when it comes to their health and their health care,” Johansson said. “I think this is a very good opportunity for us to take full advantage of the Trump administration’s program in this area.”
The committee did not vote on the draft, which it tabled until February. 
Obstacles 
Back in Riverton, McGuffey reflected on nearly eight years of efforts, like feasibility studies and fundraising, to get to the current hospital construction phase.  
“The amount of work that goes into pulling something like this off is … crazy,” he said. 
That included securing a $37.1 million USDA Rural Development loan, $15 million in federal grant funding facilitated by the state and the 4-acre building site. The district is partnering with the Billings Clinic to be an affiliate of the larger health care company, which it hopes will help leverage resources.
“We worked for so long just looking at a lot,” McGuffey said from a second-floor balcony in the new building. “To see [the building] actually go up is really exciting.”
The hospital will provide more than 100 local jobs and present the kind of essential health care that draws families to communities, Riverton Medical District Board members say. That will include, eventually, limited labor and delivery — a service that SageWest Riverton and several other state hospitals have closed down in recent years.

Once the doors open, the facility will have to navigate the unique challenges of operating a hospital in the largely frontier state. 
The infusion of federal funds and Wyoming’s plan will help overcome those challenges, Gov. Mark Gordon said during a press conference last week. 
“The bottom line is, this program will protect hospitals, strengthen emergency care, grow our rural health care workforce and bring care closer to home,” Gordon said. 
The governor also acknowledged the Legislature’s role in securing the federal funds. 
“I think we have the opportunity here with the Legislature to be able to really move forward in a way that’s going to help their constituents,” Gordon said. “I think all of Wyoming is looking very carefully at what this plan means.”

Wisdom from a dying woman inspired guest columnist John Freeman to rethink patriotism in the new year. 
The post Healing the political virus infecting our state and local communities appeared first on WyoFile .","Death is clarifying, not just for the dying, but for the living. As a hospice volunteer, I have the privilege of spending time with dying patients. Recently, I asked a patient, ‘Mabel,’ for her thoughts on how we might overcome the nastiness, anger and cruelty that has infected our beloved state and local communities.    

Opinion

Mabel began by telling me about her late husband, a World War II veteran. Missing today, she suggested, is the kind of patriotism rooted in America’s core value of liberty and justice for all, and that all are created equal. These were shared values that made the American experiment so exceptional, the American people so optimistic and the United States the envy of the world.   
After the war, thanks to the GI Bill, Mabel’s husband and millions of other veterans were able to pursue and pay for ongoing education, get help obtaining jobs, purchase starter homes, and invest in stocks, bonds and other assets. Because the U.S. was still segregated when the GI Bill became law, many Black veterans were excluded. For the veterans who did access the benefits, this led to historic prosperity — today’s baby boomers are the wealthiest generation in history.  
But we of the postwar era have taken for granted what the veterans of a prior generation bequeathed to us. Over the past 80 years, liberty and justice for all has morphed into liberty and justice for a few. 
Mabel minced no words. We who proudly called ourselves liberals — teachers in schools and colleges, policy experts in think-tanks and government — have failed to recognize that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is incompatible with liberty and justice for all. 
How right she is. The possibility of America isn’t just a political framework; it’s rooted in ideals that our nation’s founders, most wealthy landowners and slaveholders themselves, bravely enshrined despite the reality of their time. It isn’t surprising that, without exception, the founders were men of faith, trusting in each other and in something far greater than themselves. Whether religious or not, they held a shared belief in the dignity and goodness of humankind “created in God’s image.”  
But our better angels retreat amidst fear, insecurity and isolation, and that is where we are today. In a world of rapid change, misinformation and rampant loneliness, we are forgetting the moral underpinning of who we are and the very goodness that makes us human. 
Wyoming has yet to build immunity to this virus. From her hospital bed, Mabel remains a keen observer of current events. She acknowledges that with our low population, the ease of getting elected and our pathological dislike of government, Wyoming is an ideal place for agents of the wealthy and powerful to influence more than state and local government, but national politics as well. We are willing pawns in the scheme.
And so the infection spreads. Fear mongers capitalize on the legitimate grievances of hardworking, values-driven Wyomingites to advance their own agendas, leaving those furthest from opportunity even further behind.  
Sounds too simple, but it is not. It all might cast a dark shadow on the start of 2026, were it not for Mabel’s additional wisdom: The remedy is one another. The virus spreads in the distance between us, in the unkindness, distrust and nastiness that advance the interests of the powerful few. Likewise, we each have power to prioritize our neighbors over news headlines, to make patriotism about liberty and justice for all, to find ourselves in service of others and the urgent needs of our nation. In sum, we can commit this year to being human in all our goodness. We can build better communities and a better state by taking to heart the wisdom of a dying woman.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)LINCOLN — A new bill would require Nebraska’s K-12 schools to teach lessons about the ills of communism. 
Legislative Bill 1024 from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenville would require each Nebraska school district, starting next school year, to make time to teach the history of communism — worldwide and in the U.S. 
The proposed curriculum would range from covering what the bill describes as “the increasing threat of communism in the United States and its allies through the 20th century” to “mass killings that have occurred under communist regimes.” 
Similar state laws have passed in Florida and Texas. Florida Republican U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar has a federal bill that passed the U.S. House that would require the creation of a civics education program to teach high schoolers nationwide about “the dangers of communism.” 
“There’s a lot of students, especially in college, and kids that are out of the K-12 school system, who seem to support socialism and even communism nowadays,” Murman said. “I think we just have to be diligent that the risks and dangers, bad things that happen under communism, are taught in our schools.”

Murman, who chairs the Legislature’s Education Committee, said he hasn’t decided whether the bill will be a priority for the committee during the short session. The bill was cosponsored by five of his fellow Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature: State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Loren Lippincott of Central City, ​​State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings and State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman.

The proposal also would require students to take a written test “identical to the entire civics portion” of the U.S. citizenship test before completing eighth grade and before graduating from high school.
Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, the biggest teachers union in the state, said the union is “obviously opposed.” He noted that the subject was already required to be covered.
“These aren’t good standards,” Royers told the Examiner. “This isn’t the right way to teach history.” 
Royers also said the way the proposal is written steps on the toes of local boards of education. He said Murman should “let teachers write the social studies standards.”
Murman said lawmakers have the authority to offer guidance on education, and he wanted legal assurance that it would be taught.

Gov. Brad Little in his budget proposal called for $22 million in cuts to Medicaid, offering options for service cuts, such as dental coverage and home-and-community-based care for people with disabilities, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. Little also included in his budget about $23 million in reductions to Medicaid through an extension of the 4% doctor reimbursement cuts first approved in August in response to the projected state budget shortfall. 
JFAC Co-Chair Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said that the budget committee will hear from the chairs of the House and Senate Health and Welfare committees, which hold public hearings on bills. Budget bills are not brought through those committees. 
Rep. Elaine Price, R-Coeur d’Alene, recommended “reaching out to your constituents, reading those emails. Responding to those emails will get you that picture as well.”
“That’s part of our job as a Legislature, we’re supposed to be representing our constituents,” Price said, “and if we’re not reaching out to them and reading their emails, then we’re not getting that information.” 
A budget hearing in JFAC for the Division of Medicaid is scheduled for Jan. 22, and the budget will be set later in the session.

The grizzly bear, which is listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act, was shot in late October north of Perkins Lake in Boundary County, near the Idaho-Montana border, state and federal officials said. 
On Jan. 13, officials with the Center for Biological Diversity announced they are increasing the financial reward they are offering to $7,300, which brings the total reward up to $15,000. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Idaho’s Citizens Against Poaching previously announced they are offering rewards for information that leads to the arrest and conviction for the illegal killing. 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff received a mortality signal from the electronic collar the grizzly bear was wearing on Oct. 28. Following an investigation with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, officials determined that the bear was not a threat to the shooter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a press release issued Dec. 10.
In a separate press release issued Jan. 13, officials with the Center for Biological Diversity said the female grizzly that was killed was from the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem, which they described as the most imperiled grizzly bear population in the continental United States.
The conservation organization said that the death of even one or two female grizzly bears could be devastating for a recovering bear population. 
“This was a tragic, completely preventable loss and the consequences to grizzly recovery are enormous,” Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a written statement. “In a population this small and fragile, every female is critical to survival. Losing even one can tip the balance toward the decline of the entire population. We’re increasing the reward because the person responsible for killing this bear needs to be held accountable.”

Among long corridors where beauty supply stores sit beside corner stores, where barbershops outlast boarded-up buildings, where potholes crowd the pavement and front-porch conversations stretch past sundown. These are not symbolic roads. They are places where Black life continues, day after day, despite decades of disinvestment, living in the shadow of a name that promised justice long before cities were ready to deliver it.
In Tennessee, King’s legacy is etched into the geography of the state itself. His name appears on green street signs and stretches of asphalt that carry daily life: commuters heading to work, children walking to school, and churches opening their doors on Sunday mornings.
But those streets did not come easily.
The fight to name roads after King in the Volunteer state unfolded over decades, shaped by local politics, racial resistance and a persistent question about where, and how, Black history is allowed to exist in public space: Is naming a street after King an act of honor, or a substitute for the economic and political investment his work demanded?
There are now more than 1,000 streets named for King; globally, including at least 955 in the United States, according to University of Tennessee geographer Derek Alderman, whose extensive research over the last two decades has examined the geography of King streets nationwide. Those streets span 41 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, many emerging after King’s assassination in 1968 and again following the establishment of the federal holiday in 1983.

Tennessee has at least 17 streets bearing King’s name, stretching across the state’s largest cities and extending into smaller rural communities, such as Bolivar, New Market and Rockwood, sometimes no more than narrow back roads, absent from Google Maps and quietly maintained by residents determined to ensure King’s name remains visible.
“There’s been a fairly typical pattern across the United States,” Alderman said. “None of this happens without Black activism. Black communities, Black clergy, and those who have pushed very hard to get King’s name on a prominent road, one that doesn’t just serve the Black community, but transcends it.”
What often results, he said, is a compromise shaped by resistance: King’s name confined to a short stretch of roadway, frequently within historically Black neighborhoods, a form of symbolic recognition that mirrors the very segregation King spent his life challenging.
“That’s what makes street naming so controversial,” Alderman said. “It’s not really a question of whether we will remember Dr. King. It’s a question of where we will remember him. Where we choose to remember King plays a major role in shaping the meaning of that commemoration.”
 Unfinished symbols and the cost of commemoration

For all their visibility, Martin Luther King, Jr. streets carry a deep contradiction. They are meant to honor a man who preached economic justice and structural change, yet many of the corridors that bear his name remain sites of concentrated poverty and neglect.
That pattern, Alderman said, is not accidental.
“MLK streets are often placed in historically Black neighborhoods that have already experienced redlining, urban renewal and disinvestment,” he said. “So what you get is this uncomfortable reality where we symbolically honor Dr. King, but materially fail to address the inequalities that his work was fundamentally about.”
Research has repeatedly shown that the symbolism of MLK street-naming is rarely matched by economic investment. A 2020 study found that areas surrounding MLK-named streets are, on average, more segregated and significantly poorer than the national norm, with property values that consistently lag behind the rest of their cities. In majority-Black neighborhoods, homes are routinely appraised 20 to 23%lower than comparable properties in white neighborhoods, limiting wealth-building while increasing financial burden. Property values shape everyday life, influencing whether families can build wealth, access credit, fund public schools and pass stability to the next generation.










None of this happens without Black activism. Black communities, Black clergy, and those who have pushed very hard to get King’s name on a prominent road, one that doesn’t just serve the Black community, but transcends it.


– Derek Alderman, Ph.D., University of Tennessee 


On Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue in East Knoxville, longtime business owner Tanika Harper said the street’s name has always carried weight but not protection. Her family, through the generations, has held on to property on the road for decades, and she says it’s intentional.
“I’m proud to be on MLK, ” Harper said, speaking of the commercial building space her father originally operated his long standing lawncare company out for decades. “We’ve always found ways to thrive. I want to see this become a corridor that truly reflects Dr. King’s vision, where people can live, work, heal and build generational wealth. The potential is here. What’s needed now is the will to invest in people, not just property.”
Alderman argues that street naming should be understood not as a finish line, but as a starting point, one that forces cities to confront whether they are willing to back symbolism with policy, resources, and sustained investment, particularly at a moment when public commitments to racial equity and diversity initiatives are being openly dismantled.
“The name should come with a commitment,” Alderman said. “Otherwise, it becomes a reminder of what cities are willing to say, and what they’re unwilling to do.”
 Nashville: Putting King in the path of power

Nashville’s connection to King predates nearly every other Tennessee city. Long before street signs bore his name, the city served as a proving ground for the modern civil rights movement. In 1960, Black college students launched sit-ins that dismantled segregation at downtown lunch counters, drawing King to the city that spring, where he praised Nashville’s campaign as among the most disciplined in the South.
Yet despite that legacy, Nashville waited nearly six decades to place King’s name on a street tied to political power.

That changed in 2018, when the Metro Council approved renaming a portion of Charlotte Avenue, a major corridor adjacent to the Tennessee State Capitol, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. The decision came during the 50th anniversary year of King’s assassination, sharpening questions of how, and where, his legacy should be honored.
The legislation was led by then Metro Councilmember Sharon Hurt, a Memphis native who said the idea had stayed with her long before she held public office.
“I had seen Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevards all over the country,” Hurt said. “And typically, those streets reside in the African American community. Considering the contributions he made and how he brought so many people together, I felt his legacy deserved recognition beyond that.”
Once elected, Hurt said she became intentional not just about whether King should be honored, but where.
“I find it poetic justice that he was assassinated in the state of Tennessee,” she said. “With the Capitol on Charlotte Avenue, even naming a portion of that street mattered. I wanted something that could actually succeed.”
As she researched the corridor’s past, Hurt uncovered deeper layers of meaning. Charlotte Avenue was once Cedar Street, an area tied to Black residency, the slave trade and even the construction of the Capitol itself.
“There was an African American man who fell into a hole during the building of the state capitol and was never recovered,” Hurt said. “He’s actually buried there. All of that history is part of that street.”
The ordinance moved swiftly and was signed on April 4, 2018, the anniversary of King’s death.
“It was probably one of the most significant pieces of legislation that I passed,” Hurt said. “I’m very proud of it.”
Still, she is clear-eyed about what symbolism alone can and cannot do.
“A lot of what cities do around civil rights is performative,” Hurt said. “There’s no real equity if you’re not addressing the economic divide, the lack of investment in Black businesses, and the systems that still disadvantage Black communities.”
 Memphis: Still reckoning with the mountaintop

If Nashville’s debate centered on proximity to power, Memphis’s struggle was shaped by its grief.
In 1968, King came to Memphis to stand with striking sanitation workers demanding dignity, fair wages, and recognition of their humanity. On April 3, he delivered his final public address, the “Mountaintop” speech, at Mason Temple. He was assassinated the following day at the Lorraine Motel.
Few cities are as permanently linked to King’s final days as Memphis, a reality that weighed heavily on former City Councilmember Berlin Boyd.
“Being in Memphis, the city where Dr. King was assassinated, I was appalled that there were over 900 cities across the country with streets honoring his legacy, but here, where he lost his life, we didn’t have one,” Boyd said.
The delay was not for lack of effort. As early as the 1970s, Rev. James Netters pushed Memphis leaders to rename a street for King in an attempt that failed.
In 2012, Boyd introduced legislation to rename a downtown stretch of Linden Avenue as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. The location was deliberate.
“You’re talking about Clayborn Temple, the sanitation workers’ march toward City Hall, and then his assassination at the Lorraine Motel,” Boyd said. “That’s the significance behind Linden Avenue.”
For Boyd, the decades-long delay reflected Memphis’s complicated relationship with its past.

“When something is painful, people tend to brush it under the rug and think it will go away,” he said. “But nobody ever really stopped to say, ‘Let’s honor him here because this is where it happened.’”
Unlike many MLK corridors nationwide, Linden Avenue now sits amid visible investment. Boyd pointed to redevelopment in the downtown core as evidence that the street may finally begin to reflect King’s legacy.
“You see economic growth in the area where we placed our street,” Boyd said. “But just naming a street after Dr. King doesn’t define what he stood for. There’s still a lot of work that needs to be done.”
 Chattanooga: From the big nine to the river

Chattanooga became one of Tennessee’s earliest testing grounds for King street-naming, not only because of when it happened, but because of where city leaders initially tried to draw the line.
“It was one of the first cases I ever encountered,” Alderman said. “A colleague sent me newspaper clippings years ago, and what struck me was that this was a city where activists actually pulled this off politically. They started the process before the King holiday was even established. That’s a real testament to Chattanooga’s traditions of protest and moral clarity.”
In the years following King’s assassination, Black ministers and community leaders pushed to rename Ninth Street, a historically Black commercial corridor known as “The Big Nine.” Once a thriving hub of Black-owned businesses, music, and nightlife, the street’s decline mirrored broader patterns of segregation, urban renewal, and disinvestment.










9th Street was where African Americans were. But the rest of Martin Luther King Boulevard runs to the river, right into prime downtown real estate. And they were very vocal about not wanting to name that portion.


– Rev, William Terry Wood


In 1981, the Chattanooga City Commission initially rejected the proposal, signaling a willingness to rename only East Ninth Street, the portion running through the historically Black neighborhood, while leaving West Ninth, which extended into downtown and prime commercial real estate, untouched.
“Typically, streets are easy to name because they’re already in the Black community,” said Rev.  William Terry Ladd, whose church sits merely blocks away. “That’s usually where the compromise happens.”
Organizers refused to accept it.
“9th Street was where African Americans were. But the rest of Martin Luther King Boulevard runs to the river, right into prime downtown real estate. And they were very vocal about not wanting to name that portion,” Ladd said.
Instead, Black clergy mobilized. In April 1981, hundreds of residents marched up and down Ninth Street, taping bumper stickers reading “Martin Luther King” over existing street signs, symbolically renaming the corridor themselves.
“They unofficially, but defiantly, renamed the street,” said Alderman. “They were repeating the tactics of the civil rights movement to make a claim about public space.”
Ladd said he was not surprised Chattanooga moved early.
“You had pastors who weren’t originally from Chattanooga,” he said. “Many of them went to places like Morehouse (College). They were exposed to a broader theology of justice.”
Later that year, the City Commission reversed course, officially renaming all of Ninth Street as Martin Luther King Boulevard.
“Location shapes meaning,” Alderman said. “And Chattanooga understood that early.”

 Knoxville: A door-to-door commitment on East Vine

In Knoxville, the fight unfolded a block at a time.
Charles Mathes, a longtime teacher at Austin High School, spent more than two decades advocating for East Vine and McCalla avenues to be renamed for King. But it was in 1988 that the effort took on new urgency.
That year, Charlene Lewis, Anna Dirl, and a small group of community leaders began walking door to door along East Vine Avenue, carrying a petition asking the city to rename the corridor for King. Lewis had been a sixth grader when King was assassinated, too young to fully grasp the moment but old enough to absorb the stories passed down through her family.
“As I heard these stories, it became more important to me to see us not just get along, but actually make a difference,” Lewis later recalled.
“We knew this wasn’t going to happen unless we did something,” said Rev. Harold Middlebrook of a campaign to name a Knoxville street for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (Photo: Screengrab, Knoxville.tn.gov.)
The effort was deeply grassroots, rooted in churches and neighborhood networks, and grounded in a shared understanding of Vine Avenue’s role as the heart of Black Knoxville before urban renewal hollowed it out.
Rev. Harold Middlebrook, a civil rights leader with personal ties to King through Morehouse College, helped lead what he called a commitment to “walking the walk.”
“We had to do more than sit around talking about it,” Middlebrook said. “We knew this wasn’t going to happen unless we did something.”
Not everyone welcomed the change. Lewis recalled at least one business owner using a racist slur in opposition to King’s name. Still, organizers pressed forward, delivering a petition with hundreds of signatures to city officials in January 1989.
That spring, Knoxville unanimously approved the request, creating a three-mile stretch of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue through East Knoxville.
For Middlebrook, the street would come to represent both progress and unfinished work.
“We had no idea at that time this would become part of history,” he said. “But we knew it mattered.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson made his name in the U.S. House as the “TikTok Congressman.” Now, he’s again staking out real estate at the technological forefront by heading up a nationwide task force on AI.
Stepping into the attorney general’s office in a year where Trump has sought to halt funding for everything from SNAP benefits to hurricane resilience grants to public school funding — all blocked after court battles that Jackson’s N.C. Department of Justice helped win — the former Congressman has come to view his office as a last line of defense for North Carolinians, both from the executive branch and from the threats of tomorrow.
To lead that defense, he has stressed a united front across party lines. “We are stronger when we speak with one voice,” he told dozens of attorneys general at the AI Task Force’s inaugural meeting last week.
But in his own state, Republicans are vying to strip him of one of his most potent tools: the ability to challenge Trump’s executive orders. The state Senate passed a bill last March that would require the General Assembly to authorize any such lawsuits, and the state House could do the same as it returns for the short session this month.
A term defined by Trump
More than anything else, Jackson’s first year in office has been defined by its lawsuits in defiance of the Trump administration.
Most notably, they won an October court battle that required the Trump administration to disburse $230 million in SNAP benefits to 1.4 million North Carolinians during last fall’s government shutdown. Other successful lawsuits challenged the revocation of more than $165 million in public education funding and $200 million in FEMA resilience dollars.

In Jackson’s view, his office has undertaken a principled approach on executive orders. Whereas some Democratic attorney generals have joined more than 60 lawsuits challenging the Trump administration, his office was only part of 18 in 2025.
“I use an objective formula for when I file a lawsuit against the administration or anyone else,” Jackson told NC Newsline. “Did someone break the law? Did it hurt the state? And can I prove both of those things?”
He has repeatedly stressed that North Carolina’s participation in these lawsuits is often key to recovering blocked funds through court injunctions that only apply to the parties to the lawsuit. Jackson announced in January that his office had recovered a total of $1.5 billion in stalled funds in 2025.
Jackson’s office declined to join some lawsuits against the Trump administration on more divisive issues, particularly around social issues. He did not join, for example, a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this month challenging an executive order mandating health and education institutions to abide by its definition of biological sex rather than gender identity.
In the view of Western Carolina University political scientist Chris Cooper, “it doesn’t appear that he’s just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.”
“I think he’s choosing cases where he thinks they have a chance to win, and that are going to present as, yes, partisan, but not hyperpartisan and not leaning into the negative,” Cooper said. “What he’s chosen to shoot, he’s been hitting.”
‘AG TikTok’
As the gears began moving on Senate Bill 58, the proposal that would strip Jackson of autonomy on challenges to executive orders, North Carolina Republicans issued a stark warning: Comply or else.
Asked by Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) in February what lawmakers would do if the Attorney General defies a new mandate on executive orders, Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson) suggested his role could be obliterated by repealing every power granted to it by state law.
“That way, the Attorney General is a feckless, empty shell of a position that has no authority to do anything,” Moffitt said.
Jackson has seemed to draw more ire from Republicans in a single year from Republican state lawmakers than his predecessor, Gov. Josh Stein, did in eight. But he’s also maintained a higher profile than any attorney general before him.
The TikToks that made him famous in Congress have continued — churning out 11 since he entered the attorney general’s office and sharing them across X, Bluesky, Reddit, and Instragram among other platforms.
While they have shifted from the political news dominating Congress to the lawsuits his office is taking on, they have at times retained an adversarial tone — directed at those his office is probing.
“Hi. This message is for WeChat,” he said in a video in May. “You are the second-largest texting platform in the world. You’re also heavily implicated in the money laundering that is tied to trafficking fentanyl.”
In a TikTok post on Jan. 15, 2026, Jackson touted his office’s win against the Trump administration over withheld FEMA funding. (Photo: TikTok)
“The pattern is clear, and your app is at the center of it. So I reached out to some other attorneys general in both parties and asked them to join me in confronting you,” he said. “You’ve known about your role in this for years, and now, so does everyone else.”
In another video, he addressed 37 companies he accused of facilitating robocalls by name. His office has sought to crack down on robocalls routed through North Carolina, winning a court order fining an AI voice provider $5 million for enabling them.
Opponents see moves like these as evidence of showmanship, rather than statesmanship. And it’s made him an outsized target for the animus of North Carolina Republicans.
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, in comments on social media in October, linked S58 to Jackson’s social media stardom directly — retweeting a radio host who derided Jackson as “AG TikTok.”
“This is exactly why Senate Republicans passed a bill to restrict Jeff Jackson from filing frivolous lawsuits against @POTUS,” Berger wrote. “The AG should be focused on working for the people of NC, not his social media followers.”
In his meetings with Republicans, Jackson has stressed that he wants to lead the state DOJ without partisanship.
“I think it deserves to be done in a nonpartisan way. That was how I campaigned,” Jackson said in an interview with NC Newsline. “I told people that this job has to be about the protection of people and not a political party, and that’s what I believe, that’s how I’ve tried to lead the office.”
But many in the state GOP see his broadsides against the Trump administration as evidence that his lawsuits are driven by political animus.
North Carolina Republican Party spokesman Matt Mercer said he sees little evidence of Jackson leading in a nonpartisan way. “He seems like he’s chosen to take on that partisan mantle versus trying to find areas of agreement with the Trump administration to enforce the law,” Mercer said.
“He’s not leading on these things. He’s signing on to what attorneys general in California and New York and Illinois are doing,” Mercer said. “He’s just falling in line.”
What Jackson touts as a signature achievement, recovering SNAP benefits for North Carolinians, Mercer argued was unnecessary. “Whose fault was it that we had the shutdown to begin with? It was Jeff Jackson’s party.”
‘Refreshingly bipartisan’
Despite battles with Republicans in his own state, Jackson is set to meet his biggest task of the coming year alongside a member of the GOP: Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, with whom he’s co-chairing the AI task force.
Launching the task force in November capped off a first year in office in which Jackson sought to position himself at the forefront of emerging technological challenges without regulatory answers at a time when, in his view, the federal government has abdicated responsibility.

The Trump administration has not only declined to issue regulations on AI, Jackson noted, but it has also sought to prevent the states from enacting their own. A December order from Trump’s White House promises to “check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation,” warning it will  revoke funding from states that do not comply.
“In my conversations with state legislators, there’s a general understanding that it would be bad if there was executive action that obsoleted all of the AI-related laws that the state has passed.” Jackson said in the interview. “So far, I will say, the response has been refreshingly bipartisan.”
The task force, which formed just a month before that order, has said its work will continue nonetheless.
“This is a perfect demonstration of why, frankly, the Tenth Amendment matters. States really are laboratories of democracy, and I think we’re faster, we are more nimble,” said Brown, the Utah Attorney General.
Jackson said he believes the risks of leaving AI up to Congress far exceed any downsides of a patchwork approach between the states.
“You really don’t want to end up in a situation where the state safeguards have been swept away and then the federal government does nothing, which is the most likely outcome here, as we saw with social media, as we’ve seen with the internet privacy, even for kids,” he said.“The most likely outcome for congressional response to massive new technology is to do virtually nothing.”
He said he hopes to focus on digital hazards like voice cloning, deep fakes, and AI robocalls. His office has also paid special focus to e-commerce. In 2025, his office made inquiries into leading “buy now, pay later” platforms as well as the online commerce giant Shopify. Jackson also called out fraudulent websites and Instagram ads that go to fake companies as sources of concern for his office in the interview with NC Newsline.
‘The leader of an institution’
Jackson’s stint as attorney general is his first time engaging with the public in an executive, rather than legislative, role. It’s also the first time North Carolinians have seen him attempt to shed partisan colors after years of viral TikToks condemning state Senate and U.S. House Republicans.
In a November leadership talk to Duke students and faculty named for former Gov. Terry Sanford, Jackson stressed the importance of reaching out to Republican attorneys general and state lawmakers. Those conversations, he said, are crucial in a time of stark polarization.
“If all I did was diminish some antagonism, that’s worth it. If I took someone from 100% opposed to 70%, y’all, that’s a win,” Jackson said at the Duke forum. “We get out of a lot of meetings being like, I don’t think he hates me. I think he dislikes me!”

His military background has informed his executive leadership style, leading him to seek out “mission-driven” team members and taking a person-to-person approach with as many members of his staff as possible. “You’ve got to give them a sense of who you are.”
That experience, he said, led him to post up at the NCDOJ entrance with his 10-year-old son on his first day and shake hands with every employee who walked in. He also joined a sunrise workout of basic law enforcement training cadets in Asheville, which he also saw as an effort to better understand criminal justice in the state at the ground level.
“What is Jeff Jackson really trying to do in all of this? Is he trying to position himself to run for U.S. Senate in 2028, or for governor in 2028 or 2032, or is he trying to do his job?” asked Mercer, the GOP spokesman.
For his part, Jackson said he does not wish to leave his current role any time soon. When asked in an interview with NC Newsline whether he was considering a Senate run, he said, “Nope.”
“This job is wonderful in what you can actually accomplish. And in that respect, it’s very different than serving in Congress,” he said. “As attorney general, you can make a big difference every day.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB124952-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

Every January, 100 people elected to the Colorado General Assembly gather in Denver for 120 days and make decisions that affect students and teachers in the classroom, university administrators trying to balance their budgets, and parents and students having to make tuition payments.
There are only two bills that legislators have to pass before they adjourn in May: a balanced budget and the school finance act. Both have profound implications for educational opportunity.
Lawmakers also tackle many more education issues, from school meals to school safety, from what students should learn in the classroom to workforce training.
But it can be hard for ordinary citizens to understand how ideas turn into laws.
To explain the lawmaking process and the opportunities for public input, Chalkbeat has prepared this guide to the legislative session, which start last week, and how you can get involved:
How a bill becomes a law
Think Schoolhouse Rock’s “I’m Just a Bill.”
Legislators get ideas for bills from a lot of places. A legislator might have a passion for a particular topic. The governor’s office or leaders of state agencies might request a policy change. An interest group or ordinary citizens might ask a lawmaker to help solve a problem.
Lawmakers work with bill drafters — nonpartisan legislative staff — to write a bill. Once a lawmaker introduces it, leaders in either the House or the Senate assign it to a committee, usually one with relevant expertise.
Most education bills go to a chamber’s education committee, but a bill on youth mental health might land first in the health committee, or one on police in schools might be heard by the judiciary committee.
A few committees — most infamously the State Affairs committees — are known as “kill” committees, where leadership can send controversial bills, especially those from the opposing parties, to ensure they don’t reach the floor.
A bill must win committee approval to proceed to the full House or Senate. Some bills might need to go through more than one committee.
Bills must get approved twice in the first chamber, before heading to the next chamber, where they go through the process all over again. Bills can be amended at any point in the process, and both chambers must sign off on the same final form of a bill for it to clear the legislature.
Then the governor decides whether to sign it into law.
Who has a vote on the Colorado education committees
For this session, the House Education Committee has 13 members — eight Democrats and five Republicans:

Chair Rep. Meghan Lukens, a Steamboat Springs Democrat
Vice Chair Rep. Matthew Martinez, a Monte Vista Democrat
Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat
Rep. Mary Bradfield, a Colorado Springs Republican
Rep. Ava Flanell, a Colorado Springs Republican
Rep. Lori Garcia Sander, an Eaton Republican
Rep. Lindsay Gilchrist, a Denver Democrat
Rep. Eliza Hamrick, a Centennial Democrat
Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Parker Republican
Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Fort Morgan Republican
Rep. Jacque Phillips, a Thornton Democrat
Rep. Katie Stewart, a Durango Democrat
Rep. Tammy Story, a Conifer Democrat

Find the committee schedule, documents, and live and archived audio of its meetings at the committee website.
The Senate Education Committee has seven members — four Democrats and three Republicans:

Chair Sen. Chris Kolker, a Centennial Democrat
Vice Chair Sen. Janice Marchman, a Loveland Democrat
Sen. Scott Bright, a Platteville Republican
Sen. Lisa Frizel, a Castle Rock Republican
Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat
Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, a Commerce City Democrat
Sen. Janice Rich, a Grand Junction Republican

Can you speak on a bill or submit testimony?
If you’re interested in having your perspective heard, there are a few ways to get involved.
You can speak on the bill in person or remotely, or submit a written statement to the committee. The sign-up process is not difficult. Just fill out this online form.
Speakers are generally limited to two to three minutes, so think about how to make your point quickly and clearly.
Want to know the schedule?
The full schedule of the House and Senate can typically be found online on the Colorado General Assembly website’s landing page.
The session schedule should be posted daily and gets updated as bills move through the process.
How to look up Colorado General Assembly bills
Looking for a bill online? Go to the Colorado General Assembly’s bill search page. There you can search by a bill number, the sponsor, or a topic.
When you click on a bill, you’ll see a summary of what the bill does, the full text of the bill, and other relevant information, such as a fiscal note that explains how much passing the law would cost the state. Often the description of a bill in the fiscal note is easier to understand than the bill language itself.
You can also search through tabs near the bottom of the page that include the bill’s history, when it’s scheduled to be heard again, any amendments, and a summary of the committee votes.
What’s the Joint Budget Committee, and why is it so important?
The six-member Joint Budget Committee is the most influential committee in the Colorado General Assembly. Why? Because it writes the budget that guides the state’s priorities. The committee members this year are four Democrats and two Republicans, with Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, as chair.
Yes, Gov. Jared Polis does submit a budget every November. And the governor’s priorities guide the Joint Budget Committee’s work. But the committee ultimately writes the budget that gets submitted to the General Assembly for approval.
Other lawmakers also have a chance to submit budget amendments that reflect their own spending priorities — but lawmakers need to pass a balanced budget, and the Joint Budget Committee will strip out amendments that endanger that goal.
The budget shapes every facet of state government, including K-12 and higher education spending.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The new year has barely begun, but the 2026 campaign season is well underway.
This month’s special primaries for a pair of legislative seats kicked off the year’s elections, and more key dates for voters are on the way.
Arkansas’ midterm elections include several high-profile races, including the reelection bids of Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton.
To prepare for the elections, voters will need to know the rules and how to register. Here’s what to know about voter registration in Arkansas:
 To vote in the March 3 primary, when do I need to be registered to vote? 
In Arkansas, voters need to register at least 30 days before the election they want to vote in. For the 2026 regular primary, that falls on Feb. 1, a Sunday, so potential voters will need to register by Feb. 2, according to Chris Powell, the director of public affairs for the Arkansas Secretary of State’s office.
Those who moved within the state and need to register in a new county must register at least four days prior to the election.
 Can I register to vote online? 
No.
According to the secretary of state’s website, those who wish to vote in Arkansas must fill out a paper registration form.
The form can be downloaded from the secretary of state’s website and printed, obtained from state revenue or motor vehicle offices, public libraries or local county clerks. Forms can be mailed to the secretary of state’s office, or completed in-person at a local county clerk’s office. If the form is mailed, it must be postmarked at least 30 days prior to the election.
 Who is eligible to vote? 
Any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who lives in Arkansas. If someone turns 18 before the next election, then they are also able to register. People convicted of a felony who have not had their sentence discharged or pardoned are not eligible to vote.
 What kind of documentation do I need to register? 
Arkansans will need to provide either their Arkansas drivers license, or, if they don’t have a drivers license, the last four digits of their social security number in order to register. However, on election day, Arkansans may use passports, identification issued by accredited postsecondary educational institutions, a military ID or other forms of photo ID if they wish. The full list, and more information about voter registration, can be found at the Arkansas Secretary of State’s website.

(COURTESY AKA LAMBDA PI OMEGA CHAPTER)
This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Detroit was the first place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered an early version of what would become his “I Have a Dream” speech. He recited it on June 23, 1963, at the end of Detroit’s Walk to Freedom, a march that happened weeks before he spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
This piece of Detroit-first history sharpens what Martin Luther King Jr. Day asks of the city. It’s harder to treat the holiday, celebrated on Monday, as a slogan when the dream was first spoken aloud in Detroit. It’s also harder to see it as a day off when a lot of people choose to mark it every year as a day on.
The Lambda Pi Omega chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, is one of the Detroit institutions built around that belief.
Their members measure the weeks before Martin Luther King Jr. Day in labor. They assemble toiletry kits for Detroiters without stable housing, volunteer their time to youth programs focused on combating hunger and fostering leadership skills, and step into the gaps families are already navigating, like hunger and lack of resources. Crystal Sewell, the chapter’s president, said the work is rooted in service that isn’t just a once-a-year thing.
“Our work really is about uplifting our community; that is really at the heart of what we do,” Sewell said. “It is sisterhood and service for the betterment of our local community, that’s really the essence and the spirit of our chapter.”
This year, LPO will spend Martin Luther King Jr. Day at Third New Hope Baptist Church on Detroit’s west side for its annual “We Are One” AKA Day of Service. Sorority members plan to assemble 1,908 toiletry bags for Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a local nonprofit that provides emergency shelter and support services, including housing programs for families and people working toward recovery. The specificity in the number of kits is intentional: 1,908 reflects AKA’s founding year, 1908. After the event, the bags will be delivered to the rescue mission’s family shelter and recovery housing sites.
The chapter’s service calendar stays full throughout the year, Sewell said.
“If I were to add it up, I would say we participate in at least 10 volunteer opportunities per month,” she said. “So, you’re talking 100 to 150 volunteer service opportunities per year. There are several hours that go into our volunteerism, over 2,000 hours per year.”
LPO is part of the Divine Nine — nine historically Black fraternities and sororities under the National Pan-Hellenic Council, founded when Black students, excluded from White Greek systems, created their own organizations around scholarship, leadership and service.
Dr. King was part of that tradition.
He was initiated into Boston’s Sigma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in June 1952. Alpha Phi Alpha (APA) was founded in 1906 as the first Black Greek-letter fraternity; AKA is the first Black Greek-letter sorority.
AKA’s purpose statement includes a directive members repeat as a standard: to be of “service to all mankind.”
Jacqueline Newman has spent decades living by that. She became an AKA member in 1970 at Wayne State University. When the sorority’s LPO chapter was chartered in Detroit in 1977, she became a founding charter member. She now serves as the chapter historian.
“What we do is we try to help, whenever we can, wherever we can,” Newman said. “We love children, so we are in different schools to help feed students. We’ve clothed students. We’ve given Thanksgiving baskets. We’ve given scholarships, and it was not only to women or girls. It has been to men also. And no matter your race. That’s what I look at as service to all mankind, to all people that are in need. That’s what we do.”
Newman’s own timeline begins in the South. She was 13 and living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when Dr. King spoke in Detroit in 1963.
“I was part of the South that he was trying to free from civil rights injustices,” she said.

She moved to Detroit in 1965 with her family. “My mom and my dad were teachers and the employment was better here in Detroit,” Newman said. Her mother became a member of AKA in 1962; Newman described her own membership as legacy. “So, it was mainly a legacy for me. I followed in my mom’s footsteps.”
Her history of service began before she joined AKA. In the South, she said, “I saw so many injustices done, especially to our people. I was marching and doing civil rights things when I was 11, 12, 13 years old before I came here to Michigan.”
Those experiences compelled her to action — “you don’t want anybody else to have to go through what you went through,” Newman said.
“When you have seen a man hung on a tree, it hits you a little more,” Newman said. “If you have lived through it, it’s different.”
Detroit remembers Dr. King’s dream speech because it heard it early. Lambda Pi Omega is betting its Martin Luther King Jr. Day on a simpler goal: what gets done, who gets served, and whether the work continues when the holiday ends.
As Sewell said, service is about direct support and long-term civic work.
“Service for me is about uplifting others within our community who are of greatest need,” she said. “It is advocating for social justice, making sure our community is informed and educated and registered to vote and getting out to vote, thinking about the whole of the individual, from cradle to senior.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AKA-service03.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

(Photo by Brett Bowers/Getty Images)Today we celebrate the life, work and enduring legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a leader whose vision of a beloved community calls us to build a society rooted in dignity, strengthened by diversity, guided by equality, and sustained by joy. 
In Idaho, this day also marks Idaho Human Rights Day — a distinction that reflects both our aspirations and our complicated history. Across the country, MLK Day is widely observed with marches, speeches and reflections on the American promise of liberty and justice for all. But in Idaho, that recognition did not come easily. 
This struggle to be seen and honored reminds us why Dr. King’s vision of a beloved community matters now more than ever. He challenged us to confront injustice, tell hard truths and dedicate ourselves to collective care. 
At a moment when legislation increasingly threatens to roll back hard-won progress, and when efforts to erase difficult chapters of our national story are gaining traction, his vision is more vital than ever. Today is not only a day of remembrance. It is a day of responsibility. 
In Idaho and beyond, we are called to reexamine whether our actions truly align with our values. Are we living up to the ideals we claim to hold? 
MLK Day became a federal holiday in 1983, but Idaho was slow to adopt it. Some lawmakers objected to a day dedicated to one person, particularly a person of color they characterized as having “communist tendencies.” 
After years of public advocacy in support of the holiday, a pivotal moment came in 1989 when Boise State University student Eric Love organized a peaceful march to the Idaho Capitol. More than 700 students and community members gathered to demand recognition of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s legacy.

Bill Wassmuth, the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights‘ namesake, spoke that day about the deep connection between civil and human rights and joined the crowd in singing “We Shall Overcome.” It was a powerful expression of what a beloved community looks like in action: people coming together across differences to insist on the dignity of all. 
In 1990, a compromise finally led Gov. Cecil Andrus to establish Martin Luther King Jr. – Idaho Human Rights Day, making Idaho the 47th state to recognize the holiday. The dual designation was intentional, affirming that civil rights and human rights are inseparable and that both belong to everyone. Idaho remains unique in this combined observance. 
Today, however, we are witnessing a troubling reversal of those historic efforts. Laws dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; policies restricting bodily autonomy and health care; attacks on public education; and attempts to rewrite history all undermine the very freedoms Dr. King and countless others worked to secure. 
Threats and violence toward people based on race, ethnicity or immigration status violate not only our shared humanity, but the fundamental rights promised by our Constitution. These actions stand in direct opposition to the legacies of Dr. King, Bill Wassmuth, Eric Love and so many others who worked to advance civil and human rights. 
We often hear appeals to “Idaho values” and “American values,” but this moment requires us to be specific: which values, and toward what kind of community? Dr. King’s vision of a beloved community provides a clear answer — one defined by dignity, safety, opportunity and shared responsibility for one another. 
These principles reflect the best of who we are as Idahoans and Americans. As we reflect on that vision today, we must ask whether our words and actions are actively shaping a community that embodies these values. Living out this vision requires more than reflection. It demands intentional action in our everyday choices. 
One way is to hold fast to your values and align your actions accordingly. 
If you value community, find ways to connect and care for others. If you value dignity, let your words and actions reflect the shared humanity of every person you encounter. If you value inclusion, be intentional about creating spaces of belonging at home, at work and in your neighborhood.
When we pause, reflect and live into our values through our actions, we carry forward the work of those who came before us. Together, we can continue building a beloved community where human and civil rights are honored, protected and shared by all.

Haley Stevens is continuing to raise concerns about private equity deals in college sports, reaching out to the President of the National College Athletics Association ahead of Monday’s college football playoff national  championship game for information on how to prevent college athletics programs from being sold to the highest bidder. 
The Birmingham Democrat joined U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.) in penning a letter to NCAA President Charlie Baker, expressing their concern following several reports of NCAA member universities exploring deals with private equity firms, or companies whose stocks are not publicly traded. 
As part of their letter, Stevens and Baumgartner submitted a list of questions about the NCAA’s decision-making and enforcement mechanisms to prevent profit-seeking firms from buying up stakes in university athletics, requesting a response by Feb. 15. 
“College sports are a uniquely American tradition that have provided invaluable experiences for generations of college athletes, students, and fans,” Stevens and Baumgartner wrote. “As the people’s representatives, we have a responsibility to ensure that the integrity of universities and college sports is preserved for future generations of Americans, not sacrificed for short-term financial gain – especially where outside investors may gain leverage over decisions that should remain accountable to university communities.”
In November, Stevens sent a letter to Big Ten Conference Commissioner Tony Petitti following reports that the Big Ten was mulling selling 10% of its media rights to UC Investments, a group affiliated with the University of California system pension fund, for $2.4 billion.
The Big 12 Conference and the University of Utah are also reportedly looking at selling portions of their athletics revenue streams to outside investors, while the Southeastern Conference, the University of Notre Dame, and Florida State University have also reported outreach from private equity investors.
“Ceding control or meaningful governance rights tied to athletics revenues to entities that do not have to answer to students, faculty, staff, alumni, or local communities would erode the public-serving mission of universities and encourage increasingly profit-driven decision-making,” Stevens and Baumgartner wrote. “Private equity firms, principally concerned with maximizing their return on investment, have little incentive to protect or promote non-revenue sports, including those required under Title IX, that have provided a path to college and life-changing experiences for generations of college athletes.

The Fargo City Commission voted 3-2 earlier this month to dissolve the Human Rights Commission in its current advisory role. City commissioners gave the board two months to come up with a plan to restructure in a way that taps fewer city resources, both financial and staffing.
Last week, the human rights group began discussing its options at a working session.
“The best thing we can do is come together so marginalized people in Fargo have a voice,” said Sekou Sirleaf, chairman of the advisory board.

But while much of the conversation focused on next steps, several members of the board and the public who attended the meeting voiced frustrations about recent actions of the City Commission.
“It’s a strong, horrible message from our city leaders,” said Barry Nelson, who among many other roles has served on the city’s Human Rights Commission in the past. “It shows where this city’s priorities are.”
Moving the commission to a community-based or nonprofit model could lessen its impact, said Nelson.
After the meeting, Sirleaf said the city of Fargo has a pattern of not supporting diverse, marginalized community members. The dismantling of the Human Rights Commission is the latest example, he said.
He observed that city commissioners voted on the board’s future less than a month after the Human Rights Commission accused city leaders of failing to support the Somali community when President Donald Trump made disparaging remarks about the immigrant group in neighboring Minnesota.
He pointed to the city commission’s decision to eliminate a three-year-old Diversity, Equity and Inclusion department in September 2024. 
In addition, this year commissioners did not approve funds to sponsor community events that honor Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth. Those costs were $17,886 and $12,500 respectively. Martin Luther King Jr. Day has been a longstanding event reaching back to at least 2002.
“Fargo is the most diverse city in North Dakota, but our city government and its decisions don’t reflect that,” Sirleaf said.  
Fargo administrators referred a request for comment to the city’s spokesperson, who emailed a statement from Brenda Derrig, the assistant city administrator:
“While the City is no longer sponsoring MLK or Juneteenth events, the City continues to recognize the significance of both observances. On MLK Day and Juneteenth, community members are encouraged to take time to honor these observances, whether that is through service, learning or engagement within the community,” she wrote.
Derrig said funding was pulled because the city was prioritizing core services and evaluating how social services and arts funding is allocated.

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney did not respond to an email requesting comment on the issue. Mahoney drafted a memo to the Fargo Commission for its Jan. 5 meeting saying that the city had spent the past year identifying ways to streamline the city’s volunteer boards and commissions, including the Human Rights Commission. The intent, he wrote, is that community members could continue these efforts “as independent community organizations without reliance on city staff or resources, but with continued city partnerships.”
The Fargo Human Relations Commission was founded in 2000 to promote acceptance and respect for diversity and discourage all forms of discrimination. In 2021, it was renamed the Human Rights Commission, according to the city website. 
Fargo City Commissioner John Strand was among those who voted to disband the commission, but supported giving the group two months to come up with a different structure. He said there’s value in government hearing from diverse voices, but city advisory boards are limited by finances and governmental procedures. He said the board could be more effective if it doesn’t fall entirely under city jurisdiction.
He would like to see the Human Rights Commission morph into an entity that has appeal to the broader community.
“My hope is we can develop something that is connected to others in the state,” he said. “I would still like to see a city liaison appointed to the entity.”
Human rights commissions act as a local safeguard for civil rights and to promote inclusion. But these types of groups are not often established by local governments in North Dakota. 
The Minot City Council discussed restoring a human relations committee in 2023, but ultimately voted to dissolve it, according to meeting minutes.
Grand Forks has not had a human rights committee associated with city government in the past two decades, according to John Bernstrom, the city’s public information officer.
Sargianna Wutzke is chair of the Bismarck Human Relations Committee. She said a couple years ago, a Bismarck city commissioner observed there wasn’t a place for community members to talk about important issues. In response, the committee started a quarterly forum on topics of importance. 
Over the past year, the committee has hosted open conversations on issues like housing, accessibility and transportation. The format starts with presentations from experts and people with lived experience. Then the public is invited to share concerns and possible solutions.
A recent event on addressing homelessness drew a standing-room-only crowd, Wutzke said.
“We celebrate all the citizens and diverse populations we have here,” Wutzke said. “People want engagement on issues that matter.”

Engagement is key to building connections and empathy that can lead to stronger communities, said Dalton Erickson, executive director of the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, a statewide, member-based organization that has no direct connection to the Fargo group.
In a perfect world, local human rights groups would hold the local governments accountable, he said. They would ensure that all community members are heard and seen and able to exercise their human rights, he said.
“But local governments often don’t want to take on the tough civil rights issues like housing and accessible health care and federal over-reach,” Erickson said.
The loss of the Fargo Human Rights Commission should be concerning, Erickson said. But he’s also optimistic that a change after 25 years could provide some new ways of thinking and acting.
“They also could look at this as an opportunity to restructure and empower people,” Erickson said.

“I have to depart,” he said, adding that his community was “being terrorized.”
Piecing together information and constituent calls, he left the Omaha-Douglas County Civic Center that June 10 believing that at least two raids were happening. It turned out to be one. “So I have to go. I have to try and help.”
Garcia, a Douglas County Board member since 2021, provided updates about the Glenn Valley Foods worksite enforcement operation to the public using social media. The federal raid initially arrested roughly 80 alleged undocumented workers. He’s continued serving in a watchdog role in the ramp up of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the Omaha area.
Garcia was one of three people recognized this weekend by Douglas County and the City of Omaha with a 2026 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Aspire to Inspire award. The awards are presented annually to people who, according to a joint county-city statement, exemplify the slain civil rights leader’s vision of diversity, inclusivity and equality.

A nominator called Garcia a “caring and courageous fighter and defender of social and political freedoms.”
“I know he will always show up, fight and stand up for what’s right and for what’s good, just like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.”
Two recipients are public servants. Among the honored was Lt. Antwone Finch of the Omaha Police Department, who, according to the statement, “gives back to the community that shaped him.” 
Born and raised in North Omaha, Finch is a longtime member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity who has supported numerous charitable initiatives. With a focus on guiding youth, he has participated in Shop With a Cop, a program that annually connects kids from homeless shelters with Christmas gifts, and founded the “Before the Casket” gun violence prevention program.
The committee of county and city representatives that reviewed nominations also selected mixed martial artist Houston Alexander as the MLK community recipient — for his commitment to helping youth. 
In 2018, Alexander founded a foundation that provides free mentoring, education, fitness and cultural programs that promote positive lifestyles. The awards committee said Alexander’s “Culture Shock Tour” has reached more than 450 Nebraska schools, teaching the history of hip-hop while promoting self-expression, anti-bullying and nonviolent conflict resolution.

The three award winners were celebrated during an event Friday at the Omaha-Douglas County Civic Center that featured music and remarks, including from Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Omaha Human Rights and Relations Director Cailin Daly Dejillas.
Also in recognition of MLK, the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department on Jan. 19 is hosting a “Living the Dream” eighth annual high school talent competition.
The 5:30 p.m. event at the Holland Performing Arts Center spotlights music, dance, social justice speeches and art by Omaha-area students in grades 7-12, and is free and open to the public.
Local and state government offices are closed Jan. 19 in recognition of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

Lawyers for Attorney General Lynn Fitch and State Auditor Shad White will argue before the Mississippi Supreme Court on Tuesday over which of them has the right to claw back state money they believe was illegally spent.

Fitch believes she has the exclusive right to file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state. White contends state law gives him the authority to file a suit to recoup funds in some instances.

The issue is over a section of Mississippi law stating that the state auditor is “to institute suit, and the attorney general shall prosecute the same in any court of the state,” when recovering misspent tax dollars.

Fitch first took White to court when the auditor attempted to sue Pro Football Hall of Fame athlete Brett Favre to recoup allegedly misspent welfare money. A Hinds County chancery judge disagreed with Fitch, so the attorney general appealed to the state’s highest court.

The two officials have said they’re considering running for governor and have clashed in recent years over the handling of Mississippi’s massive welfare scandal, which has seen multiple people plead guilty to state and federal crimes.
Fitch also withdrew her office’s representation of the auditor in two defamation lawsuits, including one filed by Favre, after determining a book White wrote about the welfare scandal cast her office in a negative light and created a conflict of interest.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073835/AP24037782705063-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

(Photo: Memphis Public Libraries)As Memphis pauses to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, let us not forget that he gave his life in this city while standing with sanitation workers demanding dignity, respect, and a voice on the job.
Honoring Dr. King requires more than ceremony. It requires action.
Dr. King came to Memphis in 1968 because city workers were being denied basic rights and protections. He understood that economic justice is inseparable from racial justice and that workers must have the freedom to organize and bargain collectively in order to live with dignity. As he said, “The labor movement was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress.”
More than 50 years later, many of us city workers here in Memphis are still fighting for that same dignity. Fifty years later and there is still so much work left to do.
We are Memphis library workers. Every day, we serve this city by keeping public libraries safe, welcoming spaces for learning, connection, and opportunity. We help students with homework, job seekers with applications, families with access to technology, and neighbors seeking information and support. Libraries are one of the few truly public spaces left in our city, and the people who staff them are essential public servants. 



People don’t come to the library just for the books—they come because of the library workers. Yet despite the vital role we play, Memphis library workers are denied the rights and protections afforded to other city employees. 


The work we do is hard but I wouldn’t trade it. At my library I’ve been able to give out lunches to kids, I’ve helped people apply for jobs and had them come back and tell me they got a job offer, I’ve had students in my fiber arts class begin to be able to teach the basics to newer attendees, and though sometimes I have to look a person in the eye and tell them we don’t have what they need, I have witnessed how quick a library worker is with an inventive solution. People don’t come to the library just for the books—they come because of the library workers.
Yet despite the vital role we play, library workers are denied the rights and protections afforded to other city employees.
Library workers are not classified as civil service employees. That means fewer job protections, less stability, and no guaranteed voice in decisions that affect our wages, staffing levels safety, or working conditions. On top of that, a 1984 executive order still denies many city workers the right to collectively bargain, silencing some of the very voices that keep Memphis running.
The consequences of these policies show up in understaffed libraries, high turnover, burnout and workers struggling to keep up with a rising cost of living. When workers lack protections and a meaningful voice, public services suffer, and so do the communities that rely on them.
This is not what Dr. King fought for. When he stood with sanitation workers in Memphis, he was clear that public workers deserved respect, fair treatment and the power to negotiate collectively. He believed unions and collective bargaining were essential tools for democracy and economic fairness, especially for Black and working-class workers.
Memphis, of all cities, should understand these basic rights.
That is why, on this MLK Day, we have two demands.
First, Memphis City Council must reclassify library workers as civil service employees. Civil service status would provide basic protections, fairness and stability for workers who dedicate their careers to serving the public. It would also strengthen our libraries by improving retention and morale, ensuring that Memphians can continue to rely on high-quality public services. 
Second, Mayor Paul Young must amend the 1984 executive order that denies city workers the right to collectively bargain. No worker should be silenced for wanting a seat at the table. Collective bargaining is not radical, it is a common-sense way for workers and city leadership to solve problems together. 
On January 27, library workers and supporters will be gathering at Memphis City Hall for a press conference before the third reading of the referendum to reclassify the library division as civil service. 
If Memphis truly wants to honor Dr. King, we must do more than remember his sacrifice. We must continue his work. That means respecting city workers, listening to their voices, and ensuring that those who serve the public have dignity and protections. Show that Memphis has learned from its past and is committed to a more just future for all.
Words alone do not preserve Dr. King’s legacy. Policies do.

Gillis is among the Perryman residents concerned by proposals from Constellation Energy for a new natural gas power plant close to the community. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Since moving to her home in Harford County’s Perryman neighborhood in 2017, Tamie Wainwright has replaced her mailbox three times, after it was destroyed by traffic crashes.
She watches tractor trailers rush past at all hours of the day, heading toward nearby warehouses for companies like Wayfair and Sephora.
“It’s 24/7,” said Wainwright, a lifelong county resident.
And she’s seen pileups quickly trap traffic in her suburban neighborhood, which has only a few exits because it is bounded on one side by the Bush River and on the other by the sprawling military base at Aberdeen Proving Grounds.
“Our roads can’t handle it. My yard can’t handle it anymore,” Wainwright said.
It’s one reason a group of residents, called 3P Protect Perryman Peninsula, formed a public campaign to stop additional warehouse developments, promote infrastructure improvements and protect the local environment.

Now, they’re facing a new potential foe.
In November, Constellation Energy unveiled plans for a new natural gas-fired power plant in Perryman, on the same site as an existing plant that the company runs.
It’s not clear the proposal will advance. For one thing, Constellation has said that routing a new gas pipeline to the site could cost some $800 million, and the company is seeking financial help from an already cash-strapped state government. But the idea has stirred frustration in a small community already beset by industrial activity.
“For me, it was shock,” said Stacy Stone, who said her family has lived in the community for the last 50 years. “It was just shock that they would have such disrespect for our community after we’ve been vocal all this time.”
Constellation spokesman Paul Adams said the company “has a long history of operating safely and responsibly at our Perryman Generating Station in Aberdeen, Md., and that includes regularly engaging with community leaders and other stakeholders.”
“Nothing about that will change as we potentially develop additional natural gas and battery storage generating capacity at that location,” Adams wrote.
Constellation’s proposal came under a new state law that opened a “fast-track” permitting process for new energy generation in Maryland, a response to high electric bills.
The Public Service Commission determined last month that the company’s proposals —  a smaller 150-megawatt plant or a larger 564-megawatt facility — had met all of the legislature’s requirements to move through the fast-track, which would grant them a permit decision within 295 days after they file a complete application. That has yet to be filed.
Constellation’s proposal for 800 megawatts of battery storage on the Perryman site did not meet the fast-track requirements, but the company could still pursue it.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state’s rush to bolster new power infrastructure could come into conflict with its own ambitious climate change mandates, which give Maryland until 2031 to reduce its globe-warming emissions 60% from 2006 levels. Achieving those reductions already presents a challenge. Building a new emissions-generating power plant would essentially render it impossible.
Meanwhile, residents worry about what a new power plant could mean for their health, the health of the river and the infrastructure of a neighborhood that they already consider overburdened by industry. They also worry that their concerns could fall by the wayside amid the expedited process.
“I’m not at all opposed to growth,” resident Glenn Gillis said. “You’ve got to do it with a sense of balance. And what we’ve seen here has been that the balance has been completely out of sync.”
‘They don’t know until it slaps them in the face’
In many ways, Perryman is a place where the urban and rural collide.
The drive in from bustling Route 40 passes a truck stop and a warehouse, but also grassy fields and the folksy Perryman Grocery — advertising cold cut sandwiches, beer and liquor.
To get to Perryman Grocery, the only grocery within walking distance, residents need to walk along busy, two-lane Perryman Road, which has no sidewalks to protect them. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)
To Glenn Dudderar, a 25-year neighborhood, that spot has come to represent the ways Perryman’s infrastructure isn’t keeping up with its rapid development into a Harford County shipping hub.
As cars, trucks and tractor trailers whizz past on two-lane Perryman Road,  Dudderar constantly notices pedestrians walking toward Perryman Grocery — the only shop within walking distance — without sidewalks or crosswalks to protect them.
As a former vice president of the Perryman Community Association, Dudderar says he pushed the county to build sidewalks along Perryman Road beginning in the early 2000s. Only recently has the idea seemed to gain momentum, though no construction has begun.
“We were going to bring trucks through that area,” Dudderar said. “And now we’re talking about a generation plant. We still haven’t solved the sidewalk problem.”
The neighborhood includes a mixture of riverfront homes small and large, but also a mobile home community and a series of squat three-story apartment buildings that include some low-income residents receiving government assistance.
“You have some very affluent people that live on the water there, but then you have some people that are living day-to-day,” said Del. Andre V. Johnson Jr. (D- Harford) who represents the area. “They’re working. They don’t know what’s really happening as far as these — whether it’s the Constellation [proposal], or whether it’s these warehouses — they don’t know until it slaps them in the face.”
Johnson says he isn’t necessarily opposed to the idea of another power plant in Perryman, but believes that residents ought to have plenty of say — starting with a public meeting in the community to air their concerns.
Constellation’s site, directly across the railroad tracks from many homes in Perryman, already includes a five-unit, 404-megawatt electric generation facility. Four of the units are oil-fueled combustion turbines, which can start quickly to supply the grid during times of peak demand. The fifth, added in 1995, is fueled by natural gas.
The Maryland Department of the Environment considers the area both overburdened by pollution and underserved, with high percentages of low-income, nonwhite and non-English-speaking individuals. The Perryman Census tract got an “environmental justice” score of 81.8 out of 100, placing it among the most-burdened tracts in the state.
Johnson argues that efforts to maintain agricultural lands in the northern portion of Harford County, while still encouraging development, has come at a cost to his more suburban district.

“In the upper end of the county, which they would consider to be God’s country, if they don’t want something, like solar or building a new gas plant … they’ll just shove it down into my district,” Johnson said. “And I don’t think that that’s right for my constituents.”
A resistance is born
Back in 2021, Perryman resident Leigh Maddox only found out about the warehouse proposal because of a small advertisement buried in a newspaper.
Developers were aiming to transform the corn fields near the entrance to the neighborhood into a sprawling freight terminal, complete with warehouses and thousands of parking spaces for cars and tractor trailers.
Perhaps best known for its locally canned white “shoe-peg” corn, Mitchell Farm had been operating since the 1800s. Wainwright can trace her family history back to ancestors who were enslaved on the farm.
For a community already surrounded by warehouses, train tracks and industrial sites, the proposal for the Mitchell site was a step too far.
“That galvanized us,” Gillis said.
In early 2022, residents formed 3P and began appearing in force at public meetings to oppose the project. Later, they would even file suit against the developers.
And they may have won that battle. In 2023, the Harford County Council amended zoning rules so that only 250,000 square feet of warehouse space could go on the property, a dramatic reduction from the 5 million square feet originally planned.
The next battlefront
The two plants proposed by Constellation would each generate about 1,000 pounds of globe-warming carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, according to the company’s proposals.
But burning fossil fuels also means elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter, which can aggravate heart and lung disease, and lead to heart attacks, asthma attacks and strokes.

The proposals from Constellation also come as President Donald Trump’s (R) administration is proposing to roll back some air pollution rules for power plants.
“If this gets built at its current state of environmental protections, it appears more conscious to the community members, right? But I don’t think that that will necessarily stick around,” said Debbie Patton, a Perryman homeowner for the last 15 years. “That concerns me for my own personal health, for all of my neighbors’ health and all of the wildlife in this area.”
All the while, some experts aren’t convinced that new power generation even needs to be built in Maryland, including David Lapp, Maryland’s people’s counsel, who is charged with representing utility ratepayers.
Lapp said that a transmission line currently under construction by Baltimore Gas & Electric to address the retirement of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants in Anne Arundel County will solve congestion problems that forced Baltimore-area residents to pay more for power than others on the same electric grid.
“To build a power plant to serve the same purpose would be forcing ratepayers to double-pay for the same reliability benefit” Lapp said. “We can benefit from the generation that is built in the place where it is cheapest to build that generation, which may not be Maryland.”
That may be in Pennsylvania, home to substantial stores of natural gas, Lapp says.
It’s the prospect of pipeline construction, possibly from Pennsylvania, that truly worries Gunpowder Riverkeeper Theaux Le Gardeur, who also focuses on Perryman’s Bush River.
“The footprint of the gas plant is not the issue,” he said. “The issue is how the gas plant is fed.”
To build a pipeline, construction crews would have to clear foliage along the route. Even with some replanting, mature trees and other plant life would be lost, critical bulwarks against rushing rainwater that carries all the pollutants of human development, from lawn fertilizers to car exhaust fumes.

“The first thing that goes are the trees, and then the scrub wetlands go, and then we go back to, like, grass,” Le Gardeur said. “We’re losing that idea of forest and wetlands in providing natural stormwater controls.”
Controlling urban and suburban stormwater is among the greatest challenges facing the Chesapeake Bay. Stormwater pollution has increased since bay restoration efforts started in 1985, while pollution from other major sources, such as farm fields and sewage treatment plants, has declined.
Adams, of Constellation, said that “environmental and economic justice” is a “bedrock principle” for the company.
“Any new gas generation at our Perryman site would require significant new gas pipeline expansion. As Maryland policymakers consider proposals for new gas generation and related infrastructure, we encourage community members to take part in that conversation,” Adams wrote.
As he sat at his neighbor’s kitchen table among other community leaders during a recent meeting, Greg LaCour couldn’t help but gaze out the window toward the Bush River, which was dappled with ice.
And then, he saw them. A pair of bald eagles, soaring through the gray January sky. He interrupted the meeting to point them out.
“They’ve got a young one, and right now they’re teaching the young one how to fish,” LaCour said.
“I’m not kidding,” he said. “That’s part of our community.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC09894-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

Deborah Fellela, a Johnston Democrat. Her bill aims to eliminate any potential surprises for customers. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Johnston Democratic Rep. Deborah Fellela wants businesses to be up-front about their surcharges for customers who pay with credit cards.  
Fellela’s bill, H7022, introduced Jan. 9 in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, would amend the state’s Unfair Sales Practices law to require businesses to clearly disclose any fees or surcharges that are added when customers pay by credit card.
Fellela wrote in a statement Friday morning that surcharges are “a popular option for small businesses who need to offset the costs of accepting those cards.” Merchants typically pay around 2% to 3% of a purchase when a customer pays with a credit card, and they can pay more on reward cards, which is why proprietors try to recoup these fees through surcharges. According to a March 2025 issue of the Nilson Report, in 2024 U.S. merchants paid $187.20 billion in fees to accept card payments for $11.902 trillion worth of goods and services.
“However, since those surcharges can vary from business to business, there is often confusion on the part of the consumer, who may not understand that these charges even exist,” Fellela wrote. “This bill would require an explanation that is clearly visible, rather than one that’s disguised by fine print.”
Surcharges passed on to customers are usually a comparable percentage to what the retailer pays. Card networks often cap the additional cost a merchant can charge, with Visa permitting a maximum of 3% while Mastercard maxes out at 4%.  
Under Fellela’s bill, which sports three other Democratic sponsors, surcharge notices would have to be posted in a conspicuous, clearly visible spot where customers pay for their purchases. At restaurants, the notice would have to be included on all menus. The surcharge amount or percentage would need to be included as well.
“Failure to provide the required notice shall be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice and subject to enforcement under this chapter,” the legislation reads.
If the bill were to become law this legislative session, it would take effect Jan. 1, 2027.
Fellela’s bill now waits to be scheduled for a hearing in the House Committee on Corporations.
Similar legislation and guidelines have emerged in other states. Minnesota requires signage and oral notification of surcharges. A law passed in 2021 in Colorado caps surcharges at 2% and requires clear disclosure as well. And New York Governor Kathy Hochul instituted similar disclosure requirements in 2024.
A 2025 report by market research firm J.D. Power found that 34% of the 3,841 small businesses it surveyed said they added retail surcharges for credit-swiping customers. The same survey found that 41% of credit card users said they’ve decided not to use a card at a business because of a surcharge. Another J.D. Power survey from later in 2025 noted a drop in customer satisfaction when people are forced to pay a surcharge.    
Similarly, in a November 2025 survey by Lendingtree, 62% of cardholders reported they paid extra to use their credit card. About one-third said they weren’t aware of surcharges beforehand. Still, 46% of cardholders said they did not realize card networks made money off transactions.
Although some merchants will charge a fee for any card payment, debit cards are supposed to be exempt from surcharges. Both Visa and Mastercard have rules prohibiting surcharges on debit or prepaid cards, even if a customer opts to process their card as credit.

The architectural renderings from Bjarke Ingels Group showed gleaming towers rising from arid landscapes dotted with cacti and sagebrush.
But buried in the project’s early announcements was a surprise: Appalachia was listed as one of six potential locations, alongside Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona and Texas. A two-decade Western drought that has lowered the Colorado River to emergency levels may well turn the planners to the mountains as the best alternative.

By 2022, the Telosa team had narrowed their search to three western states. Yet the Appalachian option has never been formally ruled out, and the region continues to surface in discussions about the project. For those of us who have spent decades studying how outsiders have tried to remake the mountains — and how those efforts have fared — the prospect of an e-commerce billionaire dropping a futuristic city into the coalfields or another part of the region raises questions that go far deeper than site selection.
We have been here before. The mountains have served as a laboratory for planned communities, model towns and social engineering experiments for more than a century. From the company towns built by U.S. Steel to Eleanor Roosevelt’s beloved Arthurdale to the TVA’s showcase community at Norris, outsiders with grand visions have repeatedly seen Appalachia as a blank slate waiting to be filled with their dreams.
The results have been decidedly mixed. Before anyone plants Telosa in our hills, they should understand this history — and grapple with a fundamental question that has defined Appalachian development for generations: Who owns the land, and who gets to decide what happens on it?
What Lore wants to build
Lore made his fortune in e-commerce, not Silicon Valley tech. A native of Staten Island who grew up in New Jersey, he founded Jet.com (sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion) and Quidsi, parent company of Diapers.com (sold to Amazon for $545 million). After serving as Walmart’s e-commerce chief, he turned his attention to what he describes as reinventing how cities work.
The project has attracted notable supporters. Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and a childhood friend of Lore’s, has been actively involved in planning. At a 2022 town hall covered by Smart Cities Dive, Bharara spoke about the opportunity to build better civic institutions from scratch: “You don’t have to have a police department that has been marred by scandal and excessive use of force. You don’t have to have a local prison system like Rikers Island.” Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, whose firm designed Copenhagen’s innovative Copenhill waste-to-energy plant, serves as lead architect. Lore’s business partner Alex Rodriguez, the former baseball star with whom he purchased the Minnesota Timberwolves, has also been involved.
The Telosa project, named from the Greek word telos meaning “highest purpose,” promises to be “the most open, most fair and most inclusive city in the world.” The design calls for 36 mixed-use districts, each organized around the “15-minute city” concept where residents can reach work, schools, health care and recreation within a short walk or bike ride. Fossil-fuel vehicles would be banned. Renewable energy would power everything. Autonomous vehicles and even flying cars would move people and goods.
At the heart of the project is “Equitism,” Lore’s economic model based loosely on the ideas of 19th-century economist Henry George. Under this system, the land would be owned by a community foundation rather than individual property owners. As the city grows and land values rise, the foundation would capture that appreciation and use it to fund social services — health care, education, small business development — without burdening residents with high taxes.
“There’s a finite amount of land and that land was claimed generations ago,” Lore has written on the Telosa project website. “Land could essentially go from a barren piece of desert to a modern-day city worth billions, or even trillions. What if that land had been owned by a community endowment?”
It’s an intriguing question. But it’s not a new one in Appalachia.
Why Appalachia made the list
When Cardinal News editor Dwayne Yancey examined the Telosa proposal in 2021, he noted something that other commentators had missed: Despite all the desert imagery, the Appalachian region remained officially in play.
“Virtually all the news coverage of Telosa described it as a desert oasis,” Yancey wrote. “‘Former Walmart president reveals plan for $400 billion Utopian city in the US desert,’ headlined USA Today. And, sure enough, all the artists’ conceptions by the architectural firm show a desert backdrop with cacti and sagebrush. And yet … there’s still that sixth Appalachian option.”
Yancey explored what an Appalachian Telosa might mean for Southwest Virginia. The region, he noted, is “arguably underpopulated” — Buchanan County has lost nearly half its population since 1980, declining from 37,989 to around 20,000 today. “There’s plenty of room for more people.”
The practical advantages are considerable. Unlike the desert Southwest, Appalachia has abundant water — rivers, aquifers and reliable rainfall that could sustain a large population without the massive infrastructure investments required for desert living. Land costs are far lower than in the growth corridors of Nevada or Arizona. The region sits within reasonable distance of major metropolitan areas: Knoxville, Lexington, Roanoke and Charleston are all within a few hours’ drive.
But Yancey also raised the harder questions. A city of 50,000 — the initial phase of Telosa — would dwarf the existing population of most Appalachian localities. “That wouldn’t just change the culture of a county,” he observed. “It would create a new one. Is that desirable?”
That question cuts to the heart of Appalachian development debates that have raged for more than a century.
The company town model: Lynch, Kentucky

In 1917, U.S. Coal and Coke Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel, began building what would become the largest coal camp in the world on 19,000 acres in Harlan County. They named it Lynch, after company president Thomas Lynch.
By the 1940s, Lynch had a population of 10,000 and employed more than 4,000 workers. The company provided amenities that were remarkable for the time and place: quality housing built of local stone, a hospital, schools, a movie theater, churches, and recreational facilities. Housing was subsidized; no worker paid more than 25 percent of their salary for rent. The company store offered goods at competitive prices.
Lynch was considered one of the model coal camps in Appalachia because of its relatively high quality of life compared to the typical coal camp. The town attracted workers from across the globe — by 1926, it was described as “the new melting pot,” home to immigrants from Germany, Hungary, Austria, Serbia, Poland, Greece, Italy, Russia and dozens of other countries, alongside African Americans from the Deep South and local mountaineers. As historian William Turner documents in “The Harlan Renaissance,” the African American community in Lynch created a vibrant cultural life despite the constraints of segregation, building institutions that would shape generations.
But Lynch was also a closed community where the company controlled every aspect of political and economic life. U.S. Coal and Coke maintained its own police force, used not only to keep order but to intimidate workers who showed interest in unionization and to keep organizers out of town. The battles between coal operators and miners in Harlan County during this period earned the region the name “Bloody Harlan.”
When the company no longer needed Lynch, it simply walked away. U.S. Steel began tearing down buildings in the 1960s and sold what remained to residents. Today, Lynch has fewer than 700 people — a 93% decline from its peak. The rails that once carried millions of tons of coal to steel mills in Gary, Indiana, were abandoned in 1996.
The lesson of Lynch is sobering: Even a “model” company town serves the interests of its corporate owner first. When those interests change, the community is left to fend for itself with whatever infrastructure remains.
 TVA’s social laboratory: Norris, Tennessee

When Franklin Roosevelt appointed Arthur Morgan to chair the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933, he got more than a flood-control engineer. Morgan had spent the previous decade as president of Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where he pioneered a cooperative education model combining work and study. He was a utopian who saw TVA as “little less than a means of reinventing civilization.” His grand vision went far beyond dams and power lines — he wanted to transform how people in the Tennessee Valley lived.
His fellow TVA director David Lilienthal would later call the agency “democracy on the march” — a phrase that carried considerable irony given that three appointed directors held total control over a seven-state utility with no meaningful accountability to the people whose lives they were transforming. What began as America’s boldest experiment in public planning would end up, as I wrote in American Heritage magazine in 1977, as the nation’s first flirtation with socialism that devolved into little more than a gigantic federally owned utility.
The human cost was staggering. TVA displaced approximately 125,000 people to create its dams and generating stations — families who had lived on that land for generations, removed with minimal compensation and little say in the matter. And the agency’s appetite for cheap electricity led directly to one of Appalachia’s greatest environmental catastrophes: TVA promoted and enabled the introduction of strip mining to Eastern Kentucky and the broader region, devastating mountaintops and hollows that had sustained communities for centuries.
Norris, Tennessee, was Morgan’s showcase. Built to house workers constructing Norris Dam, the town was designed as a permanent demonstration of cooperative living. Working with landscape architect Earle Draper, Morgan created a community that emphasized walkability, natural materials and communal facilities. Houses were modest but modern, built with native stone and cedar, each equipped with electric heating and refrigerators — luxuries in Depression-era Appalachia. A greenbelt of protected forest surrounded the residential areas.
Morgan dreamed that Norris would become economically self-sustaining through local industry — particularly ceramics, using native materials and traditional skills. It never worked out as he hoped. The ceramics venture failed, and Norris never developed an independent economic base.
More troubling was the town’s racial policy. TVA excluded Black families from Norris, claiming they were simply following local customs. Black leaders pointed out that this was false — the races had lived and worked together in the local mountains and valleys for generations. The policy was federal discrimination imposed on a region that, for all its problems, had more racial integration than the planned community that was supposed to represent the future.
Morgan clashed repeatedly with his fellow TVA directors over his ambitious social engineering and was fired by Roosevelt in 1938. The federal government sold Norris at auction in 1948; a Philadelphia consortium bought the entire town for just over $2 million and resold individual homes to residents.
Today, Norris survives as a pleasant bedroom community for Knoxville and Oak Ridge. Its design still wins admirers among urban planners. But Morgan’s dream of a self-sustaining model community that would “reinvent civilization” never materialized. Even TVA’s own institutional history acknowledges that Morgan “proved far more adept at technical engineering than at social engineering.”
Eleanor Roosevelt’s heartbreak: Arthurdale

No New Deal project was more personal to Eleanor Roosevelt than Arthurdale, a subsistence homestead community in Preston County, West Virginia.
In 1933, the first lady visited the Scotts Run mining camps near Morgantown and was devastated by what she found: families living in filthy, crowded housing without sanitation, children going hungry, a community hollowed out by the collapse of the coal industry. She threw herself into creating something better.
Arthurdale was the first of what would eventually be about 100 homestead communities built by the federal government during the Depression. The vision was to move struggling families out of failed industrial communities and onto small farms where they could achieve a measure of self-sufficiency while working in nearby industries.
On roughly 1,200 acres, the government built 165 homes with indoor plumbing, modern appliances and furniture — amenities that seemed miraculous to families coming from Scotts Run. An experimental school operated on progressive educational principles developed by John Dewey’s disciple Elsie Ripley Clapp. The community operated cooperatively, with residents working together to support the town.
Construction on the first 50 houses in Arthurdale started in 1933. The prefabricated homes were made by the E.F. Hodgson Company in New England. In keeping with the plan that Arthurdale be a self-sufficient farming community, each home came with a barn and hen and hog houses. The homes had a complete basement mostly used to preserve farm produce. The federal government additionally provided each house with electricity, indoor plumbing, refrigerators and coal-fired furnaces. (Arthurdale Heritage)
But Arthurdale struggled from the start. The government had difficulty attracting industry to the remote location — a problem that would doom many of the “stranded community” homesteads. Cost overruns drew fierce criticism in Congress. The selection process for residents was criticized as arbitrary and paternalistic, favoring applicants who “seem likely to welcome supervision and guidance from project administrators.”
Most damaging, the program required that applicants be white, native-born, Christian and part of a “standard nuclear family” — federal discrimination that excluded many of those most in need.
The federal government closed down Arthurdale in 1947, selling the land and buildings to private owners. The community survives today, with many original structures preserved in a museum complex. Historians still debate whether it was a noble experiment that failed for lack of sustained support, or a cautionary tale about the limits of social planning.
What’s beyond dispute is that the model didn’t scale. The subsistence homesteads that succeeded were those closest to cities with industrial employment. The isolated communities — the ones most like Appalachian coalfield towns — could not create self-sustaining economies.
Oak Ridge: The exception that proves the rule

If you want to see what unlimited federal resources and a singular mission can accomplish, look at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
In 1942, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers forcibly purchased nearly 60,000 acres of farmland along the Clinch River, evicted about 4,000 residents, and built a secret city from scratch. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Oak Ridge was intended to house workers for the Manhattan Project’s uranium enrichment facilities.
Original plans called for 13,000 residents. By war’s end, Oak Ridge was Tennessee’s fifth-largest city, with 75,000 people. The government built 300 miles of roads, 55 miles of railroad track, 10 schools, seven theaters, 17 restaurants and 13 supermarkets. A library, symphony orchestra and churches for 17 denominations served the community. Housing ranged from single-family homes to dormitories to the infamous “hutments” — one-room shacks assigned primarily to Black workers, who were segregated by race and generally relegated to lower-status jobs.

Oak Ridge succeeded as a production facility because it had what no other planned community in Appalachia has ever had: essentially unlimited funding (60% of the Manhattan Project’s $2 billion budget flowed through Oak Ridge), an existential national purpose, and total government control over every aspect of the operation.
When the war ended, Oak Ridge had to reinvent itself. The government retained control until the 1950s, then gradually opened the city. Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex continue to operate, providing an economic anchor that most planned communities never achieve.
The lesson is not encouraging for Telosa’s prospects: Oak Ridge worked because the federal government was willing to spend virtually any amount of money to achieve a wartime objective. When the mission ended, the community survived because major federal facilities remained. No private-sector project, however well-funded, can replicate those conditions.
The central question: Who owns the land?
In 1973, I wrote in the Mountain Eagle of Whitesburg in Southeastern Kentucky: “If Appalachia is to survive, land reform is a must.” Fifty-two years later, I stand by that assessment.
The fundamental problem with every outside-imposed development scheme in Appalachia — whether company town, New Deal homestead or billionaire’s utopia — is that it leaves the basic structure of land ownership intact. The mountains have been owned by outside interests since the late 19th century, when land agents acquired vast holdings from families who didn’t understand what they were signing away. Coal and timber companies accumulated millions of acres, extracted the wealth, and left behind devastation.
Today, the situation is largely unchanged. A 2013 study by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy found that six West Virginia counties have 50% or more of their land owned by just 25 landowners. Five of those six are in the southern coalfields. Not one of the state’s top 10 private landowners is headquartered in West Virginia.
After every flood, more families ask whether it makes sense to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow when idle corporate land sits unused on the ridgelines above. In Eastern Kentucky, a former strip mine on the Knott-Perry line is the planned site of the Olive Branch development. (Governor’s office)
Lore’s “Equitism” model at least grapples with land ownership — he proposes that a community foundation would own all the land and capture rising values for public benefit. But there’s a crucial difference between a foundation controlled by residents and one established by a billionaire who selects the initial governance structure.
A more promising model already exists in Appalachia, though it has never achieved the scale it deserves. In 1977, Marie Cirillo and her neighbors in the Clearfork Valley of northeastern Tennessee established the Woodland Community Land Trust. Working with land trust pioneers Robert Swann and Susan Witt, they created a structure where the community owns the land collectively and leases it to residents for housing, small business and agriculture.
The community land trust model keeps land affordable permanently through resale restrictions, prevents outside speculation and ensures that decisions about land use are made democratically by the people who live there. It’s the opposite of both the company town model and the billionaire-imposed utopia: Control flows from the bottom up, not the top down.
I’ve proposed a modern Homestead Act for Central Appalachia built on these principles. The plan would use existing legal frameworks — Virginia’s Land Bank Entities Act, federal brownfields protections, Appalachian Regional Commission programs — to acquire tax-delinquent and abandoned corporate land and redistribute it through community land trusts. Homesteaders would own their homes and improvements while the trust retains ownership of the underlying land, preventing speculation and ensuring permanent affordability.
This approach addresses what outside planners have consistently gotten wrong. It doesn’t try to “modernize the mountaineer” or impose someone else’s vision of the good life. It puts land and decision-making power in the hands of the people who will live with the consequences.
Would Telosa be different?
To be fair, Lore’s vision differs from the company towns and New Deal homesteads in important ways. He explicitly rejects the paternalism of corporate-controlled communities. The Telosa governance structure, as currently described, would involve resident participation in decision-making. The economic model, whatever its flaws, at least attempts to share rising land values with the community rather than concentrating them in private hands.
And the region could certainly use investment. The coalfields face projected population losses of 26% to 48% by 2050 according to university demographic studies. Schools and clinics are closing. Volunteer fire departments can’t replace aging equipment. After every flood, more families ask whether it makes sense to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow when idle corporate land sits unused on the ridgelines above.
A project that brought 50,000 new residents — let alone 5 million — would transform the economic calculus overnight. New tax base, new businesses, new opportunities for young people who currently see no future in the mountains.
But that transformation comes with risks that Telosa’s planners have not seriously addressed.
First, who would these new residents be? The Telosa vision seems oriented toward attracting outsiders rather than providing opportunities for current Appalachian residents. The project emphasizes high-tech employment, advanced education and “diverse” demographics — admirable goals, but ones that could easily result in displacement of existing communities rather than their revitalization.
Second, what happens when the billionaire’s interest wanes or the project falls short of its astronomical ambitions? Lynch declined because U.S. Steel no longer needed its coal. Arthurdale struggled because the federal government couldn’t sustain interest in an expensive experiment. The history of planned communities is littered with projects that thrived during their founders’ enthusiasm and collapsed afterward.
Third, who makes the decisions? Lore talks about resident participation, but the initial governance structure would be established by his team. The community land trust model puts democratic control first, from the very beginning. Equitism puts democratic participation second, after the foundation has been established on terms set by outside investors.
A different path

Central Appalachia stands at a genuine inflection point. The coal economy that defined the region for more than a century is ending. Climate change brings floods that devastate communities built in hollows and valleys. Population decline threatens the critical mass needed to sustain basic services.
The question is not whether change is coming — it’s who will control that change and who will benefit from it.
One path leads through outside control: billionaires with visions, corporations seeking opportunities, investors looking for returns. This path has been well-traveled in Appalachia, and the results speak for themselves. Even the best-intentioned outside interventions have foundered on the basic problem of absentee ownership and control.
Another path leads through community ownership and democratic decision-making. This path is harder — it requires building institutions from the ground up, developing local leadership and insisting that the people who live with the consequences have the primary voice in shaping the future. But it’s the path that has proven durable in places like the Clearfork Valley, where Woodland Community Land Trust has now operated for nearly half a century.
If Marc Lore is serious about building a community that embodies equity and sustainability, he could do worse than to study what Appalachians have already built for themselves. The community land trust model demonstrates that you don’t need a billionaire’s money to create lasting, affordable, democratically-controlled development. What you need is land that belongs to the people who live on it, and the freedom to shape their own future.
That’s not a lesson that translates easily to a $400 billion megaproject. But it might be the most important lesson the mountains have to teach.

Virginia Senate Democrats advance mid-decade redistricting amendment

Unlike two other civil rights-related constitutional amendments that passed with bipartisan support over the past year, Virginia’s reproductive rights measure has faced intense debate at every stage, with every Republican in the legislature opposing it. 
In defending her amendment for the final time, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, emphasized that advancing the proposal would ultimately leave the decision to voters across the state. 
Ranging from fertility treatments to contraception access to the ability to obtain an abortion, “this amendment protects families’ entire scope of reproductive needs,” she said. 
Boysko and several other Democratic lawmakers have described how women in states with abortion bans have died amid pregnancy complications. Those states have also seen an exodus of OB-GYN physicians amid uncertainty of treating patients who need abortions or miscarriage management.  
Boysko grew tearful as she recounted stories and advocacy shared by constituents and people around the state. 
Relatedly, Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Isle of Wight, struck a somber tone as she noted that “this is a difficult topic for a lot of people.”
On the opposite side of the chamber’s aisle — and in opposition to the amendment — Jordan unsuccessfully attempted to modify the proposal to explicitly spell out care for babies when born. 
A sticking point for some Republicans has been concern that the amendment could be interpreted to allow abortion up to the “moment of birth,”  though infanticide remains illegal under both state code and federal law. 
Sen. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, also attempted for the second legislative session in a row, to reiterate existing parental consent laws. Democrats and legal experts said it is unnecessary. Under Virginia law, minors are required to have parental or guardian consent for an abortion unless they petition a judge for authorization. 
On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, accused Republicans of employing delay tactics by pressing for their amendments to the amendment. 
“It is a delay tactic,” Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockbridge, said on Friday, as he urged lawmakers to re-draft the amendment. Doing so, however, would restart the two-year process.
 A sense of urgency

While not entirely a partisan issue at the national level, the issue has increasingly fallen along party lines in states. That dynamic, Virginia Wesleyan University professor Leslie Caughell said, helps explain why Democrats are moving quickly while they hold legislative majorities. 
Though placing language in the Constitution is difficult, it is also harder to undo. With every other Southern state imposing deep restrictions or near-total bans, bolstering Virginia’s protections has become a priority for Democrats. Providers and abortion funds in Virginia have also seen a surge in out-of-state patients seeking care.
“I think everything that happened in North Carolina made activists on this really uncomfortable,” Caughell said. 
In 2023, a member of the neighboring state’s legislature switched from Democrat to Republican, giving the GOP a veto-proof majority and paving the way for enactment of North Carolina’s current 12-week abortion limit. 
In Virginia, Republicans have also put forward a range of abortion restrictions, from near-total bans to a 15-week cap that lacked exceptions for fetal anomalies — which are often not detected until around or after 15 weeks. 
On other reproductive health issues, a right-to-contraception bill has twice been vetoed by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin — a point Boysko reiterated as the amendment advanced last week. 
 ‘Yes’ and “No’ campaigns on the horizon

Reproductive rights groups in Virginia, along with physicians and volunteers, have coordinated as part the national Reproductive Freedom for All effort. Last year, a $5 million investment supported targeted initiatives ranging from canvassing to digital advertising in states such as Virginia, where Abigail Spanberger was elected governor.
Spanberger campaigned in part on supporting the amendment, though governors do not formally factor into its success or failure. 
“I look forward to spending ample time in advance of the 2026 elections campaigning to make sure that people understand the importance of this constitutional amendment,” she told The Mercury last summer. 
On the other side, SBA Pro-Life America supported Virginia-based anti-abortion groups last year through door-knocking efforts in key House of Delegates districts that were up for election. 
Democrats ultimately grew their majority by flipping additional seats. 
The abortion-opposing group “doesn’t have anything to share on the Virginia front at this time,” Communications Director Kelsey Pritchard said in an email, but the organization is monitoring Virginia among other states as it prepares to engage voters. 
Virginians for Reproductive Freedom — which includes organizations like Repro Rising and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia —  will likely ramp up public engagement events and advertising as the November elections approach. 
Caughell said she is watching closely to see how Virginia’s constitutional amendment campaigns intersect with this year’s congressional midterm elections. 
The measures — which include redistricting, reproductive rights, same-sex marriage rights and voting rights — arrive at a moment when Democrats may have an advantage, she noted. 
Midterm elections are often a referendum on the party that controls the White House, Caughell said. 
With Republican President Donald Trump in the White House, GOP majorities in Congress, and federal funding fallouts affecting states, the amendments championed by Democrats could also help drive down-ballot votes. 
She also noted that abortion, as a distinct health care need, has become a more salient argument in recent years, alongside economic considerations and support for personal choice. 
“We’ve expanded the parameters of our understanding of who this issue directly affects,” Caughell said. 
Speaking with reporters outside the Senate chamber Friday, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, emphasized that the work is not finished. 
“It’s our responsibility to go out there and tell the voters this is what this means and help everybody understand what they’re voting for,” she said.

Michelle Maldonado, D-Manassas, who represents the region of the state where most data centers are concentrated and who has put forward a measure that would have state regulators determine if ratepayers are being required to “unreasonably subsidize” data center transmission costs.
One of the challenges in regulating an industry like data centers is that Virginia holds local control in high regard. But with more counties giving approval to data centers to reap the rewards of increasing business and tax revenue, there is more pressure on the utilities to meet the power demands – the cost of which ultimately comes out of ratepayers’ pockets.
Lawmakers will debate how  the state can get the most out of the data center tax exemptions, expand on ratepayer protections following the new rate classes approved to the State Corporation Commission and get enough power on the grid to keep the lights on for everyone.
Here are the top data center bills of the 2026 legislative session so far. 
State Corporation Commission oversight
A controversial method of regulation Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, is exploring through House Bill 155 looks to put additional reviews onto high load users over 25 megawatts, which describes most data centers and manufacturers. 
The SCC would examine if proposed data centers and other high-load companies made sufficient contracts with renewable energy production and storage or have proper demand response measures. The bill also requires the SCC to make sure there is enough energy and transmission capacity on the grid to support the new project. A similar bill did not make it through the legislative process in 2025.
Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said in a press conference ahead of the legislative session that there are many ways to address the energy demands that data centers present. He pointed to a number of recommendations by the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation that are steps towards increased transparency and guardrails.
Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, has filed HB906 to direct the SCC to form a work group tasked with finding ways to address energy load flexibility for the high load users. This is meant to help with grid strain and reliability and find other methods to ease grid demand. 
Recovery cost
The SCC recently approved a new rate class for high-load users under Dominion. They will now be locked into 14-year agreements and  minimum demand charges for these users would be 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. Some environmental advocates believe it is a good first step in ensuring that data center companies are paying a fair share of the transmission and generation costs for power. 
Now lawmakers want to find more ways to relieve ratepayers from covering the cost of infrastructure that is primarily used by the data center industry.
Del. John McAuliff, D-Fauquier, has pitched HB 503, which would prevent utilities from putting the cost of transmission lines and energy generation that mostly serve data centers onto residential ratepayers. He hopes this will make the high load users chip in more for the infrastructure that is not providing power to homes and businesses.
“Right now the data centers are getting a pretty nice tax credit and we are paying for a lot of that infrastructure,” McAuliff said.
It’s in the same vein as Maldonado’s bill. She said that while the new rate class for high-load users will help keep rates fair, there is still concern about the cost recovery being added to bills through the individual riders. 
“Without this legislation, families and small businesses can still end up subsidizing the infrastructure, the line substations and transmission projects needed for data centers, even if data centers are in a new rate class,” Sen. Russet Perry, D-Loudoun, said in a press conference.
Water use, putting waste heat to use
Public questions about how much local water is being used by data centers have bubbled to the surface.
The servers inside of the warehouse-style buildings generate a lot of heat and need water to cool them down. Closed-loop hyperscale data centers are reported to use less water than the open loop systems. HB 589 by Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, would require water providers to report to the State Water Control Board monthly on the volume of water that the centers use.   
HB 496 by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would require data centers that are permitted by-right to report how much water the anticipated project would be using at the time of development. 
There are also some ideas on how to use the heat that is generated by the data centers. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, is bringing HB 323 to direct the Department of Energy to find ways to use the heat to either push it to surrounding buildings to the data centers as seen in other countries. 
Tax exemption requirements
Senate democrats said in a pre-session press conference the state misses out on an estimated $1 billion from the data center industry through tax exemptions. 
Surrovell said the state needs to benefit more from the industry utilizing the exemptions, either through potential energy efficiencies or other requirements. Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, is expected to file a bill this session on that issue similar to his bill from last year that did not pass out of committee.
Environmental impacts
Thomas, the delegate representing Prince William, said his constituents told him that there needs to be a minimum standard for data center locations, sound profile, and other environmental concerns. In response, he filed HB 153, which would allow localities to require high energy users to complete a site assessment when they apply for permits for proposed projects. 
Thomas said this would be a way for county boards to get the full picture of how data centers or other projects may impact the surrounding community. 
“We can look in some localities like my own in Prince William County, where there are clear mistakes in siting. The Village Place Technology Park is a clear example, right next to the Village Place housing development that was there first,” Thomas said. “One vote ends up putting an industrial site way too close,” Thomas said, adding that one could throw a baseball from one of the homes’ back decks and hit the nearby data center. “And so that’s clearly inappropriate.”
A similar bill was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin last year. At the time, the governor said it would create too much red tape for the industry.
There have been growing worries over the emissions from data centers’ diesel backup generators. Usually, they only run for a few minutes a month to test them unless there is an emergency situation. As the regional transmission managed by PJM is strained during hot and cold days – the grid operator is exploring whether data centers should hop off the grid to relieve some of the pressure. But that means the generators would run for hours at a time – releasing fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. 
Thomas’ HB 154 would require the facility to report publicly when the use of the emergency generators will be in use.
“I find that very dangerous and concerning for those of us that have high concentrations of data centers near our children and near our schools. So all the bill does is create more transparency,” Thomas said.
Senate Bill 130, HB 607 and HB 507 also zoom in on the diesel backup generators, offering limitations on how much they can be used and pushing the industry towards energy storage options as their backup method of power. 
Many lawmakers believe it will take more than one session to work out the regulations around the multi-billion dollar industry. 
“It’s probably going to take a year, or two, or three to fully flesh out because there’s billions and billions and billions of dollars of assets and land investment out there, and we have to make sure we’re prudent about how we do it. But there’s no question, (the data center industry) is part of the problem, and we have to take it head on,” Surovell said.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury) I’ve watched every Virginia governor’s inauguration for the past 30 years. For most of those, I covered them on-site as a reporter or editor. They’ve ranged from perfectly serviceable to pretty doggone good.
But what Abigail Davis Spanberger did Saturday in the first minutes of her term as governor soared past them all.
Spanberger sworn in as Virginia’s first woman governor, moves swiftly to set agenda

Not since the inauguration of L. Douglas Wilder as the nation’s first elected Black governor 36 years ago has the day been as heavily freighted with history as it was for Spanberger — the first woman to govern Virginia in more than four centuries as a colony or a commonwealth. Never had Virginians heard their leader speak as a daughter, a wife, a sister, a mother.
In content, tone and delivery, she comfortably and confidently rendered an address for the ages — one that rose to the importance of the occasion, rich in lines that will be quoted for generations to come.
For Virginians, it blended the sweet optimism of President Ronald Reagan’s “Shining city on a hill” valedictory and President John Kennedy’s stirring “Ask not” exhortation to Americans’ collective and individual commitment to country.
Under leaden skies against a damp winter chill, her sunny 25-minute address took in the vast sweep of Virginia’s history — for better and for worse — and paired it seamlessly to today’s divisive strife and tomorrow’s daunting challenges for her and her government.
She noted the commonwealth’s first two governors, Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, and cited Henry’s 1799 admonition in his final public speech — “United we stand, divided we fall” — that is as urgent now as it was at our republic’s birth.
Dressed in suffragette white and standing as the ultimate triumph of their cause, Spanberger saluted women who risked harassment and arrest on the same Capitol steps a century earlier advocating for women’s right to vote.
On the eve of the holiday celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King’s birthday, she noted King’s daring 1960 speech in Richmond urging Gov. Lindsay Almond to end Massive Resistance, Virginia’s disgraceful and futile effort to defy the Supreme Court’s 1954 ruling to desegregate public schools.
In attendance on his 95th birthday, Spanberger recognized Wilder, descended from enslaved grandparents, whose 1990 inauguration packed Capitol Square — a realization of King’s dream.

And she honored the memory of Linwood Holton, Virginia’s first Republican governor, who served notice in his 1970 inaugural speech that Virginia would, at last, embrace racial equality, not just as the law but as a value. Seated nearby, Holton’s daughter, former First Lady Anne Holton, fought back tears as her husband, U.S. Sen and former Gov. Tim Kaine, comforted her.
When she shifted to the present, Spanberger confronted the administration of President Donald Trump and the “recklessness coming out of Washington” without once uttering his name. She addressed Virginians’ concerns head on.
“You are worried about policies that are hurting our communities, cutting health care access, imperiling rural hospitals, and driving up costs,” she said. Affordability was the centerpiece of her campaign and is now the focus of her term.
“You are worried about Washington policies that are closing off markets, hurting innovation and private industry, and attacking those who have devoted their lives to public service,” she said, referring to Trump’s schedule of punitive tariffs and federal job cuts in a state that is home to 330,000 federal government workers.
“You are worried about an administration that is gilding buildings while schools crumble, breaking the social safety net and sowing fear across our communities, betraying the values of who we are as Americans, the very values that we celebrate here on these steps,” she said. No elaboration is necessary.
Then she spoke without equivocation to the dispute roiling the nation, causing massive midwinter protests in cities across America, knowing her words might escalate the vindictive president’s reprisals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted operating last week in Petersburg and Henrico County.
“And in Virginia,” Spanberger said, “our hard-working, law-abiding immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them, too.”
Does such a powerful oratorical start presage a successful term? Oh, were it so easy.
She has staked out an ambitious agenda, and she’s got 1,454 days and nights to achieve it. Many will be difficult, frustrating and thankless. There are unknown crises that, as often as not, hijack a governor’s term and define his — now her — legacy.
But at least for the moment, Abigail Spanberger has pointed Virginia toward a new destination, and she has inspired us to follow her there.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images) Less than a year after it was enacted, lawmakers will revisit a proposal that brought major changes to Virginia’s K-12 public school testing system, with the main debate centering on whether to keep or repeal a provision passed last year that requires assessments to count for 10% of students’ final grades.
Overhauling the testing system aims to raise student performance, strengthen outcomes and make the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments in core subjects (math, reading, history and social science) more meaningful. 
The changes made to SOL testing to tie test scores to final grades, shift test timing, and give parents clearer results garnered widespread support in the General Assembly. However, some lawmakers, like Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, who opposed certain portions, argued the education community did not entirely support the revamp.
“Overall, it is meant to be an assessment of how these SOLs are being taught, if it’s working, and so it shouldn’t be a part of their grade,” said Convirs-Fowler, a retired educator, last week.
She added that “Standards of Learning are standards and the testing is what we’re using to assess that we’ve done what we’re supposed to do … and if we do that, then that’s the goal.”
Last year, the legislation carried by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, took different measures to improve how the SOLs are administered and used to evaluate what students should know at the end of each grade or course. 
VanValkenburg, a History and US Government teacher at Glen Allen High School, said he is aware of the Convirs-Fowler’s view, but had not spoken to her at the start of the session. He said the provision was intended to alleviate end-of-year testing and improve testing.
He said the primary goal is to reduce overtesting by replacing separate teacher-led finals with standardized end-of-course exams, ensuring students face only one major cumulative test. 
VanValkenburg said adding these scores to the final grades motivates students and gives them a clearer reason to take the exams seriously. He also said this provision reduces the burden on educators. Currently, teachers lose weeks of instructional time to repeated testing cycles.
“As a teacher, it’s incredibly frustrating when the last five weeks of your school year are bogged down in repeated final exams,” VanValkenburg said. “It doesn’t make any sense to me.”
State Department of Education data showed modest gains in 2023-2024 reading and math pass rates. These gains followed targeted recovery efforts led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the General Assembly. Performance in other subjects stayed below 2022-2023 levels.
Convirs-Fowler was one of the few who voted against the legislation. This year, she is carrying House Bill 189, which aims to repeal a law requiring students in grades 7-12 to have at least 10% of their final grade in a course determined by their SOL or local alternative assessment scores.
Virginia recently overhauled its accountability system, splitting its accreditation model into two systems: one to determine whether schools meet legal and regulatory requirements, and another to provide clear data on student and school performance.
Scott Brabrand, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said that with revisions to the state’s accountability system, Virginia now has multiple ways to track accountability without having to make the SOLs count for 10% of the student’s final grade.
“The Standards of Learning are an important part of accountability, but they’re not the only part of accountability, especially in this new performance and support framework,” Brabrand said. “Additionally, SOLs are tied to a student’s graduation. Students have to get a certain number of verified credits to pass the SOLs. So really, this 10% final grade is adding an additional layer of accountability that really isn’t necessary.”
The future of Convirs-Fowler’s bill is uncertain, as Helmer and VanValkenburg have filed companion bills to refine their previous legislation. These changes focus on grading integrity, student eligibility for alternate assessments, test timing, and the public release of assessment materials.
Some of the highlights of the proposal include adding specific exemptions for students with significant cognitive disabilities and clarifying that parents and teachers are part of the team that decides whether a student should use an alternate test. 
Exceptions to the test timing were added for high school seniors in the final semester, students retaking tests and student transfers.
National exams, such as Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and College Level Examination Program (CLEP), would be exempt from the general limit of one assessment per academic quarter under the measure. 
The proposal would allow school boards to request a case-by-case exemption to give a standard SOL test to an individual student, even if the rest of the class is taking a local alternative assessment, provided that the exemption does not exceed five percent of the students in that subject. 
To protect the security of future exams, the proposal allows the board to release representative sample questions instead of a full past exam, if releasing the full exam would leave less than 70% of the question bank available. 
Changes to the legislation are likely to affect the Board of Education’s efforts to revise how the state measures students’ performance in history and social science in the state’s Consolidated State Plan. 
Social studies leaders have advocated for flexible, performance-based local assessments that allow educators to measure student learning in meaningful, varied ways while maintaining alignment with state standards. Such assessments balance accountability with recognition that students learn and demonstrate knowledge differently.
The proposed legislation would add safeguards for both mandatory and permissive local alternative assessments, including requiring permissive assessments to be graded in alignment with the “best practices” established by the Board of Education, which are slated to be made available to schools by Sept. 1, 2026.
The proposal also creates stricter rules for grading local alternative assessments, such as preventing teachers from grading their own students’ work and ensuring students have no prior access to the test prompts.
There are other bills that might impact testing on the docket. A measure being carried by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, would give Virginia school districts more time and flexibility in how they test students.
Currently, the commonwealth is rolling out a new testing system that measures student growth throughout the year. Sutterlein and Rasoul’s bill would allow schools to fully switch to the new system and continue using alternative tests until the 2027-2028 school year.
Under House Bill 1243 sponsored by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, if a student fails an SOL test but quickly retakes it and passes, the school would count only the passing retake score when the student’s performance and the school’s overall rating and accreditation are considered.
Currently, a failing score can impact a school’s rating.

(Photo by Nathan King/ National Park Service)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of working Americans first, our leaders in Congress and the White House have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5 percent — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4 percent. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses.
As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households.
The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

When one of Adam Burkhammer’s foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.
“We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,” said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. “There are real impacts on real kids.”
The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.
The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans — and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — created last year as part of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas — offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.
Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water and PFAS, a group of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.

In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.
Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden’s term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.
Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey  and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.
“We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,” said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.
This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.
“The state laws are really what’s motivating companies to get rid of dyes,” said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.
Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California’s 2023 law, which bans four food additives.
“It’s not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,” Baker-White said.

Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP or food stamps — from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.
There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.
“There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,” Baker-White said.
In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It’s a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling “harmful and addictive” products. The lawsuit names specific brands — including cereals, pizzas, sodas and potato chips — linking them to serious health problems.
Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don’t agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven’t focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans’ championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.
Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.
Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.
“If we’re honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,” said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. “We’re going to step up as states and do the right thing.”

Republish photo only with original story.)A federal judge in the Southern District of Ohio issued a preliminary injunction in favor of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio in a lawsuit challenging Ohio State University’s decision to expel a student who posted videos on social media about the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
Ohio State disenrolled Guy Christensen without a hearing in May and on Wednesday U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus, Jr. of the Southern District of Ohio ordered Ohio State to expunge “any mention of involuntary disenrollment” from Christensen’s academic transcript, according to the lawsuit. ACLU of Ohio filed the lawsuit in September and the case remains open.

“The Court concludes that Mr. Christensen has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment claims,” according to the lawsuit. 
Christensen is a pro-Palestinian social media influencer with more than 3 million TikTok followers. He finished his freshman year at Ohio State in April. 
His social media videos attracted attention back in May when, in response to two Israeli embassy staff members being killed in Washington, D.C., Christensen urged his followers to “support” Elias Rodriguez, the accused killer, in a video that has since been taken down. Christensen originally condemned the killings, but took back his condemnation. 
In another video around that time, Christensen condemned U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres, D-NY, for his “support for Zionism and associations with pro-Israel political entities,” according to the lawsuit. Torres then urged the U.S. Capitol Police to investigate Christensen and the alleged threats he made. That video has also since been taken down. 
Christensen claimed Ohio State “violated his First Amendment right to free speech by expelling him for engaging in protected political speech and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by expelling him summarily, without an opportunity to be heard,” according to the lawsuit.
The court held a hearing on Christensen’s motion for preliminary injunction on Monday and Christensen argued both videos are political speech protected by the First Amendment, according to the lawsuit. 
Sargus found the videos “did not explicitly encourage violence or lawlessness and are unlikely to be an implicit endorsement of such action … there is no evidence that violence or lawlessness occurred as a result of Mr. Christensen’s speech,” according to the lawsuit. 
The court also found no evidence to suggest Christensen’s video disrupted any classes, according to the lawsuit. 
When it comes to due process, the court found Christensen received notice of his disenrollment at the same time the disenrollment took effect on May 30 — meaning he did not have an opportunity to be heard before his dismissal, according to the lawsuit. 
“We’re disappointed in the ruling,” Ohio State spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. 
ACLU of Ohio Managing Legal Director David Carey said the ruling underscores a foundation concept of the U.S. Constitution. 
“Political opinions may not be silenced or punished merely because they may give offense,” Carey said in a statement. “We applaud the court’s ruling not only for its vindication of a student’s right to free expression, but also as a critical reminder to our institutions of higher education.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Friday was bright and bitter at the foot of Mount Washington. The sun was shining, but howling wind dropped the feels-like temperature well below zero and whipped up a sharp spray of ice from the forest floor. At higher elevations, snow was flying as wind gusts clocked in at 50 to 100 miles per hour. 
These conditions can be perilous, but for some, and with careful precautions, they’re also a coveted treat. But for all the joy the outdoors can offer, the ability to feel safe and comfortable in the wilderness can be elusive. That’s one reason Hannah Kothari said she had convened a group of nearly 20 other women at Pinkham Notch on Jan. 16 — and why, through her rapidly growing club, Kothari has dedicated much of her free time over the past several months to bringing groups of women out into the wilderness of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont.
“It’s been very empowering for me to be outside with other women for the first time, really, in my life,” said Kothari, who founded her club, Chicks on Cliffs, in November. Her mission, she said, is to create the safe, empowering, and beginner-friendly community she had wished for during her own introduction to outdoor recreation.
“I feel like I can finally kind of pay it forward,” she said, “and be the person I wish I had when I was starting out.”

The Instagram account for Chicks on Cliffs has already grown to nearly 6,000 followers. Through it, Kothari, a college senior, marshals groups of women and a network of trip leaders on excursions in the White Mountains and beyond nearly every weekend. But the endeavor, she said, started humbly, and not very long ago.
Early in her college career, after years of struggling to keep up with her peers despite her active lifestyle, doctors discovered that one of Kothari’s heart valves was leaking. The realization explained why strenuous activities felt difficult, and made many of Kothari’s past experiences suddenly make sense, she said, like falling behind during group activities and hikes — and the frustration, disappointment, and even embarrassment she felt at those times.
At first, doctors told Kothari there was nothing to be done. But reading a nursing textbook over a friend’s shoulder, Kothari learned that certain kinds of birth control, including the one she took, could significantly worsen heart valve problems. Inspired, Kothari switched her prescription, and almost immediately her ability to exercise was transformed.
Kothari immediately took to the trails, logging more than 100 miles on hikes between October and December 2025. She was mostly hiking alone, and posting about her adventures on social media. Soon, her posts were resonating with other women.
“All these girls started reaching out to me, asking me questions,” Kothari said, about things like feeling safe hiking alone as a woman and traveling solo in the backcountry. Kothari gladly answered them, and soon, online connections turned into real-world hiking meetups; then, Chicks on Cliffs was born.

The first official Chicks on Cliffs meetup had two attendees, in addition to Kothari, she said. But lately, trips have been fully booked.
The communities around hiking and skiing can be hard to break into, and sometimes feel gatekept or male dominated, Kothari said. Chicks on Cliffs, she hopes, can serve as an antidote to that, allowing women to share knowledge and tips in a judgment-free environment. 
Kothari takes pride in sharing the knowledge she’s gained over the course of her own introduction to outdoor exploration, which was largely self-taught and trial-and-error, she said. Armed with extra layers, snacks, water, and a first aid kit, she hopes to teach newcomers about safety in the outdoors while empowering them to eventually feel comfortable outside on their own.
Kothari carries her own experience being frustrated, and feeling like the outdoors weren’t a place for her, in her role as trip leader, she said. 
The goal, she said, is to take “that experience of feeling that way, and giving that to others, and helping other people through that. … Being patient, and being kind, and being everything that I wish I would have had in those moments earlier in my academic career.”

Most Chicks on Cliffs gatherings take the form of hikes or casual ski meetups, Kothari said. But Jan. 16 was different, featuring an introductory course on safety in the backcountry. The course was led by two avalanche experts: Caitlin Kelly and Ashley Murray of East Coast Avalanche Education, which partnered with Chicks on Cliffs to offer the course. 
Some in attendance said they’d been to other Chicks on Cliffs meetups before; others were joining for the first time. All were glad to have a welcoming group in which they could lean into the experience of being a backcountry beginner.
“My only friends that backcountry ski are a group of guys that have been doing it for a while. It kind of felt intimidating to go with them and be kind of left in the dust, or rely on them to teach me,” said Maddie Castle, who drove from Maine to Pinkham Notch Friday to attend the Chicks on Cliffs meetup. 
There was something “automatically comfortable” about a group like Chicks on Cliffs, where everyone comes as they are, said attendee Caroline Eaton.
Kothari said she was thrilled to offer a place for women to try new things and experience the joy of the outdoors together. In the future, she hopes to continue growing the club, and offer a wider range of activities to capture people at more levels of experience and comfort.
“Everybody is on their own journey, and I really want to support folks in whatever phase of that journey they may be on,” she said.

Phil Plummer, R-Dayton, speaks during a Jan. 15, 2026, press conference on new legislation to increase investigative authority in the state on child care fraud.

State Reps. Phil Plummer, R-Dayton, and Tom Young, R-Washington Twp., emphasized the strength of Ohio’s verification and investigative process when it comes to child care facilities in a press conference where they also announced a new bill to increase the investigative power available to state authorities.
Ohio House Bill 647 would give the Ohio Attorney General’s Office the authority to investigate “any publicly funded child care program suspected of fraud.”
The Ohio Department of Children and Youth, which leads oversight of licensed child care providers and currently investigates allegations, would be allowed to immediately suspend the license and provider agreement for a facility “under the suspicion of fraud.”
The sponsors of the bill also promoted money the bill would allow to go to “enhanced data analytics” for attendance reviews. Young said the bill would include $5 million in appropriations over the next two years.
Following the allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota originated by a right-wing social media influencer and taken up by the Trump administration, states like Ohio have felt the need to respond to public questions, and were told by federal leaders that they would need to prove the federal money for Publicly Funded Child Care was being used properly.
Plummer said the bill is not only an effort to maintain an already strong system, but also a response to public opinions that the child care system in Ohio is in need of more scrutiny.
“We can’t gaslight this and freak out the federal administration, and they pull our funding,” Plummer said. “Because then we lose child care centers.”
As a parent of children who have benefitted from Ohio’s child care system, Young said he’s glad to see facility workers keeping members of the public attempting to do their own investigations out of child care buildings. He said it further proves the protections at work in the sector.
“There’s no way, (even) as a parent, I can walk through that door and just walk back to a classroom,” Young said. “There are protocols, and they are tight and there’s a reason for that: for their safety.”
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine released a statement after the Minnesota allegations began to make headlines, and held a press conference with Ohio Department of Children and Youth Director Kara Wente soon after.
They said Ohio’s system is diligent in addressing allegations of fraud should they come about, and maintaining high standards in child care facilities.
In 2025, Wente and DeWine said there were 124 referrals from the public about facilities, and of those, 61 overpayments were identified, and 12 facilities were closed.
So far this year, Wente said “with all of the statements, and press conferences, and social media,” the agency has received more than 60 referrals.
Referrals are allegations, and haven’t necessarily been investigated or proven any wrongdoing.
Wente attended the press conference introducing Plummer and Young’s bill, urging support for the added protection, and increased authority for the department to keep funds from facilities until an investigation is complete.
“What we know is there are times when we need to turn the spigot off to the public funds, and then continue the investigation and have the ability to work with the provider and come back,” Wente said.
She said the bill also helps the department continue work they’ve already done, creating new avenues for data.
The department just started a “random sample” of 400 child care programs “to collect data and to see what was happening in the program itself,” according to Wente.
“We can’t be at 5,200 programs every day, we are reliant on our data and we are reliant on our analytics, which this bill will help improve,” Wente said.
The director also said “program integrity reviews” were happening at child care facilities in Ohio “well before the headlines started” about Minnesota.
The federal government seems satisfied with Ohio’s program, though. Wente said the department received approval for Child Care Development Block Grant funds on Jan. 13, another federal approval on Jan. 14, and approval for federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding last week.
“We depend on these federal dollars,” Plummer said. “We’re doing the best job we can do to protect those federal dollars.”
Child care supporters and organizations in the state have also said oversight is solid, but early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio said they appreciated state leaders and the bill’s sponsors for “responding quickly and seriously to concerns of fraud in the child care system by putting forth a reasonable proposal.”

Before Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, he asked several of his friends to continue his life’s work building what he called “beloved community.” One of the people he invited was the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, poet and mindfulness teacher Thich Nhat Hanh.
My new book, “On Mindful Democracy: A Declaration of Interdependence to Mend a Fractured World,” is inspired by King and Hanh’s friendship. These two men bonded over the shared insight that how we show up for each other matters, as does how we advocate for social change. In his sermon “Loving Your Enemies” King announced, “Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” Hanh taught: There is no way to peace, peace is the way.“
At the heart of beloved community is true democracy. To be agents of change who do not add to the suffering of the world, people must learn to become more loving and peaceful people.
 ‘The real enemies of man’

Hanh was born in 1926 in central Vietnam. As a young Buddhist monk living in a nation confronted by colonialism, conflict and war, he developed the doctrine of ”engaged Buddhism,“ premised on the belief that working to relieve suffering in the world is enlightenment.
During the mid-1960s, amid the Vietnam War – Vietnamese call it the “American War” – Hanh founded the School of Youth for Social Services to practice engaged Buddhism and help those affected by the bombs raining down on their homes.
On June 1, 1965, Hanh wrote a letter to King to raise awareness of the suffering of the Vietnamese people. He also hoped to correct some common misconceptions about Buddhism.
His overarching point was that Buddhists in Vietnam did not hate Americans. In fact, they did not hate anyone. Their goal was simply to bring an end to war – and an end to the delusions that led to war. “Their enemies are not man. They are intolerance, fanaticism, dictatorship, cupidity, hatred and discrimination which lie within the heart of man,” he wrote. “These are the real enemies of man – not man himself.”
Hanh refused to take a side during the war. He stood for peace. His peace activism earned him a 39-year banishment from his homeland.
 Continuing King’s dream

Marc Andrus, author of the 2021 book “Brothers in the Beloved Community,” notes that King and Hanh met in person twice: once in Chicago, on May 31, 1966, and a second time in May 1967, at the World Council of Churches Peace on Earth Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. In Geneva, King shared his understanding of the beloved community with Hanh, inviting him to participate in its construction.
In between these two meetings, King nominated Hanh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize, writing in his nomination letter, “I know Thich Nhat Hanh, and am privileged to call him my friend.” No award was given that year, however, perhaps to protest King’s choice to make his nomination letter public. Nominations were typically private, but King used his to call out the injustice of the Vietnam War.
Hanh was crushed when he learned of King’s death in 1968. “I was in New York when I heard the news of his assassination; I was devastated. I could not eat; I could not sleep,” he later recalled. “I made a deep vow to continue building what he called ‘the beloved community’ not only for myself but for him also. I have done what I promised Martin Luther King Jr. And I think that I have always felt his support.”
 Building ‘beloved community’

In the years after King’s murder, part of Hanh’s life work was devoted to fulfilling King’s dream and building the “beloved community.”
Beloved community is not an abstraction. It is a loose-knit global community composed of a multitude of smaller, local communities committed to practicing peace, nonviolence, freedom, love and justice. Emerging from King’s activism and Hanh’s engaged Buddhism, these communities are also committed to social change.
In 1982, Hanh and his student Sister Chan Khong established the Plum Village monastery in southern France. In the years since, the Plum Village community has founded dozens of monasteries around the world, including three in the United States: Blue Cliff in upstate New York, Deer Park outside San Diego, and Magnolia Grove in Mississippi.
Hanh’s lay students have established thousands of smaller Plum Village sanghas – communities – in North America and Europe. These monasteries and sanghas serve as practice centers where people learn to embody the ideals of beloved community in their mindfulness practice and daily lives.
Since the time of the Buddha, people committed to the path of mindfulness have agreed to live by a number of “precepts.” These precepts, typically numbering five, provide a moral foundation for action. Hundreds of thousands of people attending Plum Village retreats have agreed to live by the updated, secular version of the precepts that Hanh and his community wrote called the Five Mindfulness Trainings. These include: reverence for life, true happiness, true love, loving speech and deep listening, and nourishment and healing.
The Five Mindfulness Trainings are written to provide people with a practical path to building a shared life based in love, compassion, joy and peace: the type of life that both King and Hanh envisioned for all.
As Hanh told the global Plum Village community in a 2020 letter titled Climbing Together the Hill of the Century: “We have continued that aspiration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and every day, our practice is to generate brotherhood and sisterhood, to cultivate joy and the capacity to help people. This is a concrete way to realize and continue that dream.”
On MLK Day, their friendship and writings are a reminder that democracy rests on the ability of citizens to be present for each other, to recognize their interconnectedness, to embody loving kindness and to disagree without resorting to violence.

The government of this state works for you.
You know who has the best claim to that glorious Statehouse building in downtown Topeka? You do. Not lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. That building exists to make your life and the lives of your friends and neighbors better. However bizarre or dark the news that flows from that place, never forget your ownership of its marble halls.


Statehouse scraps
Opinion editor Clay Wirestone’s weekly roundup of Kansas legislative exploits. Read the archive.


You can visit. You should visit. Anyone can come into the building and watch the House or Senate in session. You can chat with those lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. You can just watch and make fun of them in your mind.
You don’t need to have to a reason to go. Drop by anytime during business hours. That’s the power of living in a representative democracy. Your elected officials answer to you. If they don’t, they will shortly be replaced by other elected officials. Any Kansan has the right, even the obligation, to check up on those paid to govern on their behalf.
I had already planned to kick off my inaugural Statehouse Scraps column of 2026 with this little sermon. But it turns out that someone else had similar thoughts last week.
This would be AFL-CIO executive secretary-treasurer Jake Lowen, who told a labor rally Wednesday that the Statehouse can feel like it’s built for “other people, fancy people, people in suits.”
“But you know what? This is your house. This is your state,” he proclaimed.


 

 Opinion editor Clay Wirestone and editor in chief Sherman Smith sum up the Kansas Legislature’s week in the first installment of Statehouse Chats.
He’s right.
One of the reasons that I write about legislators the way I do — irreverently, including comparisons to tipsy raccoons — is that we treat people in power with far too much reverence. They work for us. Sure, people might badmouth lawmakers on Facebook, but they don’t want to make waves in public.
That good-natured civility makes sense while avoiding conflict in your daily life. But it doesn’t work if it keeps you from voicing what you believe and demanding the people who serve you do their jobs.
So get in the car and visit the Statehouse. I know that folks in western Kansas face more of a challenge than those of us in the northeast. But you owe it to yourself to see where policy is made that affects all 3 million Kansas. All the lawmakers and public officials who work in the building must be reminded that they don’t do it for themselves or positive headlines.
They do it for you.

Their usual villains
The Legislature replayed one of its greatest hits last week. One of 2026’s first committee hearings tackled favorite Republican villains: transgender people.
You might think that trans folks just live among us out in the world, going to work and raising families and drinking Diet Coke. As people do. But no, because trans folks express their true gender identity, Kansas officials have targeted them repeatedly in recent years. Remember kids, elected officials believe that being different is bad.
The latest bill was touted by Secretary of State Kris Kobach as a way to supposedly reduce confusion with driver’s licenses and birth certificates. It would  ultimately require that these documents list a person’s sex at birth.
This justification didn’t make any sense with earlier bills. It doesn’t make any sense now.
If someone is a transgender woman, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a woman. You’re going to identify that person as a woman if you see them out and about. If someone is a transgender man, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a man. You’re going to identify that person as a man if you see them out and about.
Forcing these people to carry identification documents that don’t align with their public presentation is a recipe for the exact confusion that Kobach decries. It also opens the door for law enforcement and officials to abuse transgender people.
Hundreds of pieces of testimony from those opposing House Bill 2426 were submitted on a laughably short timeframe. Advocates turned out in droves to oppose the bill — as they always have and always will.
Will the Republican leaders who direct their caucus listen? Count me skeptical.

Speedy session
For the second year in a row, word in the hallways of the Statehouse is that Senate President Ty Masterson, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins want to keep the session short and tight. Last year, the motivation appeared unclear — it did give both chambers the excuse to bypass traditional debate and discussion — but this year it’s no mystery.
Elections draw near.
Lawmakers won’t be able to raise money or campaign until the session ends. With primaries in August and the general in November, you better believe that Kansas politicians want to hit the road rather than sit in boring committee meetings.
This cuts both ways. On one hand, lawmakers will have less opportunity to pass hateful or harmful legislation (see above). On the other, leaders use tight deadlines to their advantage by rushing through legislation without appropriate vetting. This gets especially touchy when it comes to budgets and various line items, which can be fiddled with up until the last minute.

Closed GOP caucus
You might remember that House Republicans closed their daily caucus meetings to members of the news media last session. I wrote a whole column about the break with longstanding practice.
From the evidence of last week, they’re doing it again. I showed up at a caucus meeting Tuesday morning along with Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski. She checked and was told the gathering was off-limits for reporters. I’m going to monitor the situation as the session continues, and you’ll be hearing more in the weeks that come.
Meanwhile, Senate and House leadership continue to restrict press access to the floors of their respective chambers. (And not inviting us to their press conferences.) Don’t worry; we’ll cover them anyway.

Scraps on board
Welcome to the 2026 edition of Statehouse Scraps. I started writing this roundup column back in 2023. For three sessions, it appeared on Saturdays and collected tidbits from the week before.
For this 2026 session, I’m treating it somewhat differently. You’ll still see bits and bobs from the week that was, but I’ve decided to run it on Mondays. That allows us to talk more about the week that’s coming up and give you a sense of the big storylines in Topeka.
Press corps shifts at the Statehouse and continued pullback from publishers in covering state government news means that Kansas Reflector has a bigger role than ever in informing Kansas about the session. I want to respond to that, and I want to make sure you know we’re looking out for you.
As part of that effort, we’re also unveiling a weekly video podcast with editor-in-chief Sherman Smith and myself talking about the big stories and offering our own observations about what’s going on. Please let us know what you think.

(Photo nu Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of working Americans first, our leaders in Congress and the White House have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5% — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4%. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses.
As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households.
The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

Connecticut needs a regional approach to housing

A bill was passed by the legislature (HB 5002), and then the governor vetoed it.
In a special session over the summer, the legislature passed another housing bill, (HB 8002) which the governor signed and is now law. There are some things about it to admire, especially the provisions that seek to help our neighbors who are hardest hit by the housing crisis — people who have no housing at all, or whose housing is threatened by eviction.
It brings the language of “smart growth” into the conversation, encouraging the adoption of transit-oriented development districts, priority development housing zones, and the like. 
But it does not address in a serious way the housing crisis.
For decades now, many of Connecticut’s towns have successfully thwarted the creation of new housing within their borders that would help address the need. And under this new law these towns will unfortunately be able to continue to do so. (I refer to towns alone, and not cities, as the handful of actual cities in Connecticut have historically encouraged housing production.)
Last January, I argued that a more regional approach to land-use planning, guided by the state’s nine councils of governments “COGs” (which are composed of the cities and towns within their jurisdictions) might be a way to navigate between: a.) the statewide goal of producing more housing and b.) the desire of towns to control development within their borders without regard to the statewide housing crisis.
The new law does, in fact, lean heavily on the data-based, regional, land-use plans that the COGs have produced for years, and which the cities in towns within each COG’s region participate in drafting. These plans consider all the factors that good land-use planning requires, like the availability of infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and water and sewer facilities, as well as environmental conditions like wetlands and the protection of other fragile resources. But they have been, historically, basically advisory.
Now, provisions in this new law encourage towns to align their town-wide zoning to the regional plan for their COG jurisdiction. It lays out a lengthy and iterative process whereby the Secretary of the Office of Policy & Management reviews town zoning codes for compliance with the regional plans’ housing goals. But — and this is a big but — if a town’s housing goals do not meet the law’s goals for alignment with the regional plan, there are no real consequences. Essentially, the secretary may deny state funding to assist that town in planning for new housing, as well as state funding to plan and construct the infrastructure related to new housing.
But if the town’s leadership doesn’t want the new housing, denying them state funds to assist them in planning for new housing is hardly much of an incentive for each town to plan for new housing that they don’t want to begin with. Gov. Ned Lamont likes to describe this approach as “towns lead the way.” But towns leading the way is precisely what got us to where we are now – at least 110,000 homes short of the need.
The new law comes close to imagining a way forward, of bridging the gap between the statewide need for more housing and the so-called “local control” advocates who rail at “interference from Hartford.” It is important to remember that the 169 cities and towns in Connecticut are not independent entities but rather political subdivisions of the state, and have only the powers that the General Assembly grants them. Local control of zoning is conducted solely by the authority granted, and the rules laid out, in Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statues.
What this law still needs, if we are serious about addressing the housing shortage, is a bit more than holding back planning grants from recalcitrant towns. What I suggested a year ago, and I advocate now, is that the regional plans be activated as enforceable documents. If a developer is denied permits to build new housing in a town, but the regional plan envisions it, the law should provide the developer with a cause of action against the town on that basis.
This would operate along the lines of Chapter 8-30(g), which gives a developer a cause of action against a town that denies permits for any housing development that proposes some amount of affordable housing, if the town’s housing stock does not meet a 10 percent minimum affordable housing standard. But Section 8-30(g) is almost an anti-planning approach. It doesn’t matter if the proposed housing is located where it doesn’t make sense from a planning standpoint. What I am advocating is a pro-planning approach. If the regional plan envisions housing for a location, but the town says “No,” then the onus should be on the town to explain their denial to a judge.
Local control advocates can’t moan about “We don’t want Hartford telling us what to do” under this approach, because every city and town within each COG would have participated in the drafting of the regional plan. These regional plans are a far better way of guiding rational growth than arbitrary, one size fits all, standards for all 169 cities and towns. And we should use them, and let developers rely on them, and stop letting local control advocates, and the town governments they hold sway over, thwart us from meeting our housing goals as a state.

It is a present-day crisis affecting tens of thousands of families and straining our health care system in ways we can no longer afford to ignore.
  More than 80,000 Connecticut residents aged 65 and older are currently living with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. An estimated 130,000 family members provide unpaid care, contributing over 200 million hours annually – labor valued at more than $5 billion. At the same time, Medicaid spending related to Alzheimer’s exceeds $1.2 billion each year. These figures represent not only an economic burden, but countless households quietly navigating exhaustion, financial strain, and grief.
I know this reality personally. I am a Connecticut resident and a constituent of Rep. Jahana Hayes in the 5th District. Through sustained advocacy with her office, I was proud to see her cosponsor two bipartisan bills in 2025: the AADAPT Act and the ASAP Act. These bills focus on earlier diagnosis, improved access to care planning, and a stronger national response to dementia – all critical steps for families facing this disease.
  Early detection matters. New treatments and clinical trials are most effective in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, yet too many people in Connecticut still receive diagnoses late, after years of missed or minimized symptoms. By then, options are limited, caregivers are already overwhelmed, and the trajectory of the disease is far harder to alter.
Connecticut has an opportunity to lead, but leadership requires urgency. It means supporting federal legislation that prioritizes early diagnosis and equitable access to care. It means strengthening caregiver supports and ensuring our health and social services systems are prepared for the realities of an aging population.
  CT Mirror published my letter on Alzheimer’s advocacy last summer. I’m writing again because the crisis has not eased – it has intensified. Families are still absorbing the burden largely alone, and the costs – human and economic – continue to rise.
  Alzheimer’s is not just a personal tragedy. It is a public health emergency. Connecticut can, and must, respond accordingly.

(Photo by STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — With two months to go before candidates must file to be on this year’s ballots, the state Democratic Party made a plea.
“RUN FOR OFFICE in 2026,” reads the top of an email sent Jan. 7 from state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain.
Democrats have announced bids for just two of the seven constitutional offices on the ballot this November: governor and state superintendent of education. The party is still talking with potential candidates, Spain told the SC Daily Gazette.
In her email, she pointed to that week’s slim margin of victory for Republican Greg Ford in a special election for a state House seat representing Dorchester County. He defeated Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani by just 21 votes, as determined by an automatic recount.
Ogletree Satani “ran one heck of a race,” Spain wrote, noting that President Donald Trump won the district by over 6 percentage points in 2024. (Statewide, he won by 18 points.) “The lesson to all of us is that we can compete and win if we run!”
The email was successful, Spain told the Gazette on Wednesday.
In one week, more than a hundred people filled out the candidate interest form attached to that email. “Dozens” of them checked a box showing interest in seeking a statewide office, according to Jon Burton, a party spokesperson.


Upcoming deadlines
To compete in the June 9 party primaries, candidates must file the forms and pay the required fees between March 16 and March 30.
The fee is 1% of the job’s salary over the entire term.
For statewide offices, that ranges from $4,243 for gubernatorial candidates to $8,560 to run for state superintendent.


It’s been 32 years since a Democrat competed for every statewide elected office in the South Carolina constitution. And back in 1994, there were two additional offices on the ballot.
The party has come close to having a candidate for every office since.
In 2006, a Democrat ran for every statewide office except attorney general. Then-Attorney General Henry McMaster ran unopposed for re-election that year. In 2002, the only constitutional office without a Democrat running was adjutant general, the leader of the state’s military department. Maj. Gen. Stan Spears ran unopposed that year for his fourth and final term before retiring. In 2014, voters approved taking that office off the ballot and making it a governor-appointed position.
Asked about Spain’s email, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said Democrats’ problem “isn’t a lack of candidates.
“It’s that voters simply aren’t buying what they’re selling,” he said in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
Two races with both parties on the ballot
A Democrat last won a statewide office in 2006, when Jim Rex was elected state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
This year, two Democrats, Lisa Ellis and Sylvia Wright, are running for the job overseeing the state agency for K-12 public schools. Whoever wins the June 9 Democratic primary will likely face Superintendent Ellen Weaver, who’s running for her second term. So far, no Republican has announced a challenge.
In 2022, the race for superintendent was the most crowded: Six Republicans and three Democrats ran to replace outgoing Superintendent Molly Spearman.
Ellis was a first-time candidate then. The 25-year veteran teacher of Richland 2 high schools, who in 2018 founded the online teachers’ group SC for Ed, won a three-way primary outright without needing a runoff, then lost to Weaver by 16 percentage points. In 2023, SC for Ed announced an indefinite pause to its lobbying efforts, four years after organizing a teachers’ rally at the Statehouse attended by an estimated 10,000 people.
Wright, who has two decades of classroom and administrative experience in rural South Carolina, resigned from her job last fall as a district coordinator for Dorchester 4 in order to campaign full-time.
Among all the statewide races on the ballot this year, the wide-open governor’s race has by far gotten the most attention.
It’s been 16 years since no incumbent ran for governor. Five Republicans and two Democrats have announced bids to replace Gov. Henry McMaster, who first ascended to the job nine years ago when then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined President Donald Trump’s first administration. So, when voters first elected McMaster to the job in 2018, he’d already been governor almost two years.
In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms. Other constitutional offices have no term limitations.
Two other offices are wide open
Two other statewide offices that have gotten little attention are wide open for the first time in over two decades.
Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is not seeking a sixth full term. It’s been 16 years since a Democrat challenged him.
Voters first elected Weathers in 2006, two years after Gov. Mark Sanford appointed the Orangeburg County dairy farmer to the job following the indictment of Charlie Sharpe, who was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe to protect a cockfighting ring.
Weathers endorsed Republican Fred West to replace him, The State newspaper reported last March. West retired in 2023 after 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms and his since become director of market development at the Department of Agriculture.
So far, West is the only candidate to announce a bid to lead the agency with duties that include promoting one of the state’s top industries, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The job of comptroller general is open for the first time in 28 years, when then-Sen. Jim Landers replaced the retiring Earle Morris Jr.
That 1998 election was also the last time a Democrat won the post as the state’s chief accountant. In 2002, Republican Richard Eckstrom ousted Landers and kept the job for 21 years. Eckstrom resigned in 2023 amid mounting pressure over his office’s $3.5 billion accounting error. (The error was strictly on paper. No money went missing due. The office mistakenly double-counted some agencies’ revenue.)
McMaster made history in appointing his budget director, Brian Gaines, who by agreeing to run the office temporarily became South Carolina’s first Black constitutional officer since Reconstruction. Gaines said at the time he had no interest in running in 2026.
One Republican has announced a bid: Mike Burkhold, a Charleston businessman who founded Equiscript, a health care technology company.
For two other statewide offices, Republicans are seeking re-election without any announced competition.
Secretary of State Mark Hammond, first elected in 2002, is seeking a seventh term leading the office that registers and helps regulate businesses and charities operating in South Carolina. (Unlike in other states, South Carolina’s secretary of state plays no role at all in overseeing elections.)
Treasurer Curtis Loftis, first elected in 2010, also got came under fire recently for accounting problems. Senate investigations into the comptroller general’s office led to discovery of a $1.8 billion error in the treasurer’s office — also a blunder on paper that didn’t affect state revenues or the Legislature’s budgeting process. An outside accounting firm found that all but $200 million never existed. But senators were incensed, voting 33 to 8 last April to remove him. The House, however, never took up the case.
Amid a grilling from senators, Loftis initially pledged that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he later reversed course and announced he’s seeking a fifth term. He maintains that he did nothing wrong.

Delaware Legislative Hall, Dover, Delaware, USA
convened in the second half of the 153rd Session of the General Assembly, this week.  The normal, more relaxed tone to the opening session was tempered by recent events, including the murder of Cpl. Matthew “Ty” Snook at the Delaware DMV offices two weeks ago.  Tensions seemed to be running high, leading to an outburst on the Senate floor, as Senate Concurrent Resolution 114 was introduced.  This is a measure, introduced by Sen. Bryant Richardson, that would add Delaware to the list of states authorizing an Article V “Convention of the States” resolution to introduce a slate of U.S. Constitutional amendments.  Heated exchanges led to a call for greater civility in these floor discussions, with a resolution (SCR124) by Sen. Kyra Hoffner passing unanimously in the Senate and echoed by a voice vote in the House, shortly after.  Sen. Brian Pettyjohn reinforced the unanimous call for civility in legislator discourse.  The resolution for the Convention of States, failed to pass with a vote of 7-7, with 7 senators choosing not to vote.  Senator Hansen joined the Republican members in voting for the resolution.
The session opened with a resolution recognizing “Law Enforcement Appreciation Day” as January 9th.  Comments we made by Sen. Nicole Poore, a close friend of the Snook family, and Secretary of the Senate, Ryan Dunphy, Snook’s brother-in-law.
There were a handful of other bills addressed in the opening days.  These included:
SB213 – “Amend Code Related to Hospital Review Board” 

This controversial law from 2025 was amended according to an agreement that followed legal challenges by hospital associations. The bill would still require hospitals to submit financial data to the Diamond State Hospital Cost Review Board to increase transparency around costs and spending trends, however it removes the authority of the board to approve or modify future budgets.  The bill was released from the Senate Executive Committee, with all 7 members approving (2 “Favorable”, 5 “On the Merits”) and sent to the Senate Floor for a vote.  There is an end of January deadline in the agreement related to the legal challenges.

SB222 – “Term Limits for Legislators, Attorney General, State Treasurer, State Auditor and State Insurance Commissioner” 

Senators would be limited to 5 terms, Representatives would be limited to 8 terms and others would be limited to 2 terms each.

SB106 – “Cell Phone Use Policies for Schools” 
Did not dictate policy, but laid out areas that must be addressed by the school policy.  This passed the Senate unanimously in 2025 and was passed by the House unanimously at the start of the 2026 session.
SB27 – “Establishing the Office of New Americans”

Codifies the executive actions of Gov. Meyer to establish this office “to help improve the lives and economic prosperity of new Americans who come to Delaware.” There does not appear to be a distinction between legal and illegal immigrants in this bill.  A sunset provision was added by Sen. Bryant Richardson.  The measure passed the Senate, as amended, unanimously and was sent to the House.

SB188 “Expand Permit to Purchase Handgun Exemptions to Law Enforcement Procurement”

The “Permit to Purchase” law (SB2) had not excluded the purchasing function of law enforcement agencies to supply their officers and candidates. This passed unanimously in the Senate and was sent to the House.  In a related article, we will explore the impact of SB2, as Delaware handgun purchases are down by 80%, as the processes for obtaining and exercising permits are not fully in place.  This is placing an incredible financial burden on firearms dealers in the state.

A number of other bills are expected to receive attention in this current session, including:
HS2 for HB13 “Added/Revised Tax Brackets”

Creates added brackets for $150K (amended from $125K), $250K & $500K, as the state faces concerns over decreasing revenue. This bill was deferred, as revenue estimates for 2026 were increased.  There is long term concern over the pace of budget increases.

HB72, HB73 & HB108 “Property and Income Tax Relief for Seniors”

Republican-sponsored bills to increase the Senior property tax deduction, reduce the residency period back to 3 years and increase the pension exclusion were not allowed to progress.

SB2 & SB3 Constitutional Amendments Affecting “Early, In-Person” and “No Excuse Absentee” Voting have progressed  to House vote.  HB65 “Moving Primary Election Date to April” is also pending Senate vote.

These CA’s will require 2027-2028 votes, if passed. HB65 will align primary dates with Presidential Primary and provide for longer General Election campaign.  These were all deferred to 2026 and will not affect the 2026 elections.

Protections for Illegal Immigration are progressing – HB58, HB60, HB93, HB94 , HB95, HB96, HB150 & HB151

Limiting schools and State/local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement agencies or providing information from state files and resources. These were not yet passed in 2025.

(Photo: Izzy Ross/IPR News)This story is made possible through a partnership between Interlochen Public Radio and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Students at Traverse City West Senior High School are raising money to install solar panels on their campus so they can learn about renewable energy.
Srinergy, a Michigan-based solar company, donated 14 ground panels to the school and students need to fundraise money to cover installation costs. They aim to raise more than $11,000 by the end of this school year.
The school’s Environmental Club is leading the effort. Lucy Jones, the club’s president and senior at TC West, said clean energy like solar will only become more common as students get older. That makes this project important for their education, she said.
“It’s good for students to learn about it now and learn about how it works, so then in the future, they’re able to know about it and use renewable energy in their lives,” Jones said.
The goal of the project is to teach students, but the 14 panels would generate about 7,000 kilowatt hours of electricity for the building. That’s an estimated 5% of the school’s electricity use, according to the project proposal from Srinergy.
Mary Brisbois, a science teacher at TC West, said data from these solar panels could help teach students in her environmental science class about how renewable energy works. Other science and math teachers have expressed interest to Brisbois in using data for their classes, too.
Students are also responsible for fundraising, she said. That way, students can learn that “money is something to figure out” and not always “a complete roadblock,” Brisbois said.
Lyla Hollis is a clean energy specialist at the nonprofit Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities and a partner in the school solar project. She said just seeing the installation of the panels could be beneficial to students.
“Getting the solar panels installed into the electric system is not that hard, but it is a process, and to learn how to do that on a small scale is pretty cool to see,” Hollis said. “The actual steps, you can implement it in different classes and learn how the chemistry works and all that stuff, which is more than I learned in school.”
Jones said she’s optimistic her classmates will raise enough money by the end of the year, with the help of the local community. And she’s excited for future students to benefit, long after she graduates.
“It’ll be something that the whole school will get to see and experience and gain information and knowledge from and then on to future generations,” she said. “It’s kind of like giving something to the school and giving back to our community.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/m-72-solar-panels-8.2.23-1024x768.png,,,2026-01-18 13:56:44.118578

For years, both Democrats and Republicans in Michigan have advocated expanding FOIA to include the two branches of government, but no deal has been reached.
Currently, two bills aiming to expand Michigan’s FOIA laws (Senate Bills 1 and 2) are sitting in the House’s Governmental Operations Committee awaiting discussion. However, Michigan Speaker of the House Matt Hall stated that he wasn’t interested in putting the bills on the agenda.
“We’re just not going to do FOIA,” Hall told reporters during a Nov. 6 press conference.
Michigan’s Democratic-led Senate started 2025 by quickly introducing and passing the bills, with 33 yeas and two nays. After moving off the Senate floor, SB 1 and 2 were read by the House and have remained in committee since January.
‘Let’s get it done,’ Moss says as Michigan FOIA reform clears Senate again

“If this were put up for a vote in the House, it would pass,” said Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), co-author of the bills. “There’s no doubt. It has the votes.
“The question is, why won’t the speaker put it up for a vote?”
Hall recently celebrated the passing of two earmark reform bills (Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025), which require legislators to disclose spending on individual projects before a final budget is put up for a vote. The passing of these bills completes part of Hall’s Ethics, Accountability and Transparency, or HEAT, plan, which he believes will be more beneficial to the public than expanding FOIA.
“We ask people all the time, they know HEAT will have a much better benefit than  FOIA,” Hall said during the conference.
Michigan Press Association Public Policy Manager Lisa McGraw said that the reform bill is a step in the right direction, but that the state government could, and should, do more.
“I think until the governor and the legislature in the state are subject to FOIA, we really have no transparency at the state level,” said McGraw, who has been working to expand FOIA since 2015.
Hall did not provide comment for this story.
Senators Moss and McBroom’s mission for FOIA
SB 1 and 2 are in the same position as other FOIA expansion bills that have been introduced in recent years.
Since joining the State Senate in 2019, Moss and Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) have co-authored four bills in an attempt to expand FOIA:

Senate Bill 1 of 2025
Senate Bill 2 of 2025
Senate Bill 669 of 2023
Senate Bill 670 of 2023

While serving as the state representative for Michigan’s 35th District, Moss introduced House Bill 4149 of 2017, which would have made the legislature and the governor subject to FOIA. Just like his and McBroom’s Senate bills, the House bill was referred to committee and wasn’t put on the agenda for a vote.
“It was the first bipartisan package that got out of the House that term, and the Senate Leader (Arlan Meekhof) said, ‘I’m not taking this up,’” Moss said.
According to a 2017 story by the Detroit Free Press, Meekhof told journalists, “You guys are the only people who care about this” referencing Moss and McBroom’s bill.
Both senators will be term limited at the end of 2026. Both stated they will continue to push for expanding the public’s right to know.
“We would really like to see this project through,” Moss said. “It’s not fun to work on something for 10 years, and make progress on it, and not get past the finish line. But we’re working really, really hard to achieve this.”
The campaign on FOIA expansion
In 2018, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stated that she would work to expand FOIA laws to include the governor’s office and legislature.
“I mean, unilaterally we could open up the executive branch to FOIA and ensure that there is real notice and real searchable capabilities online,” Whitmer said in an interview on PBS Detroit in July of 2018. “The public and the press need tools so they can get information.”
Whitmer signed Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025 into law and praised the bills.
“Since I took office, I’ve been committed to increasing transparency in our government, so Michiganders know exactly where their hard-earned dollars are going,” Whitmer stated in a press release. “I made a promise to increase transparency on legislative earmarks in my most recent State of the State. Less than a year later, I’m proud to sign these two bills that require lawmakers to put their names on any projects they propose.”
“I’ll keep working with anyone to serve Michiganders and increase transparency in our government.”

Whitmer made the calendars for her office and the office of Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist open to the public – as well as her federal income tax returns and personal financial information.
However, her promise to extend FOIA to her office has not yet been met.
Whitmer did not provide comment for this story.
“Since the (Whitmer) administration started, we have not gone anywhere despite an entire campaign called the Sunshine Report, when she was running the first time,” said McGraw.
In 2018, Whitmer released an eight-page document titled “Get it Done: Michigan Sunshine Plan,” highlighting issues with Michigan’s transparency and ethics laws and what she wanted to change if elected governor.
“If the legislature won’t act, I will use the governor’s authority under the Michigan State Constitution to extend FOIA to the Lieutenant Governor and Governor’s Offices,” Whitmer stated in the report. “ Michiganders should know when and what their governor is working on.”
While discussing the history of politicians advocating for expanding FOIA, Attorney General Dana Nessel told Central Michigan Life that false promises are often made during campaigns.
“No one runs for governor being like, ‘absolutely not, I don’t agree with that,” Nessel said. “Everyone says what they think everyone wants to hear, and maybe they really think that, until they get (into office).’’
As Whitmer’s term comes to an end in 2026, candidates in the gubernatorial race have started to make promises on expanding FOIA.
“On day one, I will voluntarily comply with FOIA,” said Democratic candidate Jocelyn Benson, who has served as Secretary of State since 2019. “Every job I’ve had, whether it’s been running a law school or running the Department of State, I’ve complied with FOIA proudly.”
Republican candidate and Former House Speaker Tom Leonard shared a similar commitment during an interview with Central Michigan Life in October.
“Michigan is only one of two states in the entire country whose executive branch and legislature is not subject to open records and FOIA. That needs to change,” Leonard said. “People of this state deserve to know what’s going on in their executive branch and legislature.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9944-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 11:56:26.353815

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s second most populous county has agreed it will no longer jail people who can’t afford to pay the daily fees attached to the state’s signature sobriety program.
Pennington County’s settlement in a federal class action lawsuit could impact the way counties operate the 24-7 program, which originated in South Dakota and has since spread to other states. 
People accused of crimes involving drugs or alcohol can be assigned to the program and released as they await trial, or as part of their sentence, on the condition they submit to sobriety monitoring and pay for it.
The participation price varies based on the type of monitoring involved and how long a person takes part. Some people pay $2 a day for breath testing, while others pay $30-$42 a week for urinalysis drug testing or alcohol monitoring bracelets. Judges also permit participants to shift from one method to another along the way to better suit their financial or life circumstances. 
Some people remain on the program for weeks or months, and occasionally for a year or more, depending on how long it takes for their case to work its way through the court system. 
Drunken driving courts prepare for more action from minimum-sentence law

The Pennington County settlement comes in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by a Rapid City man named Ricky Lookingback, who’d been ordered to participate in drug testing. 
He was jailed for failure to pay a 24-7 fee, which he argued was a violation of constitutional prohibitions on jailing people for debt. He also alleged that he belonged to a class of individuals who’d been jailed for the same reason in Pennington County, and asked for a judgment on behalf of all class members.
Under the terms of the agreement, Lookingback and 37 others jailed for inability to pay program fees are members of the class and are each eligible for cash payments, with Lookingback in line for $10,000 and the others for $1,000 each. The settlement also dictates that no one can be jailed or threatened with jail time for their inability to pay program fees.
Class members will have the opportunity to object to the terms of the settlement at a hearing in February. A federal judge can then accept or reject the agreement, which has been signed by Lookingback and county officials.
Jim Leach, Lookingback’s Rapid City lawyer, said the settlement should put all South Dakota counties on notice that jailing the indigent is a civil rights violation and could draw a legal challenge.
“I’ve got nothing against the 24-7 program,” Leach said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “From everything I can gather, it’s a really good program that has helped a lot of people. But nonetheless, the basic constitutional law in this country is that we cannot jail people for poverty.”
24-7 built on frequent testing, participant fees
Under the 24-7 program, testing fees are due at the time of testing or in advance.
In the cheapest and most common form of 24-7, people appear twice daily at a local jail to take breath tests for alcohol, at a cost of $1 per test. Those who fail a test or fail to show up can be put in jail, after which a judge decides whether to release them again.
More than 90,000 people have been on some version of the program since its launch, and hundreds participate every day. Its rollout began as a three-county pilot project in 2005 under the guidance of former Attorney General Larry Long, who’d tried it decades earlier as Bennett County’s state’s attorney.
In testimony before the Legislature in 2022, Long called it “the most efficient tool to reduce DUIs ever enacted in South Dakota.”
Driving under the influence arrests have not dropped dramatically since the program launched, but they also haven’t grown in line with the state’s population, which is 20% higher today than in 2005. 
DUI arrests hit 11,612 in 2024, the last full year reported in the Department of Public Safety’s annual summary. That was the highest tally since 2007, the year the 24-7 program went statewide, when there were 11,756 DUI arrests. 
Long stepped down as attorney general in 2009 to become a circuit court judge. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, he said DUIs holding more or less steady is a sign that the program works. 
The bigger impact, Long said, has been on felony drunken driving charges and alcohol-related traffic crashes. 
In 2007, when the program went statewide, there were 1,092 felony DUI charges, each representing a third or subsequent offense. By 2017, the year he retired as a judge, that number had fallen to 699. In the last fiscal year, there were 468 charges for such repeat offenses, according to the Unified Judicial System.
Alcohol-related crashes, meanwhile, hit a record high of 630 in 2006, according to the Department of Public Safety. The highest tally since then was 535, recorded in 2021. In 2024, there were 458 such crashes.
Since its start in South Dakota, versions of the 24-7 program have spread to other states, including North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Wisconsin and Utah.
Constitutional concerns about jailing the program’s poorest participants have always been a sticking point, Long said, even for people who’ve generally supported the concept. 
The price point for breath tests was set low intentionally, he said, in hopes of making the program accessible to the widest range of people.
From the start, Long advised the county sheriffs who run the programs that an inability to pay shouldn’t be enough to draw immediate sanctions. 
“What I used to say during my presentations was ‘if you skip or if you fail, you go to jail,’” said Long. “You don’t go to jail for not paying.”
Long acknowledged, however, that local officials may not have always followed that guidance.
There are no statewide statistics on how many people may have been jailed for failure to pay 24-7 fees, according to the Attorney’s General’s Office, since counties manage their own programs. During debate on a bill to alter the program in 2022, administrators said punishment for failure to pay alone is a rarity, based on reports from counties.
Fees still too much for some
The 24-7 fees may be fairly low, but they’re still more than some people have, said Leach. 
Lookingback was and remains homeless, Leach said, and he was placed in a version of 24-7 that required him to take three drug tests each week, at a cost of $10 per test. 
Court documents in the case, filed by Pennington County, say Lookingback was released from jail and ordered to sign in to the program and did not on multiple occasions in 2023. On those occasions, the county said, he was sanctioned for failure to appear for testing.
In the fall of that year, he was again ordered into the program. On Sept. 23, 2023, he showed up but didn’t have the $10 needed to pay the fees. As a result, Leach said, Lookingback found himself again incarcerated at the Pennington County Jail.
If a judge accepts the settlement agreement, Pennington County will pay Lookingback $10,000 for that incarceration, and will set aside another $37,000 for the 37 other people who were found to have been jailed for their inability to pay. 
Leach will be required to “make reasonable efforts” to contact the 37 people, who were identified in county records obtained over the course of the lawsuit. Any money that goes uncollected, the settlement says, will be given to a nonprofit organization called the Public Justice Debtor’s Project. The New York-based nonprofit works to address issues related to the jailing of defendants for unpaid court fees across multiple jurisdictions. 
Leach can ask the judge to order Pennington County to pay attorney’s fees, but the settlement says he’s entitled to none of the money the county’s already promised to pay through the agreement.
Helene Duhamel, spokeswoman for the Pennington County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement the settlement “clarifies that 24-7 Sobriety Program participants who have not paid the court-ordered fees” won’t be incarcerated.
“Instead, individuals who have not paid the 24-7 Program fees may be reported to the courts or supervising authority,” Duhamel said. “Any sanction decisions for nonpayment would be set by the court.”
A judge can look at each case individually to determine if the person who didn’t pay on a given day truly could not afford to, or if they were able to pay and didn’t. Participants can be sanctioned under the latter circumstance, under the terms of the settlement, but not for a legitimate lack of funds. 
The settlement applies to the 37 known members of the class, Leach said, but the class also includes any people who “have been or will in the future be incarcerated in Pennington County, threatened with incarceration or sanctions, based in whole or in part on inability to pay the fees required to participate in the 24-7 Program.” 
The county currently has 352 people in the program.
Other counties, statewide impacts
Lucas Oyler, the program’s former state coordinator, told lawmakers in 2022 that an inability to threaten jail for failure to pay might cause county sheriffs, who administer 24-7 tests, to opt out of participating in the program.
Leach said he doubts that. He said the majority of people who wind up involved in the criminal justice system, even those deemed income-eligible for a court-appointed lawyer, are able to pay $2 a day. 
“But at the same time, there’s a certain group of people who are just poor,” Leach said, in ways that are “far beyond anything” most people have experienced.
‘Treated like a criminal’: Native woman’s death sparks questions

Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead was among the first sheriffs to use 24-7, and he’s been following the Pennington County lawsuit closely. 
The policy for 24-7 participants in Minnehaha County, he said, is built around an understanding that an inability to pay doesn’t justify an immediate jail stay.
“If a person has been released from jail and ordered by a judge to comply with the 24-7 program as a condition of release but cannot pay,” Milstead wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight, “then it is up to the judge to decide whether bond should be revoked, modified, or remain.”
In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight on how counties ought to proceed in the face of the successful class action lawsuit, Attorney General Marty Jackley issued a statement saying his office intends to let counties decide the right approach.
“While we cannot dictate how an agency operates its program,” Jackley wrote, “we are committed to supporting them in ensuring compliance with state statutes and administrative rules.”
Long, the former attorney general who launched the program, said a case can be made that counties — or even community organizations — would benefit in the long run if they decide to pay 24-7 fees for the indigent, who might be “among the ones who’d most benefit from it.”
Keeping habitual drinkers or drug users sober can reduce visits to the emergency room, Long said, as well as business losses from theft.
“There is some community benefit to keeping these folks sober,” Long said.

Wisconsin lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers rushed to finish the state budget in July, ahead of federal legislation making it to President Donald Trump’s desk, to ensure the state draw down additional federal funds. Whether the state will be able to benefit from that funding is now uncertain. 
The 2025-27 state budget included a provision to increase its Medicaid hospital assessment from 1.8% to 6% as a way to supplement the state’s Medicaid resources with matching contributions from the federal government. The change was meant to increase payments to hospitals and to offset the state’s funding for the Medical Assistance program. It was estimated to result in over $1 billion in additional revenue for Wisconsin hospitals. 
A Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis this week found that “preliminary federal guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has created some uncertainty about the allowability of changes to Wisconsin’s hospital assessment.”
29 Marklein Born Revenue Estimates
The analysis said that if the increase is disallowed then it would lead to a general purpose revenue shortfall of $396 million annually — or $792 million in the 2025-27 biennium.
“CMS indicated that this matter will be addressed through formal rule making procedures, and thus will be subject to provisions of notice and public comment. Pending additional information from the federal government, the allowability of the Act 15 changes is not currently known,” the LFB analysis stated. 
A group of eight Democratic state lawmakers, including state Rep. Steve Doyle and Sen. Brad Pfaff, both from Onalaska, sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden urging him to take action to help ensure Wisconsin receives the funds. Following the state budget, Van Orden claimed credit for helping secure the extra funds for the state.
“Our hospitals, and especially our rural hospitals were counting on that funding to keep their
doors open… At a time when our medical institutions are facing unprecedented financial challenges, we must do everything we can to ensure their ability to continue to operate. Our state budget was counting on it, and our constituents’ lives literally depend on it. We implore you to do everything in your power to reverse these catastrophic decisions,” the lawmakers wrote.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Department of Energy/Bechtel)Congress this week approved a $3.2 billion budget for the Hanford nuclear reservation’s cleanup in fiscal 2026 — a more than $200 million increase from the prior two years.
That is more than what the Trump administration originally requested for Hanford, but almost $3 billion less than what Washington officials believe is needed this year to keep the site’s cleanup on its legally mandated timetable. This is also the biggest cleanup budget in Hanford’s history.
President Donald Trump’s budget request allocated slightly less than $400 million to operate Hanford’s biggest project — the new plant to convert the site’s radioactive waste into glass, which began operating in October. 
Congress bumped that budget up to $480 million, according to the office of Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
Murray said in a statement that Thursday’s Senate approval was “a rejection of the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the Hanford cleanup mission.” 
“We cannot do nuclear waste cleanup on the cheap,” she said. 
The House passed the same budget earlier this month.
Washington’s Department of Ecology calculates that Hanford needs a budget of $6.15 billion to meet all of its legal cleanup obligations for fiscal 2026, and $6.76 billion for fiscal 2027. 
Hanford’s cleanup is governed by an often-litigated and often-changed 35-year-old legal agreement between the state, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“The federal government has a big job to do cleaning up Hanford,” Gov. Bob Ferguson,  a Democrat, said in a statement. “This budget is a positive step forward in ensuring they live up to their responsibilities.”
“We have made important progress this year. Let’s keep up the momentum,” he added.
Casey Sixkiller, director of the state ecology department, also acknowledged progress with the cleanup in the past year.
“We need to keep funding at a level where we can accelerate the pace of cleanup and reduce the risk of a catastrophic infrastructure collapse or contamination release,” Sixkiller said. “Now is the time for the federal government to double down and not back away from its legal and moral obligations to the people of Washington state. ”
Hanford is arguably the most radioactively contaminated spot in the Western Hemisphere.
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs, including those exploded in New Mexico and over Nagasaki in 1945. That work created many billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive waste.
The worst 56 million gallons of that waste were pumped into 177 underground tanks. About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
Hanford has just begun converting lesser radioactive wastes in the tanks into a benign glass to be eventually stored at an underground storage site at a still undetermined location. 
A second plant to tackle more radioactive waste could be operating in the 2030s. 
Since the low-activity waste plant will handle only 40-50% of the less radioactive wastes, Hanford recently decided to look into encasing the remaining low-activity materials in a cement-like substance, which would be theoretically faster and cheaper than building a second low-level glassification plant. 
Originally, the legal deadline to finish glassifying all 56 million gallons of tank wastes was 2019. 
Right now, Hanford’s legal target is removing all the waste from 149 single-shell tanks and closing those tanks by 2043, and closing the 28 newer and safer double-shell tanks by 2052. 
The Energy Department has moved those targets back to 2069, a date not reflected in its current cleanup agreements with the state of Washington, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hanford-low-activity-waste-facility-containers-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota must spend $106 million in remaining pandemic relief by the end of the year, or it has to be returned to the federal government.
Most of the funds left to spend are for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, housing, broadband, ambulance upgrades and telemedicine upgrades in nursing homes, according to a Wednesday presentation from the Bureau of Finance and Management at the Capitol in Pierre.
Bureau Commissioner Jim Terwilliger told lawmakers on the budget committee that the state will meet the deadline to “maximize those dollars.”
“We feel like we’re in a good place,” Terwilliger said.
Federal relief and stimulus funding for South Dakota in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included about $974 million from the State Fiscal Recovery Funds authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The unspent balance represents about 10% of that funding.


The funding has been transformative in some sectors of the state. South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources Secretary Hunter Roberts said during the last legislative session the influx of cash sparked an overdue “water renaissance.”
Roberts’ department has $75 million left to spend on water and sewer projects. Some projects that have used ARPA funding so far include upgrades for the Mni Waste Water Company in western South Dakota, a regional waterline upgrade for the Randall Community Water District in eastern South Dakota, and funding for the Western Dakota Regional Water System study.
The bureau receives quarterly department reports for how funding is spent. As the end of 2026 approaches, any unspent funds will be reallocated to water projects.
About $14 million for workforce housing projects, which is roughly a quarter of that program’s ARPA funding, has not been spent. A mix of federal and state funding was approved by lawmakers in 2022 to help increase South Dakota’s housing stock as the state’s population grows. Roughly $64 million in state-funded loans for workforce housing also remain unobligated, with Gov.

About $4 million, which is nearly half of the ARPA funding meant to improve emergency medical services across the state, has not been spent, according to the presentation. About $2 million, which is three-quarters of the ARPA funding promised to nursing home telemedicine upgrades, hasn’t been spent yet either. Both grant programs are under the state Department of Health.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The effort of Mississippi House leaders and others to expand programs providing public funds to private schools validates the oft-repeated quote that “history may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”
Efforts by Mississippi legislators to send public funds to private schools go back to at least the 1960s.
The current effort, led by House Speaker Jason White and buttressed by President Donald Trump and Gov. Tate Reeves, would provide funds to parents to allow them to help pay for the children’s education at a private school.
The argument is made that such a scheme, sending the money to parents to help pay for their child’s private school education, will not violate Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, which states definitively that public money may not go to schools not operating as “free schools.”
The argument is being made that it would be constitutional because the public money is going to the parent instead of the private school. Some would argue that the process is simply trying to achieve through deception what the Mississippi Constitution says is prohibited and, who knows, maybe that is the definition of lawyering.
There have been limited state court cases involving Section 208, and none of those addressed directly the issue of whether providing public funds to a family to be spent on a private school education is constitutional.
It is almost certain that many of the nine members of the Mississippi Supreme Court would prefer not to have to take up the explosive issue. But if the bill passes the Legislature, it is almost certain that it will land in justices’ laps at the state’s highest court.
While it does not appear there has been a state case addressing the particulars that will be in front of the Mississippi Supreme Court if the bill becomes law, in 1969 there was a federal case with similar facts. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a state law sending public funds, called tuition grants, to families to be spent on a private school education.
As the number of Mississippi private schools exploded in the 1960s to provide white students an escape from attending classes with Black students, the Mississippi Legislature passed a bill to provide funds to white students to be used to attend segregationist academies.
Many of those academies still exist today and could benefit if the new effort to provide public funds to private schools becomes law.
The 5th Circuit did not address Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, but instead said the law was discriminatory. The 5th Circuit found that the law “encourages, facilitates and supports the establishment of a system of private schools operated on a racially segregated basis as an alternative available to white students seeking to avoid desegregated public schools.”
Granted, 2026 is much different than the 1960s. There are many private schools that enroll and do a good job educating Black students.
But there are still private schools that take great pride in being the sole overseer of their enrollment criteria. The private schools told legislators during a hearing on the issue last year that they would not relinquish their authority to decide who they enroll.
There are, no doubt, private schools that deny enrollment to certain disabled students because of the high cost of providing those children an education.
And, no doubt, there would be private schools that would balk at enrolling gay or trans students. Some private schools also might deny enrollment to students who openly embrace certain religious practices.
Are those forms of discrimination?
In 1969, like today, the executive branch of the federal government got involved in the issue of sending public funds to private schools. The Trump administration has endorsed the bill pending in the Mississippi Legislature.
In 1969 the Justice Department of then-president Richard Nixon opposed the effort to provide “tuition grants” for students to attend private schools.
The opposing positions taken by the two presidents perhaps proves that sometimes history does not repeat itself and doesn’t even rhyme.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/07022545/IMG-3225.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

The brave
Marga Camarinta, 15, Manchester Center

I am 4,
and a self-proclaimed 
hero of bravery.

The plane whirs in my ears,
loud and incessant and monstrous,
but I sit as calmly as I can.
Solemn and stoic
is this sugar-stuffed knight.

In this dark, blue light,
in this hollow, titanium titan,
I am illuminated by wonder.

Questions…
questions about a foreign land,
one shrouded in mystery,
with unfamiliar faces.
Like a faraway fantasy,

but tangible to the tips of my small, sticky fingers.

The United States of America:
the land of the free,
and apparently, 
the home of the brave.

Yet so unlike the home I am accustomed to,
and so far away from the ones I love.

But just as this hero feels herself falter
and fall into the mouth of the monster that is her fears,
she is swept up by a warm, wooly embrace,
rescued by her own hero of bravery:
her dazzling, fearless Mom.

The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour, putting the Hinesburg department relatively in line with other Chittenden County police forces.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in The Citizen on Jan. 15, 2026.
The Hinesburg police union, recognized by the town last June, has officially inked a contract with the town of Hinesburg.
The contract, which will go into effect in July, is set to last until June 2029 and outlines a slew of worker protections and benefits along with a step system for annual pay raises. The contract also comes at a time when Hinesburg is oriented toward building back up its police department, both by hiring a chief and filling out its vacant officer positions.
The Hinesburg officers had previously unionized under the Fraternal Order of Police in 2021, but never successfully negotiated a contract. Last year, they organized under the New England Police Benevolent Association and quickly began negotiations, which have been ongoing since the summer.
While contract negotiations inevitably lend some question as to whether pay raises or changes in benefits may impact a budget, according to town manager Todd Odit, the contract signed by the selectboard and union representatives will not change any of the calculations for the police budget as it is currently drafted. The selectboard has been debating increasing the number of budgeted officers from five to six, but the calculation for what each officer might cost will not change.
The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour. This puts the Hinesburg department fairly in line with other Chittenden County towns and their own police forces. According to various job postings, towns range in starting pay from around $30 in Winooski to over $37 in Burlington. That includes a $34 starting wage in Williston and just over $31 an hour in South Burlington.
For departments across Vermont, successful contract negotiations can represent a renewed ability to vie for officers. The state is currently in a police shortage, with active postings in communities across the county that have been open for months or longer. If an officer isn’t happy with their position, it’s not difficult to find another.
Right now, Hinesburg only has three officers, including interim police chief Frank Bryan, of the five it has budgeted. In October, in outlining a departmental case for an increased budget, Bryan advocated to increase the base pay to $36 an hour as well as for additional officers.
“The more we overwork these guys, the more likely they are to say, ‘hey, I can probably make just as much money, if not more money in another town,’” Bryan said. He added that increases to the budget and base pay would not only help the town retain officers, but hire new ones.
There are other elements to the new contract that might be appealing to an incoming officer. For one, there is the possibility for a sign-on bonus of up to $10,000. Additionally, come July, Hinesburg’s officers will have four hours of flexible unpaid leave every month which can be used for things such as attending a child’s parent-teacher conference or bringing an elder to a doctor’s appointment. The officers will also have a labor-management committee to address workplace issues outside of union negotiations.
Along with the budget discussions, this contract is also coming into effect as Hinesburg searches for a new police chief. The town hired consultants to conduct a search for applicants and brought on two community members to give feedback on the process. As of Jan. 7, Odit said the town had entered the second round of interviews with candidates.
Odit has long contended that stable leadership is imperative to attracting and retaining officers. Should a new chief soon be found, in conjunction with the new union contract, the town may be well positioned to start trying to fill out its roster — whether or not the selectboard approves a budget decision that increases the town’s total officer count from five to six.

Many teenagers wallpaper their bedrooms with pinups of hot celebrities. Jessie Diggins, the most-awarded U.S. cross-country skier in history, instead tacked up an “Endless Winter” poster of a less-recognized hero: Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American Nordic racer to win an Olympic medal.
“He looked like he was having fun,” Diggins, who grew up in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Afton, Minnesota, recently recalled of the athlete-in-action shot. “It was the pure joy of life. That for me is what it’s all about.”
Moving to the Green Mountain State in 2012, a 20-year-old Diggins joined Stratton’s SMS T2 elite training team in hopes of following in Koch’s footsteps.

“I took a blind leap of faith as this young, naive total nobody when I moved out here,” she said in an interview.
Fourteen years later, Diggins — currently ranked the globe’s No. 1 female cross-country skier, with Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals and three overall-season World Cups — is set to wrap up her racing career this March after her fourth and final Winter Games.
“Her world-class engine, her unique combination of fearlessness and vulnerability, and her willingness to tell the world about her frailties is what has made Diggins an icon to plenty of people,” the New York Times wrote in its report on her pending retirement.
For all her stratospheric success, Diggins remains down-to-earth. Take her turn as a de facto cater-waiter when she crushed bags of ice into a beverage tub at a recent $100-a-plate Stratton dinner in her honor.
“This community really took me in,” the 34-year-old said. “I honestly believe this is the best place in the world to train. You feel really supported, and I’m able to get all the things that I need to learn and grow.”
It’s why Diggins keeps finding ways to give back.
‘A whole different story’
Diggins, born in the pre-digital days of 1991, doesn’t have a trope childhood memory of skiing before walking. Instead, she first saw Nordic racing on a VHS tape.
“I’m not going to lie,” she wrote in her 2020 memoir “Brave Enough.” “I wasn’t all that into it.”
Diggins changed her mind when she learned that winners left with a prize.
Joining the Minnesota Youth Ski League at age 3, Diggins ran out of levels to compete in by 10. Worried about juggling homework with practice six days a week, she almost didn’t join the cross-country team in seventh-grade, only to train with the varsity girls and, by her senior year of high school, score straight As and a state championship.
“On the outside, school and sports and dating were going great,” she wrote. “But on the inside, it was a whole different story.”
While classmates saw her as an all-American free spirit and picture of fitness, Diggins — watching her body morph from a girl to a woman — began to eye what she thought was fat. Her memoir recounts her struggle with eating disorders before a family intervention led her to the national Emily Program nonprofit treatment network.
“I’m so lucky to be here and be alive,” she wrote. “This secret, left to its own devices, might have killed me.”

Diggins earned entrance to the U.S. ski team and World Cup racing circuit in 2011, spurring her move to Vermont the next year. Training with Stratton’s SMS T2 crew, she soon found herself alongside one of its founders: Koch, who acquiesced to autographing her childhood poster.
Diggins would compete in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, then win U.S. cross-country’s first-ever Olympic gold medal in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and a silver (after a bout of food poisoning) and bronze in 2022 in Beijing, China.
In World Cup racing, Diggins became the first American woman to score the season Nordic title in 2021 (Koch became the first U.S. man to do so in 1982) and repeated the feat in 2023 and 2025.
Headed back to the Olympics, Diggins is plugging into social media to connect with fans in her home state of Minnesota, training site in Vermont and Boston suburb where she lives with her husband, financial analyst Wade Poplawski, in Massachusetts.
The skier happily lays claim to them all.
“I’ve been welcomed and adopted by all these different states,” she said. “It’s triple the love.”
‘I have a much bigger platform’
Diggins has yet to announce what she’ll do upon retiring after this March’s World Cup finals in Lake Placid, New York, although she’s noted a desire to start a family and already has after-hours partnerships with the Emily Program, the climate-advocating Protect Our Winters and the ski-instructing Share Winter Foundation.
For several summers, Diggins has joined the Bill Koch Youth Ski League for a fundraising hike up Stratton Mountain. Asked this past August for her biggest challenge, she told students about the 50-kilometer skate at last year’s world championship in Trondheim, Norway.
“I came in as a heavy medal favorite,” she recalled. “There were a lot of cameras and lights and pressure on me.”
Three minutes into the long race, she lagged behind a large field of competitors and realized she wasn’t going to win.
“I had to make a difficult decision. Do I drop out? Do I make some sort of excuse? Or do I finish because I love what I do?”
Determined to continue, Diggins pushed forward for the next two hours and 40 minutes.
“It was the hardest thing I’d ever done, but it was a really good experience,” she said of her 22nd-place finish. “When you win a race, you don’t really learn a whole lot, but when you lose, you get a chance to reexamine: Is this still fun? Do I still love training?”
In that moment, Diggins answered affirmatively, propelling her into this current end-on-a-high-note season.
“Sometimes,” she told students, “having a really, really bad day is what you need to continue to have good days.”

After Covid limited crowds at the 2022 Olympics, Diggins is set to travel with her family, friends and trademark face glitter to next month’s Winter Games in Italy. But she’s less interested in the destination than the journey there.
“You really have to enjoy the process of what you’re doing every day, because even if you win, the award ceremony will last 10 minutes — and it’ll be the best 10 minutes of your life — and then it will be over,” she said. “If you don’t love working hard, improving, and everything else that goes into it and you get out of it, then winning isn’t going to change your life.”
That’s why Diggins focuses on the present rather than the future.
“In racing, I want to cross the finish line and look back and say, ‘I used this chance and I gave it my all. That’s the approach I have with advocacy, too. I have a much bigger platform, and I’ve found myself thinking, ‘I have to do something with this.’ If there’s a way I can make a difference, then I want to try.”

Although overall town populations in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore have increased over the last decade, school enrollment has declined by 10% since 2017, according to a new study.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in News & Citizen on Jan. 15, 2026.
A study commissioned by the Lamoille South Supervisory Union predicts that school enrollments in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore will decline 10% by the 2030 school year, reflecting trends in rural towns throughout Vermont as the state ages and grows increasingly expensive.
At recent Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school board meetings, Lamoille South Supervisory Union Superintendent Ryan Heraty introduced the study to school board members and explained how the supervisory union might react to a slow enrollment decline over the next four years.
The study was produced by the Boston firm Statistical Forecasting LLC. In 2021, the supervisory union hired the New England Development Council to conduct a similar study, but the results were largely rejected due to controversial options for utilizing Lamoille South’s eight buildings, including shuttering some of them and rerouting students to different locations.
Heraty said the new report is focused more narrowly on student population and doesn’t make recommendations. Enrollment trends in local schools are frequently referenced in housing and affordability discussions throughout Lamoille County, particularly in Stowe, and the Stowe School board wanted a study that dovetails with the Town of Stowe’s Housing Needs Assessment.
“With all of the statewide discussion around consolidation and thinking about Vermont’s overall demographic trends, leaning towards an aging population, declining student enrollments — all of that — we want to think more local,” Heraty said. “How is this going to impact our schools here? And what do we see around housing trends that are going to impact our kindergarten, first and second grade enrollments so that we can start preparing for the future?”
Although overall town populations in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore have increased over the last decade, and are expected to increase in the future, according to the study, school enrollments in those towns have declined by 10%, from 1,592 in 2016 to 1,406 this year, after peaking at 1,694 students in 2017.
Throughout the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, kindergarten through fifth-grade classrooms have experienced the largest decline over the last eight years. Enrollment for that age group is currently at 544, a decrease of 132 students since 2016. According to the study, school enrollment for that age group is expected to dip over the next three years before leveling out at this year’s figure by 2030.
Enrollment for grades 6-8 has held relatively steady, declining by just 48 students over the last eight years, but that figure is expected to decline another 65 students by 2030.
High school enrollment district-wide has swung by nearly 100 students over the last eight years, ranging from 497 to 589, but figures for 2016 and 2025 are nearly even at 521 and 515, respectively. By 2030, that high school enrollment is expected to decline 12%.
While the study illustrated what many in Lamoille County’s housing and affordability circle already recognize — that a lack of viable housing and declining homestead rates are impacting local school enrollments — members of the Stowe school board said they aren’t necessarily concerned about declining enrollment.
“In my experience, it’s not unusual to see these ups and downs,” Stowe School Board Chair Tiffany Donza said.
In Stowe and Morristown, atypically large high school classes are currently graduating, inflating enrollment trends over the last few years, but elementary school enrollment has been low, partially explaining a projected enrollment decline by 2030 as those students move through the school system.
Prior to Act 60 and Act 68, both of which imposed a new funding formula for Vermont schools, Donza said enrollment wasn’t as much of a consideration. But the new formula started rewarding districts with more students and schools started watching their numbers closely, Donza said.
“It made it so students come with dollars,” Donza said, “Which is a disadvantage to Stowe for so many reasons.”
To understand enrollment trends, Heraty pointed to the median age of a community, saying those small elementary school classes coming up are indicative of greater housing and affordability issues facing families.
According to the study by Statistical Forecasting LLC, a housing boom from 1990 to 2009 benefitted a younger median age group who were moving to town. But as that group ages, and their children graduate, housing development has rapidly declined, and the median age has increased.
From 2000 to 2009, 1,207 homes were built in the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, almost twice as many as the next decade. From 2010 to 2020, there were only 666 homes built, according to the study. Stowe’s grand list has also increased significantly and the homestead rate has declined.
“The problem isn’t demand; it’s availability of affordable housing,” Heraty said. “It’s really hard to be in a position where you know that people want to be here and they want to live in our communities, but the housing just doesn’t exist for them.”
While Heraty is not sounding the alarm of declining enrollment, the Lamoille South Supervisory Union has begun making subtle changes to respond to the trend.
The supervisory union has already reduced central office positions and will reduce support staff positions this year.
“We don’t need to look at this as a negative,” Donza said. “We just need to plan for it and properly staff the schools.”

Jeff Landry now has to balance his duties as Louisiana's governor with his new role as President Donald Trump's special envoy to Greenland. (Photo by Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Most of Jeff Landry’s predecessors as Louisiana governor never saw the need for a side hustle. For them, running the state was more than enough of a job. 
But Landry has made it clear he doesn’t want to be like other governors. His chutzpah might have been why the governor felt comfortable asking President Donald Trump to name him special envoy to Greenland on top of his duties overseeing Louisiana. 
Trump has made increasingly charged remarks in recent days about the United States taking control of Greenland, a self-ruling territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. In response, several European countries have announced their support for Greenland, with some launching military exercises to back up their stance. 

To what extent it is practical for the governor of Louisiana to be involved with the sensitive, international negotiations over Greenland that have much of Europe on edge while also managing one of the neediest states in the country remains to be seen.
“Most of us in Louisiana would think he is supposed to have a full-time job already,” said Terry Ryder, who served as general counsel for former Govs. Mike Foster and Kathleen Blanco and worked for former Govs. Buddy Roemer and Bobby Jindal. 

“Having been with multiple administrations, four administrations, there is always way more to do than any one governor can do,” Ryder said. 
Foreign affairs experts agreed it could be challenging for Landry to hold both roles at the same time. Special envoys, particularly ones handling high-profile issues for the White House, are often expected to devote their full attention to their assignment, they said. 
“Anytime you have two jobs, you are probably not doing either of them very well,” said Barbara Bodine, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen who is now the director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. 
“It is going to take a lot of his time out of state,” Bodine said of the envoy position. “There is no way you can be governor of Louisiana by Zoom.”
Landry’s staff declined to answer almost all questions emailed to them last week about the governor’s role as special envoy, including one regarding concerns the position could distract from his job as governor.

How much time will Landry spend on Greenland? His staff won’t say.
Landry isn’t being paid for his work as special envoy, his state staff said. But how much energy he will spend on Greenland isn’t clear.
Landry went to Washington, D.C., Thursday to participate in discussions that included the Trump administration, members of Congress and emissaries from Greenland and Denmark. He has also appeared in person on national television shows to talk about Greenland during a New York trip earlier this month. 
The governor’s office would not provide an estimate for how many hours Landry expects to spend per month on his Greenland role or to what extent he would be traveling for those duties.
Questions about whether Landry will receive federal staff or a D.C. office for his envoy role went unanswered by the governor’s staff. The U.S. Department of State and the White House press offices also didn’t answer questions about the federal resources Landry might receive. 
Foreign diplomacy experts said there are no set rules for an envoy, including whether the role is done on a part- or full-time basis. Historically, presidents have used special envoys because the positions allow for that type of flexibility. 
“It can be full time for a while, and then there is a pause in negotiations, and the envoy goes back to whatever they were doing before and just keeps a watchful eye on the matter,” James Bishop, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, Liberia and Somalia, said in an interview. 
Given Trump’s intense focus on Greenland, however, foreign policy experts said Landry, as special envoy, would normally receive some federal staff support at the U.S. State Department on a temporary basis.

Landry would also be expected to make negotiations over Greenland his top priority while the discussions are taking place, the experts said.

“A sitting governor who intends to keep his day job is unusual, to say the least, because one of the reasons that you have a special envoy is that you have an issue that is meddlesome, and you need to find somebody who can focus on that issue to try to resolve it,” said Bodine, who teaches about the role of special envoys in one of her classes at Georgetown.

In recent history, Bill Richardson is the only other governor who had a strong hand in foreign affairs while holding his state office. The Democrat worked as a “freelance diplomat” to get American hostages released while leading New Mexico from 2003-11, although he was never designated a special envoy for the president during that time. 

Unlike Landry, Richardson had significant experience in foreign relations before he became governor. He first helped free an American hostage in 1994 during a trip to North Korea that he took as a New Mexico congressman, and he served as President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to the United Nations in 1997-98.

Landry says he wants Greenland deals for Louisiana 
While no connection between Greenland and Louisiana is apparent, it hasn’t stopped Landry from trying to make one with the arctic island. 

“They tell me they like to hunt, they like to fish, they like to have a good time. I’m like, ‘Y’all belong in Louisiana,’” Landry said on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio this month. 

The governor has also taken great pains, even on national broadcasts, to say he will use his role as special envoy to Greenland to create business investment for Louisiana. 

“I can’t wait to have discussions with Greenland about the opportunities that we can do in Louisiana,” Landry said during an appearance on CNBC Squawk Box.
The Louisiana Economic Development agency, which is run by a Landry appointee, is not actively working on business deals in Greenland but would welcome those types of projects, according to a spokeswoman. 
“[W]e are excited about the future opportunities that Governor Landry’s new role brings,” Emma Wagner said for the agency in a written statement. 
Talk of mixing Louisiana’s business with his special envoy duties alarmed foreign policy experts interviewed for this story. They said the governor using a diplomatic role abroad to gin up investment for the state would create ethical concerns and possibly run afoul of federal law. 
“It could get messy if, for example, any company that has an office, much less a headquarters, in Louisiana that would benefit from mining, refining or shipping,” Bodine said. 
There have also been questions about whether Landry might be violating a Louisiana constitutional law that prohibits public officials from holding federal and state jobs at the same time. But Ryder, who worked for four governors as an attorney, said he doubts Landry’s unpaid role will raise concerns.

“I would say the less formal it is, the safer it is for him,” Ryder said. “There is nothing wrong with a governor helping the president of the United States.” 
Whether Landry’s Greenland assignment will be popular with Louisiana voters is another matter. Former Gov. Bobby Jindal saw his polling numbers tank while he started traveling frequently to raise money and generate support for his 2016 presidential campaign. 

Bernie Pinsonat, a Louisiana political consultant and polling expert, doubts Louisiana voters have paid much attention to the governor’s Greenland job. Landry’s approval ratings are already low, standing at 39% according to one recent poll, but won’t necessarily sink further because of the special envoy job, he said.

“I’ll guarantee you that if [Louisiana voters] think he’s too involved in national politics versus what he’s doing here, believe me, he’ll suffer,” the pollster said. “But I don’t think he’s anywhere near that.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BR.specialsession.110724_HS_1722-1024x998.jpg,,,2026-01-18 06:56:56.816249

Winthrop Rockefeller was the only Southern governor to hold a public memorial following the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.
The indelible image of a white governor joining hands with Black mourners to sing “We Shall Overcome” was needed to heal a city that was just a couple hours away from where King was killed.
The moment was also a reminder of how Arkansas shines the best when its leaders find ways to highlight the importance of civil rights rather than shy away. Arkansas needs to find more avenues to do so, even in a hyperpartisan environment.
The state’s move nearly a decade ago to remove Robert E. Lee’s name from the state holiday honoring King was a step in the right direction. The joint holiday honoring the civil rights icon alongside the Confederate general had become an embarrassment for the state, especially as pictures of the state notices about the joint holiday gained traction on social media.
That embarrassment was enough for Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to add the issue to his legislative agenda and take the rare step of testifying before a legislative committee in favor of it.
The state has made other signs of progress, at least symbolically. 
The decision to replace one of the state’s statues in the U.S. Capitol with one of Daisy Bates, the civil rights leader who mentored the nine students who integrated Central High School, was a necessary statement to be made in a building where statues of Confederate leaders can still be found.

A lesser but still significant step was taken by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signing legislation creating a specialty license plate honoring the Central High historic site.
But elsewhere there have been stumbles and missed opportunities. That includes the effort to no longer honor the Confederacy with one of the stars on Arkansas’ flag, a proposal that failed before a legislative committee. Similarly, a bid to end the state’s commemoration of “Confederate Flag Day” passed the House in 2021 but failed before a Senate panel.
The current political climate isn’t encouraging for another attempt at these measures. President Donald Trump has defended Confederate figures and symbols, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken moves to restore the names of Confederate generals to military bases.
Sanders has echoed Trump’s rhetoric complaining about “indoctrination” in the classroom, with a law she signed prohibiting critical race theory from being taught in public schools that’s sparked a legal fight. The prohibition has also drawn criticism from civil rights groups who say the restriction threatens to whitewash history. A federal appeals court panel last year allowed the law to be enforced in the state. 
Arkansas is running out of opportunities to properly honor that history instead of engaging in fights over it. Many of the leaders and key figures of the Civil Rights Movement are gone, including Claudette Colvin, who died last week. Two of the Little Rock Nine have died, leaving only seven of those civil rights icons left. 
Next year marks 70 years since the Little Rock desegregation crisis, and it may be one of the last times that an anniversary can be commemorated with most of the Little Rock Nine on hand. The sad truth is that despite the symbolic progress that’s been made, Arkansas remains a state where symbols and monuments of the Confederacy significantly outnumber tributes to the state’s civil rights icons.
It’s easy to echo talking points about heritage and much harder to admit that true patriotism requires embracing a full history. It requires elevating civil rights heroes, and acknowledging a country and state’s shameful past. 
Finding a way to do so in this environment might be the best monument.

The Legislature will reconvene for a three-day special session on Wednesday. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers plan to hold a three-day special session starting Wednesday, but it’s still unclear if they’ll discuss any bills other than five focused on the federal Rural Health Transformation Program.
Legislative leaders will decide Tuesday afternoon if additional bills will be allowed. That means the public will have a tight window to provide input on potential legislation. Gov. Kelly Armstrong will deliver a State of the State address at 10 a.m. Wednesday.
What we know
At least five bills will be introduced, focused on the federal rural health care funding, the reason Armstrong called the special session. One is an appropriations bill to approve spending $199 million of federal funding this year and authorizing $200 million anticipated for next year. A hearing is set for 10:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Four health policy bills also will be introduced. The one likely to get the most debate would expand the prescriptive authority of pharmacists, which proponents say could make it easier for rural North Dakotans to get treated for common conditions. A hearing for that bill is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday. 

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

Lawmakers also will consider a bill that would require K-12 students to take the presidential fitness test; a bill to require one-hour of continuing education for doctors related to healthy eating; and a bill to include physician assistants in a state licensure compact.
Hearings on those policy bills are scheduled between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Wednesday. For specific information, including links to submit written testimony, visit the committee hearing schedule. Some written testimony is due as early as 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Lawmakers also will accept public testimony in person and online, though they prioritize in-person testimony.
Lawmakers are proposing the policy bills in order to fulfill criteria for additional federal funding through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid’s grant application process. Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, warned any substantial modifications to those bills come with the risk of losing some of the state’s $199 million grant. 
“If any of those four policy bills do not pass in the form that we have them, or if they’re significantly changed from the form that CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) wanted us to draft as policies, then we could see reductions in funding or clawbacks of that funding,” said Bekkedahl, who will co-chair a joint Appropriations Committee during the special session. 


What we don’t know
The Legislative Management committee will meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday to hear pitches from lawmakers about other legislation for the special session. Lawmakers will have five minutes to explain their bill draft and why it’s an emergency that can’t wait until 2027.
We don’t know all of the topics that could be addressed. Those bill drafts are expected to become public on the legislative website on Monday on the Legislative Management meeting agenda.
One bill that will be pitched during that meeting is a proposal to provide free school meals to all K-12 students, similar to a ballot measure that’s circulating. It will be up to the bipartisan committee of legislative leaders to decide if the bill advances to the full Legislature on Wednesday.
If the committee does not advance a bill, a lawmaker could still attempt to introduce it from the Senate or House floor. The bill would need support from at least two-thirds of the members to be introduced.
How the public can participate
All legislative proceedings, including the governor’s speech, are open to the public and livestreamed on the legislative website.

Affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Emilie Tenenbaum and Sharron Harrington: Why Vermont must stay committed to child care.","This commentary is by Emilie Tenenbaum, the executive director of Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, and Sharron Harrington, the executive director of the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children.
Across political lines and communities, most Vermonters agree that young families should be able to afford to live and work here. 
The good news is that the long-term investments in child care arising from Act 76 (Vermont’s landmark child care law passed in 2023) are moving us toward this shared vision. 
Early childhood connects to many of Vermont’s biggest policy challenges, from affordability to school readiness. We know that investing in quality child care leads to better results down the road, including improved health outcomes and higher graduation and employment rates. 
Since 2023, Vermont’s bold investments in child care access and affordability have begun to reshape what’s possible. 
In the last two years, more than 5,000 additional children and their families have accessed tuition assistance to help pay for quality child care. Over 100 new child care programs have opened, creating 1,700 new spaces for children and 400 new early childhood educator jobs. 
Parents tell us these changes have helped them afford to stay in Vermont, participate in the workforce, and start or grow their families. Investing in child care delivers results that every Vermont policymaker wants to see and that Vermonters deserve.
It’s essential that lawmakers stay committed to investments proven to work. To put it bluntly: while our momentum is real, continued progress is not guaranteed unless our state remains committed to child care. 
That’s why we are focused this year on the following policy priorities: protecting the child care funding driving Vermont’s success; strengthening our early childhood educator workforce; increasing child care access and affordability; and fixing delays in fingerprinting and background checks, which are critical for safety and staffing. 
Together, our organizations represent more than a decade of statewide coalition building. Our recommendations come from ongoing engagement with families, early childhood educators, employers and partners.
First and foremost, we must protect the funding driving these systems-level improvements. Act 76 created more than $100 million in long-term public investment, which was supported by Vermont businesses and citizens because they recognize that affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
The numbers show it’s paying off. As lawmakers craft the budget for fiscal year 2027, funding for child care must not be diverted.
The continued success of our child care commitment depends on strengthening and growing our early childhood educator workforce. Children have better outcomes in school and beyond when their earliest experiences are supported by a qualified early childhood educator.
Expanding access for children only happens when there are enough qualified early childhood educators to care for them. The best way to do this is to establish professional recognition for early childhood educators. 
The Early Childhood Educator Profession Bill (introduced as S.206) creates professional recognition for more than 6,500 educators working in child care programs outside our public schools. 
It is workforce-informed, workforce-strengthening legislation that addresses regulatory gaps and creates a transparent, supportive system for parents, educators, hiring programs and the public. It connects educators’ accountability and compensation to their qualifications — just like any other profession.
It professionalizes a workforce without which our state cannot function, and it does so while supporting, rather than displacing, the talented educators already doing the work. 
As we work toward accessible, affordable, quality child care for every family that needs it, we’ll continue to advocate for improvements. For some families earning more than the tuition assistance threshold, affordable child care still remains out of reach.
Meanwhile, measures improving child care quality are clearly working. Programs helping early childhood educators earn credentials and degrees are extremely popular; training, coaching, and targeted supports are improving child care quality statewide. 
Lawmakers must continue to increase access, lower costs, improve quality, and expand programs that help recruit and retain educators — especially in rural regions and for families with unique needs, like nonstandard work hours.
They also need to fix Vermont’s fingerprint and background check delays. Child safety depends on efficient, thorough criminal background checks for anyone working in child care. The current lengthy delays worsen staffing shortages across child care and afterschool programs. 
Vermont’s commitment to child care is a source of statewide pride. We must protect and strengthen that commitment: keep growing child care programs, keep strengthening our early childhood educator workforce, and keep improving outcomes for children, families, and our economy. 
Vermont’s future depends on what we do next.

But some concerns linger about privacy issues.","Drivers who speed down Route 66 on the border of Middletown and Middlefield are getting hit with an automatic $50 fine. The second time they’re caught in a month costs $75. 
Middletown is one of the first municipalities in Connecticut to install speed cameras in town — but it won’t be the last. After the Connecticut legislature passed a law in 2023 allowing municipalities to install red light and speed cameras and collect fines from drivers who break the law, cities and towns have been presenting extensive plans to the state Department of Transportation in bids to procure their own monitoring devices. So far, 11 have had plans approved and three more are under consideration.
The 2023 law says that municipalities can install cameras that will capture drivers who speed and run red lights. After an initial 30-day period of written warnings, drivers who drive more than 10 mph over the speed limit or run a red light will be issued a fine. 
According to the Middletown police, the area on Route 66 near the camera is a hotspot for speeders. The limit is 35 mph, but the police have caught drivers going more than twice as fast. 
Middletown Police Chief Erik Costa said he would need significantly more police officers to catch as many people speeding as the camera was able to. He said it has also “changed the culture” of driving in that part of the city, where there are multiple apartment buildings and large retail stores. 

Towns that want to install speed cameras have to create plans that include quite a bit of information, including data on traffic stops and crashes in the areas where the proposed cameras would be installed. 
According to Middletown’s plan, the police department made 455 traffic stops over the last three years in the area on Route 66 where the camera was to be located.
From the time the camera went live in July through December 2025, the department issued about 46,000 citations for the same area. As of early December, the department had collected $1.84 million in fines out of a total of $2.8 million issued, according to Costa. 
“ The force multiplier that the cameras take care of is tremendous,” Costa said. 
Costa said the cameras have allowed him to send his police officers to patrol other “hot spots” in town. 
The town recently installed two more traffic cameras, near Spencer and Moody elementary schools. Costa said the areas near those schools have no lighting or stop signs for controlling traffic. The roads slope downward and the intersections are at odd angles, making the cameras necessary. 
“ We really are focused on maintaining good speeds in that area so we don’t have any tragedy and especially during the transition of our buses and family pickup for students,” he said.

‘The only thing … that has actually worked’
So far, the state has approved traffic cameras in 11 municipalities — New Haven, Middletown, Washington, Beacon Falls, Marlborough, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Greenwich, Stamford and Wethersfield. 
The municipality of Washington, a town in Litchfield County with a population of about 3,600 in 2021, was the first to install cameras. The plan submitted to the state said because Washington shares a resident state trooper with surrounding towns, the town needs additional resources in order to enforce traffic laws.  
Richard Inniamo, Washington’s resident state trooper, said in early December that the town’s three cameras had issued upwards of 13,400 citations since May of last year. 
“People are slowing down for them, and that’s all we really wanted,” Inniamo said. He added that where people used to travel more than 20 mph over the speed limit, they are now staying within 10 mph to 15 mph of the speed limit. 
According to Jim Bretton, Washington’s first selectman, in early December the town had collected roughly 75% of the $662,000 it has issued in fines. Bretton agreed with Inniamo that the cameras have slowed down drivers. He said citations peaked in June, a month after the cameras were installed. Since then, the number has dropped.  
“Honestly, it’s the only thing to date that has actually worked,” Bretton said, adding that the town had tried installing speed bumps, and offering more education, to no avail. 
Bretton said the town saw the cameras as a way to improve pedestrian safety, a top concern.
“As a rural community, we’ve got people out constantly with their children with their pets walking the roads. It was virtually every road was a speedway,” he said. 
Data from Marlborough shows that the two cameras installed on North Main Street caught 8,600 speeding events between July and December 2025 and issued 6,500 citations. According to a presentation that Town Manager David Porter gave to the Capitol Region Council of Governments, the percentage of people driving over the speed limit dropped significantly when the cameras were installed and continued to drop over the course of the first few months they were active.

“Speed cameras have been enormously successful at making that road much safer,” Porter told the Board of Selectmen at a meeting on Dec. 16. 
But Porter also said that state rules requiring the data to be erased after 30 days made it difficult to keep track of repeat offenders. He said he would like to see the time limit increased to 60 or 90 days. 
So far, he said, the town has collected $186,924 after paying fees to the camera vendor. 
The towns have contracted with a variety of vendors to provide the cameras and software. A purchase order from August 2024 shows that Middletown paid about $3,900 to the firm Traffic Logix for a speed camera. The town paid $4,000 to Dacra Tech for the camera’s operating system and will also pay the firm a monthly fee based on the number of citations and warnings issued: $13.50 per citation and $6 per warning. 
Costa said the cost of the speed cameras will be funded by fees from violations. Under the 2023 law, fees collected from traffic violations must go either toward paying for the speed and red light cameras or toward transportation infrastructure.
Privacy concerns
Privacy concerns have been raised, not only with the use of red light and speed cameras but with all surveillance technology.
Late last year, the ACLU called for a temporary ban on automatic license plate readers out of concerns the information the devices collect could be used by federal agents for immigration enforcement or to penalize people seeking abortions or transgender care. 
Although Connecticut’s law strictly regulates the way data collected by speed and red light cameras can be used, Dan Barrett, the legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said the organization is concerned about their use. 
“The pervasive surveillance means that so much more evil is possible,” Barrett said. 
State law mandates that any data collected by speed or red light cameras can only be used to track those violations. It can’t be used, for example, to track someone who has committed a crime. 
Still, some municipal officials, while assessing the need for the cameras, have expressed concerns about potential collateral effects.
In September, the town of East Hartford approved a detailed ordinance regulating all surveillance technologies, including license plate readers, speed and red light cameras and drones. Don Bell, the town council vice chair, said at the council’s September meeting that the strict state regulations around speed and red light camera data helped quell his fears that the program might overcharge or discriminate against certain residents. 
Still, he said, he felt some “discomfort” about the use of the devices.
“We know that surveillance technology, good intentions or not, often disproportionately impacts communities of color. As one of the most diverse communities in the state, throughout this process I’ve worried if I might unintentionally hurt East Hartford by supporting any ordinance that opens the door for new technology,” Bell said. 
The ordinance places regulations around surveillance cameras that are similar to the ones the state places on speed and red light cameras, limiting the way the data can be used and how long it can be kept. The ordinance also prohibits the use of facial recognition technology. 
The town has not yet proposed installing any red light or speed cameras. 
People who receive citations are able to contest them and ask for a hearing. There are six valid reasons under the law for overturning violations: if a traffic light was broken, a driver had to get out of the way of an emergency vehicle, a driver was directed to ignore the traffic light by an officer, the camera was calibrated incorrectly, the vehicle in question had been stolen or the vehicle was an emergency vehicle. 
The citations are civil violations, meaning that drivers will not receive points on their licenses, and the violations will not be reported to insurance companies. 
New Haven
Connecticut’s largest cities have also started to invest in the technology. 
The New Haven town council voted in November to approve a contract with the firm NovoaGlobal to install traffic cameras. The city applied to install 19 red light and speed cameras at various intersections. The state Department of Transportation approved 15 of the 19 requested. 
Overall, New Haven was the site of 20,000 crashes between 2020 and 2022, including about 250 in which someone was seriously injured and 58 in which someone was killed, according to the plan New Haven submitted to DOT.
Several of the sites the city chose for the cameras were locations where pedestrians had been struck and killed by motor vehicles in the last five years. 
At one of the intersections, where Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd crosses Church Street, more than 70 crashes occurred between 2020 and 2022. In 2024, a bicyclist was hit by a garbage truck and killed at the intersection, and a pedestrian was injured during a crash in which one vehicle ran a red light. 
Mayor Justin Elicker said the traffic cameras were one tool in a larger plan to curb traffic accidents in New Haven. He said the city has doubled the number of officers assigned to traffic enforcement and is installing speed bumps and modifying roads to slow drivers down. The city is also installing cameras on school buses that record drivers passing buses when they’re stopped. 
“In general, there’s still dangerous driving, but we have seen a lot of progress overall in the city,” Elicker said. 
Elicker said the cameras were an advantage not just because they were able to monitor traffic 24/7 but because certain intersections made it difficult for a police officer to pull someone over even if the officer happened to witness a violation. 
“ The cameras are not just helpful to have more enforcement eyes on the street but also to keep our officers and community members safe,” Elicker said. 
Hartford
While the state has not yet approved its application, the Hartford city council voted in November in favor of a plan to install traffic cameras at 11 locations near schools in the city.
According to the proposal the city submitted to the state Department of Transportation, multiple pedestrians had been killed at the potential camera site on Main Street near S.A.N.D. Academy in the past two years. Other potential locations were places where drivers had put students at risk, like at the Parkville Community School. 
“School staff report that students crossing Park Street near New Park Avenue have experienced near misses with speeding drivers,” the report noted. 
In an area on Wethersfield Avenue near Burr Middle School and Bulkeley High School, more than 100 crashes had taken place within the prior three years, according to the proposal.   
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam told CT Mirror that the city saw the 11 cameras as a pilot program. He said that focusing on the schools would improve multiple neighborhoods across the city and prioritize the safety of children. 
“ I’ve heard time and time again from families about the toll that reckless driving has taken. And as we all know, it’s gotten so much worse after COVID,” he said. “ We want to be able to have residents feel safe in every neighborhood that they’re in across the city and driving is clearly a major public safety concern.” 
“I think actually that [the cameras] will disproportionately help victims of color, and I think we’re going to find a mix of folks from outside of Hartford who are perpetuating many of these traffic violations,” he said. 
Bridgeport
Other cities remain skeptical. On Jan. 6, members of the Bridgeport city council’s Public Safety Committee gathered to hear a presentation raising the possibility of installing speed cameras at several intersections in the city. 
Councilwoman Maria Valle said her goddaughter had been struck at an intersection on East Main Street. She told the Connecticut Mirror that she supported the idea of speed cameras because “something’s got to give.” She mentioned flowers that would appear at intersections, signifying that someone had been killed there.  
“If it’s going to help our residents, why not?” she said. 
But others said they wanted to see the money used to bolster resources that were already suffering from funding shortages in the city. 
“ We are in a place right now that we don’t even have officers to solve crime,” said councilwoman Eneida Martinez, who questioned whether the city would have enough personnel to monitor the cameras, as well as the drones the city has approved to alert law enforcement and first responders to emergencies. 
Constance Vickers, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, told the council members that she felt the cameras would improve safety.
“ I live right on one of these intersections. I see accidents every day. I walked to work through one of them,” she said.

Slowing people down
It may be too soon to say whether the municipal cameras have reduced the number of vehicular fatalities in the state.
The Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut found that last year, 270 traffic-related deaths were recorded across the state. That was a notable drop from the previous three years, where deaths ranged from 308 to 366 people. 
Eric Jackson, the institute’s executive director, said there had been a renewed focus among police departments on ticketing speeders and aggressive drivers. 
“It could just be the talk of automated enforcement has people slowing down,” Jackson said. 
While the number of drivers and passengers in vehicles who were killed was lower in 2025 compared to previous years, the number of pedestrians who died in crashes remained relatively consistent.
Jackson said the numbers reflect a nationwide trend of pedestrian deaths increasing over the last decade, a trend bolstered by increased aggressive driving during the pandemic. He said the crashes have become more deadly for pedestrians as average vehicle sizes increase. 
Speed cameras can lead to improved safety at particular hot spots, Jackson said. He said cities and towns should also be thinking about road infrastructure, providing wide crosswalks, installing poles and bump-out curbs and making sure there is enough lighting. 
In 2023, the state Department of Transportation ran a pilot program placing speed cameras at five work zones. The program issued more than 24,900 warning notices but issued fewer than 750 fines. A 2024 report to state lawmakers found that the cameras reduced vehicles’ speed in the work zone — in some cases, up to 18%. 
“Based on the results of the pilot, and what we heard directly from the men and women on these job sites, yes, the pilot was a success. Speeds dropped and workers felt safer when these devices were active,” Josh Morgan, spokesperson for the department, said in an email. 
The state resumed the program in the fall of 2025, although it has not yet begun enforcement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0115_SR_SpeedCamera_071-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 05:56:12.338849

If you’re like most people, you’d do it. And you’d keep doing it, at the urging of that authority figure, despite the howls of pain from the poor sap on the other side of the wall.
You’ve probably heard of the Milgram experiment, in which a Yale psychologist faked electric shocks to study the willingness of ordinary people to obey orders in conflict with their personal conscience. Nobody was really hurt, because no shocks were delivered and the yowls of pain came from actors. We’ll return to Milgram shortly, but let me explain how I got to thinking about the famous experiment in the first place.
It was Gov. Laura Kelly’s last State of the State address, delivered Tuesday.
“Kansans are the most civil, decent people on earth,” she declared.
I couldn’t agree more. But our nature is part of the problem.
Kelly, a Democrat, was trying to make a point about civility and bipartisanship in politics. She urged Kansas lawmakers, the supermajority of whom were Republicans, not to let the loudest and most extreme viewpoints “drown out the voices of the vast majority of Kansans, who want to see us work together.”
Problem is, the Legislature has ignored what the vast majority of Kansans want for years — and right-wing extremism already rules. That’s why we don’t have legalized pot or Medicaid expansion. About 65% of Kansans support recreational marijuana, and 74% think expanding Medicaid would help rural hospitals stay in business. Those figures are from the Fall 2025 Kansas Speaks public opinion survey by the Docking Institute for Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University.
Much of the daylight between what Kansans want and what we get is because of historic GOP majorities in the Kansas House and Senate, which routinely block any measure that might give joy or comfort to anybody but the rich. But some of the blame belongs to a collective culture in which Kansans are so desperate to be polite and cooperative, and not to be regarded as different, that we’ll defer to power even when we shouldn’t.
Not all Kansans are like this. I’m not. My journalistic training and the books I’ve read and the friends I’ve made have allowed me to transcend Sunflower bashfulness. But it hasn’t absolved my guilt about being different.
There’s no guilt like Kansas guilt, and it lurks inside us like a vestigial organ from our founding. Although admitted as a free state on the eve of the Civil War 165 years ago, Kansas throbs with the political memory of the struggle that made us bleed. In our collective conscience there nags the worry we haven’t lived up to our promise, that even though we helped end the stain of slavery we still struggle with other deadly civic sins. From racism to hunger to inequality, the job remains unfinished. Nobody today remembers the state’s founding, but every living and reasoning Kansan takes their catechism from the pages of history.
We Kansans are not only a civil lot, as a whole, but a decent lot.

My definition of decency is behaving in a moral way, whether or not it conforms to accepted notions of respectability. You probably know a neighbor or a friend who has put their own self-interest aside to help you or someone else, and that’s the kind of approach Kelly specifically mentioned. Perhaps you donate food in a blessing box or give what you can to charity. But let me give you an historic example of Kansas decency in a time of trial.
During World War II, hundreds of thousands of captured German soldiers were sent to POW camps across America. Some of these camps were in Kansas, including one that held 100 or so prisoners at Peabody.
The POWs were billeted in town at a warehouse that had been turned into a prison. During the day the POWs were sent out to work, for meager pay, at surrounding farms, as long as the work was not dangerous and didn’t involve war production. POW labor helped alleviate a wartime manpower shortage at farms across Kansas.
“At first only the Mennonites invited the prisoners to work,” recalled Marian Franz, in the Mennonite Weekly Review in 1989. She had been an adolescent farm girl during the war. “Then others, observing the comfortable arrangement, employed them also.”
Franz wrote that she was more afraid of the armed U.S. guards than of the German prisoners. The Mennonites are historically known as pacifists and, during the war, many were conscientious objectors and given alternative service.
The German worked hard, were grateful for the quality of the food they were given, and even had a little time for hobbies such as sketching or whittling. The commander of the Peabody camp obtained soccer balls and boxing gloves for the prisoners. Even the guards who accompanied the prisoners to the field work developed a degree of trust.
“The original tension between the U.S. and German soldiers was relaxed by the hospitality that our Mennonite home and community extended equally to friend and foe,” Franz remembered. “As time went on fewer guards accompanied the prisoners. The guards no longer brought the guns into the house at mealtime. On occasion we sang together at the piano.”
Not everyone liked how well the German prisoners were being treated. Every time an American casualty list was printed in the papers, there were calls for some POWs to be executed. Once, when three farm women drove prisoners back their barracks in Peabody, they were unexpectedly met by a group of politicians, army officials and newspapermen who were conducting an official inspection. Wharton Hoch, a newspaper editor from nearby Marion, was particularly incensed. He condemned the practice of women transporting prisoners without guards, according to the Kansas City Times.
The commander of the four prison camps in central Kansas immediately put an end to the practice.
“When these prisoners first came to Kansas there was an urge on the part of the people to kill them,” the commander, Col. H.L. Shafer, told a town meeting, as reported by the Times. “Now there is a tendency to swing just as far the other way and fraternize with them. Treat them fairly but as prisoners.”
Franz became friends with one of the prisoners, Berthold Schwarz, who had been captured in North Africa after Erwin Rommel’s defeat. He returned to Germany at the end of the war. In 1988, Franz was reunited with Schwarz during a trip to Europe.
“It was evident the prisoner-of-war experience was emotional for Schwarz,” she wrote. “He pored over photos of how the Peabody prison looks today.”
I didn’t know of the German POW camp at Peabody until October, when I visited the historical society there and was surprised to see a wooden model of what appeared to be a twin-engine Heinkel bomber. It had been carved out of scrap wood by a German POW. There I also learned of “Spoils of Victory” by Daniel Markowitz, a 2025 novel about the German POW experience among Mennonite families in Kansas.
Franz, who for 24 years as director of the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund lobbied Congress unsuccessfully to establish the right of conscientious objectors not to fund wars, died in 2006. She was 76.
I’m not a pacifist. But I am worried about our current blundering into war, the increasing threat of nuclear annihilation, and the loss of the stabilizing influence of American power on the world stage.
I’m also not naive enough to think German prisoners during World War II were treated well in Kansas just because it was the right thing to do. Had they been Japanese prisoners, they likely would have been treated far worse, as were the Japanese Americans in the concentration camps at Manzanar and elsewhere. Also, there is the problem that the German POWs, decent people by appearances, were part of the Nazi regime. Hardcore Nazis, including SS officers, were barred from farm work, but even Rommel’s rank-and-file soldiers were fighting for fascism.
Which brings me back to Milgram and his famous experiment.
“Obedience, as a determinant of behavior, is of particular relevance to our time,” Milgram wrote in his 1974 book detailing his experiment. “It has been reliably established that from 1933 to 1945 millions of innocent people were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded, daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only have been carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of people obeyed orders.”
In 1960, Milgram devised the test, in which subjects were paid $4 an hour to administer the shocks, ostensibly to study the effect of pain on learning. The subjects were the ones with their fingers on the button. There was an “experimenter” who directed the shocks be increased while a “learner” supposedly tried to memorize word pairs, but the learners were actually actors who were in on the scheme.
Milgram found that two-thirds of subjects turned their machines up to the maximum of 450 volts when told to do so, despite the cries of pain from the learner. Perhaps more disturbing, every subject was willing to inflict some pain.
There has been ample criticism of Milgram’s work, particularly from psychologist Gina Perry, who in 2013 wrote “Behind the Shock Machine,” in which she interviews the original subjects and concludes Milgram may have overstated his percentages and erred in his broad generalizations. Yet, Milgram’s results have been replicated so many times that his conclusions remain substantially valid.
The real unease with Milgram’s experiments, I think, lies in the central question that drove him to experiment in the first place: Why are otherwise decent people disposed to obey orders that result in cruelty, suffering and death to their fellow human beings?
It is the essential question of civilization.
On presidential Election Day in 2024 I visited several polling places in my town and observed, from a safe and legal distance, as scores of my neighbors cast their votes. The polling places for some of the precincts, like mine, were churches. For others it was a public building, including the municipal auditorium. It all went smoothly enough, with voters behaving cordially and the volunteer poll workers doing their jobs with efficiency and dedication. As I watched, I recalled the Trolley Problem, a thought exercise in which you’re given the choice to kill one person in order to save five.
But I was wrong. What I was watching was akin to the Milgram experiment in real life.
No experimenter was giving orders to shock, but each person voting had the memory of authority figures — politicians, preachers, activists, family members and even journalists — crowding the booth with them. There were no fake electrical shocks or cries of pain, but there were real cultural and economic shocks and actual pain for unseen human beings radiating beyond the ballot.
We can think for ourselves, but often we do not. Every day is an actual Milgram experiment. The key to casting a moral vote is to seek reliable information, find the moral compass within yourself and act accordingly.
Failure leads to severe moral dissonance.
Just take Coldwater. This Kansas town overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump and Kris Kobach. Yet, as Kansas Reflector Opinion Editor Clay Wirestone wisely points out, they also mourned the loss of their mayor, Joe Ceballos, who could face deportation after Attorney General Kobach filed fraud charges against him for voting without being a citizen.
Much of the rest of the country must be experiencing similar political vertigo. ICE is a murderous American masked police, the GOP-packed Supreme Court is poised to render yet more Dred Scott-like bad decisions, we’ve abducted the president of Venezuela and we’re risking the collapse of NATO by threatening to conquer Greenland.
Welcome to the new world disorder.
Most Kansans are civil and decent humans. But we need leaders, elected and otherwise, who will clearly denounce the moral collapse at the center of this political chaos, not call for more compromise or deference to authority. Now is the time not for civility, but for civil disobedience.

(Photo courtesy of ICE)The Louisiana Republican Party voted overwhelmingly Saturday to endorse President Donald Trump’s aggressive and controversial immigration enforcement efforts, even as Minnesota officials warn Minneapolis is descending into chaos as a result of a dramatic federal immigration crackdown. 
The Republican State Central Committee approved a resolution saying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are performing “vital work” that upholds “national sovereignty” and ensures public safety. The vote took place during the group’s quarterly meeting held this weekend in Baton Rouge. 
An initial draft of the resolution also rebuked Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, the second-highest ranking Republican in state government, for questioning Trump’s immigration strategy. Late last year, Nungesser told reporters he wondered whether the surge in federal border patrol agents who descended upon south Louisiana in December had hurt New Orleans’ tourism industry. 
But state Rep. Mike Bayham, R-Chalmette, convinced other members of the Republican committee to remove the comments about Nungesser from the resolution before the vote. Bayham said Nungesser is a popular elected official who regularly supports GOP causes by making donations to Republican women’s groups around the state. 

“This isn’t the time to pick a fight with the lieutenant governor,” Bayham said in an interview after the resolution passed. 

As lieutenant governor, Nungesser oversees the state’s tourism and marketing efforts. He said several business leaders in the hotel and restaurant industries had called him to say their employees had stopped showing up to their jobs during Louisiana’s immigration crackdown. Immigrants with legal work permits were scared they could get swept up in the federal raids if they went to work, he said.

Federal agents said they were targeting immigrants who weren’t in the country legally and who criminal backgrounds. But records show several people arrested during the Louisiana sweeps have no criminal history beyond traffic tickets, according to the Associated Press. 
Louisiana is also no longer a target from federal immigration enforcement. Border Patrol officers also abruptly pulled out of the state earlier this month so they could be redeployed to Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. 
For a few State Central Committee members Saturday, the frustration with Nungesser appeared to extend beyond his immigration comments. 

Charlie Buckels of Lafayette said he was upset with Nungesser because the lieutenant governor had “trashed” Gov. Jeff Landry and criticized the new closed party primary system Landry helped implement.

Nungesser has traveled the state campaigning against the new primary system, which he believes weakens moderate voters’ influence and empowers extremists in both political parties. 

Still, GOP activists at Saturday’s meeting said it would make the party leaders look foolish to criticize one of the state’s highest-profile Republicans. 

“What happens here is the media is going to talk about it, and that’s going to make us look like children,” committee member Heidi Parker Martin of New Iberia said, arguing against the formal criticism of Nungesser. “I would rather handle this in more of a private situation.” 

Reached by phone Saturday, Nungesser said state GOP leaders should have invited him to their meeting so he could defend himself against the criticism. Republicans should also be able to have a difference of opinion without facing a punishment for it, he added. 
“I speak out when something is wrong, and everybody should be able to do that,” Nungesser said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/250317neworleans1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-17 21:56:51.879213

TOPEKA — La actividad de agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de EE. UU. en Kansas City y en todos los Estados Unidos inspiró a una legisladora estatal demócrata a intentar apropiarse del proyecto de ley de un republicano que decía: “ICE no tendrá jurisdicción ni poder dentro del estado de Kansas ni de sus subdivisiones políticas.”
La representante Susan Ruiz, demócrata de Shawnee, propuso el miércoles en el pleno de la Cámara revisar el texto del proyecto de ley de la representante republicana Rebecca Schmoe, que establecía que organizaciones internacionales como las Naciones Unidas y la Organización Mundial de la Salud no tienen poder en Kansas.
En lugar de organizaciones internacionales, Ruiz insertó ICE.
“Tenemos que levantarnos”, dijo Ruiz. “Y al menos necesitamos decir — cada comunidad, cada ayuntamiento, cada comisionado de cada condado debe hacer una declaración para decir que ICE no es bienvenido en sus comunidades, y que, si están allí, deben ser sin máscara y bien identificados, y deberían llevar cámaras corporales.”
Ruiz basó la explicación de su enmienda en la reciente muerte de la exresidente de Kansas City Renee Good, a quien un agente de ICE disparó y mató a quemarropa a través del parabrisas de Good en Minneapolis.
“La tragedia siempre ocurre porque las personas que consiguen ese tipo de trabajos o se dedican a esos no tienen mucha formación. Y lo vimos”, dijo Ruiz. “Vimos todos los vídeos y puedes verlos tú mismo.”
Ruiz relacionó la actividad de ICE en todo el país con Kansas City, describiendo los efectos de una mayor presencia de agentes de inmigración. Menos gente va a trabajar, ir al supermercado y a las escuelas, dijo.
Mencionó informes de noticias sobre una redada de una horda de vehículos ICE en Kansas City, Missouri, dirigida por ICE en gasolineras y especulaciones sobre que ICE utilizara el área de Kansas City como base de concentración, lo cual no ha sido verificado.
Schmoe, un republicano de Ottawa, propuso el Proyecto de Ley 2204 de la Cámara en 2025. Fue la primera ley debatida en el pleno de la Cámara en la sesión legislativa de 2026, que comenzó el lunes.
Cuando los demócratas le presionaron para que explicara la motivación detrás del proyecto de ley, Schmoe dijo que su propósito era cerrar “una laguna que puede ser explotada”.
“Un grupo de mis electores acudió a mí y estaba muy preocupado porque entidades globales tomaran decisiones para Kansas, en lugar de para los habitantes de Kansas”, dijo.
Durante una audiencia en marzo de 2025 sobre el proyecto de ley, un alto miembro del personal legislativo lo calificó como “un proyecto de ley declarativo tal como es cualquier cosa” y puso en duda si las organizaciones internacionales objetivo tienen alguna autoridad existente en el estado.
Schmoe impugnó la enmienda de Ruiz, y un comité de normas decidió que no era pertinente, deteniendo el esfuerzo de Ruiz.
La Cámara votó el jueves para aprobar el proyecto de ley de Schmoe siguiendo las líneas partidistas, con 85 votos a favor y 35 en contra.

We must listen to people who are actually impacted.","Renee Good – shot three time and killed this month in Minneapolis by a masked Homeland Security agent, who then called her “a fucking bitch”.
George Retes, a US citizen and Army combat veteran, arrested by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in California and held for three days, allowed no communication with family or lawyers, and then released – without explanation, charges, or apology. 
Rümeysa Öztürk – a Tufts graduate student snatched off the street in Somerville by a team of government agents because she had the temerity to write an op-ed in the university newspaper criticizing the school’s response to the Israel-Hamas war. 
Incidents like these that are the result of the Trump administration’s efforts to rid the country of people it deems unworthy are profoundly alarming – but often distant – to many us who are comfortable in our status.  
But every citizen of the Commonwealth is indirectly supporting and benefitting from this effort. The 2026 Massachusetts budget anticipates collecting more than $25 million from the federal government for housing ICE prisoners at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility — the only facility in the state currently contracted with ICE to detain people.  
We need to own the consequences of this budgetary — and moral – decision. The intuitive reaction is that this is blood money. We must refuse to lease beds in our correctional facilities to ICE.  
Despite the visceral appeal of such a stance, we need to take a more nuanced view. Prohibiting ICE from holding prisoners in Plymouth County might actually harm the very people we are trying to protect. That said, if we are going to let ICE detain people here and take their money, at the least, we must not treat the funds like they are just another neutral source of revenue. 
There’s a compelling argument that no part of the state government should make ICE’s job easier: Collaborating with immoral action is never justified. We should, under this thinking, immediately cancel the contract with ICE.  
How the country addresses immigration is, admittedly, not an easy issue. We need immigrants – and have long been a place where those from other countries sought to a build a new, better life — and we also need secure borders. I know how hard striking this balance can be.  
When I served under Gov. Patrick as an undersecretary of public safety and security, I was tasked with defending why the Commonwealth was participating in the Obama administration’s Secure Communities program – an effort to identify when local and state police had arrested someone without immigration documentation.   
This is not an argument about the substance of who should be able to enter the country and under what circumstances. Whatever the validity of the underlying policy goals, ICE is engaged in activities that we cannot tolerate. As a prosecutor and public safety official, I have learned that process matters: How you go about enforcing the law is at least as important as the objective. Good policing is deeply mindful of that.   
It is not acceptable for government agents to act like the secret police in a totalitarian state, detaining people without identifying themselves by name or agency. It is neither necessary nor productive to go into the streets in full military kit carrying rifles designed for combat. These actions are designed to bully and intimidate, not preserve community safety. And – notwithstanding the recent opinion of the Supreme Court – it should be plainly unconstitutional for the government to stop and question people because of their race or ethnicity.   
Cancelling the Commonwealth’s contract with ICE would make every detention more costly and logistically complicated, as the federal government would have to spend more time and money on transportation. We should consider anything that throws sand in the gears of the deportation machine. There is even some evidence that jurisdictions with fewer detention beds see less ICE activity. 
I had concluded, therefore, with great rectitude, that there is no reason that we should allow ICE to hold people in Plymouth County – and that we should end our cooperation. Then I shared my opinion with a colleague who was personally affected. 
She is the close friend of someone who had just been arrested. She argued that banning ICE from holding people here would be a mistake. She couldn’t visit her friend if he was brought to a detention facility in Louisiana or Florida.  
As with all policies, it is important not to make decisions from afar. We must listen to people who are actually impacted. My friend prompted me to consider whether, as long as ICE is going to snatch people off our streets, we might decide that we want our immigrant neighbors held as close to home as possible, for as long as possible.  
Ending the ICE contract with the state might not mean fewer arrests in the Commonwealth. It might just mean ICE bundles even more detainees off to faraway for-profit prisons in jurisdictions with less sympathetic courts, further from counsel and family, and beyond the reach of inspection by state officials and state law. 
There is no easy answer. But this much, it seems to me, is clear: If we continue contracting with ICE, we must stop quietly collecting money from this arrangement and pretending that it does not facilitate ICE’s cruelty. Instead, the Commonwealth must match its rhetoric about supporting immigrants with its budget: Every dollar ICE pays us should be dedicated to programs that counter that agency’s inhumanity.  
The $25 million we expect from ICE this year could increase the state’s allocation to immigrant legal defense by 500 percent. Or it could more than double the Refugee Social Services Program. If we redirect ICE payments in this way, the Commonwealth would need to absorb the cost of housing the ICE detainees in Plymouth. But this is the only way we can allow ICE to use our facilities and still align our actions with our values.  
Gov. Healey and the Legislature must take this opportunity to be a national model for how to use ICE’s own resources to mitigate the horror of its policies.  
John Grossman was a Massachusetts assistant attorney general from 1995 to 2007 and an undersecretary of public safety and security between 2007 and 2011.

Abigail Spanberger becomes the state's first woman governor as she is sworn in alongside her daughters and husband on Jan. 17, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democrat Abigail Spanberger was sworn in Saturday as Virginia’s 75th governor, making history as the first woman to hold the commonwealth’s highest office and pledging to lead with unity, affordability and pragmatic action amid deep national divisions and growing uncertainty coming out of Washington.
Within hours of taking the oath, Spanberger, 46, moved swiftly to define the priorities of her administration, signing a package of executive orders aimed at lowering costs for families, strengthening public education, responding to federal disruptions and reshaping the internal operations of state government — an early signal that her tenure will be focused on affordability and what she described as “delivering results.
Standing on the steps of the Virginia state Capitol in Richmond, Spanberger framed the moment as both historic and forward-looking, calling the peaceful transfer of power “a cornerstone of our American democratic experiment” and a defining feature of American democracy.
“It is the honor of my life to stand before you and take the oath today,” Spanberger said, underscoring the gravity of the moment and her responsibility to all Virginians. 
She reflected on the generations who expanded democracy in Virginia — particularly women who fought for the right to vote and hold office — saying she stood before those “who could only dream of a day like today.”
Spanberger was sworn in alongside fellow Democrats Ghazala Hashmi, who took the oath as lieutenant governor, becoming the first Muslim to win statewide office anywhere in the United States, and Jay Jones, who was sworn in as Virginia’s attorney general, making history as the commonwealth’s first Black attorney general.
The ceremony drew a cross-section of Virginia’s political leadership, including all living former governors, from outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to L. Douglas Wilder, the nation’s first elected Black governor, who celebrated his 95th birthday Saturday and whom Spanberger recognized during the event.

Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland and U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, were also in attendance. 
Spanberger thanked Youngkin and former first lady Suzanne Youngkin for their cooperation during the transition, as well as former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, former Attorney General Jason Miyares and members of the outgoing administration for their service. The latter two did not attend the ceremony.
 A historic oath, a forward-looking message

Much of Spanberger’s inaugural address traced Virginia’s long democratic arc — from native sons George Washington and Patrick Henry to the suffrage movement and the Civil Rights era — but she repeatedly emphasized that the day was ultimately about the future Virginians will shape together.
Citing Patrick Henry’s warning that “United we stand, divided we fall,” Spanberger urged Virginians not to fracture into factions that threaten democratic institutions. 
She said the work of perfecting democracy has never been finished, but argued that Virginia’s history shows progress is possible when leaders and citizens confront challenges directly.
“This square has been the scene of remarkable dramas of equality and justice,” she said, referencing suffragists who pressed their cause at the Capitol, the delayed ratification of the 19th Amendment, and the 1957 Pilgrimage of Prayer led by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
She also invoked moments when Virginia leaders confronted division head-on, quoting former Gov. Linwood Holton’s call to move beyond partisan camps and to “act together,” and highlighting Wilder’s 1990 inauguration as another milestone that reshaped expectations of who could lead.
Throughout the address, Spanberger emphasized the meaning of Virginia as a commonwealth — a government designed to serve the common good — and framed unity as both a moral obligation and a practical necessity.
 Executive actions underscore affordability focus

The urgency of that message was reflected in Spanberger’s first official acts as governor.
The series of executive orders she signed after the swearing in were designed to confront rising costs, reinforce public education and prepare the state for potential disruptions tied to federal policy changes.
“Today, we are responding to the moment,” Spanberger said. “We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs and delivering results.”
The first three executive orders focus squarely on affordability — an issue that she declared a centerpiece of her 2026 agenda during a news conference in December.
One requires the governor’s secretaries and all executive branch agencies to submit reports within 90 days identifying immediate, actionable steps to reduce living expenses for Virginians, including housing, health care, energy, education, child care and grocery costs.
A second establishes an Interagency Health Financing Task Force within the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, charged with developing a unified financing strategy to reduce duplicative spending, maximize federal funding and strengthen Virginia’s long-term health care infrastructure. 
The task force is directed to assess programs most vulnerable to federal policy changes, review oversight of managed care organizations and evaluate shared technology, licensing and procurement systems.
A third directive launches a comprehensive review of housing development regulations and permitting practices, with the goal of eliminating unnecessary requirements and reducing barriers to housing production. It also creates a Commission on Unlocking Housing Production to recommend legislative, regulatory and administrative changes to increase housing supply statewide.
Academic progress is the focus of a fourth executive order directing the Department of Education to strengthen literacy and math instruction, review accountability measures and expand access to advanced math coursework. 
The directive calls for implementing recommendations from a 2025 JLARC report, advancing a next-generation assessment system and launching a statewide listening tour of educators, parents and students.
Other executive actions respond to external pressures, including federal workforce reductions, funding cuts, tariff impacts and immigration-related effects. 
One order establishes an Economic Resiliency Task Force to coordinate the state’s response, including managing potential disruptions to Medicaid and SNAP, supporting displaced federal workers and expanding agricultural and forestry exports amid tariff uncertainty.
Additional orders initiate a review of the Board of Visitors appointment process for public colleges and universities; establish narrowly defined standby emergency authority for senior officials if the governor is unreachable; formally delegate operational authority to the governor’s chief of staff; and create a comprehensive equal opportunity and non-discrimination policy across state government.
A tenth executive order rescinds Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which required and encouraged state and local law enforcement agencies to divert resources toward enforcing federal civil immigration laws. 
The directive redirects law enforcement to focus on core public safety responsibilities, including investigating crime, staffing local jails and engaging with communities.
The move aligns with a position Spanberger outlined during an interview with The Mercury in August, when she said she would move quickly as governor to end policies she argued pulled Virginia law enforcement away from their primary mission and strained already limited resources.
 A personal case for pragmatic governance

In her inaugural address, Spanberger did not name President Donald Trump, but repeatedly referenced federal actions and rhetoric she said were unsettling Virginians.
“I know many of you are worried about the recklessness coming out of Washington,” she said, citing concerns over health care access, rising costs, attacks on public servants and policies she said betray American values.
She rooted her priorities in personal experience, describing her middle-class upbringing, her work as a federal law enforcement officer and her service as a CIA case officer focused on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation.
Those roles, she said, reinforced the importance of accountability and service — lessons she now brings to the governor’s office. She also spoke as a mother of three daughters, emphasizing the strain rising costs place on families and the difficulty of planning for the future amid uncertainty.
Her policy agenda centers on affordability, education, economic growth and public safety. She pledged to tackle housing costs by cutting red tape and increasing supply, lower energy costs by ensuring high-volume users pay their fair share, and protect health care access while addressing prescription drug pricing practices.
As she closed her address, Spanberger urged Virginians to consider how future generations will judge this moment.
“Choose to stand united. Choose to serve one another. Choose to act together,” she said. “As we continue forward, let us be united for Virginia’s future.”

From Wichita’s world-class aviation industry to Olathe-based Garmin, Kansas knows how to build, create, and lead. However, one of the biggest threats to our state’s innovation is the challenge  imposed by a federal agency that was never meant to serve against the interests of American businesses: the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC.
Patent trolls, which are shell companies that buy up old patents solely to sue productive businesses, use the ITC as leverage to force costly settlements. The agency’s Section 337 statute, meant to protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign trade, has been twisted by patent trolls into a tool for private profit. Patent trolls file cases with the ITC because the agency has an extraordinary power called an exclusion order to ban certain products from entering the United States. Given the devastating consequences an exclusion order can have for a business, the possibility of losing a case and receiving one is enough to lead patent trolls’ targets to settle.
It’s complete extortion, and it drains time, money and resources that could otherwise go toward research, hiring, and growth.
Garmin, a proud Kansas company employing thousands across the state and one of America’s top technology and navigation companies, has spent years fending off patent troll infringement cases before the ITC. The problem isn’t that Garmin has done anything wrong, as courts have repeatedly ruled in its favor, tossing out weak and baseless patent claims. The problem is that the ITC’s process itself gives patent trolls an opening to exploit.
Garmin is often forced to defend itself from patent trolls at the ITC. Despite multiple victories in court, the company has still had to use up resources and valuable time. Instead of shielding American innovation, the ITC is giving foreign patent trolls a platform to drain American companies like Garmin.
Kansas isn’t alone. Across the country, the ITC’s outdated process has allowed patent trolls to file cases that threaten the supply chain and increase costs for businesses and consumers alike. Legal experts have long warned that the ITC’s broad interpretation of “domestic industry” invites abuse. A Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal study found that patent trolls routinely exploit this loophole to extract settlements rather than protect real innovation. In an economy where every dollar counts, these unnecessary battles hurt competitiveness and jeopardize American jobs.
In Kansas, the effect is especially clear. Garmin employs nearly 5,000 Kansans at its U.S. operational headquarters in Olathe and ranks among America’s best large employers. Its success supports families, local suppliers, and the broader regional economy. Every dollar spent fighting useless patent claims is a dollar not spent on innovation, hiring or investment in Kansas communities.
That’s why members of Congress have introduced the Advancing America’s Interests Act. This bipartisan legislation would reform the ITC to ensure it only intervenes when those who make claims have a legitimate U.S. industry at stake. In other words, if you don’t make anything or employ anyone in the United States, you can’t weaponize the process.
The AAIA restores the ITC’s original intent, protecting genuine American innovation, not rewarding litigation abuse. For Kansas, that means companies like Garmin can focus on doing what they do best: designing cutting-edge products, supporting local jobs, and fueling our state’s economic growth.
Leaders like Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kansas, understand what’s at stake. He’s been a strong voice for protecting Kansas workers, innovators, and manufacturers. He understands that standing up to patent abuse isn’t just about fixing a federal agency, it’s about defending the jobs, technologies and communities that make Kansas – and the United States – strong.
While patent trolls may game the system, Kansas thrives on hard work and innovation. It’s time for real accountability to the ITC.

In a letter rejecting the complaint, Gallus said the mailing could be viewed as partisan but that doesn’t mean it creates a violation under his jurisdiction.
Last week, a Harlowton voter filed a complaint alleging the Secretary of State’s Office should not have used taxpayer dollars to pay for the postcard, which said “only citizens should be allowed to vote.”
The Secretary of State’s Office has not responded to a question about the cost of the postcard or how many Montanans received it. Montana has nearly 785,000 registered voters.
The postcard announced a partnership with the federal government to “strengthen election security” and featured a picture of Secretary Christi Jacobsen and President Donald Trump.
The complaint said the postcard pushed a false narrative that “elections are rigged” and “someone other than citizens” are voting.
However, Gallus said the complaint does not clearly allege any violation of statute over which he has jurisdiction. He also said elected officials have a responsibility to communicate with citizens, and voters elected the Secretary of State based in part on her political leanings.
“Expecting that all communication following an election would be devoid of a political bent so as to avoid any criticism or open debate is unreasonable and impracticable,” Gallus wrote in the letter.
Gallus said he wanted to address the complaint in detail because his office has received numerous inquiries about the postcard in relation to “the use of government funds or resources.”
“Montana’s elected officials routinely provide communications to Montana citizens which under a certain lens may appear to be political,” Gallus wrote. “Montana laws do prohibit the use of public resources for political purposes.”
But he said he and staff in his office reviewed the mailer, and it does not appear to violate any provision of the Montana Code of Ethics or any campaign regulation because it “does not have a political purpose” as defined by law.
In making that determination, he said, he looks for words that solicit support or opposition to any political committee; nomination or election of a person to public office; or passage of a ballot issue. That means language such as “vote,” “oppose,” “support,” “elect,” “defeat,” or “reject.”
Gallus said his office also looks at whether material depicts a clearly identified candidate, party or ballot issue “in a manner that is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as a call for the nomination, election or defeat” of the candidate or issue.
Gallus said it is a high bar, and the postcard doesn’t meet the threshold. He said neither Jacobsen or Trump are currently running for office, and the mailing doesn’t include any express words of support.
“Public officials have associated duties, which include communicating with constituents,” Gallus wrote. “For Montana’s Secretary of State, this means communicating with all voters regarding elections, voting and the SOS positions on citizen only voting, which she appears to be doing here.”
In a subsequent news release, the Secretary of State’s Office said it had identified 23 potential non-citizens who had voted. A spokesperson did not answer questions about when they most recently voted, what counties they had voted in, or what the next steps would be.
Missoula County Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman said earlier the 23 potential non-citizens indicated the current system is working well; it represented 29-one-thousandths of 1 percent of voters.
Seaman also said it is important to address those findings as soon as possible. He pointed to a recent tied vote in Missoula County where one vote would have made a difference. (In that case, a council race, the Missoula City Council made the appointment.)
To vote in Montana, people need to be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old before the election, and a Montana resident for at least 30 days before the next election.

Haley Stevens said Friday that a key portion of her time in the U.S. Senate, if she becomes the Democratic nominee in August and is elected in November, would focus on helping Black, brown and other minority communities thrive across Michigan.
Stevens visited Detroit this week to roll out what those plans might look like, calling it her “Michigan Hope Agenda.” The congresswoman unveiled the policy proposals during a “fireside chat” Friday moderated by state Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) at the Durfee Innovation Society.
Stevens said she would focus on equitable federal investments back into communities, economic empowerment and access to capital, safer communities so families and businesses can flourish, and health and stability for those same families. The congresswoman further extolled the need for education innovation and workforce assurances, well-managed water and infrastructure, and lowering the overall costs of housing.
Stevens said that for her to succeed in the U.S. Senate, she needs to make sure that residents back home can connect the dots to quality economic development that doesn’t leave minority communities behind.

“We know that there, for too long, have been communities that get overlooked. We know that there has been a lack of investment in communities of Black and brown communities,” Stevens said. “That hope for equal really deeply matters.”
That’s why things like housing and investments and public health will take center stage in a would-be Senate tenure for Stevens.
“It’s a path for all of us to succeed,” she said. “And to do this in the Motor City, the heart of Detroit, we’re going to put our stake into what Michigan needs at the lawmaking table, in that chief lawmaking role for our state, in the U.S. Senate.”
Stevens previously worked as an organizer and later in the administration of former President Barack Obama as the chief of staff to his auto rescue efforts. The congresswoman said that people had written Detroit off the map, but now, the lights continue to be on in the city and it has become a beacon of urban renewal since those Obama years and onward.
She hopes to continue that work serving in the Senate as she ramps up her bid to win the Democratic nomination in the August primary. She would have big shoes to fill after U.S. Sen. Gary Peters announced that he would not seek reelection this year, although both he and Stevens have been routinely hailed as two of Michigan’s most effective federal lawmakers.
Stevens, Peters rated most effective Democrats in technology, other key policy areas

Making a policy pronouncement on how she would assist minority communities, at the top of the year, follows Stevens’ aim to make a splash as primary season gets into full swing — she currently faces a three-way race with state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former Detroit health official Abdul El-Sayed.
On federal investments, Stevens said she would work to ensure federal resources and infrastructure dollars are delivered equitably to underserved Michigan communities to strengthen public services, transit, and economic opportunity where it is needed most.
Stevens would expand access to capital and training for underserved communities and advance an industrial policy that creates jobs, lowers costs, and strengthens Michigan’s economic future.
Safer communities would take precedence in her policy agenda, and Stevens said she would advance fair and accountable policing, invest in community-based violence prevention, and strengthen common sense gun safety laws to protect families and rebuild trust.
A common theme for the Democrats in the race, Stevens said her tenure would also focus on health care issues, particularly lowering the costs of care, advancing health equity, protecting science-based care, and defending Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid so Michigan families can live with dignity, health, and security.
A 21st Century manufacturing model would guide her policy focus with an emphasis on investments in STEM and job-training pipelines, and other policies that strengthen the supply chain and prepare workers for the industries of the future.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Clean and safe drinking water is also top of mind for Stevens. She said she would champion funding for lead pipe replacement and ending PFAS contamination, all with a focus on environmental justice.
Housing is also a big component of the plan. Following the chat with Tate, Stevens told reporters that her plan would also focus on Generation Z homebuyers who may feel like they are left out of attaining home ownership due to financial strains and lack of access to the very capital she wants to make available.
She said that was something that she and Tate, the former Michigan House Speaker, often talk about at the local level in Detroit.
“Under his leadership, there were some remarkable improvements to our housing development here in the state. There is a lot more to do, though,” Stevens said. “It’s not just about starting the conversation and recognizing that home ownership now begins at a much later age. For this next generation, we need to put more money in people’s pocketbooks.”
Stevens said one of the federal solutions she’s working on legislatively is for a pre-tax savings program so people can buy homes earlier.
“That way, we can increase the affordable home stock here in Michigan and support our building trades as we move forward,” Stevens said. “But this has to do with an economic agenda that is clearly not serving us well under this current administration. Erratic tariffs have been a tax on people. Their pocketbooks are being stretched, and that’s taking away from the investments that people could be making in that first home.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1166504-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-17 10:57:47.009294

For Detroit homeowners over 65 who overwhelmingly live on fixed incomes, unexpected costs – increases in grocery prices, rising health care premiums or an emergency repair – heighten their risk of financial instability and can even lead to them falling into poverty.
I am a policy researcher at Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan. Our initiative uses action-based research, an approach that seeks to understand real-world problems and inform policy changes that could make life work better for people with low incomes. The center recently examined data from the 2023 American Community Survey to explore how low-income seniors in Detroit are affected by declining housing values and high housing costs compared to seniors across Michigan.
Federal, state and local programs to help seniors with these costs are already strained. As the population of older adults in metro Detroit continues to grow, demand for support services, such as caregiving and healthy meal programs, will likely increase.
 Housing cost burdens are more acute for Detroit seniors

The poverty rate of senior-headed households in Detroit is nearly twice as high as the rate statewide.
Detroit seniors, both owners and renters, are more likely to be housing cost-burdened than Michigan seniors overall, with 45% paying more than 30% of their income on housing costs compared to 31% of seniors statewide. This is partially driven by lower median incomes in the city compared to the state.
Even when we focus on the seniors who would be considered the most financially stable, those who own their homes free and clear, the proportion burdened by housing costs is twice as high as the state: 32% versus 16%.

 Detroit seniors pay more for property taxes and utilities

Lower incomes aren’t the only thing driving the higher housing cost burden. Detroit seniors pay more for all homeownership costs, including utilities – not only as a proportion of home values and income, but also in terms of real costs.
Detroiters face higher rates for auto insurance, and they pay more for utilities, compared to others in the state, adding to a situation where many residents, especially seniors on fixed incomes, struggle to make ends meet.
While the cost of living in urban areas is often higher compared to suburban and rural places, my analysis found that comparative costs for insurance, water, electricity and gas are lower in cities such as Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, which points to systemic issues that might be unique to Detroit.

Insurance and property taxes are also higher for seniors in Detroit compared to seniors across the state, especially relative to median home values. Detroit seniors pay the same or slightly more for these essentials despite living in homes that are worth less, based on the analysis.
The median house value for senior property owners in Detroit is $65,000, compared to $170,000 for seniors in Michigan.
 High property taxes and insurance rates drive costs

Detroit lost over half a million residents between 1980 and 2020, causing an oversupply of single-family housing stock and a steady drop in home prices.
As residents left and businesses followed, the property tax base eroded. To generate the same revenue as cities with a richer tax base, Detroit levies property taxes at relatively high rates. Detroiters face a property tax rate close to 3%, significantly higher than the national average of 1.38%.
The housing market in Detroit has seen such large declines in property values that a disconnect has emerged. The replacement cost of a home, which is the actual expense required to reconstruct the dwelling, is often substantially higher than its current market value. This makes the cost of homeowner’s insurance disproportionately expensive relative to the market value of a home in Detroit.
A property’s condition and the condition of neighboring properties also raises the cost of homeowner’s insurance because insurance premiums are primarily influenced by the risk associated with insuring a property. Poor property and neighborhood conditions limit the availability of homeowner’s insurance, driving those who want homeowner’s insurance to purchase costly policies from insurers of last resort, or companies that provide coverage to people who cannot obtain it through other means due to high insurance risks.
The high cost drives many Detroit residents to forgo homeowner’s insurance. According to my analysis, almost 35% of Detroit seniors do not insure their homes, putting their main financial asset at risk.
 Big utility bills

Utility bills in Detroit are higher compared to those statewide for two reasons: higher use and higher rates. The housing stock in Detroit is significantly older, with 88% of Detroit seniors living in houses built before 1960, compared to 34% of seniors in the rest of the state. These older homes use more energy because they often lack modern insulation and have single-paned windows, outdated appliances, older plumbing fixtures and poor seals around windows and doors.
Detroiters and others in Michigan served by DTE Energy, a utility provider, pay gas and electricity rates that are higher than others in the state. Detroiters also pay more for utilities due to a 5% “utility users tax” added to their gas and electricity bills. This surcharge isn’t new. It stems from legislation originally passed in the 1970s, and the funds collected flow to the Public Lighting Authority, which is responsible for improving and maintaining street lights in the city, and to the Detroit Police Department.
In the wake of Detroit’s bankruptcy filing in 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department carried out widespread shut-offs. From 2014 to 2020, the shut-offs affected as many as 141,000 Detroit residents, mostly those with low incomes. The crisis garnered national and international attention.
The initial crisis has passed, yet the cost of water continues to increase across the entire state, with those in the metro Detroit area served by the Great Lakes Water Authority seeing substantially higher rate increases than the state overall to cover deferred maintenance and infrastructure costs.
 Costs are compounded by social isolation

Costs stemming from isolation and disability exacerbate the financial strain Detroit seniors already face.
Several factors contribute to older adults living alone, including increased life expectancy for women as well as children and family members moving farther away from each other. Older adults living alone are also more likely to be poorer than older adults who are a part of a larger household.
This issue is more pronounced in Detroit, where 54.7% of seniors live alone compared to the 43.2% statewide average. Living alone increases the risk of social isolation, which is linked to poorer health outcomes. Detroit seniors also have higher rates of disability than other seniors in the state of Michigan, which can lead to higher health care costs, decreased mobility and increased social isolation.
 Less funding could create more hardship

Historically the demand for support outstrips the available resources, with only a small proportion of eligible households receiving energy assistance. And now, programs that help vulnerable seniors with the costs of utilities are at risk of funding cuts.
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s Lifeline Plan, launched in 2022, ran out of state and federal money in October 2025.
Meanwhile, the entire staff that administers the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, was cut in April 2025. While the program is funded in the continuing resolution passed on Nov. 12, 2025, it is zeroed out in the president’s fiscal year 2026 proposed budget.
Even before funding uncertainties emerged, Detroit seniors who own their homes faced institutional barriers accessing property tax relief, putting many at risk of tax foreclosure. Additionally, Detroiters struggle to keep up with home repair costs, heightened by the needs of older homes and because the home repair assistance system is fragmented and difficult to access.
Without these programs, Detroit seniors will be left without an essential lifeline.

Unions and advocates want a wealth tax targeting billionaires to make up the loss.,"Guest Commentary written by

Josephine Rios
Josephine Rios is a nursing assistant at Kaiser Permanente.


Doctors told us my grandson wouldn’t live past three months, but they didn’t know Elijah was capable of. Today he’s 7 years old, stubborn as ever and fighting every day to prove them wrong.
Elijah was born with cerebral palsy. Caring for him is a full-time, all-hands-on-deck operation that includes in-home nurses, physical and occupational therapy, school support and a small pharmacy’s worth of medications. 
None of that care is optional. It’s what keeps him alive, learning, laughing and giving me attitude. 
It’s only possible because of Medi-Cal. Now California’s health care system — the system that keeps Elijah alive — is being pushed to the brink. With $100 billion a year in federal health care cuts barreling toward Americans, California is expected to lose about $30 billion a year in Medi-Cal funding. 
Families like mine are living in a state of panic. Elijah’s medications alone would run over $5,000 a month. That’s not a “tough choice” for a working family — that’s impossible. 
And the emergency rooms we rely on when his seizures hit? They may not even be open.
This isn’t a hypothetical threat. This is my reality. It’s the reality of millions of Californians who depend on the care we’ve been promised.
This disaster is preventable. There’s a simple, fair, no-nonsense solution on the table, the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act. I’m one of thousands of Californians fighting for it, as the campaign collects signatures to place the proposal on the ballot this year.

As a nursing assistant, union member and grandmother battling to keep a special needs child healthy, I don’t have time for political games. I’m interested in what works, and this would work.
The measure would create a one-time, 5% emergency tax on Californians worth more than $1 billion. That’s roughly 200 people, who together hold more than $2 trillion in wealth. The tax would be spread out over a five-year span.
And because of loopholes in tax law, most of that money may never be taxed at all.
This proposal would raise $100 billion for California. It would keep hospitals open, protect Medi-Cal, prevent layoffs of health care workers and keep 3.4 million Californians who are at risk insured. 
In other words, it would keep my grandson and many others alive.
As for the billionaires, they honestly wouldn’t even feel it.
I’ve heard some people say this tax is “punishing success.” Give me a break. Working families already pay our share. We pay it every time we choose which bills to pay. Every time we work a double shift. Every time we sit in an ER praying that the lights stay on long enough to keep our kids breathing.
All we’re asking is for the tiny group who benefit the most from California’s economy, to pitch in one time to prevent a total health care collapse. That’s not punishment. That’s responsibility.
Voters from across the political spectrum support this. When your child or parent is sick, politics matter a whole lot less than their survival.
The ultra-wealthy and their lobbyists are already gearing up to fight this effort. They always do. They’re loud, they’re powerful and they’re used to getting their way.
But I’ve got news for them: so am I. I’ve had to fight for Elijah since the day he was born. I’ve fought for my patients, my coworkers and my community for decades. I know how to stand my ground, and I know I’m not standing alone.
California is at the cliff’s edge. We can either let the healthcare system fall, or we can pull together and pull it back.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/031125-Medicaid-Bakersfield-LV_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-17 08:57:26.587593

First State Ballet Comes to The Baby Grand
Presented by Delaware’s only professional ballet company, “Dreams In Motion” features two works by choreographer Viktor Plotnikov that highlight both technical precision and expressive storytelling. The program includes Fantasy to Dvořák and Nonsense (In the Sense of Innocence), offering contrasting yet complementary interpretations of the dream world.
Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 7:00 p.m. and Sunday, February 22, 2026 at 2:00 p.m. at the Baby Grand Theater inside The Grand Opera House, First State Ballet Theatre invites audiences to experience “Dreams In Motion”, a contemporary ballet program that explores imagination, emotion, and the fluid nature of dreams through movement.
In Fantasy to Dvořák, dancers respond to the rich musical compositions of Antonín Dvořák with lyrical movement that emphasizes musicality and emotional depth. The choreography allows the dancers to move seamlessly between strength and softness, creating a visually compelling piece that feels both grounded and ethereal. The ballet showcases the company’s classical foundation while embracing contemporary phrasing and flow.
Nonsense (In the Sense of Innocence) shifts the tone to something more playful and whimsical. This work leans into the unpredictable nature of dreams, using inventive movement and lighthearted interactions to spark curiosity and delight. The choreography invites audiences to interpret the performance through their own lens, reflecting how dreams often feel familiar yet open to endless meaning.
The Baby Grand Theater provides an intimate setting for this program, allowing audiences to experience the nuances of the choreography up close. Located within The Grand Opera House in downtown Wilmington, the venue enhances the connection between dancers and viewers, making each performance feel personal and immersive.
Tickets for “Dreams In Motion” range from $42 to $62, offering an accessible opportunity to experience professional ballet in a contemporary format. Whether you are a longtime dance enthusiast or attending ballet for the first time, this program offers a fresh perspective on movement, music, and storytelling.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)There are a few different tactics for passing legislation. One is to pick a change in the law that’s not likely to draw too many detractors. Another is to take a big swing at a change in the law that’s certain to be opposed and will likely need to be offered to legislators during a few sessions so they can learn more about the issue.
With open meetings laws, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley has chosen the first course of action. He has offered three bills that will make slight, but needed, changes.
Those bills include a clarification that an agenda must include items to be considered during an official meeting; a revision for the requirements for executive session; and a requirement that a state open meeting agenda must be posted on the state website 72 hours before the meeting is scheduled to start.

Those bills aren’t likely to elicit too much of a howl from lawmakers. No one can blame Jackley for reaching for some low-hanging fruit. However, while the attorney general is noted for being tough on crime, he has yet to try to put any teeth in the laws governing the punishment of open meetings violators. The problem is that as well-intentioned as Jackley’s bills are, they don’t approach what South Dakota really needs to fix its open meetings problems.
On one end, there will be an effort this year to bring light to the public, letting them know when meetings will be held and what will be on the agenda. Still dwelling in the dark is the fact that there is a lack of accountability whenever the boards of local governments — city council, school board, county commission — go into a closed or executive session. By law they are allowed to meet behind closed doors to discuss personnel matters or student expulsion, consult with an attorney or negotiate contracts.
The problem is that once the public has been sent away, there’s no way to know if the local board is following the rules. There have been cases of elected officials using that time away from the public to discuss locally controversial issues that don’t fit within the limits allowed by law. Some boards use the fact that their lawyer is in the room to claim that they are “consulting” on legal matters while they discuss how to handle volatile issues.
Other states have recognized this loophole and adopted specific rules for when the local commission can shut the door and consult with its attorney. The law in Arizona says such a consultation in a closed meeting is allowed for the “discussion or consultation with the attorneys of the public body in order to consider its position and instruct its attorneys regarding the public body’s position regarding contracts that are the subject of negotiations, in pending or contemplated litigation or in settlement discussions conducted in order to avoid or resolve litigation.”
Unless an elected official comes forward to say that she believes the executive session she just sat through broke the law, there’s no way of knowing what goes on behind closed doors. One idea that’s been floating around South Dakota open government circles is having each executive session recorded. When a question arises about whether or not the board followed the law, the recording would be reviewed privately by a judge to determine if there were any violations.










The problem is that once the public has been sent away, there’s no way to know if the local board is following the rules.


So far, no one in the Legislature or state government wants to take on those fights. Many see the Legislature, top-heavy with Republicans, as a roadblock to significant change. That’s odd, because Republicans should be the first ones calling for greater transparency in government.
These are the same lawmakers clamoring for more transparency in state credit card use after discovering the spendthrift ways of former Gov. Kristi Noem. It stands to reason that greater transparency in the workings of local governments would also be good for taxpayers.
Some lawmakers have said that cutting the budgets of counties and school districts would ease some of the complaints they’re hearing about high property taxes. They should welcome a means for keeping an eye on those tax dollars by ensuring that there’s a way to figure out what local officials are up to in executive session.
The state’s open meetings law has its share of violations. To his credit, Jackley resurrected the Open Meetings Commission that had gone dormant for four years. Last November, that commission found local boards had violated the open meetings law in 10 of 12 cases.
Some violations are just a misinterpretation of the law. Others are blatant attempts to keep public business out of public view. To strengthen that law, the state needs leaders who aren’t content to just reach for low-hanging fruit.

I’m sure Cosell would have some strong words about the financial factors and threats that have left Missouri without an NFL football team for the first time since 1960 despite the significant taxpayer funds spent to develop both Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium and the domed stadium once used by St. Louis Rams.
Cosell regularly attacked the NFL franchises and local governments for using threats to depart a city without higher local tax funds to improve their stadiums.
News stories about Cosell’s 1970s testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, quoted him saying those efforts were “blackmail” and “extortion.”
“Let them run their business like any other without protection granted by Congress. Lord knows they’re big business” Cosell was quoted by UPI as testifying before the committee.
There is a direct Missouri connection to Cosell’s comments.
In 1995 when the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis various news reports cited the reason as financial frustrations about Los Angeles.
Twenty years later, the Rams abandoned Missouri citing inadequate fan support and because city funding for the St. Louis Stadium was not good enough. The team moved back to Califonia.
Ultimately, St. Louis won a $790 million lawsuit award from the Rams to cover the costs for the Rams failing to meet financial requirements for stadium improvements.
The latest team to depart Missouri is the Kansas City Chiefs. They abandoned Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium after voters defeated a sales tax proposal for stadium improvements.
The Chiefs will move to a new stadium in Kansas.
The Kansas City Star reports the move could cost Kansas more than $6 billion to build the new stadium.
Beyond that, the Star reports that the Kansas financial incentive for the Chief’s to move could end a restriction on state tax incentives to stop “boarder war” raids that entice a business in one state to move.
It makes me wonder about the potential costs and legal fights if the Kansas Kansas City Chiefs seek to move from Kansas back to Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri.
And of course, an abandoned football stadium in St. Louis and at Kansas City’s Arrowhead might intice teams from across the country to jump at the opportunity if, of course, there are sufficient financial incentives.
If you read various stories about tax funding for NFL teams, you’ll read a reference to STARBonds to entice relocation to Kansas.
They are bonds issued to finance a private project, like a football stadium, that are funded by additional sales taxes collected within the district.
I write this column from the perspective listening to legislative debates about the advantages to provide tax breaks for various private financial interests.
From my hours reading Cosell’s arguments and listening to him on Monday Night Football, I gained a far better understanding about the danger of committing government funds to private sports operations that are free to leave for other locations.

And with that, let’s get started.
 Idaho Gov. Little delivers State of the State, and the budget dominates legislative conversations in week one

The state budget – and projected multi-million dollar budget deficits for the current 2026 fiscal year and the upcoming 2027 fiscal year – have taken center stage in the Statehouse as the legislative session gets underway.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

Very few bills were introduced or acted on this first week, but there was plenty of discussion about how the state is situated financially.
Is it a big deal that the state is facing a projected $40.3 million budget deficit for 2026 and a $555.2 million deficit for 2027? That depends on whom you ask.
Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said Monday that he’s tired of the negative talk surrounding the state budget deficit. So are other Republicans in legislative leadership.
“This isn’t a big deal,” Moyle said at a GOP press conference. “It’s going to be easy to get through.” 
 
But Democrats and some advocacy groups, especially groups that focus on Idahoans’ access to health care, paint a different picture entirely.
They say the budget crunch is self-inflicted due to the $450 million in tax cuts and tax credits approved by the Legislature and Idaho Gov. Brad Little in 2025, as well as $4 billion in income tax cuts that have been approved by lawmakers over the past five years.
They say the plans to close the gap, including the governor’s proposal to cut about $45 million from the state’s Medicaid program’s budget, harm everyday Idahoans who rely on those essential services. Some of those proposals include cuts to Medicaid’s dentistry services and cuts to programs that support people with disabilities.
Some Republicans, including Moyle, have said they would consider a full repeal of Medicaid expansion, which is how approximately 90,000 Idahoans access health insurance across the state.
While Little said he was not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion, and did not include full repeal in his budget proposal, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said she is still deeply concerned about the impact of the budget cuts Idaho legislators will make to balance the budget. 
“We are in a hole,” Rubel said at a Jan. 8 press conference. “There’s no question about it. We are $555 million below what we need to cover the most basic maintenance budgets to keep the lights on in our agencies.”
 When should Idaho legislators set a state revenue projection?

The Legislature’s powerful budget committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, has fielded recent criticism from legislators of both parties and from stakeholders around Idaho because it set the state’s revenue projection late in the session last year. Essentially, critics say, the budget committee and Legislature passed tax cuts before having a clear picture of how much revenue the state had coming into its coffers and therefore didn’t know if the state could truly afford those cuts.
And after the budget committee met on Friday, some legislators are worried that a similar situation is playing out again in 2026.
On Thursday, the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee voted to recommend a revenue projection of $5.8 billion for next year. Notably, that revenue target is about $137 million more than the revenue projection Gov. Little issued Monday in conjunction with his State of the State address.
The budget committee was scheduled to consider the revenue projection on Friday morning. However, without any public explanation, JFAC leaders started Friday’s meeting about 20 minutes late, pulled back their agenda for the day and removed the agenda item for the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee’s report.
After Friday’s meeting adjourned, JFAC co-chairmen Sen. Scott Grow and Rep. Josh Tanner, both R-Eagle, said they wanted to give JFAC members more time to study the revenue recommendation, and it’s back on the agenda for JFAC on Monday.

Senate Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, at a Jan. 8 press conference, said setting the revenue projection early in the session is top of mind for legislative leaders.
“We’ve decided, as majority leadership, to try to do a better job this session (by) really hitting the revenue projection early and to work better with the governor’s office to try to get to that revenue number quickly,” Anthon said. “We’ll see how that goes, but that is the goal.”

In the State of the State Address, the governor said while this may be a tighter budget year than lawmakers have experienced in the recent past, he stressed the state is fiscally sound.
“The proof is clear – Idaho’s fundamentals remain among the strongest in the nation,” Little said. “Your dollar stretches farther here than anywhere else. Our unemployment rate is among the lowest in the nation. We lead in personal income growth, and our economic activity continues to outpace most states, reflecting a diverse and resilient economy. Jobs are growing, and Idaho’s healthy business climate remains a magnet for employers, talent, and investment.”
 What to expect next week at the Idaho Legislature

Quick note: Many committees, especially at the beginning of the session, have agenda items known as an RS (which stands for routing slip). That’s legislative talk for “draft legislation.” An RS is not a public record until a committee votes to introduce the bill. Many of those agenda items are only listed by subject matter, so it’s impossible to ascertain what the RS is specifically about, other than the few words used to describe the RS until the introductory hearing takes place.

 Quote of the week

“Our plan uses a responsible mix of one-time and ongoing spending reductions to keep the budget structurally sound. Across state government, executive agencies will tighten their belts. We’re renegotiating contracts to save money. We’re reprioritizing initiatives. We’re finding operational efficiencies, and we will make disciplined use of cash balances and interest earnings. All of this serves to limit the impact on Idahoans as we right-size government.” – Idaho Gov. Brad Little in his 2026 State of the State address

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)While Maine began bracing this week for a suspected increase in immigration operations, local organizers have been preparing for this for months, or years if factoring in the longstanding immigrant rights organizations propping the work up.
Since the launch of an ICE watch hotline in October, more than 300 Mainers have now been trained by community groups to help verify reports of enforcement activity across the state and de-escalate tense situations. Their work has already begun and the number of people signing up to get involved continues to grow, said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine. 
The hotline, organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice of which Presente! is a part, is also often used by the loved ones of people who have been detained to help connect them with financial, legal and other resources. 
“In times like these, when people are afraid and there’s a lot of reactivity,” Cron said, what’s essential is “staying rooted in the systems that we’ve created.” 
The hotline is one aspect of a multi-organization, grassroots effort to document federal activities and support immigrants in Maine against unlawful action. 
There is a solidarity fund to cover legal representation for people who are detained, volunteers who watch over students and their families during school drop off and pick up, networks to bring food and other necessities to people afraid to leave their homes, and protests.
All of this work is being done with little information about the scope of the suspected immigration operations coming to Maine. 
The mayors of Maine’s two largest cities announced Wednesday that they’re expecting increased federal immigration presence in their communities soon. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has neither confirmed nor denied plans. Gov. Janet Mills and members of Maine’s congressional delegation have also been unable to get confirmation. 
This comes after a particular ramp up of operations in Minnesota, after a federal agent shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good. The Trump administration has sent as many as 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota, nearly five times the total sworn officers in the city’s police department. 
With the surge in federal officers there, ICE arrests have become quicker and quieter as agents avoid drawing crowds. ICE and Border Patrol have also been documented scanning the streets for people who may be immigrants, then asking those people to provide documentation. The American Civil Liberties Union is alleging immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens, in a lawsuit filed Thursday.
Without a sense yet of what may be in Maine’s future, organizers like Cron are prioritizing information gathering and meeting people’s basic needs. And, much of this work is rooted in previous iterations of mutual aid efforts.
For Presente!, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide food and resources to immigrants and others in need with schools closed and fear of exposure to the virus. 
“We’re hearing the same thing again,” Cron said, “but this time, the pathogen is ICE and racism.” 
Presente! and other community groups in the coalition began preparing for Trump’s mass deportation effort as soon as they saw the possibility coming.










We're hearing the same thing again, but this time, the pathogen is ICE and racism.


– Crystal Cron of Presente! Maine


Safiya Khalid, executive director of the Community Organizing Alliance, a Lewiston-based group boosting civic engagement among Black and immigrant communities, spearheaded the establishment of that coalition when Trump was reelected in 2024.
“We needed a plan and a strategy in place to support communities,” Khalid said, who was also the first Somali-American to serve on the Lewiston City Council. 
Khalid’s days are now busy further refining that strategy, but also filled with anxieties over what could happen. 
The Trump administration’s increased operations in Minneapolis specifically target Somali immigrants because of alleged welfare abuse. Similar accusations are being leveled in Maine.
Fear in Maine is visible. In Portland earlier this week, the superintendent reported multiple students absent from each school, citing concerns about immigration enforcement. A local school watch group started after a parent was detained by ICE in September after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
The team at Khmer Maine, a Portland-based nonprofit serving the state’s Cambodian community, is reviewing their safety protocols to ensure its programming — such as citizenship preparatory courses and cultural events — can continue to be held without risking attendees safety. 
“We’re worried, of course,” said Executive Director Marpheen Chann, “but at the same time, what gives us comfort at Khmer Maine is that we’re not alone,” speaking to the broad network of organizations preparing for ICE’s arrival.

Chann is also running for Cumberland County commissioner, specifically to try to end the county jail’s contract with federal authorities to house immigration detainees. 
A group called No ICE for Maine has been turning out hundreds of people to board meetings to call for the contract’s termination, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics. 
That push feels even more urgent now for member Jack O’Brien. “We hope the commissioners understand that this is why we’ve been talking about this for eight months,” O’Brien said. “There’s been a real frustration, I think, with a lot of the public that the commissioners have not taken the concerns about ICE as being legitimate.”
O’Brien, who is also a trained verifier for the hotline, has been connecting with anti-ICE protestors in Minnesota and elsewhere to get advice. He believes Maine’s organizing infrastructure sets the state up to be more proactive than other states. Part of that, he said, is because Maine is smaller than Minneapolis or Los Angeles, which has also faced major immigration raids. 
“It’s also that we’ve been able to learn from them as this horror has continued for them,” O’Brien said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_6435_720.jpg,,,2026-01-17 06:56:29.966775

The hundreds of Kansas who showed up at the Statehouse on Wednesday for a human rights rally understood that better than most. An array of civic organizations sponsored the event, which featured speakers, songs and chants — including a particularly pungent one directed at U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Yet the most memorable commentary could be seen throughout the crowd, thanks to dozens of handmade signs.
These signs, fashioned from poster board or even plain cardboard, varied in complexity. Some were colorful and artistic, others were hurriedly scrawled. What they shared was visceral outrage at our state and nation’s drift toward authoritarian violence. Most sharply criticized he Trump administration’s deployment of ICE agents against immigrants and protesters.
The death of Minneapolis mother Renee Good fueled Kansans’ anger. However, the crowd understood it as part of a broader effort, one meant to muffle resistance and grab ever more power for White House commissars.
Here at the Kansas Reflector opinion section, we talk about raising the voices of residents who would other not otherwise hear or see themselves in the mainstream media. We work “to amplify the voices of people who are affected by public policies or excluded from public debate,” as the blurb repeated underneath every column says.
In the interest of fulfilling that mission, I hereby present a sign roundup from the Wednesday protest.

Shared concerns
Throughout 2025, I thought we had reached various turning points against President Donald Trump‘s administration. There were the crude cuts by Elon Musk‘s Department of Governmental Efficiency. There were the attempted deportations of various legal immigrants. On the postive side, there were the October No Kings protests.
While all these events dinged Trump‘s popularity, it wasn’t until the government shut down that his administration finally took a serious hit.
The ongoing ICE raids — following a year of harsh tactics — have brought us to another fraught moment. In you listen closely, you can hear a difference in the way that even the most diehard Republicans talk about immigration and efforts at immigration enforcement.
Exhibit A? Longtime reporter Roy Wenzl’s story for the Journal of the Kansas Leadership Center: “Does Kansas need its immigrants despite crackdown? Key business leaders say ‘yes’ ”
Businesses, immigrants and community activists all agree that the current system doesn’t work. That was also the immigration system under former President Joe Biden and his predecessors. While many hoped that Trump would fix well-documented problems, he has instead spread chaos.
I don’t expect that Wenzl’s Republican sources will join demonstrators at the Statehouse anytime soon. However, their calls for a just and humane approach suggest that less division exists than generally supposed.
“Nobody from a city wants to move to western Kansas and work in slaughterhouses,” former state Sen. John Doll, R-Garden City, told the reporter. “It’s absurd to say those workers could be replaced by citizens. If they leave, southwest Kansas with its meatpacking plants will become a series of ghost towns.”
Most Americans, liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, want an approach to immigration that recognizes those who have spent years or decades in this country. A similarly broad coalition wants smart and effective security at our nation’s borders.
I doubt Trump or ICE will bring us to that space of agreement and compromise anytime soon. In fact, both seem dedicated to fanning the flames.
But underneath it all, the hope for something better remains.

Wes Moore joined 12 governors and two Trump administration officials pushing for power grid operator PJM Interconnection to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data centers paying the tab. PJM responded with its own plan.,"The massive computing power of data centers comes with a massive demand for energy, driving up demand for electricity and raising costs on all customers. Multistate electricity grid operator PJM and state and federal officials have their own ideas on how to fix that. (Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) found himself in a rare position Friday: Joining forces with President Donald Trump’s (R) administration on energy policy.
Moore was one of 13 governors who signed an agreement with the Trump administration, pushing for PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data center companies paying the tab.
Moore has been a critic of PJM, arguing that its policies delayed new clean energy projects, which got stuck in a backlogged queue waiting for approval, and then electricity demand skyrocketed because of power-hungry data centers.
“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Moore said in a statement Friday. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”
But PJM’s Board of Directors released its own data center plan later Friday.
That plan also initiated a “backstop procurement” for new energy. But PJM merely directed its staff to study assigning the costs of new energy to the jurisdictions, who could then pass those costs to the data center companies, such as Amazon and Google.
PJM’s plan also encourages — but doesn’t mandate — “bring your own generation,” wherein data centers could choose to bring new power onto the system on an expedited basis, to defray the possibility of being asked to reduce their power demand when the grid is strained.

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth,” said David Mills, PJM Board Chair and Interim President and CEO, in a statement.
“This is not a yes/no to data centers,” Mills’ statement said. “This is, ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”
PJM’s plan also includes changes to the way that the grid operator forecasts energy demand. Concerns had been raised that PJM’s projections were inflated, because companies looking to build data centers could be shopping the same data center proposal in more than one jurisdiction.
According to a news release from PJM, some of the items will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, while others can take place immediately.
Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.
The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM’s decision protects “everyday families from blackouts” caused by data centers, but it falls short when it comes to new power generation.
PJM has created a “fast-track process that effectively excludes clean energy projects and gives special treatment to fossil fuel power plants built for data centers, allowing them to cut ahead of low-cost clean resources that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” wrote Claire Lang-Ree, advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at NRDC.
Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) also chimed in, adding that PJM’s decision doesn’t provide sufficient protections for ratepayers.
“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee. “Given that solar and batteries are the fastest, cheapest way to provide new generation, this is another example of PJM serving for-profit energy companies and not families who can’t afford their energy bill.”

A Trump spokesperson called the administration’s plan with the governors an “unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts.”
“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the Mid-Atlantic region,” wrote White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in a statement.
The governors’ proposal would also have extended a cap on PJM’s energy capacity auction, which has lowered the price charged to ratepayers from the last several auctions, during which PJM procures energy supply to feed the grid in the future.
But PJM decided to request additional feedback about the cap before making a final decision.
Meanwhile, PJM executive director Jason Stanek was in Annapolis on Friday, speaking to a panel of legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, convened by Maryland’s conservative Freedom Caucus.
Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.
“Despite what you may have heard, our interconnection queue is open, and PJM has been processing the connection of new, and mostly renewable, resources to connect to the grid at record pace,” Stanek said. “We soon hope to turn around requests in a period of one to two years, or possibly sooner.”
During his remarks, Stanek said that states own part of the blame for energy supply worries — and high electric bills, citing state-level energy policies and permitting procedures. He urged the legislators in the room to look inward as they aim to reduce prices.
“We would implore all of our states in the PJM region not to retire any more [power] resources until you have a sufficient amount of resources to backfill those retirements,” Stanek said.

“We would also ask that you look at your state permitting laws on the books to determine whether or not we can actually build energy infrastructure in your states in a timely manner.”
The Republicans in attendance were insistent that Maryland has contributed to its own power woes, by passing legislation to push the state away from fossil fuels — and toward a grid fueled by solar, wind and nuclear power. By law, Maryland has until 2031 to cut its carbon emissions 60% from 2006 levels.
“Why would politicians push to force the economy onto electricity while simultaneously shutting down the very power plants needed to generate it? It’s simple. Virtue signaling, green dreams over common sense,” said Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert).
Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said Friday that he was initially encouraged by the PJM governors’ announcement, because he agrees that data centers should pay for new power. But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.
“Gov. Moore needs to embrace natural gas,” Hershey said. “He hasn’t done it yet. He’s trying to talk about nuclear, because it’s clean, but nuclear is 12 or 15 years out. As we heard today in this hearing, the quickest way to get reliable energy back on grid is to open up these retired fossil fuel generation facilities.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)One recent morning, Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) opened his computer to an email from a desperate family:  “Please help us locate our elderly family friend who has been detained,” it read.
“This is the moment we are in right now,” says Acevero, who serves as vice chair of the Maryland Latino Legislative Caucus. “We serve as the voice of the Latino and immigrant community to assure that we are reflecting their concerns and aspirations with legislation and a budget that is fair, equitable and meets the moment.”
Acevero says the caucus can use its 91 members – the largest caucus in Annapolis – to leverage its priorities to address fears like those in that short note.
In 2025, caucus members voted to support 55 pieces of legislation. Included in the 20 that were ultimately signed into law were inclusive policies for returning citizens, anti-poverty and housing policies, health care access, child welfare and transportation safety. Some that did not succeed last year have already been reintroduced this year and pushed to the top of the caucus’ agenda.
According to a Brookings Institution report, Maryland’s Latino community had a growth spurt in 2025 attracting 32,646 new residents, adding to the approximately 800,000 already living across the state, but largely in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.
Barring police agreements with ICE
Acevero says in 2026 the caucus is resolute in its mission to combat federal government measures that target Latinos. That focus is on immigrant protection with three key bills. One would prohibit 287(g) agreements,  the collaborative agreements between local law enforcement agencies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That provision was stripped from the 2025 Maryland Values Act on the last day of the 2o25 session.
More than 3,300 Marylanders were detained by ICE in 2025, twice the number of preceding years

Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince Georges), who sponsored the Values Act, says she will reintroduce the 287(g) measure as a standalone bill.  “I am very optimistic that it will pass because we have really great partners in the Senate who are committed to ensuring that this bill passes this session,” she said.
Among those partners is Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City). Another is House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s), who told Maryland Matters, that she also supports the measure.
“I think it’s important, especially given the climate that we have presently in this country,” said Peña-Melnyk, a native of the Dominican Republic. “The states have to act. This is a way for us to tell our immigrant community, ‘We love you. You’re part of us. We see you. We hear you, and we want to give you protection,’ and that’s why this is important.”
Williams anticipates opposition from the Maryland counties that have signed 287(g) cooperative agreements, eight in total. Arguing for their termination, she says the stand-alone bill promotes greater trust and better relations with the police in the long run.
“We want to make sure that people feel comfortable reporting crimes to the police, engaging with our local officers, and that our officers are engaging in community policing, where the community feels as though they are part of it,” Williams said.
Other priority protection bills
Two other bills among caucus priorities include House Bill 155, also drafted by Williams, which would bar on-duty law enforcement officers from wearing masks or disguises when interacting with the public. Senate Bill 1 is the companion measure in the Senate.
The other from Del. Vaughn Stewart (D-Montgomery) would bar ICE arrests in courthouses. The measure would build on the sensitive location guidelines of the Maryland Values Act that restricts federal enforcement agents from schools, churches, libraries, places of worship, hospitals, clinics and community shelters.
Among the caucus members seven are of Latino heritage – the other 84 associate members support caucus priorities.  They have crafted dozens of bills, which at their core are immigrant related, but have a broader reach. “I’m coming into this session with a pretty comprehensive agenda around affordability and workers’ rights,” said Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery), whose parents brought him to the United States from Uruguay at age 3 in 2000.

Elected to the House in 2022, he is now the caucus secretary. “I spent the last nine months, both here in my district – Gaithersburg and Rockville – and then in other parts of the state hearing directly from Marylanders, from immigrants, who are really hurting now, fearful of the federal government and struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living,” he said.
Caucus Treasurer Del. Deni Taveras, a Dominican American, also has several prospective bills with immigrants in mind, ranging from developmental disability service for Latino families, an anti-price gouging housing bill, and legislation around teen pregnancy, chronic truancy and drug addiction among Latinos.
‘We cannot afford to be silent’
Caucus delegate Teresa Woorman (D-Montgomery) immigrated from Puebla, Mexico, as a child, became a naturalized citizen in college and served as a long-term staffer in the General Assembly before she began her first term as a legislator in 2025.
This year she strongly supports the Latino Caucus agenda, with bills of her own that include working with Peña-Melnyk to tweak a law that would put in-state tuition for undocumented students on parity with neighboring states.
She says while her constituents live in Bethesda and Potomac, areas with much less threatened by ICE,  “When I go door-knocking, people are worried about what they see on their TVs, what’s happening across the whole country,” she said.  “And I tell them I feel like we are [in Annapolis] as the first line of defense to protect what we can at the state level.”
Acevedo is ready for the fight.
“What we are seeing is a federal government that is targeting hard working Marylanders and immigrants who have come to this country and who have called this country home for decades,” he said.  “We are going to continue to push legislation, raise our voices. We are going to be in the streets shoulder to shoulder with our partners and our allies to call out this administration.  We cannot afford to be silent.”

J. Sandy Bartlett, and the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee wastes no time getting into the nitty-gritty of bill hearings, in political notes.","Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel) has reason to smile after being elevated from vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee last year to chair this year, the first woman and first person of color to hold the seat. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Department of Legislative Services is the keeper of all legislative arcana, among other things. So it was able to respond relatively quickly this week to a request for information about House Judiciary Committee leadership, spitting out a list of chairs — or, more strictly, chairmen — dating back to 1828.
They might want to put an asterisk next to this year’s entry.
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), recently elevated from vice chair of Judiciary, is not just the first woman to make that 198-year list of committee chairs, she is also the first person of color to chair the committee. She was appointed by new House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), who made former Judiciary Chair Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) her speaker pro tem.
Del. Debra Davis (D-Charles) was named vice chair, making the Judiciary Committee the only standing committee this year chaired by two Black women.
“We have quite a team. We have the dream team here, I hope. I think we do,” Bartlett said during an organizational hearing for the committee this week.
“We do,” Davis replied.
In an interview Friday, Bartlett said she was grateful for the chance to serve as chair, which she said comes with a “strong sense of responsibility.” She said she thinks about her ancestors when serving in the legislature, including her great-grandfather Bryant William Thorpe, one of four Black state legislators in North Carolina in 1885.
Peña-Melnyk unveils House leadership shake-up, expands standing committees

“I am just so grateful. It hasn’t even really completely hit me yet because I stand on the shoulders of other people, but I know it’s special,” Bartlett said. “I know it’s historic, and I appreciate it.”
It’s not the first committee to be led by two Black women: Last year, the House Ways and Means Committee was chaired by Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) and the vice chair was Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery). When Atterbeary stepped down this year to focus on her race for Howard County executive, Wilkins was made chair. Her vice chair is Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard).
The only other standing committee led by two Black legislators is Senate Executive Nominations chaired by Sen. Benjamins Brooks (D-Baltimore County) and Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s) as the vice chair.
Burning the candle at both ends
The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee got its nickname, “JPR after dark,” for its habit of holding hearings well into the night to handle its significant workload during previous legislative sessions.
Now, it appears the committee has started burning the candle at both ends.
Committee Manager Sandy Popp informed the committee during an organizational meeting Thursday that the committee had already scheduled 58 prefiled bills to be heard this month, a little more than a fifth of the 273 bills that had been submitted to the full Senate as of Friday. Popp said that’s down from the 75 prefiled bills the committee started with last year.
Hearings will begin Tuesday and be packed in over the next 10 days. (The Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee is keeping pace with 65 bill hearings scheduled, but those start Wednesday and are currently scheduled through mid-February.)
“The work that we do here is, I think, most directly connected to how people move about their everyday lives, and you’ll see that through testimony,” said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the committee.
And the committee has not packed the calendar with softball bills. About 31 bills will be reviewed next week on topics that include estates and trusts, family law and criminal law. But there is also a potentially a high-octane hearing Thursday when the committee hears Senate Bill 1, prohibiting face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers; and SB 245, prohibiting a county sheriff, local police or any “agent of the state” from entering into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.

Put simply, SB 245 would ban 287(g) agreements with ICE. That language was stripped out of larger bill on the last day of the 2025 session, original sponsor Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) reintroduced it this year with two heavyweight co-sponsors: Smith, the committee chair, and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).
SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s),follows months of aggressive immigration raids by ICE agents who are typically masked. The scrutiny intensified after Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month. Augustine’s bill would prohibit officers from wearing items such as a balaclava, ski mask or neck gaiter on duty. It wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation.”
Ferguson and Pena-Melnyk have both expressed support for the measure.
“I think all of us can sit back and imagine if you’re sitting in your car and somebody runs up to you, even as a law enforcement agent that quickly shows us a badge and has their face covered, I know I would be terrified,” Ferguson said Wednesday to reporter. “It’s just not how you build trust in policing.”
But Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), a Judicial Proceedings member who recently retired from the Frederick Police Department, said law enforcement officers in the state usually do not wear face coverings unless it’s due to inclement weather. He said masked federal officers “are trying to actually find a way to protect themselves and their families from being doxed by certain activists who make it their mission to cause disruption … in the performance of their duties.”
“I find it interesting that the state of Maryland wants to legislate a policy for federal law enforcement officers,” Folden said.
Bartlett could not say when the House version of the masking bill, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), might be heard in the Judiciary Committee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters and observers of federal officers Friday, granting a preliminary injunction preventing the officers from retaliating against demonstrators.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of 3,000 immigration officers and agents here. The Reformer talked to a protester who was detained for hours on Sunday and never charged.
The federal agents can no longer use pepper spray or other nonlethal munitions against people engaged in peaceful protest. They cannot stop or detain drivers where there is no “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they are interfering.
ICE observers are frequently following cars they suspect are being driven by federal officers, tracking them, entering vehicle descriptions into a database and discouraging them from making immigrant arrests. The judge declared this legal and a protected activity: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”
The ruling comes out of a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU.
The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community.
Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer. 
“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference Wednesday.
The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 22:57:57.238603

Pete Ricketts said he encouraged Tyson to keep the plant open and help affected people find jobs.,"A Lexington water tower on Dec. 9, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA  — U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, asking her federal department to “block” the closure of the Tyson beef plant in Lexington, Nebraska. 
Schumer, in the letter, pointed to the Packers and Stockyards Act, saying the upcoming closure in Lexington is a “textbook violation” of the century-old federal law. The New York Democrat said the closure will send “shockwaves through America’s cattle market.”

“[USDA] publicly stated it is ‘closely monitoring’ the planned closure of large processors like Tyson’s Lexington plant, yet has offered little clarity on whether that monitoring includes active investigation, enforcement, or any concrete steps to protect producers and competition … I urge you to act swiftly to preserve competition, help bring prices down for families and farmers, and save jobs,” Schumer’s letter reads. 
The Packers and Stockyards Act, passed in 1921, was meant to promote competitiveness and fair practices in the livestock, meat and poultry industries — and to ensure payment protection.

The law prohibits deception and fraud in those markets. Some have questioned whether the feds have the authority to do so. The Packers and Stockyards Act does give the Agriculture Department the authority to force Tyson to sell the plant.  
Ricketts, during a campaign event Friday in Omaha, told the Examiner he had talked to Tyson to “encourage them to quickly make a decision about the plant and to keep it open.” He said he also is working to connect people affected by the closure with help finding jobs. 
“I think about the disaster that’s going on in Lexington … like a natural disaster,” Ricketts said, “so it’s locally executed, state supported or state managed, federally supported [and] we’re supporting the state of Nebraska.” 
Lexington is likely see 3,200 workers lose their jobs. The statewide economic loss, including both direct and ripple effects, has been estimated at $3.28 billion a year, according to a University of Nebraska-Lincoln Bureau of Business Research analysis. 
The west-central Nebraska city is home to more than 10,000 people.

State agencies have partnered with Lexington nonprofits and other groups to support the affected workers. Gov. Jim Pillen told the press after his State of the State address that he is “pushing at every meeting” with Tyson to decide the future of the plant “sooner than later.”  
Tyson has not scheduled any shifts at the Lexington facility this week, according to Farm Journal.
The letter from Schumer comes after Ricketts’ Senate race opponent this fall, registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn, used a campaign appearance in Lexington to highlight the plant’s loss. He accused the company of breaking the century-old law. Tyson also is reducing its operations in a plant in Amarillo, in the Texas panhandle.
The Ricketts campaign said Schumer is “amplifying Osborn’s political grandstanding.”  
“Dan Osborn will be a consistent yes vote for Schumer’s far-left agenda. … It’s why Schumer spent $3.85 million on Osborn’s last campaign,” said Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson. “Nebraskans will see through these political games.” 
Dan Osborn said the interest from Washington is “too little and too late.”

“The workers and their families in Lexington are the latest to have the rug pulled out from under them by corporate greed. … Where has Pete Ricketts been on all this?” Osborn asked. 
Nebraska also lost a Tyson plant in 2006 in Norfolk. U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, a Republican from Norfolk representing the 1st Congressional District, has said Tyson “stripped the plant bare” and the property couldn’t be used as a beef processing facility. Flood said the plant still sits empty today. 
Tyson’s Lexington plant is set to close next week.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-17 02:51:34+00:00,Mississippi Today,Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss sues NCAA to seek extra year of eligibility,"Mark Pratt, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/16/trinidad-chambliss-sues-ncaa/,"Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss throws during the first half of the Fiesta Bowl NCAA college football playoff semifinal game against Miami, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, in Glendale, Ariz.","Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss sued the NCAA in state court on Friday for an additional year of eligibility so he can play for the Rebels next season.
The suit filed in Lafayette County came a week after the NCAA denied Ole Miss’ request for an extra year, saying the university and Chambliss’ previous school — Ferris State — failed to provide adequate medical documentation to back up the request.
The lawsuit filed Friday called the NCAA’s denial in “bad-faith, unreasonable and arbitrary,” and detailed Chambliss’ history of illness and included letters from physicians.
“Despite the duty of good faith and fair dealing it owes to Trinidad, the NCAA insists on considering the evidence in Trinidad’s case in an isolated, rather than comprehensive manner; interpreting its rules to impose requirements not contained therein; taking unreasonable if not irrational positions; and acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner in its decision-making and ruling,” the suit says.
Ole Miss’ arguments revolve around the fact that the 23-year-old Chambliss, although he has been in college for five years, has only played three years of college football because of that medical history.
“Trinidad first enrolled in Ferris State in the fall of 2021, but medical and physical incapacity prevented his ability to adequately train and condition and develop athletically,” the suit says.
After taking a redshirt his first season at Ferris State in 2021-22, Chambliss was held out in his second season for medical reasons.
“Obviously, Trinidad’s medical conditions, which rendered him incapable of competing in any game during these years, were beyond his or Ferris State’s control,” the suit says.
He played two more seasons at the Division II school in Michigan, leading the Bulldogs to a national championship before transferring to Ole Miss before the start of this season.
Chambliss completed 294 of 445 passes (66.1%) for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and three interceptions for Ole Miss (13-2), which set a school record for wins, including two after making the College Football Playoff for the first time. He ran for 527 yards and eight more TDs.
The Rebels lost 31-27 to Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinals on Jan. 8.
The NCAA, when contacted Friday, did not have a new statement, but referred to its statement from a week ago saying “This decision aligns with consistent application of NCAA rules.”
The NCAA said in that week-old statement that approval of such waivers requires schools to submit medical documentation from a treating physician at the time of a student’s incapacitating injury or illness.
“The documents provided by Ole Miss and the student’s prior school include a physician’s note from a December 2022 visit, which stated the student-athlete was ‘doing very well’ since he was seen in August 2022,” the NCAA said. “Additionally, the student-athlete’s prior school indicated it had no documentation on medical treatment, injury reports or medical conditions involving the student-athlete during that time frame and cited ‘developmental needs and our team’s competitive circumstances’ as its reason the student-athlete did not play in the 2022-23 season.”

Kyrsten Sinema was asked to describe the world’s current chapter in history during a Salt Lake City event, the question was almost unintelligible, obstructed by the yells of a heckler and the quick movement of security officers dragging him outside.
“Disruptive,” Sinema said, “and I promise I didn’t plan for that.”
A few minutes later, a second heckler appeared interrupting the session as well. Both of them yelled they were having affairs with Sinema, a nod to the news of a lawsuit filed against her for “alienation of affection” after being accused of having an affair with a former member of her security team.
Sinema, currently an adviser for a law and lobbying firm and for cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, was visiting Salt Lake City on Friday to speak on a panel about policy and partnerships with Gov. Spencer Cox and Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Director Natalie Gochnour, part of the Utah Chamber and Gardner Institute’s Utah Economic Outlook and Public Policy Summit.

After the interruptions, Sinema continued her thoughts on what she described as “a period of incredible disruption,” especially with the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies.

“So AI is changing the way that we work and the way that we interact with each other. It will also change the way that we consider jobs,” she said. “Jobs will look different in the future, and there’s always a period of disruption. This has been true since the invention of electricity, right? Since the invention of the internet, right?”
The discussion followed the presentation of the annual Economic Report to the Governor from the Gardner Institute, which made projections of moderate economic expansion for the state throughout 2026. 
The institute also projected 1.3% population growth in Utah from 2026 to 2027 — the same population growth calculated in 2025. That would outpace the national average, but at the same time, represents a slower rate than the state’s historical trend. 
And while the state remains the youngest in the country, the population is aging, reports from the Gardner Institute say.

One of Cox’s concerns, he said on Friday, is to be prepared “when that silver tsunami hits us,” but also, he worries about the decline of the state’s fertility rate.
“Our society is a pyramid scheme. It is, and it always has been, and that’s a very positive thing,” he said, prompting some laughs. “We need those next generations. Now that doesn’t even touch on our social safety nets and what happens when you don’t have the workers who are paying the taxes to deliver the social security that people are relying on to retire, we are screwed if we don’t have that.”
Sinema agreed with Cox, saying that if nothing changes at the federal level, by the time she and the governor reach retirement age, “there will be no social security.”
Cox had mostly kind words for business representatives who attended the summit. But, he finished his remarks warning that he was about to be blunt with them.
“You’ve abandoned us. You have. We do not see the business community on Capitol Hill like we did when I started this 10 years ago. It’s not even close,” he said. “Everybody just kind of does their thing, and they’ll complain about legislation, but they don’t show up.”
He urged them to also find other people to be at the Legislature if they are unhappy with its results.
“Some of you need to run for the Legislature, we need you. We desperately need you,” he said.
Sinema had a similar message, but for everyone in the country.
“If you don’t like the tone, if you don’t like the ugliness, if you think, ‘Gosh, this is distasteful,’ the thing we’ve got to remember is that we as Americans, we built this. This is us,” she said. “We created it, so we choose who we put in these positions. We choose who to reward, we choose who to punish.”
When asked about Utah’s culture and social cohesion, Sinema said that having spent a significant portion of her life in the state, she knows it’s “a very special place.”
“Utahns, with two notable exceptions today,” she said, “are just very generous, kind.”

We cannot sustain world-class institutions if we squeeze workers and residents who make them run. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Narain Batra: Growth is pushing the Upper Valley to breaking point.","This commentary is by Narain Batra, a professor, historian, journalist and author whose work spans freedom, artificial intelligence, media and geopolitics. 



The Upper Valley, a most extraordinary economic and cultural heartbeat of the vast twin-state region, is currently at a turning point where outstanding institutional growth is colliding with a bucolic infrastructure that’s pushing against its limits and raising the question of affordability.
The colossal footprint of Dartmouth Health remains the region’s major economic driver. The final phases of the Patient Pavilion at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) are scheduled for completion in August 2026, adding new inpatient beds and specialized units, according to Tom Manion, DHMC’s chief operating officer. 
But its expansion is reaching a critical threshold, and the so-called Upper Valley paradox — it is building beds for patients but lacks roofs for staff — is evident. 
Dartmouth College is doing its part to mitigate the housing crunch through its Sugarwood Circle project in West Lebanon, a $15.2 million development specifically for Dartmouth employees.
It is slated for initial occupancy in January 2026, as part of President Sian Leah Beilock’s commitment to add 1,000 beds for faculty, staff, and students in the next 10 years.
Keeping affordability expectations in mind, the “company town” model could perhaps become a primary survival strategy for major employers in the Upper Valley: most of the stores, businesses, and housing in the town would be partially or fully owned by the same company that is also the main employer. 
Consider this: as of late 2025, the median home price in Grafton County surged 12.4%, almost triple the statewide average, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. 
Lawmakers in both Concord and Montpelier are facing rebellion from business leaders who argue that 1970s-era regulations are strangling growth. 
The Vermont Chamber’s 2026 Legislative Priorities emphasize “workforce and housing alignment” and the need for regulatory predictability.
According to the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, “Affordability pressures, demographic decline, and rising operating costs are converging just as our state needs more workers, more housing, and greater predictability to sustain economic growth.” 
For Upper Valley residents, 2026 will raise questions about zoning laws and whether they can combine new housing opportunities with environmental preservation. The question is no longer if the region must change, but how fast it can adapt its legal framework to keep pace with its economic potential. 
The most disquieting question of 2026 is what might be termed the property tax shock. As towns upgrade infrastructure to support growth, sooner or later, the bill will arrive. 
Vermont homeowners are facing a projected average 12% education property tax increase in 2026, driven by rising school costs. For the average homeowner in the Upper Valley, rising home valuations are no longer viewed as a wealth gain but a liability. 
Property tax bills jump while the local school district is still forced to cut staff, which, to residents like me, seems a cruel joke.
The Upper Valley’s labor crisis has been worsened by federal policy. Deportations and intensified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, such as the recent high-profile actions against farmworkers in the Champlain Valley and Upper Valley dairy farms, have created a chilling effect that extends far beyond the undocumented community. 
Dairy farmers in the region, who are largely ineligible for the H-2A seasonal visa program, are facing serious threats. According to the Business & Human Rights Centre, many workers are now afraid to leave the farms to get basic necessities. The loss of even a few key milkers can force a multigeneration family farm to close down.
In New Hampshire, the landscape shifted drastically on Jan. 1 as new anti-sanctuary laws took full effect. Communities like Lebanon and Hanover have been forced to amend their ordinances to allow police cooperation with ICE or face state penalties of up to 25% of their funding.
With deaths now outnumbering births in the region, growth is almost entirely predicated on migration. International migrants fill a disproportionate share of essential roles in health care, manufacturing and domestic services, according to USA Facts. 
The Upper Valley in 2026 is a microcosm of the modern American dilemma: high-tech and high-demand, but low inventory in housing and labor. 
It’s a region with a “We Are Hiring” sign permanently affixed to its front door, finally realizing it cannot sustain its world class institutions if it continues to squeeze the workers and residents who make them run.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. Justice Department has issued subpoenas to Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey as part of a criminal investigation into whether they’ve impeded federal immigration enforcement, the Washington Post reported Friday.
The investigation intensifies an already combustible conflict between the feds and Minnesota, while also adding to the DOJ’s list of targets deemed enemies by President Donald Trump and his administration. 
A DOJ spokesperson declined comment. 
Walz’s office said he hadn’t received any notice of investigation. 
Walz replied in a statement to the news: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly,” he said, referring to the U.S. senators who made a video telling U.S. servicemembers that they can and must refuse illegal orders, as well as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has refused to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump desires. “Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” Walz said. 
Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement and our residents against the chaos and danger this administration has brought to our streets.” 
He added: “I will not be intimidated.” 
The Post reported that “the subpoenas suggest that the Justice Department is examining whether Walz’s and Frey’s public statements disparaging the surge of officers and federal actions have amounted to criminal interference in law enforcement work.”
Walz, who announced earlier this month he won’t seek a third term, also used his statement to criticize the federal government for not properly investigating the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” he said.   
Six prosecutors in the Minnesota Office of U.S. Attorney quit this week, The New York Times reported, because they objected to their bosses’ push to investigate the widow of Good and their ties to anti-ICE groups. 
The ICE surge, which has put as many as 3,000 federal agents in the state — or nearly five times the number of sworn officers with the Minneapolis Police Department — is just the latest round of an ongoing conflict between Minnesota and the federal government. Fraud in Minnesota’s social programs — often funded in whole or part by the federal government — has caught the attention of right-wing media and activists, and the Trump administration has followed with a wide array of investigations of Minnesota programs across a range of agencies.  
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is auditing Hennepin Healthcare — Minnesota’s largest safety net hospital — for compliance with immigrant employment eligibility laws.
The Trump administration has frozen child care payments and halted small business grants. The administration also says it’s investigating possible housing assistance fraud and looking into Minnesota’s unemployment insurance program. The federal government has also attempted to withhold funds to Minnesota for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, but a federal court issued a preliminary injunction.
Earlier this week, Trump said he would cut all federal funding to Minnesota and other states that have sanctuary cities beginning Feb. 1, but it’s unclear what that means and few details have been released.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9332-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 20:57:41.157388

(Photo by Jeremy Edwards/Federal Emergency Management Agency)Landslides, storm-driven floods, infrastructure-damaging permafrost thaw and intensifying wildfires are among the expensive disasters that scientists link to Alaska’s rapidly changing climate.
Now a state legislator is proposing to levy a 20-cent surcharge on every barrel of Alaska-produced oil to fund programs that respond to and prepare for disasters related to climate change.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, introduced the measure, House Bill 247, in advance of the legislative session scheduled to start on Jan. 20.
To explain why the state needs such a fund, Josephson ticked off a list of recent disasters in Alaska that imposed heavy costs — and, in some cases, killed people. Those events, which include deadly landslides in Southeast Alaska, landslides that have blocked roads, severe flooding in Western Alaska last October from the remnants of Typhoon Halong and similar damage in 2022 from the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, all had some links to climate change that is caused by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning, he said.
“It’s a true statement that a lot of the disaster dollars we need right now are related to climate change. That, in my opinion, is sort of inarguable,” he said.
Disasters like those that have occurred in recent years are expected to continue in the future, he said: “We’re in a new normal.”
The bill is logical from a fiscal standpoint, Josephson said.
As of now, the state’s disaster relief fund is “basically a sub-fund of the general fund,” and it gets whatever lawmakers are able to appropriate, he said. But if there is a new stream of money as proposed by his bill, “we would free up those dollars we’re otherwise spending in the disaster relief fund.”
At 20 cents per barrel, the proposed surcharge would raise about $30 million a year, he said.
In comparison, Gov. Mike Dunleavy in December proposed that lawmakers approve a $40 million appropriation for the state’s existing disaster relief fund. The need could increase from that total if the Trump administration fails to reimburse 100% of the costs for Typhoon Halong relief rather than the normal 75%. The Biden administration in 2022 approved 100% reimbursement for Merbok-related costs.
As introduced by Josephson, the bill would give the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation oversight over the money generated by the surcharge. It would distribute fund money in the form of grants to local governments and other entities for purposes like disaster response, disaster preparation and upgrades that make infrastructure better protected against climate change.
The surcharge idea has precedent in Alaska. The Department of Environmental Conservation already administers another fund with money coming from a per-barrel fee on oil produced in the state.

	After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the state began levying a 5-cent-per-barrel surcharge on oil that goes into the state’s Oil and Hazardous Substance Release Prevention and Response Fund. The fund itself was created by the legislature in 1986, with the surcharge established after the disastrous Prince William Sound spill.
That surcharge and rules concerning the fund’s operations have been modified over the years, broadening the purposes for which the fund can be used and boosting DEC’s reporting requirements, according to the department.
In its current configuration, each 5-cent-per-barrel surcharge sends 1 cent into a spill response account, to be used for spills that have been officially declared disasters. The other 4 cents goes into a spill prevention account, which can be used to address spills that have not been declared disasters, among other functions.
In 2015, refined petroleum products were added to the program. The state added a small surcharge, 0.95 cents per gallon, on refined fuel projects sold, transferred or used at the wholesale level, according to the DEC.
The idea of a similar levy to raise money for climate change preparedness and response is not new.
Rick Steiner, a retired University of Alaska marine conservation professor who founded and leads an environmental organization called Oasis Earth, has been advocating for the approach for several years.
“The legislature has so far seemed unable or unwilling to connect the dots between the many climate-related disasters we are experiencing — typhoon Merbok, wildfires, landslides, floods, coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, storm damage, infrastructure damage, subsistence impacts, commercial fishing impacts, etc..– to see the larger picture of the threat and costs these interrelated climate disasters pose,” he said in a letter to lawmakers sent last September. “The money to address these issues will have to come from government.”
In advocating for what he called an Alaska Climate Resilience Fund, Steiner said funding issues have become more pressing because of federal cutbacks.
The climate-response surcharge idea is not unique to Alaska, either.
Hawaii has put its version of a climate surcharge into law, a measure that seeks to raise money for responses to future disasters like the deadly 2023 Lahaina wildfire on the island of Maui.
In May, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, signed a bill that increases the state’s hotel and lodging tax by less than a percentage point. The increase is applied to the state’s Transient Accommodations Tax, known at TAT. The governor said the increase would amount to an additional charge of about $3 on a $400-a-night hotel room fee. It is expected to generate about $100 million a year, according to state officials.

Hoskinson Health Wellness Clinic's owner, Charles Hoskinson, also laid off 136 workers from his Gillette-based construction and concrete businesses in December.
The post Gillette clinic lays off around 40 people appeared first on WyoFile .","The Hoskinson Health Wellness Clinic announced plans Friday to eliminate around 40 positions at its Gillette medical facility. 
The clinic, which opened in 2022, said it’s not at risk of closing. It will continue serving 20,000 patients with a staff of around 250 employees, according to a clinic spokesperson. Patients affected by discontinued services will be notified directly. 
“To continue fulfilling its original goal of improving rural health care, the Clinic must come to terms with some harsh realities that have hurt its ability to perform in an efficient manner,” a clinic press release stated.
The clinic, along with construction and concrete businesses in Gillette that laid off a combined 136 workers in December, were founded by Charles Hoskinson, CEO and founder of Input Output Group. 
Declining reimbursement rates, escalating costs, including high provider salaries, and the facility’s payer mix were listed as factors driving the staff reduction in the clinic’s press release. 
“To ensure the Clinic can continue serving the people of Gillette and Northeast Wyoming who depend on us, the health care facility must operate in a significantly more cost-effective manner,” the release said. 
The layoff comes as Wyoming residents face mounting obstacles to health care access. Hospitals have shut down services like delivery wards in recent years, patients increasingly drive long distances for specialty care and state residents insured on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are experiencing the highest premium increases nationwide because Congress did not extend tax subsidies. 
“Hoskinson has been a key source of care for Gillette and surrounding communities, helping residents access medical services close to home,” Wyoming Health Resources Network Executive Director Amanda Teppo said. “Like many rural and frontier providers across Wyoming, it is facing financial pressures from rising costs and ongoing workforce shortages.
“While specific service changes are not yet known, reduced staffing could mean longer wait times, fewer care options, and increased strain on patients, providers, and emergency services,” she continued. “These challenges reflect the broader struggle to sustain reliable, accessible health care in rural and frontier communities throughout Wyoming.” 
Layoffs across town 
Hoskinson companies announced in December a combined 123 layoffs among its construction and concrete businesses in Gillette and that Hoskinson Concrete would be permanently closed. The actual number of layoffs in December was 136, a spokesperson told WyoFile on Friday.
Though some employees dispute this, the December job cuts were anticipated, according to the Hoskinson firm.
“The large-scale construction needs that led the clinic to create an in-house construction company have come to an end,” Hoskinson Contracting CEO Chris Davis said in a press statement at the time. “As a result, Hoskinson Contracting is scaling back its operations, and the Hoskinson Concrete division is being closed.”
Every laid-off employee would remain on payroll through January, a Hoskinson spokesperson told WyoFile at the time. A spokesperson confirmed the information with WyoFile on Friday.
Workers affected by layoffs can reach out to the Gillette Workforce Center, state workforce officials have advised. Job seekers can look for employment and register at the HireWyo website.

Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that the seed company, Nutrien Ag Solutions, as well as its partner, the Montana Seed Growers Association, have known about an abusive pattern by the colony’s men, but rely on the Hutterite colony’s business and so disregarded the claims, even though court documents say the company investigated the allegation and found the company should have taken steps to make the workplace more secure.
The incident involves several interactions with male members of the Hilldale Colony and the Nutrien facility in Havre. The lawsuit accuses Leonard J. Waldner of sexually assaulting the victim, and says that the religious colony leaders have actually helped the man escape to Canada.
A request for comment by Nutrien went unanswered Friday by time of publication.
Court documents filed in Missoula County District Court say that early in her employment the victim raised safety concerns because she was sometimes the only employee at the facility. She requested Nutrien install security cameras, as she was also worried about vandalism. In the court filing, she also said that the company has a very specific policy against the use of deadly force and has a policy which outlaws pepper spray and tasers.
“Nutrien refused, claiming it was too expensive, delaying the installation of cameras due to only allowing approved vendors (on site),” the lawsuit said.
The victim renewed her request after an April 8, 2024 incident in which she recalled a semi-truck pulling up just as she was leaving work. It appeared the man, an unidentified Hutterite worker, needed help unloading pallets. She said the man asked if she was alone, and she told him she’d quickly unload them.
“Take your time, please. I like to watch a woman work,” the court documents said.
“He then watched the plaintiff very closely as she bent over to unload the pallets, making her physically uncomfortable,” the documents said.
When the victim told her supervisors about it, her boss said that he would be fired because of it, but seemed to blame the victim for not addressing it herself.
She then renewed her request for security cameras. According to the court filing, Nutrien did not install cameras.
On Oct. 17, 2024, she was working around lunch when the other employee was making deliveries. That’s when she interacted with Waldner. Often, the documents say, Hutterite colony workers would bring produce for sale, and she asked if they had any pumpkin pies. Though he said no, they agreed she’d buy one of their turkeys. As Waldner was leaving he stretched his arms to give her a hug, and she “awkwardly complied.”
“She felt uncomfortable, and even more so when Waldner whispered to her, ‘This is just between you and me,’” the court documents said.
The victim went back inside the office and saw the truck pull behind the building. He appeared in her office and brought her a pie. Notably, the victim said he had never come inside the office. He then walked around to her desk and looked at her family photos. The court documents record the alleged conversation:
“Isn’t it fun,” he asked.
She replied that she loved her family.
“No, the best part — and why I have five kids — is making them,” he said, recounting how nice the hug from her was.
Waldner asked about her coworker and she replied that he was at another colony.
“They sure leave you alone a lot and without cameras,” he said, according to court documents.
At that point, the court documents say that he physically moved toward her, pinning her with his legs, arms and body grabbing at her chest and pants. He pulled her pants down. She recounted that she feared if she tried to fight, he’d only become more aggressive, but felt him kissing her and making noises. When he stopped, he went to the bathroom, and the victim noted semen on the floor.
She told a coworker and then called her husband.
“They immediately called to report the assault to Havre Police Department. When (the victim) was put on the phone to try to tell police what had happened, she could not stop crying or calm down enough to articulate everything that had just occurred,” the court filing said.
The lawsuit alleges that the Havre Police never did follow up and Waldner was never questioned. She also reported the incident to Nutrien.
As a result, the lawsuit said she has been through therapy and has post-traumatic stress disorder after the assault.
According to court documents, when Nutrien investigated the assault, it found that she needed mental health support because of the “assaults and violent acts.” The report also said that the incidents also occurred within “Nutrien’s zone of influence” and that the company would need to further review “systemic deficiencies.”
Even after the incident, the victim witnessed three men from the Hilldale Colony telling the victim when she was alone, “You still don’t have cameras, huh?”
  Scope of the lawsuit 

The lawsuit doesn’t just describe the alleged incident in Hill County or Nutrien’s role. It also claims that the other defendants in the lawsuit, including the colony, and the Montana Seed Growers knew about this problem, and had documented other incidents.
The victim was employed by the Seed Growers to perform seed inspections and the organization had a rule about field inspections: Women were not allowed to conduct them alone because of the “Hutterite men like Waldner had a propensity to treat female MSGA employees in an unsafe manner.”
“Despite a known risk of sexual violence and o/or sexual harassment that Hutterite men like Waldner pose to women in the ag industry, the industry does not talk about it, warn women or take meaningful action to prevent it,” the lawsuit said. “The Hutterites’ business is important to the ag industry and defendants here put business over women’s safety.”
The lawsuit said that Nutrien’s general manager said that normally they’d cut off a client, in this case, the Hutterites, which engaged in behavior like this.
“But the accounts are too lucrative for Nutrien to do so,” the lawsuit said. “The Safety and Health Advisor for Nutrien communicated to the plaintiff that Hutterites are important because they keep prices low for the little farmers by buying in bulk.”
The lawsuit alleges a female employee at a Nutrien location in Idaho was attacked by a Hutterite truck driver and left her job. It also states that a woman working at a different Nutrien branch was attacked at approximately the same time and the company did nothing to remedy the problem, or take future actions to protect or warn employees.
The lawsuit said that all organizations knew about the behavior and did nothing to stop it, and the colony is being sued because Waldner was an employee and it should have taken precautions.
“Our aim is not only to secure justice, but to hold fully accountable all those who failed in their duty to protect her and to ensure meaningful change is implemented to protect other women working in Montana’s agricultural industry,” said attorney Michelle Simpson Tuegel.

This story by Sophia Langlois was first published in Valley News on Jan. 13, 2026.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — Isaiah Taylor recalls growing up in Woodsville in an extended family beset by violence and drugs. When he sought help for his addiction as a teenager, he felt no one would listen.
After seven years of incarceration for various crimes, Taylor, now 29, has spent the past year and a half rebuilding his life with help from the Hartford Community Restorative Justice Center, or HCRJC, which guided him as he reentered the job market and secured housing, he said. Its volunteers listened and empathized. 
“It’s not only breaking the cycle of addiction and abuse, but being a better parent to my kid and being a good partner,” said Taylor in an interview earlier this month at the Listen Dining Hall where he now works.
The Justice Center, first established in 2003, is a nonprofit organization that provides community housing, employment opportunities and basic necessities to those seeking a fresh start.
Many clients are referred by the Department of Corrections, but some visit the office on N. Main Street in White River Junction by their own volition. 
The Center currently has five employees and 40 volunteers from the community, Larry Blake Harvey, the Justice Center’s executive director, said. The organization is primarily funded by the Vermont Department of Corrections through transitional housing and restorative justice grants, in addition to other grants and community donations.

Harvey hopes to increase awareness about the work they do and bring in more volunteers.
“We are in a political and public climate where concerns about safety and crime feel more visible, and there is growing pressure on law enforcement and courts to respond more harshly,” Harvey said in an email.
The Center offers a safer, more effective response to harm, said Harvey.
There are programs to ensure mental wellness, including creative classes and Circles of Support and Accountability, or CoSA — which involve meeting with a support system of volunteers devoted to helping clients work through personal issues and plan for the future.
“The evidence is really clear. When the folks who are reentering society or communities after incarceration do not receive support and services similar to what we offer here, recidivism is a high likelihood,” Harvey said in an interview at the Center.
Of the more than 100 clients the center supports each year, more than 90% find employment and stability, and do not reoffend during program participation, according to the HCRJC website. About half of the Justice Center clients participate in its programs as an alternative to jail time for more minor crimes if completed successfully. 
As a child, Taylor’s home life involved drugs and abuse, he said. He felt stuck in this environment and remained surrounded by people who promoted a similar lifestyle, leading to an addiction to opiates, heroin and crack cocaine as a teenager.
After spending years in the prison system as a result of drug charges, aggravated assault and burglary, Taylor was released in 2024, hoping for stability. When first offered support by the Justice Center days prior to getting out, he thought it was too good to be true. Promises of housing and work had been made to Taylor before, but always seemed to fall apart.

“I’ve dealt with a lot of trauma, and been let down so much in my life,” said Taylor. “I’ve been through the system and the system is so corrupt that I felt like they were selling me hopes and dreams.”
The Center connected Taylor with Larry Lowndes, the former manager at Listen Dining Hall in White River Junction.
After Taylor volunteered at Listen for a summer, Sherise Simpson, Listen’s community meals manager at Listen, hired him, she said in an interview at the Listen Dining Hall Tuesday. As a recovery-friendly workplace, the organization is all about second chances, she said.
When Taylor first started working at Listen, the Human Resources department gave him an opportunity to explain his record based on information online regarding his past crimes. They listened to Taylor’s story, and he said he felt they trusted that his days of using drugs were behind him.
“I just think it’s good to be honest about it and talk about it because I feel like a lot of people don’t talk about it and that’s kind of the problem,” said Taylor. 
After one month as a dining hall food service assistant, Taylor was promoted to senior associate, Simpson said. He also earned two raises this year. She has no concerns about Taylor’s working ability and considers him kind and self driven.
“He cares about the guests; he cares about the food that goes out, about the quality,” said Simpson. “You can’t teach people skills. You can’t teach how to be nice.”
He now lives, with his girlfriend and 4-year-old daughter, in a post-transitional apartment with affordable rent coordinated by the Center, Harvey said. In his free time, Taylor focuses on health and fitness by going to the gym. 
The Justice Center also helped Johnathan Gordon, 45, reintegrate into society when he was released from incarceration in 2018, after serving an 11-year sentence. The Center helped Gordon find a restaurant job in White River Junction less than a week after he got out.

Gordon worked with his CoSA of 12 people over that first year to become more open about his past. He said that he had the biggest group of any client because he asked for extra support. 
“I wasn’t quite open about my offense or anything. They wanted me to be more open about it,” Gordon said in an interview at the Center earlier this month.
When it came to getting through the hiring process for later roles in White River Junction, Gordon decided to be upfront about his sex crime conviction, oftentimes having a conversation with the manager before even applying. 
“It took me a while to figure out how to say it, but I got used to it,” said Gordon.
A criminal record can create difficulty when seeking employment. However, both Taylor and Gordon say they found it effective to let their work ethic speak for itself. 
“I’m the type of employee who will show up 10 minutes before I’m doing the work,” said Gordon.
Gordon has worked at the Britton Lumber Company based in Bath, N.H., for about three months. Reached by phone, product manager John Moses, Gordon’s boss, declined to comment on his work ethic.
After his release from incarceration, in addition to finding work, Gordon began living independently in East Corinth and purchased a vehicle. In 2024, he married his husband, Phil Garland.
As of May 16, Gordon will no longer be on parole, meaning he’ll be completely free and unsupervised after 20 years in the justice system. He is interested in volunteering with the Center and, ultimately, finding a job that involves operating construction vehicles. Harvey said over the phone that Gordon already volunteers on a monthly basis, and is often the first to offer his advice and phone number to new clients.
Gordon advises future clients to ask for help and be open. The most important step is a willingness to change, he said, and the volunteers will help from there.
Kitty O’Hara, a Woodstock resident, is the longest-serving volunteer at the Center, having been involved since 2012. Gordon described her as his “strongest supporter” since the beginning of his time there, even teaching him to drive so he could get a license for the first time.
“We all make mistakes, and that doesn’t mean you can’t change,” said O’Hara. “To just dismiss them like they’re throwaway people, I just think that’s such a big mistake. They really can contribute back to society. They just need a little help.”
O’Hara said that those who complete long prison sentences often have never owned a cellphone before and need assistance setting up a bank account and getting a job. The goal is to help people move on by providing those initial resources as well as mental health support along the way. 
O’Hara teaches art classes at the Center for any interested clients. The creative projects promote mindfulness and connecting with other community members in a low-pressure environment, O’Hara said.
One student, Jonney Reisinger, 58, has a particular interest in art. As a member of the AVA Gallery in Lebanon, Reisinger had his art on display for a member show. 
Reisinger has been with the Center for two years, since completing a six-month sentence. During his first visit, Reisinger wasn’t sure who to trust. Now, he is proud to have created works of art and formed friendships with both volunteers and other clients. He bought a car and works in the warehouse at Upper Valley Produce, and looks forward to seeing what other opportunities come his way. 
“It’s so exciting to see that somebody I work with now is a member of the AVA Gallery (and) is showing some of his work,” said O’Hara. “And I look at John (Gordon), and how he’s progressed. It makes you feel good.”
The Center is seeking more volunteers as it expands programming in 2026. The organization plans to add new housing units, as an average of 140 people in Vermont stay in jail longer than their sentences due to a lack of transitional housing, Harvey said. The Center also wants to increase outreach by teaching community members — particularly youth — how to handle conflict and repair harm.
Harvey calls on community members to join the cause by taking an active role in helping respond to harm. Ways to contribute could include mentoring clients, supporting victims of crimes, practical assistance in transportation, job searches, etc., and teaching a special skill as a class at the Center.
Even as he is starting to move on from his past, Taylor said he wants to keep in touch with the people at the Justice Center because of how much they helped him. His job at Listen also gives him the chance to pay it forward. 
“I really like being here because I can help people that are in the same position as I was. I see a lot of homeless people my age come in and a lot of people who aren’t working, and I’ve helped a lot of people,” said Taylor. “It feels good to give back.”
Those interested in volunteering on a regular or occasional basis are encouraged to fill out the interest form on the HCRJC website.

Language in park’s 75-year-old founding legislation means its staff will have to make recommendations to provide more hunting, though opportunities may be limited. 
The post Trump administration wants to boost hunting in Grand Teton National Park appeared first on WyoFile .","The National Park Service has four months to develop ideas for how to increase elk hunting in Grand Teton National Park following a directive from U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
A Jan. 7 secretarial order requires federal land managers to come up with recommendations for increasing hunting and fishing opportunities on public lands managed by the U.S. Department of Interior. 
Typically, the Park Service doesn’t allow hunting — the agency’s founding legislation, the 1916 Organic Act, generally prohibits it. But there are dozens of parks where Congress made an exception, and Grand Teton National Park is one of them. 
Teton Park spokeswoman Emily Davis referred WyoFile to the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. for questions. The 310,000-acre park is still awaiting specific guidance regarding Burgum’s order, she said.

But the secretarial directive makes it clear that Teton Park has until May 8 to provide recommendations for “expanding opportunities” related to hunting authorized by Congress. Additionally, park staff must review regulations to “identify restrictions on hunting or fishing” that exceed their authorities and then identify “appropriate” modifications. 
In Grand Teton, elk hunting is the only type of hunting authorized by Congress. Language in the park’s enabling legislation calls for a “controlled and managed reduction” of elk by “qualified and experienced hunters” who are considered “deputized rangers.” Partly because of the setting — it takes place near roads and sometimes in view of tourists — the annual park hunt has proven controversial at times, even triggering litigation. 
The Park Service sets hunting seasons and quotas for Grand Teton’s annual fall hunt, dubbed a “reduction program,” in consultation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

Because the Jackson Elk Herd has hovered slightly below its 11,000-animal objective and long-distance migrating elk pass through Teton Park, hunting there has been scaled back significantly. Although hundreds of licenses were once available for the hunt, tag numbers have fallen to 20 in the park, classified as hunt area 75 by Wyoming. 
Wildlife disease experts predict the Jackson Herd will shrink considerably in the years and decades to come because of the effects of chronic wasting disease. A planning process is underway to alter the historic practice of elk feeding and avert the worst consequences of the always-fatal disease.

Those factors may make it difficult for federal and state wildlife managers to achieve Burgum’s vision and ramp up elk hunting opportunities in Teton Park. 
“The Wyoming Game and Fish Department objective for the Jackson Elk Herd is 11,000, and it’s been below that for the last three years,” Wyoming Wildlife Advocates Executive Director Kristin Combs told WyoFile. “It seems like Game and Fish would not want to increase hunting within Grand Teton National Park.” 
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department declined an interview for this story. 
Grand Teton isn’t the only park that may run into difficulties, National Parks Conservation Association lobbyist Kristen Brengel said. There are nearly 70 Park Service units where hunting is permitted, including the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, where hunting seasons are broader and mirror those set by Game and Fish. But the Congressional language authorizing park-specific hunts is oftentimes quite restrictive, she said. 
“You can’t abandon the Organic Act to hunt,” Brengel said. “That’s why I think this is going to be a fruitless exercise.” 
Brengel also questioned the wisdom of adding duties — in this case, requiring a planning process — for national parks that have been steadily shedding staff. The Park Service has lost a quarter of its staff since the second Trump administration began, she said, and as of October, Grand Teton’s full-time, year-round workforce had dwindled by 20%. 
“If Doug Burgum wants more of something, he should focus on more staff,” Brengel said. “You’re not going to get any of these things that he wants done with the amount of staff he has now at the Park Service.” 
Although Park Service advocates have not met Burgum’s directive favorably, the reception has been warmer in other circles. The order applies to all Interior Department agencies, including those where hunting is more commonplace, such as the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Greg Sheehan, president and CEO of the Mule Deer Foundation, called the directive “one of the most important conservation and access actions taken in decades.” 
“Secretary Burgum is reaffirming that hunting and fishing are not fringe activities on public lands,” Sheehan said in a statement. “They are foundational to how wildlife is conserved, funded, and managed in America.”
In a Congressional hearing Tuesday, Wyoming resident and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik cited Burgum’s order as an example of the good he believes the Trump administration is doing for public lands. 
“I don’t believe that anybody should be worried about what this administration is doing with public lands,” Nesvik said.

Vermont should prepare for a future with more mysterious objects in the sky, one lawmaker argues.

Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, speaks before the House Government Operations Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, Jan. 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger

He started with an apology.
“If your inbox looks at all like mine since the introduction of this bill, I think I owe you all an apology,” Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, told the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee.
Why had Headrick’s bill — one of more than 600 in play in the House this session — caused such a stir?
Because H.654 is about UFOs. Sorta.
The bill proposes creating a state task force to evaluate reports of unidentified aerospace and underwater objects, assess airspace safety risks and coordinate with federal partners and academics on the topic, with the goal of recommending better policies for the future. The new body would be led by officials from Vermont’s departments of public safety and transportation, with additional membership from lawmakers and relevant experts. 
In short, the legislation concerns UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena, a topic that’s attracted increasing federal attention and lawmaking.
There’s potential for fun in the proposed task force, too. 
“For the cryptids fans in the room, there’s an underwater provision to this as well, so if we want to investigate Champ, we can do that,” Headrick said, nodding to Vermont’s favorite sea monster. (In an interview, Headrick described himself as “agnostic” on the existence of extraterrestrial life.)
“I am not a subject matter expert at all,” Headrick said. “As policymakers, I think we have an obligation to remain attentive to emerging” trends in public safety, he added. 
And he expected military and commercial airline officials would line up to testify on Vermont’s attempt to stay ahead of the atmospheric curve. 
But if skeptics remain unconvinced of the need for his proposed task force, Headrick highlighted a more down-to-earth purpose.
“The proliferation of drone use — this is where I see the need for data,” Headrick told the committee. In the years to come, Vermonters might receive their groceries and packages via drones, as is already happening in other parts of the country. Buzzing propellers in the sky might not cause anyone to think twice as these unmanned aircrafts become normalized, but if they’re not regulated, Headrick suggested, there could be new safety concerns. 
Whether the gov ops committee, which typically examines the inner workings of state and municipal government, has the appetite to exit the stratosphere, time will tell. The body did take testimony from Tucker Anderson, a legislative attorney, to walk through the bill in all its legal detail — the last agenda item in a morning packed with new bills.  
“Appreciate the committee’s patience and tolerance for the last several hours of walkthroughs and overviews,” Anderson told lawmakers. “I always appreciate a close encounter with all of you.”

In the know
“Everything is on the table.”
That’s how Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre City, framed three bills that would transform the state’s approach to taxing Vermont’s high earners to his colleagues in the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday morning.
“The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer,” Waszazak said. 
Waszazak’s H.619 would create a “surcharge” tax of 3% for those earning over $1 million, while H.621 would create two new top-level tax brackets that raise income tax by 3% and 5% for those making over $500,000 and over $1 million, respectively. He described the two measures as different approaches to the same idea.
H.620 would create a “wealth tax commission” tasked with analyzing the state’s taxation of wealth with a focus on areas that are “escaping taxation.” 
Waszazak pointed to his constituents in Barre City, some of whom he said are struggling to keep up with health care costs and the price of housing. “These are the folks … who we want to invest in as a state,” he said.

On the move
The House passed a bill Friday morning that would create an emergency aid fund for farms and forestry operations affected by natural disasters. Qualifying business owners could apply to recoup up to half of damages they can’t cover another way, up to $150,000. Despite devastating damage from floods and drought in recent years, roughly 70% of farms statewide don’t carry crop insurance.
S.60, which was introduced last year by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, will return to the Senate for consideration. Several House committees made changes to the Senate’s version of the bill, which included making forestry outfits eligible for the fund, and adding a provision legislators say will streamline the payout process. 
The latest version of the bill doesn’t carry an appropriation, meaning the program won’t run — even if the bill becomes law — unless the Legislature sets aside money for it in the state budget. Some senators’ efforts to write an appropriation into the text of S.60 failed last year.

A fancy new floor plan
What good is the people’s house if people don’t know how to get in, or — if once they do get in — they don’t know where to go? 
That’s the question Sergeant-at-Arms Agatha Kessler posed to the Senate Institutions Committee. She showed the committee renderings Friday of a proposed new Statehouse entryway that a committee of lawmakers have been working to create with an architecture firm since 2023. 
“If you are not a regular here, it’s actually quite intimidating to figure out how to get into the building,” Kessler said. But with a new entryway, she hopes that could change. 
The proposed entrance is set to be on the west side of the building (or to the left if you’re facing it from the front). The curved glass facade would extend from the current building, giving space for a security screening area that funnels to a main lobby with a reception desk. 
The public would only be required to use that entrance during the session, said David Schutz, the state curator, while lawmakers and staff could enter the building through any door with their badge. 
The proposed design could address a need for enhanced security when, as Schutz put it, “important people” are in the building. 
Like everything in government, the project will take time. If everything goes as planned, the new entrance could open its doors for the 2030 session, Kessler said, though the timeline could change if lawmakers don’t want construction going on during the session.

Notable quotable
Vermont’s top economists had a shorter-than-usual timeframe this year to compose their January revenue forecast. Buried in one of their reports, which Tom Kavet and Jeff Carr presented to the Emergency Board on Friday, was the following:
“In an attempt to maximize our analytic time during this compressed schedule, and determine how close our jobs are to being replaced by AI, we explored feeding the economic and revenue facts we determined to be pertinent to various AI models, asking them to draft the text for this report in ‘our style.’”
The result? “Our jobs are safe for now,” the report said, though noted that “it won’t be long before AI could free up at least a day or two of time.”

(Provided by American Prairie)American Prairie’s permit to graze its bison on federal land has been revoked, according to a new decision from Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
The nonprofit conservation group will lose its right to graze bison on seven plots of land in Phillips County. American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana, owning more than 500,000 acres in the state. The nonprofit organization has 940 head of bison across 46,000 acres and a mission to create one of the largest nature preserves in the country.
AP has grazed bison using federal leases since 2022. They stand to lose at least 63,000 acres of land they were leasing to graze on. The organization is also concerned about impacts to other livestock owners.
“Our organization and conservation model remain resilient, but that does not negate the fact that this creates uncertainty for all livestock owners who depend on public lands for grazing,” American Prairie CEO Alison Fox said in a press release. “We have followed the law, complied with every requirement, and prioritized transparency at every step.”
Opponents of their bison operation say the Taylor Grazing Act, a bedrock 1934 piece of agricultural legislation, does not allow for conservation grazing, which is essentially grazing that is done for multiple purposes, including ecological benefit. The act does not define what animals can be grazed, only that the Secretary of the Interior can permit “free grazing within such districts of livestock kept for domestic purposes.” 
In fact, the act appears more concerned with impacts to other industries, specifically naming various resources, like stone and clay, that can be used on those grazing lands and also protecting the ability to mine in those areas.
The Interior’s argument in the decision rests on two words that are not defined in the act: “livestock” and “domestic.” Two other federal laws cited in the decision — the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Public Rangeland Improvement Act don’t define the terms either.
“The BLM’s regulations define the term to mean “species of domestic livestock—cattle, sheep, horses, burros, and goats,” the decision said, citing federal code. “But that definition does not answer the question whether livestock can mean anything other than animals managed as part of a production-oriented operation.” 
The decision attempts to answer that question, saying that the term “stock” is tied to commerce and “domestic” is the opposite of “wild.”
“The dictionary definition, therefore, supports the proposition that livestock as used in the TGA and related authorities refers to animals “kept for sale or trade,” id., and that the authority to issue grazing permits and leases is limited to applicants who will use the animals to graze the public lands in that manner,” the decision reads.
American Prairie has insisted that there’s nothing in those laws preventing grazing by conservation herds. Even more, for they’ve said they qualify as a stock owner and that they are engaged in the livestock business. And they have sanctioned bison hunts as well.
“Our bison herd has supported food security, improved rangeland health, and created valuable opportunities for local nonprofits which include veterans associations, youth organizations, and local sportsmen’s chapters,” Fox said in a release. “Those benefits should matter. Instead, we’re seeing a departure from consistent application of the law that puts producers and working lands at risk.”
Burgum assumed control of the case last year, which came after pressure mounted from Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and the four members of the state’s Congressional delegation.
He praised the decision in a press release.
“Today’s decision by BLM is a win for Montana’s ranchers, our agricultural producers, and the rule of law,” Gianforte said in a statement. “For years, we have raised serious concerns about the federal government’s failure to listen to the folks who live and work the land. By proposing to cancel these permits, BLM is finally acknowledging that federal overreach cannot come at the expense of our local communities and the production agriculture that feeds our nation. I’m proud of our administration’s work to achieve this decision and I would like to thank Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and BLM for following the law and putting Montanans first.”
In that letter, the politicians say American Prairie is harming the state economy, which the nonprofit has bristled at, calling the notion “absurd” last year. 
Gianforte painted the decision as a win for farmers and ranchers, though some ranchers have expressed that billionaire ranch owners are a bigger problem than any issues they might have at American Prairie.
“This administration will always stand with our farmers and ranchers against federal overreach,” Gov. Gianforte concluded. “We will continue to protect our way of life and ensure that Montana voices are heard in Washington, D.C.”
American Prairie has 15 days from receiving the decision to file an appeal. 
“American Prairie is reviewing the decision and determining its course of action, and will continue to advocate for a public-lands grazing system that is lawful, predictable, and applied equally,” a press release from the organization said.

With tricorn hats on their heads, the elementary school students attended South Carolina’s inaugural Liberty Day, a hands-on learning experience about the Revolutionary War.
Historical reenactors in more elaborate time-accurate garb dotted the House chamber and wandered the Statehouse lobby, where they explained to the children what life was like when the first shots of the American Revolution were fired in Massachusetts in 1775.

The idea came from the National Society of the Colonial Dames’ state chapter, said Molly Fortune, who leads SC250, a commission dedicated to recognizing the country’s 250th anniversary.
The commission put out applications to schools across the state, and when more applications came back than there was space for students, officials prioritized those with teachers who completed the dames’ 10-week course on Charleston’s colonial-era history, she said.
The goal was to get children out of the classroom and bring history to life for them, Fortune said.
“Kids learn really, really well when it’s hands-on,” Fortune said. “So, when the kids get to shake a rattle, or they get to actually touch the flax and weave with it, it opens a door that is not just history. It’s not just dates.”
One of the commission’s missions is to highlight stories that often go untold, including those of Native Americans, Black soldiers and women during the war.

A representative of the Catawba Nation, the state’s only federally recognized Native American tribe, showed children feathers, rattles and drums tribal members would have used during the Colonial era.
Beaufort-based Gullah Kinfolk Traveling Theater put on a version of Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, a play about the Gullah Geechee experience during the American Revolution. Spinsters from Belle Sisters, who make period-accurate gowns for battle reenactments, demonstrated how to use a spinning wheel to make yarn.
Those stories can help engage children who don’t often see people like themselves in their history books, Fortune said.
“All these kids here today, if you saw it, it was a melting pot,” Fortune said. “Anybody can be a leader. That’s what I want them to take away from this.”
Names and dates were also important Friday. Fourth grade is when students start learning about American history, and those who visited the Statehouse came prepared. During a trivia contest that could have stumped some of the adults in the room, students knew nearly every answer.
Students divided into two teams representing the Continental Army, moving from colonies in the North and South. With each correct answer, the student troops advanced — using Post-It notes on a map — closer to Philadelphia, home of the Second Continental Congress where the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776.
Katherine Saunders Pemberton, SC250’s education and outreach manager, called the questions. A few examples:

What female plantation manager, who turned indigo into a major cash crop for South Carolina, supported the Patriots financially and helped Francis Marion escape the British? (Eliza Lucas Pinckney)
Which American general famously betrayed the Patriots and defected to the British? (Benedict Arnold)
What South Carolina fort built of palmetto logs and sand famously defended Charleston from the British Navy? (Fort Moultrie)

The team representing the southern colonies won.
The students impressed Gov. Henry McMaster, a history buff who talked the children through some of the battles fought in South Carolina.
“That was a great thing,” McMaster said afterward of watching the students answer trivia questions. “We’ll do it next year and do it right on, because our history, we’ve got a great story.”
The goal is to make the event annual, Fortune said. The celebration of the nation’s history doesn’t end with a big bash July 4. Instead, events will continue through 2033, the anniversary of the Treaty of Paris that formally ended the war.
Younger children have a lot to look forward to when they get their own turns at Liberty Day, said three students from Latta Elementary School in Dillon County.
History is already fun, said the three students, but seeing it happen in front of them made it even more so.
“This has been the most exciting field trip I’ve ever had,” said fourth grader Alexander Barnhardt.

(Photo by Jeff Fisher/ACEP)For much of the past half-century, nuclear energy in the United States has occupied an uneasy space between a technology of the past and a technology of the future — but not quite one of the present. That is beginning to change, and Alaska is part of that shift. 
A couple of months ago, Project Janus, an initiative led by the Department of the Army, identified Fort Wainwright as one of nine candidate sites for deploying a new generation of small, advanced nuclear reactors. While the announcement received little public attention in Alaska, the program is significant. Janus is designed not only to support the energy security of military installations, but also to move advanced nuclear from isolated pilot projects toward repeatable, “nth-of-a-kind” deployments, where costs are expected to become more predictable and decline over time relative to first-of-a-kind efforts.
This follows on the heels of a June 2025 announcement that Oklo Inc. was selected to move forward on a planned microreactor deployment at Eielson Air Force Base. Taken together with other demonstrations and commercial proposals now moving through testing and licensing, these projects point to a broader shift: new nuclear is no longer hypothetical — it is beginning to move into real-world deployment.
Why nuclear stalled
Nuclear power in the United States generates roughly 20% of the nation’s electricity — about the same share as all renewable sources combined — yet it is often perceived as static and outdated. While wind, solar and battery storage have seen rapid, highly visible innovation and have dominated conversations about the energy future, nuclear has largely been associated with aging plants, long development timelines and high costs.
From time to time, talk of a nuclear renaissance has resurfaced. But for years, that renaissance seemed perpetually just out of reach — always promised, but not delivered. Large projects such as the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia came to symbolize this tension. Built around conventional, large-scale reactor designs developed decades earlier, Vogtle’s long delays and multibillion-dollar cost overruns ultimately hardened public skepticism about whether nuclear still had a role to play in the nation’s future energy supply.
For many observers, the question became not whether nuclear power could work, but whether it still made sense in an energy landscape increasingly shaped by shorter build times and greater flexibility in how capacity is sized and deployed. Wind, solar and natural gas plants can often be built quickly, with far less up-front capital and can be scaled incrementally. Against that backdrop, large, conventional nuclear projects increasingly appeared obsolete.
Reimagining nuclear
This new generation of nuclear technologies is not trying to solve old problems by building better versions of the same systems. Instead, it represents a fundamental rethinking of how nuclear power is designed, built and used. New designs emphasize smaller-scale, standardized systems that can be factory-assembled and rapidly deployed to a site. This shift reflects an effort to adapt nuclear technology to the practical realities of today’s energy landscape.
A major focus of this new wave of nuclear innovation has been safety. Traditional nuclear plants rely on multiple engineered systems, layers of redundancy and highly trained operators to manage risk. By contrast, many advanced reactor designs place greater emphasis on inherent or passive safety: Both the reactor and its fuel are designed to remain stable under extreme conditions.
These more accident-tolerant approaches are being put into practice. A major milestone occurred a few months ago, when the first fuel shipment designed specifically for these advanced reactors arrived at Idaho National Laboratory. The fuel, known as TRISO, is configured differently from conventional nuclear fuel. In TRISO fuel, uranium is encapsulated within multiple ceramic layers designed to withstand extreme heat and physical stress. As a result, a significant portion of the safety function is built directly into the fuel itself. 
This initial production run will support the first advanced reactors to be tested at Idaho National Laboratory in several decades. Commercial demonstrations are expected to follow, with multiple vendors seeking access to the laboratory’s limited testing infrastructure, including Oklo Inc.
What Alaskans are saying
Surveys conducted by Strategies 360 on behalf of the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at UAF over several years show that Alaskans across a broad spectrum of communities and political views consistently favor greater diversification of the state’s energy systems. Respondents support expanding hydroelectric, solar and wind resources while reducing reliance on gas and coal.
Views on nuclear energy remain more mixed, though they are evolving. In the most recent poll, a slim majority of respondents said they would be open to greater use of nuclear energy in Alaska, while the share of those strongly opposed has dropped below 10 percent. Support increases when respondents are provided with additional information: Those who report greater familiarity with nuclear energy tend to be more supportive overall, and among less familiar respondents, interest rises substantially after hearing a brief, neutral description of advanced nuclear technologies. Taken together, these results suggest that many Alaskans are receptive to learning more and engaging on the issue as new information becomes available.
Taking stock: Where are we now?
While progress is encouraging, we still have a way to go before these technologies are available off the shelf. Even the vendors closest to market remain in design, licensing or early demonstration phases. New nuclear technology is no longer purely theoretical, but it is still far from an established technology.
There are also important unresolved questions: how these systems will perform over time; how they will be financed, owned and operated; how regulatory frameworks will adapt; and how issues such as waste management and emergency planning will be addressed. These questions can only be answered through experience — by moving projects from concept to operation and learning from them along the way. And that’s exactly what’s happening.
One reason this moment feels different is the level of sustained federal involvement and investment — an area of rare continuity in U.S. energy policy. Support for advanced nuclear has continued across both the Biden and Trump administrations, enabling momentum in addressing long-standing barriers that have kept these technologies from moving beyond paper studies and early prototypes.
Alaska is already playing an important role. Through defense-led demonstrations, research activities and early commercial proposals, it is reasonable to expect continued discussion and activity in the coming years. Decisions about how far Alaska ultimately leans into a new nuclear era will rest with Alaskans themselves. In the near term, the state clearly has a seat at the table. The question ahead is not whether nuclear can be developed, but when — and under what conditions — Alaskans will decide whether it belongs as part of the state’s future energy mix.
Where to learn more
In that spirit, on Jan. 27–28, the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska Fairbanks will host a free, online workshop bringing together national experts and Alaskans to explore where nuclear energy actually stands today — technically, regulatory-wise and programmatically. The goal is not to advocate for a particular outcome, but to ensure Alaskans have access to clear, current information as these conversations continue.

Travis denied a motion for a temporary injunction in a suit challenging a Kentucky licensing law. (Getty Images) LEXINGTON — A judge on Friday declined to enjoin enforcement of a state law that governs the licensing of alcohol and drug counselors and peer support specialists.
The decision came as a new state law threatens to put many Kentucky peer support specialists out of work.
Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis
Two applicants for licenses and a Lexington-based nonprofit filed suit contending that it’s impossible for them to comply with the new law because the state Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors has failed to enact any regulations implementing it. They say the board has let other regulations expire, including those governing disciplinary actions and appeals and the code of ethics that license-holders must promise to follow.
The legislature approved and Gov. Andy Beshear signed the new law — contained in House Bill 505 —  in 2024. It took effect Jan. 1 and changes credentialing standards to work and be paid in many treatment and recovery settings. 
During an afternoon hearing, Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis said, “In an ideal world the regulations should have been promulgated long before now. Maybe there’s a reasonable explanation for that. I just don’t know.”
But Travis ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a temporary injunction, including a showing of irreparable harm.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of peer support specialists Wes Hagenbuch and Adrianna Kenley and Grin Grant Inc., a nonprofit that employs and trains peer support workers. 
Kentucky set to pull funding from peer support for recovery, is asked to reconsider

The defendants are the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors; the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and its secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, and the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities.
A state lawyer representing the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors argued that enjoining enforcement of the board’s statutory framework would preclude the board from issuing any licenses or enacting regulations, thereby delaying the relief the plaintiffs seek.
The lawsuit, which asks the judge to declare the law void, will now proceed on its merits. Travis gave the state agencies until Jan. 30 to file pleadings responding to the suit’s allegations.
Peer support is considered an essential ingredient in recovery. Peer support specialists, who earn $15-$18 an hour in Kentucky, share their first-hand experiences of addiction and hope with those new to recovery. Their duties range from providing transportation to medical appointments and court dates to teaching problem-solving skills.
As of Friday the board had licensed 78 individuals as registered alcohol and drug peer support specialists compared with 16,883 who are certified under the previous standards.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 18:57:57.277827

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Three Washington state senators said the biting testimony Pierce County’s sheriff delivered during a committee hearing Thursday was threatening to legislators.
Sheriff Keith Swank delivered the remarks to the Senate Law and Justice Committee, stating his opposition to legislation that would set stricter eligibility requirements for people to serve as sheriffs and in other law enforcement leadership jobs. In his roughly 90 seconds of comments, Swank also remarked on a bill that would restrict officers from wearing masks.
“My deputies don’t wear masks, but once you pass this law that they can’t, I would not only allow them, but I would encourage them to do so just to see what you do,” he said.
“I don’t recognize your authority to impose these controls over me and when you try to remove me from office, thousands of Pierce County residents will surround the County-City Building in downtown Tacoma and will not allow that to happen,” he continued. “I hope it doesn’t come to that, but I, and they, are prepared. Are you prepared?”
The sponsor of the bill on eligibility standards for law enforcement officials, Sen. John Lovick, D-Mill Creek, served as a state trooper and Snohomish County sheriff.

He saw Swank’s comments asking if lawmakers were “prepared” as “very, very threatening.” He compared Swank’s intimidating behavior to Eugene “Bull” Connor, the 20th-century Alabama police leader who opposed civil rights for Black people and was known for ordering the use of fire hoses and police dogs on demonstrators. 
“He just doesn’t represent what law enforcement is supposed to represent,” Lovick said. 
As a sheriff, Lovick said he wanted to set the example for his rank-and-file deputies. 
“I want them to display the same characteristics I have,” Lovick said. “If I go and talk to legislators like that, they might feel compelled to speak to the public that way.”
Law and Justice Committee Chair Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, said she has a thick skin after being a prosecutor for 20 years. 
“I recognized threats in his speech, but I do not get intimidated by bullies,” she said Friday.
The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs condemned Swank’s comments as “inflammatory” and said it plans to initiate proceedings to consider expelling him from the organization.
“The scope of his testimony went beyond reasonable dialogue and devolved into what could be perceived as threatening to legislators and he challenged their constitutional authority,” association leadership said in a statement. “The manner in which he conducted himself was not in line with the professional behavior we expect of members.”
The association noted it also has “grave concerns” with the legislation.
Dhingra appreciates the association’s move to potentially expel Swank, but it is “something that should’ve been handled a long time ago,” citing Swank’s history of controversial behavior in office. 
Just this month, Swank clashed with Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders in the aftermath of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shooting a woman in her car in Minnesota. 
“PSA: if law enforcement tells you to stop. STOP,” Swank wrote on social media. “You can always sue later if your rights were violated. Even if you are right, do you want to be dead right?”
Sanders believed Swank was mocking the woman’s death, leading to a tense back-and-forth. Swank has also faced backlash for disparaging transgender people and defending those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
A spokesperson for the association of sheriffs and police chiefs declined to comment on whether Swank’s prior controversies played a role in its decision to begin expulsion proceedings.
Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, who serves as vice chair of the Law and Justice Committee, said she felt more directly threatened by Swank’s comments Thursday as she lives in Pierce County. The Tacoma Democrat argued it showed how “off the rails he actually is.”
“I think he’s an embarrassment to the profession,” she said.
There isn’t a timeline for a decision on Swank’s future with the Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, spokesperson Barbara Smith said. 
Eight members of the organization’s 14-member board would be needed to remove Swank from the organization, which wouldn’t affect his position as the elected county sheriff. The influential group advocates on behalf of law enforcement leaders and administers some state-funded programs.
Swank worked for the Seattle Police Department for 33 years before retiring in 2023. He won a tight election to become Pierce County sheriff in November 2024. Pierce County, home to Tacoma, has about 940,000 residents.
Swank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a social media post, he included the testimony he would’ve given if he had more time. In it, he called Democratic lawmakers “evil” and compared them to President Donald Trump. 
“You Democrats hate President Trump so much, yet you do the very things you accuse him of doing such as imposing these types of controls over other independently elected officials,” Swank wrote. 
Swank also wrote that his potential expulsion from the sheriffs and police chiefs association “is what happens when you don’t tow the party line.”
Lovick’s bill would require elected sheriffs to meet the same, new heightened eligibility standards as appointed police chiefs and marshals and would force them to undergo a background check. It also limits the use of volunteers amid concerns of so-called “posses” that rural sheriffs sometimes build. It is set for a vote from the Law and Justice Committee next week.
Swank is the subject of three Criminal Justice Training Commission cases related to his certification as a law enforcement officer, but none appear to have been assigned to an investigator, according to the commission. Under the bill, if he were decertified, he would have to vacate his role as sheriff.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen.-Manka-Dhingra-State-of-the-State-2026-1-e1768603676110.png,,,2026-01-16 18:57:57.277827

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The American Farm Bureau Federation, along with soybean and specialty crop farm organizations, has asked congressional leadership for economic support to “fill in the gap of remaining losses for both field and specialty crop farmers.” 
The letter follows a December announcement from the Trump administration of a $12 billion one-time package to offset farmer losses across the country.
“These funds could provide a meaningful first step but do not cover the extensive and cumulative losses that farmers have absorbed over the last several years,” the letter said after acknowledging the farmer bridge payment program.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is allocating the funding with commodity specific payment rates and set aside $1 billion of the $12 billion for specialty crop farmers. 
The American Soybean Association, a signee on the recently submitted letter, said in a news release the $30.88 per acre allotted for soybeans from the payment package was not enough to cover the “significant financial damage soybean farmers sustained this year due to the high cost of production and losses sustained during the China trade war.” 
Grant Kimberley, Iowa Soybean Association’s director of market development, said the additional need from farmers is “complicated” and is a result of more than just one event in the past year. 
“I think people don’t really realize this has been going on for a couple years now,” Kimberley said. “… Just about every row crop agriculture sector in the whole country has been losing money, probably, for the last three years.”
Kimberley said the ongoing downturn in the industry is due to several factors, including low commodity prices, high input costs, changes in global trade and uncertainty in domestic markets. 
Data from Farm Bureau show that commodity prices for major row crops like corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat have declined each year since 2022. 
Kimberley said as the prices that farmers can get for their crops has declined, expenses have not declined, and have instead increased.  Land, rent, equipment and inputs like fertilizer, seed and chemicals continue to squeeze farmers’ bottom lines, he said.
Farm Bureau economists found that farm expenses in 2025 were 12% higher than the previous five-year average cost. 
Another piece to the puzzle, Kimberley explained, is the growing soybean and row crop markets in Brazil and other South American countries. He said the expansion of these markets has interrupted U.S. demand, especially with big buyers like China. 
China also declined to purchase U.S. soybeans for the beginning part of harvest season due to President Donald Trump’s trade policies. While the country later agreed to a trade deal, Kimberley said it’s less than what the country previously bought from the U.S. and the gap in purchasing this year has also had an effect. 
Kimberley also pointed to the lack of finalized guidance from federal agencies on renewable fuel standards and tax credits. Many of these initiatives, like 45Z tax credits for low-carbon fuel, were initiated during the Biden administration and still do not have finalized guidelines.
Other standards, like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s blending standards, were proposed over the summer and have yet to be finalized. Kimberley, who is also executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said this uncertainty means overall biodiesel production has declined in the state, causing a “ripple in the pond” for soybean demand.
“You can’t really just say it’s this or that, you know, it’s all of these things that have kind of added up a little bit over time,” Kimberley said.
The letter from American Farm Bureau Federation also noted the compounding factors squeezing farmers. According to the letter, farmer bankruptcies are increasing and nationwide farmer losses are approaching $100 billion. 
“These trends aren’t just statistics; they represent an economic crisis in rural America,” the letter said. 
Specialty crop farmers are also struggling under similar pressures and asked Congress for relief. 
The majority of the more than 50 organizations that signed the letter represented specialty crop growers. 
In a news release about the letter, the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance said that despite the fact that specialty crops account for more than one-third of all U.S. crop sales, the farmer bridge program from USDA allocated just $1 billion to the industry. 
“Any agricultural aid package should reflect the economic contribution of specialty crops, which support rural communities and provide key nutrition,” the alliance leadership said in the release. 
The letter, addressed to House and Senate leadership, ask for “immediate” congressionally approved support. 
Kimberley said additional changes need to occur in the farm economy for farmers to be profitable, but those changes won’t happen overnight.
“None of these things make farmers whole, and (aid packages) are not preferred, but sometimes they’re necessary,” Kimberley said.

(Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)The North Dakota Attorney General’s Office on Friday ordered a Fargo nonprofit to stop promoting certain abortion pill providers on its website.
The order accuses the Prairie Abortion Fund of violating a state consumer protection law by including links on its website to sites where counterfeit pills may be purchased without a prescription or the oversight or a doctor.
Caitlin Wachsmuth, co-chair of Prairie Abortion Fund’s board, said Friday afternoon the organization was holding off on speaking publicly about the cease-and-desist order until it could seek input from legal counsel.
Abortion is almost entirely illegal in North Dakota. There is no abortion clinic operating in the state.
The mission of Prairie Abortion Fund, which dates back to 1999, is to help women access abortions in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. This includes providing financial assistance with the cost of abortion-related medical care, transportation and birth control, among other expenses, its website states.
In the order, the Attorney General’s Office says the Bureau of Criminal Investigation was able to successfully purchase abortion pills without a prescription from two businesses listed on Prairie Action Fund’s webpage.
The agency says these pills “are not FDA approved” and contain ingredients that must be prescribed by a doctor.
By facilitating access to the pills, Prairie Abortion Fund lends credibility to “counterfeit, unapproved, untested, misbranded or misrepresented products,” the Attorney General’s Office argues in the order.
The order states that the Attorney General’s Crime Laboratory Division conducted some tests on the pills purchased through retailers found through the nonprofit’s website.
The test found “at least some of the tablets contained the represented content mifepristone,” and no controlled substances were detected in the pills.
The laboratory could not test whether the dosage strengths of the pills were the same as advertised by the retailers, according to the order.
The agency notes the North Dakota’s Abortion Control Act requires doctors to be physically present any time the abortion medications mifepristone and misoprostol are administered to a patient.
The order also claims the nonprofit is breaking federal and state laws that prohibit the sale of misbranded drugs.
Prairie Abortion Fund’s website says that it is “intended for informational purposes only” and “does not provide medical or legal advice.”
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

“Prairie Abortion Fund is making efforts to comply with applicable law and regulations to the best of its understanding and ability,” the website states.
If Prairie Abortion Fund wishes to challenge the cease-and-desist order, it has 10 days to request an administrative hearing with the attorney general, according to state law.
Violating the order could result in fines of $1,000 per violation. Additionally, North Dakota’s Consumer Fraud Law carries penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.
According to Prairie Action Fund’s website, the nonprofit has served more than 600 callers. Its work has included distributing more than 1,000 Plan B contraception pills, providing at least $104,000 to patients seeking abortion care and $172,000 in birth control assistance. 
Abortion is illegal in North Dakota except in cases of rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy would be considered a serious physical health threat under “reasonable medical judgment.”
The law was upheld late last year after the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled 3-2 that the ban is unconstitutional. A supermajority vote of four of five justices is required to strike down a law.

Jan. 14, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors is officially suing to stop the University of Nebraska Board of Regents from securing sole ownership of the nonprofit using an $800 million deal with Clarkson Regional Health Services.
Nebraska Medicine filed the lawsuit Friday, less than 24 hours after the regents voted unanimously to proceed with the $800 million deal. Regents and NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold had described it as similar to divorce proceedings or selling a house, with sole ownership expected to be transferred by June 30.
Both NU and Clarkson have maintained a 50-50 split of the hospital, clinical and medical nonprofit since 1997.
The transaction, plus a promised donation from Clarkson to NU, is as follows:

$500 million for NU to buy out Clarkson’s 50% share of Nebraska Medicine.
$300 million for NU to purchase related Clarkson-area properties.
$200 million that Clarkson pledges to donate to NU for “Project Health” in Omaha, a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.

NU regents unanimously approve $800M Clarkson deal for Nebraska Medicine

In a brief statement Friday, Nebraska Medicine wrote: “This is a necessary but unfortunate step to take, but it is aligned with our commitment to protect the mission of Nebraska Medicine. Out of respect for the judicial process, we will let our complaint explain our serious concerns and requests, and we will not provide further comment.”
An NU spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Gold and NU regents have argued they are following their legal interpretation of the joint agreement, including advice they said came from the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. NU leaders also said they acted quickly, in part, to prevent Clarkson from seeking to sell its share to an out-of-state or for profit entity.
The lawsuit, filed in Douglas County District Court, asks the court to decide whether the regents and Clarkson can “unilaterally” enter into transactions that Nebraska Medicine leaders argue violate a joint agreement between NU and Clarkson and Nebraska Medicine’s governing documents.
Nebraska Medicine leaders have argued Clarkson can withdraw from its ownership stake only if the Nebraska Medicine board and NU sign off.
“Plaintiffs believe this answer is clearly no, and thus, file this lawsuit to stop an imminent, harmful and, in part, unlawful, set of transactions,” the lawsuit reads in part.
Nebraska Medicine leaders had argued the deal was unlawful ever since NU and Clarkson publicly announced the idea Jan. 2 after a year and a half of closed-door negotiations that both entities said were subject to “strict” nondisclosure agreements.
This is a developing story.

Democrat Hannah Pingree and Republican Jonathan Bush have each raised more than $1.3 million, and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, has also received more than a million in contributions. But while the Democratic candidates’ contributions are in part from many Mainers chipping in small amounts, most of Bush’s donors contributed the legal maximum: $2,075.
That’s according to a Maine Morning Star analysis of the latest campaign finance reports published on the Maine Ethics Commission website, detailing fundraising from the second half of 2025.
Former Maine House of Representatives Speaker Pingree has consistently led the race in fundraising since she launched her campaign in June, amassing more than $1.4 million, according to the January 15 report. Her campaign said donations came in from all 16 counties and nearly 300 Maine towns, “reflecting the campaign’s statewide reach and growing support as Hannah continues to meet with workers, families, small business owners, and community leaders across Maine.”
According to Maine Ethics Commission data, Pingree’s campaign reported contributions from more than 1,800 unique donors, including several state representatives and officials, including Attorney General Aaron Frey. That aligns with the endorsements she’s received from more than 100 former and current state leaders. She raised more than $58,000 in small contributions of $50 or less. Pingree also received two donations for the maximum amount from her mother, U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree, as well as contributions from Gov. Janet Mills’ siblings, Dora Mills and Peter Mills.  
Bush, a health care entrepreneur, entered the campaign months after Pingree and Bellows in October, but has assembled the second largest war chest.A significant part of that is the $300,000 loan he gave himself, but Bush’s fundraising stands out for the large number of out-of-state contributions. He also received a high number of contributions for the legal maximum, including a donation from his cousin, former President George W. Bush. Overall, Bush raised close to a million from fewer than 700 unique contributors.
Bush is currently leading the Republican gubernatorial candidates in fundraising, with attorney and Leeds resident Bobby Charles in second place with more than $500,000 raised. Bush’s campaign manager Eamonn Dundon highlighted his fundraising as proof that he can beat Democrats in the general election.
“The rest of the candidates in the Republican field are nice guys with some good ideas, but they’ve shown now that they can’t compete with Democrats’ massive money machine that will be trained at whoever our nominee is in June,” Dundon said in a press release. 
With just over a million dollars in the bank, Bellows’ — who was first to announce her run last March — leads in the most small dollar contributions: more than $146,000 in amounts of $50 or less.
“The Maine Ethics Commission’s end of year reports show what Mainers have already known: Shenna Bellows is the leading candidate for Maine Governor,” her campaign said in a press release.
Democrats Angus King III, a businessman, and former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson follow, with $900,000 and $600,000 raised, respectively. And although former head of Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Nirav Shah only entered the race in October, he has already raised more than $500,000, as has independent Sen. Rick Bennett. Republicans David Jones and Owen McCarthy have raised $400,000 and $300,000 each, although both gave their own campaigns big loans.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/MInnesota Reformer)Two videos add new details to what happened before and after an immigration agent shot a man in the leg in the Hawthorne neighborhood in north Minneapolis Wednesday night.
One video, a livestream of a 911 call from inside the house, includes a woman saying that the immigration agent shot the man, who she said is her husband, as he was entering the house. The livestream also shows at least one child present in the house.
Another video, taken by a north Minneapolis resident from across the street and shared with the Reformer, shows federal agents firing numerous times into the house, breaking a second-floor window.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Reformer on Friday that the agents had fired tear gas, not live rounds.
The incident began on Interstate 94, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man, federal law enforcement and Minneapolis police said. The man drove toward a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car outside the house and ran towards the house, federal and local law enforcement said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that the man who was shot is Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, and that he “began to resist and violently assault the officer.”
“While Sosa-Celis and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” the official federal statement said. The statement goes on to say that Sosa-Celis then began striking an officer with a shovel or broom stick.

According to the DHS statement, the officer, fearing for his life and safety, then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” after which the three men ran into the house.
Federal immigration agents arrested all three men, the statement said, and Sosa-Celis and the officer who shot him were at the hospital when the statement was published.
The Washington Post interviewed Sosa-Celis’s mother, Alicia Celis, who said her son told her that the man who was pursued by federal agents was actually Sosa-Celis’s friend, one of the three men arrested.
Facebook livestream of 911 call and observer video
According to Celis, Sosa-Celis opened the door to let his friend inside, and as Sosa-Celis went to close the door, an ICE officer shot him in the leg, reported the Post.
A Facebook livestream video, which appears to show the moments after the man was shot from the perspective of his wife and other people inside the house, partly lines up with Sosa-Celis’s account. The video was published by an account by the name of Lachamaka Mendoza and is timestamped to Wednesday 6:51 p.m., the exact time Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said local police started receiving 911 calls about the shooting.
The Reformer has requested records of the 911 calls made after the shooting to further verify the video.
In the video, at least five people, including one small child, are in a house while law enforcement lights flash outside. They speak on the phone in Spanish to what sounds like a 911 operator, saying that someone has been shot in the leg by “guys from ICE.”
“Please help, we have kids,” one person said.
A woman then tells the operator: “It was ICE, they were chasing my husband for like half an hour and they were trying to crash into him. He got to the house and as we were closing the door they shot him.”
Another woman adds: “Tell them that they shot the door.” It is not clear from the video whether she meant that the agents shot through the doorway or at a door.
The 911 call suggests that the agent shot at the man as he was trying to escape into the house, which would contradict the Department of Homeland Security account that the federal immigration agent fired a shot defensively.

A separate video taken by a north Minneapolis resident starts around 7:26 p.m. and shows the vantage from across 24th Avenue North.
In that video, over a dozen agents surround the house. At minute 2:55 in the video, the agents fire what DHS said was tear gas into the house, shattering the second floor window; at least three more shots are heard later.
At around 5 minutes into the video, federal agents enter the house. One observer yells that there are children in the house. Around 16 minutes into the video, a woman who appears to be wearing a pink shirt exits the house — the Facebook livestream video also included a woman with a pink shirt.
“This is something I would have never expected to see in my life,” said the man who took the video and was granted anonymity by the Reformer. “It’s still hard for me to believe that this is actually happening in my city, so close to my home.”
The BCA’s independent investigation
The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene Wednesday night along with FBI agents to process evidence.
Also present at the scene were Minnesota State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies, which O’Hara said were there to help control the crowd of over 100 protestors and observers who had gathered, as well as Federal Bureau of Prisons officers.
The BCA said in an X post Wednesday night that it is investigating the shooting in an independent investigation.
The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, the Trump administration said she was attempting to run over the ICE officer and kill him. But bystander footage shows a chaotic scene with the officer to the side of her car when he shoots her as she seemingly tries to flee.
All three men are from Venezuela and came to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023, according to the DHS statement. The statement describes two of the men as criminals, though the only listed offenses for Sosa-Celis are driving without a license and giving a false name to a law enforcement officer.
Minnesota court records show that a 24-year-old Julio Cesar Sosa Celis has been fined for speeding and driving without a license or proof of insurance.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Leaders of the New Mexico House of Representatives gathered Friday at a South Valley health care clinic to tout their agenda for the upcoming session, one they said will make life better and more affordable without overspending amid a possible economic downturn.
The Democrats gave general outlines for how they intend to use legislation and the budget process to increase health care access, protect immigrants and improve public safety all within 30 days. House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) predicted the Legislature’s achievements will offer a stark contrast to the “dysfunction” in Washington, D.C. 
“We will have to make hard choices as we build the state budget, because, unlike the federal government, we have to have a balanced budget every single day,” he said. “So we’ll have to make sure that we put families first and not balance those budgets on their backs, which I can assure you, we will not.”

In addition to passing a roughly $11 billion operating budget, the Legislature will consider legislation regarding medical malpractice and other health care reforms, a ban on local government involvement in immigrant detention, public safety and road repairs.
According to the speakers and a news release the House released Friday afternoon, House Democrats are hoping to attract and retain more doctors; hold gun dealers accountable for straw purchases; protect license plate data from being shared with the federal government; and create an independent commission overseeing the Children, Youth and Families Department, among other proposals. 
“We may not know all that the future holds, but we’re ready to protect our people, regardless of the immigration status, the color of their skin or the languages they speak,” said Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque). “Because all New Mexicans deserve to feel safe in their communities.”
Advocacy groups push to expand immigrant services, driver protections during session

Much of the news conference focused on the Democrats’ plans for health care amid a statewide doctor shortage that has prompted sharp criticism from Republicans and advocacy groups. 
Martinez and Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) described a medical malpractice reform bill that aims to reduce the number of malpractice lawsuits as well as protect doctors from losing their practices if they get sued. 
The bill has not yet been introduced. Rep. Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source New Mexico after the news conference that House lawmakers are still working with the governor’s office on the reforms, which she expects to be wrapped into one piece of legislation. 
Republicans and Senate Democrats are expected to introduce their own legislation on the topic, as well, including measures that will cap the amount of damages that can be paid or raise the standard at which a jury can find health care workers liable for injuries. 
Szczepanski said the bill aims to “make targeted changes to the medical malpractice laws to change the climate that our doctors are practicing in.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7254-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Condos make up nearly half of the 1,039 short-term rental properties in Stowe, over two-thirds of which are located within the town's six resort complexes.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Jan. 15, 2026.
As the Stowe Selectboard continues to consider a cap on the number of short-term rentals, the town’s major resorts are arguing that they should be exempted from further regulation.
Consideration of a short-term rental cap began last fall, when the planning commission sent a letter to the selectboard recommending such a regulation, but with the exemption of short-term rentals in zoning districts dedicated to the preservation of land owned by resorts like Spruce Peak, Topnotch Resort and von Trapp Family Lodge — properties the planning commission noted were never meant to house year-round Stowe residents.
In a September letter to town manager Charles Safford and shared with the selectboard from assistant manager Will Fricke, condominiums were identified as the predominant housing structure of short-term rentals in Stowe, making up nearly half of the 1,039 rentals that have signed up for the short-term rental registry that went live last May.
Over two-thirds of those condos are located within the six resort complexes: Spruce Peak, Topnotch Resort, Mountainside Resort, Stonybrook, Village Green and Notchbrook, according to Fricke.
Overall, Fricke said, properties in zoning areas designated for skiing and resort operations, which include von Trapp Family Lodge, Spruce Peak and Topnotch, account for 360 short-term rental registrations, which is about one third of total registrations and approximately 60% of units in those zoning areas.
Sam Gaines, president of the Mount Mansfield Company, which manages Spruce Peak, has advocated that short-term rentals at the resort should have been exempted from registry entirely, and they certainly shouldn’t be included in a cap, and if the town wants to install a short-term rental cap, they have little choice but to ensure areas like Spruce Peak are exempt.
“What most people think of when they think of a short-term rental, it’s something that is taking place in a residence, a residential dwelling unit, as opposed to something that’s taking place in a lodging unit, which most people would just consider to be a hotel stay,” Gaines said. “While I’m appreciative of the carve out, I’m not sure that the selectboard has another option.”
AWH Partners, the hospitality group that owns Topnotch Resort, was also eager to ensure its properties were left out. In a letter sent to the selectboard last November, the group wanted to make sure they were exempted alongside timeshares and skiing adjacent complexes like Spruce Peak.
Topnotch is in the midst of constructing new buildings that include 31 new condos, which “are intended to be included in the resort’s hotel inventory when not in use by their owners,” the partnership’s general counsel, Nicholas Mayer, wrote.
“The nature and use of these units has been central to Topnotch Resort’s business plan from the beginning,” Mayer wrote. “Should the Selectboard’s proposed ordinance, as we understand it, not exempt Topnotch Resort from STR limitations, the expansion project will become immediately irretrievably infeasible.”
To avoid this “catastrophe,” Mayer called on the board to exempt them as well.
Selectboard chair Paco Aumand emphasized that discussions of any short-term rental cap are only in the draft stage and still ongoing, but the board is actively looking at determining “which housing units might not develop into long-term housing units if they were further included in an (short-term rental) cap regulation.”
The board will further discuss this potential regulation at a public hearing to be held on Feb. 11 at the Akeley Memorial Building in Stowe.

Splitting rentals
Over half of all condo short-term rentals in Stowe are located at Spruce Peak alone, according to Fricke, and two-thirds of those condos are located at The Lodge at Spruce Peak.
When a visitor to Stowe books a room at The Lodge, the process may not be much different than renting a traditional hotel room. But what they’re really renting is technically a short-term rental.
These rooms aren’t regulated like a short-term rental in a single-family home by the state of Vermont. While stand-alone short rentals have to pay a 3% surcharge tax on their bookings, the Vermont Department of Taxes views rentals within a complex like The Lodge differently, exempting them from the surcharge tax because they’re regulated under the Vermont Department of Health like a traditional hotel.
Fewer than 20% of the condominiums or single-family homes within the Spruce Peak complex but outside of The Lodge are registered as short-term rentals with the town, according to Fricke, and Spruce Peak is far from the only resort or hotel maintaining short-term rentals like traditional hotel rooms, but it is a prime example of the spectrum of short-term rentals operating in nuanced ways in Stowe, both within and adjacent to resort complexes and hotels.
While it’s relatively easy to excise the resorts in zoning areas identified specifically for resort and ski-lodging stays from further regulation, the number of condos being let as short-term rentals while their owners are often elsewhere offers a tougher challenge.
According to Fricke, of the 930 short-term rentals registered without a homestead declaration — meaning the property is maintained as a rental or second home — about 600 are not in either of those zoning areas and are not timeshares.
Condo associations outside of resorts have begun clamoring for their own exemptions. Among the slew of letters protesting any further regulation of short-term rentals from property managers whose livelihood depends on the growth of that market in Stowe, these associations have also written to make their objections heard.
Of the 55 condominium complexes in Stowe, 37 have at least one short-term registered with the town, according to Fricke’s analysis.
A handful of letters sent by owners at the Mountainside Resort, a condo association off Cottage Club Road, make the case that those properties, too, were never intended for year-round residence, were always meant to be rented out while their primary owners were away, would impact the value of real estate throughout the town if not exempted and function similarly to properties being considered for exemption at places like Spruce Peak and Topnotch.
Mark Vandenberg — who is on the board of trustees at Mountainside and owns Sun and Ski Inn, where he operates both traditional hotel rooms and some short-term rentals — reiterated that Mountainside was “never intended for full-time occupancy,” and has operated as a “vacation resort, with a strong emphasis on timeshare until very recently.”
“Furthermore, I’d like to point out that many of our out-of-state owners have owned here for decades — some over 40 years — and paid plenty of property taxes during that period. Is it fair for them to see their unit values crumble as a result of this proposal?” he said.
Charles Stevenson, president of an association representing 32 condo owners adjacent to Stoweflake Resort, also submitted a memo to the selectboard lobbying for exemption from any potential short-term rental cap.
The selectboard still has tools to regulate short-term rentals that have yet to be discussed. An entirely new zoning overlay district could be created to accommodate condo owners concerned about being locked in to simply owning property that could no longer generate income. The question of how a short-term rental designation under a cap regulation could be maintained or transferred in the event of property sale or inheritance is another thorny, open question the selectboard will have to address.
If the selectboard does decide to draw a line on what properties can be rented in the short term, as part of a multi-pronged regulatory effort to make housing in Stowe more accessible to the workers who make Stowe’s hospitality economy run, it’s unlikely that all parties will be pleased.
“I think there’s all types of gray areas, and that’s going to be part of the hard work that the selectboard and planning commission have to do,” Gaines said. “Where do you establish some boundaries that are appropriate, keeping in mind what you’re trying to accomplish.”

(Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)Washington and Oregon will not have to build a drawbridge as part of the project to replace the aging Interstate 5 bridges across the Columbia River, the U.S. Coast Guard decided on Friday.
Instead, the states can go with a less expensive fixed span that provides 116 feet of clearance for vessel traffic on the river below. The savings from this design will be welcome news for the states, which are confronting rising cost estimates for the multibillion-dollar project before construction is even underway.
Coast Guard officials informed elected leaders and transportation officials in the two states Friday. A written decision was expected to follow.
The approval “will eliminate the only stoplight on Interstate 5, put an end to commute interruptions, and save millions in construction costs,” said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington.
“The vast majority of the maritime community agrees that the new bridge design will not only allow river commerce to continue but also improve safe passage down the river,” added Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees the Coast Guard. 
Cantwell had pressed Admiral Kevin E. Lunday, Commandant of the Coast Guard, for a decision by Jan. 16.
Washington state Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said he was “really excited to see that the Coast Guard listened to the communities. We’re one step closer to getting this bridge replaced.” 
Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, said this is “a really critical decision point” that allows planners to drill down on what the bridge might look like and the costs.
The existing bridge is in danger of collapse in a major earthquake, and one of its spans is over a century old. Supporters of the project predict fewer crashes, faster commutes and more transit options when the new bridge is done.
A fixed span has always been the official first choice of Washington and Oregon. Project planners argue a movable span would perpetuate the same issues travelers experience with the existing bridge, including delays, freight bottlenecks and crash risks.
While Friday’s announcement answers one major question, others, such as what the bridge will cost, when construction will begin and when traffic will finally drive on it, remain unknown.
Program managers are looking to get federal government sign-off on environmental review and a record of decision so contracts can be negotiated this year. Once rolling, construction is expected to last until at least 2032.
For the past couple years, project planners have said the price tag for replacing the bridge ranges from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with the likely figure of around $6 billion. And they’ve said constructing a movable span would be $500 million more than a fixed-span.
In September, legislators said they anticipate the total could reach $10 billion because costs have escalated 30% on transportation projects in the Seattle and Portland regions in recent years. 
Project planners have been recalculating the estimate for months. The work involves examining “100 risk factors,” including inflation and tariffs, staff have said.
Joe Cortright, a Portland economist and project critic, said earlier this month that the revised expense could range between $12.2 billion and $17.7 billion based on public records he obtained and shared with reporters. 
Funding is coming from several sources. Each state has committed about $1 billion. Tolls — which will be imposed in both directions on the existing bridge starting in 2027 and managed by Washington — are relied on for a minimum of $1.2 billion. Oregon has a moratorium on any tolls other than the bridge.
Federal grants totaling $2.1 billion were awarded last year under the Biden administration. Planners are pursuing $1 billion from the Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment Program. This would help pay for a 1.9-mile extension of light-rail from North Portland to a future station near Evergreen Boulevard in Vancouver, Washington. A decision on that funding isn’t expected until the project is further along.
The question of cost should become clearer in the coming weeks, Liias said.
“We know it will be more than the resources we have,” he said Friday. “We will have to figure out how we phase it.” 
He has previously said work may need to be delayed on some of the nearly 30 separate items — from new bus shelters to off-ramp improvements — in this endeavor.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/i5-bridge-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island and Providence education officials say a loan forgiveness program for educators of color is “no longer in effect,” according to documents both organizations filed Friday in response to a U.S. Department of Justice complaint.
Both defendants want the feds’ complaint dismissed and are demanding a trial by jury.
The case began in September 2025 and identified the Educators of Color Loan Forgiveness Program offered by the Providence Public School District (PPSD) as an example of racial discrimination because, in the suit’s words, it “exclud[ed] white teachers” and afforded benefits on the basis of race.
DOJ sues Providence schools over teacher loan forgiveness program it says excluded white hires

With up to $3.175 million in funding pledged by the Rhode Island Foundation, the program started in 2021 and offered up to $25,000 in student debt relief for new district hires who identified as Asian, Black, Indigenous, Latino, biracial, or multiracial. Applicants would need at least $5,000 in debt to participate.
Now, in separate and mostly similar responses to the DOJ complaint, both defendants say the program is defunct, with the phrase “no longer in effect” repeated a total of more than 30 times across both documents.
“The Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to show that it is entitled to recover any damages from RIDE,” the education department’s response reads. “The Plaintiff’s allegations are moot in whole or in part.” 
It’s still unclear exactly when the program ended. When the lawsuit was filed last September, the DOJ alleged that the program “continues to operate on behalf of applicants accepted.” References to the program had been removed from the district’s website in certain places, although publicly cached copies can still be accessed. 
The program lasted until at least the 2024-2025 academic year, according to PPSD’s response Friday. 
The original federal complaint says that “PPSD accepted applications for the Program for at least four school years: School Year 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025.”
The Providence school district admitted to “the truth of the allegations” in its response. RIDE maintained it was “without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations” in its own response.
The Justice Department argues the loan forgiveness program violated Title VII by compensating employees differently because of their race. In their formal responses, RIDE and PPSD argue that they acted in good faith.
“RIDE acted reasonably and in good faith and has not violated any established right under the Constitution or laws of the United States or any political subdivision or any act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights,” the response reads.
The two parties diverge a bit, however, when responding paragraph-by-paragraph to the latter portions of the DOJ’s argument, which detail the mechanics of the loan forgiveness process at the Providence school department.
Providence school officials confirm most of the feds’ timeline and schematics for how the program worked, while the education department — which has controlled the Providence school district since 2019 — repeatedly says it lacks the necessary knowledge to confirm the truth of these allegations.
Both defendants confirmed they were investigated by the DOJ prior to the complaint’s filing.
Providence officials said in September that they were taken aback by the complaint, as they had cooperated with the investigation earlier in 2025. At that time, neither RIDE nor the school district had been formally served.
According to the case docket, the state and city school department were not formally served, and therefore compelled to respond, until early December. 
The defendants had a deadline to respond by Dec. 29, but RIDE and PPSD asked for an extension to file their responses, moving the deadline to Jan. 16. RIDE and PPSD filed their responses Friday.
RIDE and PPSD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
The case, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is assigned to U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan. No hearing date has been set yet.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The State Investment Board on Friday approved about $1.3 million in performance bonuses to 12 Retirement and Investment Office staff members.
Two state lawmakers had called on the board to delay the vote, citing unanswered questions about whether the bonuses comply with state law.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the State Investment Board, on Friday urged the bonuses to move forward, noting an assistant attorney general and legal staff within his office said the payments are legal.
Armstrong said that while he has problems with the structure of the bonus pay program, he doesn’t want to abruptly take back money that was promised to the agency.
“In North Dakota, when we make a deal, we honor it,” he said.
The program, established in 2024, is intended to reward Retirement and Investment Office staff when its internally managed funds outperform the market.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, and Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, in letters to the board this week, said the bonuses were based on the performance of funds mostly managed by outside firms on the Retirement and Investment Office’s behalf. They said this appeared to conflict with the statute’s mandate for the additional pay to only be granted if money directly invested by the state agency surpasses revenue benchmarks.
The law doesn’t specify what qualifies as internally managed funding. Armstrong said that while the language of the statute is “opaque,” testimony on the proposal from the 2023 Legislature indicates that the bill’s authors never intended for the program to award bonuses exclusively based on funds managed by Retirement and Investment Office staff. 
The bonuses were approved almost unanimously. Board member Adam Miller was the only no vote.
Seven of the 12 bonuses exceed $100,000 and the largest is $293,000. 
Lawmakers urge investment board to delay action on bonuses, citing lingering questions

The Retirement and Investment Office still has a hand in overseeing money managed by third-party firms, executive director Jodi Smith said during the meeting.
The incentive pay is awarded if the state’s top four funds outperform the market. Those four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
Those funds surpassed benchmarks by $191 million between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025.
State data indicates only a fraction of the four funds was invested by in-house employees during the period of time the bonuses cover, Cleary wrote in his letter.
Smith said during the meeting that even if the agency were to follow Cleary and Ostlie’s narrow interpretation of the statute, the Retirement and Investment Office’s investments still did well enough to merit the bonuses.
“It doesn’t matter how you do the math,” she said. “Our team succeeded.”
Cleary and Ostlie have also raised concerns that the board lacks continuing authority to appropriate the bonus money. The lawmakers have asked for an attorney general’s opinion on the matter.
Armstrong said that the executive branch has already had internal discussions about changing the bonus pay program in the future.
He said that even though one of the goals of the program was to attract and retain Retirement and Investment Office staff, it hasn’t been effective in reducing turnover.
“Since December of 2024 this agency, had turnover in 11 of 32 positions,” he said. “We have to address base pay to be more competitive with other public funds across the country.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) North Carolina will have $213 million in federal funds to spend this year to improve rural health care, and will be eligible for more money each year over the next four years. 
The money for the new “rural health transformation program” is coming from $50 billion that was included in the OBBBA, the massive federal law passed last year that cut taxes and cut Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for people with low incomes. 
The fund is meant to help ease the impact of the cuts on rural areas, where residents have a harder time accessing care and where health care providers are more likely to rely on Medicaid payments than providers in urban areas. 
Every state received money from the rural health fund. The federal government will review states’ progress to determine future funding. Debra Farrington, deputy secretary for health at the NC Dept. of Health and Human Services, said it will be important to demonstrate early wins by delivering immediate and visible benefits to communities.  
“Year-one successes are vitally important,” she said. It’s also critical to use the first year to build momentum toward achieving long-term goals, she added.
During an online discussion Friday about the rural health transformation program rollout, Farrington said North Carolina plans to spend the money on:

Six locally-governed NC ROOTS hubs to connect medical, mental health, and social supports  
Prevention, chronic disease management, maternal health, and nutrition programs  
Increased access to mental health services, including substance use disorder treatment  
The rural health care workforce  
Rural providers’ transition to to value-based care, where providers are paid based on keeping people healthy and out of the hospital rather than on how many services are provided
Enhanced technology in health care through artificial intelligence and expanded broadband access 

“This is really potentially a generational opportunity to invest in the things that we really need to be investing in for our rural communities,”  said NCDHHS state health director Dr. Larry Greenblatt, “things that will make a difference to the individuals living in those communities to improve their health, but also to recruit and support the workforce.”
The federal government is giving states money with one hand, and taking money away with the other.  
“This funding will improve health care delivery for the more than 3 million North Carolina residents who live in rural communities,” Gov. Josh Stein said. 
But, he warned, the same federal legislation that created the rural health transformation program will cost the state tens of billions of dollars in Medicaid funds over the next 10 years. 
“It is without doubt that these cuts will inevitably hit rural communities hard,” despite the rural funding program, he said. 
Stein said his administration will continue to urge Congress to repeal the Medicaid cuts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/infant.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

The justices will consider whether the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of the Roundup weedkiller without a cancer warning should rule out the state court claims.
The Trump administration has weighed in on Bayer’s behalf, reversing the Biden administration’s position and putting it at odds with some supporters of the Make America Healthy Again agenda who oppose giving the company the legal immunity it seeks.
Some studies associate Roundup’s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the EPA has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed.
Bayer disputes the cancer claims but has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. At the same time, it has tried to persuade states to pass laws barring the lawsuits. Georgia and North Dakota have done so.
The high court will take up a case from Missouri, in which a jury awarded $1.25 million to a man who developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after spraying Roundup on a community garden in St. Louis.
The Supreme Court in 2022 declined to hear a similar claim from Bayer in a California case that awarded more than $86 million to a married couple.
But Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto in 2018, contends the Supreme Court should intervene now because lower courts have issued conflicting rulings. In 2024, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Bayer’s favor.
Bayer faces about 181,000 Roundup claims, mostly from residential users. It has stopped using glyphosate in Roundup sold in the U.S. residential lawn and garden market. But glyphosate remains in agricultural products. It’s designed to be used with genetically modified seeds, including corn, soybeans and cotton, that resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.
Bayer has said it might have to consider pulling glyphosate from U.S. agricultural markets if the lawsuits persist.
“It is time for the U.S. legal system to establish that companies should not be punished under state laws for complying with federal warning label requirements,” Bayer CEO Bill Anderson said in a statement.
Environmental groups said Bayer wants to keep juries out of the lawsuits because it keeps losing in state courts.
“It’s a sad day in America when our highest court agrees to consider depriving thousands of Roundup users suffering from cancer of their day in court,” said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
It’s unclear if the case will be argued in the spring or at the start of the next court term, in October.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016713345414-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Preyer, who joined the board in 2019, was instrumental in founding the North Carolina Collaboratory. He also helped establish the university’s School of Civic Life & Leadership, which was touted by supporters as a model for restoring debate and critical thinking on campus. Faculty critics, however, called the new school a “blatant overreach” by the Board of Trustees and an effort to dictate a more conservative curriculum.

More recently, during his time as board chairman, Preyer was a key figure in helping the university hire former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick as the university’s head football coach. The team went 4-8 in Belichick’s first season.
Preyer’s term was set to end in 2027.
“I’ve never felt better about the University and its leadership, so now is the time for me to get back to my day job,” wrote Preyer in announcing his departure.
Preyer’s day job is serving as president of Raleigh-based Restoration Systems, an environmental permitting company that specializes in wetland and stream mitigation.
On Thursday, Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) praised Preyer’s impact.
“John’s tenure on the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees was defined by incredible reforms,” said Berger on social media. “I’m thankful for his leadership and vision, especially his role in getting the School of Civic Life & Leadership up and running.”
Now it’s up to the UNC Board of Governors to select a replacement to complete Preyer’s term. The Board of Governors is wholly appointed by the Republican-controlled NC General Assembly, and it has been criticized as overly partisan and lacking in diversity.
Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, said he hoped that partisan politics would not dictate who fills the opening.
“I think the way that the General Assembly has politicized the university system, has politicized the courts, has politicized the Board of Elections – all of this is bad,” said Stein.
Stein called partisan intervention by UNC Boards of Trustees or the Board of Governors “absolutely counterproductive.”
“I think that we would be better served if these were not partisan, but rather they represented the broad representation of the entirety of the state, which includes unaffiliated voters, which includes Democratic voters, which includes Republican voters, not exclusively one party,” said Stein.
There’s no timetable for announcing Preyer’s replacement. UNC-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees meets Jan. 21.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stein_1152026.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

In an order from Judge […]","Michigan Capitol | Susan J. DemasUpdated 5:48 p.m.
The state must not spend a portion of the disputed $645 million in state work project funds slashed by the Michigan House Appropriations Committee late last year despite the State Budget Office authorizing departments and agencies to do so, a Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled Friday.
In an order from Judge Michael Gadola, the court ruled that the Michigan House of Representatives and its key committee allocating state funds would suffer irreparable harm if the Michigan State Budget Office “encumbers, expends or otherwise utilizes those funds designated for work projects that were unencumbered within 15 days before the end of the 2025 fiscal year.”
“This harm outweighs the harm an injunction may cause,” Gadola wrote.
The order came after the court heard oral arguments in the matter on Friday morning. Gadola had indicated earlier on Friday that he would rule on the spending matter later next week, which focused on the State Budget Office’s decision to activate spending codes on the work project dollars slashed previously by the House Appropriations Committee. 
The office did so after Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a formal opinion that the cuts to work projects from the Appropriations committee were unconstitutional, bucked the separation of powers doctrine and violated presentment requirements.
Unconstitutional: Nessel says $645M Michigan House GOP project cuts violated separation of powers

Yet, Gadola moved swiftly to opine on the spending matter while the question of constitutionality as it related to Nessel’s opinion was still being resolved.
“The public interest will be served by the entry of this preliminary injunction order,” Gadola wrote.
He further ordered that the budget office’s agents, officers, and employees were immediately enjoined from encumbering, expending, transferring, or otherwise obligating any of the $645 million in unencumbered funds associated with the specific line-item appropriations disapproved as work projects by the House Appropriations Committee on Dec. 10, 2025.
The order did not, however, apply to any funds that were paid out by the budget office as of Sept. 15, 2025.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

The status quo of the order was to be maintained until the court ruled otherwise, with Gadola noting there were other pending questions in the case.
The drastic work project cuts were made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bollin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, who said the money was an area of concern in their push to wipe what they’ve labeled “waste, fraud and abuse” in the budgeting process.
Several of the cuts slashed community services and other projects that residents have come to rely on. Democrats in the state House and Senate unified to call the cuts cruel, and some Republicans joined their repudiation of Hall and Bollin.
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Nessel said earlier this month that the cuts were accomplished through an unconstitutional process, which led the budget office to start spending the money.
Hall filed a lawsuit almost immediately, the merits of which are still pending before Gadola and the Court of Claims.
The speaker ran a victory lap in a statement following Gadola’s order.
“I’ve said all along that we were going to win this easily, because any fair court would rule in the House Republicans’ favor,” Hall said. “While ultimate Lansing insiders and Senate Democrats are desperate to protect their pork spending, House Republicans are fighting for hardworking taxpayers. This ruling has stopped Dana Nessel’s bogus legal opinion in its tracks, forcing the Whitmer administration to stop illegally spending their slush fund dollars.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 21:59:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers question DOC leaders after audit flagged shortcomings,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/lawmakers-question-doc-leaders-after-audit-flagged-shortcomings/,Connecticut legislative leaders said they're concerned about findings in a recent audit report showing failures by state prison staff.,"Lawmakers said they’re concerned about findings in a recent audit report showing failures by state prison staff to distribute medications on time, inform individuals who were released about money left in their accounts, and provide proper training for employees. 
An audit report released in July, which reviewed the years 2022 and 2023, found the Connecticut Department of Correction had administered medications to incarcerated individuals late — or, in some cases, not administered them at all. A review of medications given out to 10 people showed delays roughly 10% of the time. 
“This could really put inmates and correction officers in danger for folks not receiving their medication,” Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, said during a forum at the Capitol on Friday.
Dathan is co-chair of the legislature’s Government Oversight Committee, which convened the forum, along with the Judiciary Committee to discuss the audit. Lawmakers at the forum also raised concerns with the functioning of the state’s correctional health care system as a whole. 
Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the legislature has heard for years about problems with medical care for incarcerated men and women. He said he wanted to see data from the department showing improvement. 
“Frankly, I don’t know what else we can do to track that we’re getting better. I don’t see that we’re getting better. And maybe we are. But I would like the data to back that up,” said Stafstrom. 
DOC Commissioner Angel Quiros told lawmakers Friday that the department has struggled to fill positions for nurses and prescribers. That was the case in 2022 and 2023, and it’s still the case, he said. Quiros said the state’s nursing ranks declined during the pandemic and DOC is competing with other health care facilities — like hospitals, which offer better pay — for a limited number of providers.
That may have resulted in there not being enough nurses to distribute medication, Quiros said.
Robert Richardson, chief operating officer for DOC’s health services, said the department changed its policies to allow for a larger window of time when medication could be distributed. He said nurses were coached on the importance of documenting any delays. The electronic health records system now allows for exceptions for “exigent circumstances” that might cause delays in medication distribution, such as a facility lockdown. 
Stafstrom said he wanted to receive a direct report monthly on the doses of medicine delivered and the percentage of compliance, so he could track whether compliance was increasing or decreasing over time. 
Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Bridgeport, said she felt there needed to be a way to prioritize individuals with serious conditions for whom delays in medication could lead to significant health risks. 
“ There could be certain medications, [that] when they’re missed even by an hour, could be critical for a patient,” she said. 
In a press conference in advance of the hearing, advocates called for heightened scrutiny on medical care for inmates, particularly in light of the deaths of Tyler Cole and Ronald Johnson, who died from an overdose of methadone and other prescribed medications while incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution. 
“We will never know how many deaths in custody actually resulted from misdiagnosis and overdosing clients without adequate professional oversight,” said Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary CT. “Incarceration was not meant to be a death sentence, and yet countless people have died in just the last five years.”
State auditors are in the process of completing a performance audit with a specific focus on medical care for incarcerated men and women. 
Other findings
According to the audit, DOC continued to hold money that had belonged to individuals who had been released from prison. As of August 2024, there were 7,813 inactive accounts that held a total of about $483,000, according to the report.
Several lawmakers pointed out that the money, which had been held in commissary accounts while the person was incarcerated, could be critical for someone who was newly released from prison.  
“Most of the inmates are going to be released at some point in time, and we want them to be good upright, law-abiding tax paying citizens,” said Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. “In this day and age, any dollars in your pocket are going to be helpful, and there’s just no real reason why someone should not be alerted as they’re walking out the door, ‘Hey, you’ve got $500 coming to you.’” 
The audit also found lapses in training for DOC employees. Auditors said 19 of the 20 employees’ training they reviewed did not meet requirements. Employees must have 16 hours of training per year if they don’t have direct contact with incarcerated individuals, and 40 hours per year if they do work directly with the incarcerated population. 
Quiros said he had raised the requirement for in-person training from 8 to 24 hours and reduced the amount of training on computers at individual facilities. He said training numbers had improved in recent years, but were not at the levels he would like to see. He estimated that at each facility, between 88% and 100% of staff who work directly with the population had completed required training. 
Costly leaves of absence and overtime
A series of extended administrative leaves of absence among DOC employees also drew the attention of lawmakers. Several expressed concerned about the amount of money being paid to employees under investigation for misconduct or awaiting criminal charges.
The report found that, while paid leave is capped at two months, nine employees remained on administrative leave for over a year. In at least one case, it lasted for over three and a half years. 
Together, the department paid these nine employees more than $800,000 during the time they spent on administrative leave beyond the permitted 60 days. 
According to the Department of Correction, most of the employees who are on administrative leave are either under investigation for use of force, under investigation for “undue familiarity” — usually for bringing contraband into a facility — or have been arrested for a felony outside of work. 
The department attributed the lengthy periods of paid leave to delays in investigations. 
Dathan questioned why someone with pending charges could not be brought back and placed on an administrative desk duty rather than being paid while not doing any work. 
Quiros told lawmakers that there were 26 individuals currently on administrative leave, a decrease from 61 in August. He said he had been bringing people back to work who were awaiting trial proceedings for felony charges. In some cases, he said, the delays were caused by lengthy court procedures.
Quiros said that of the people who were on administrative leave, he estimated that about half would return to the department and half would be dismissed, depending on the severity of the charges.
Lawmakers also took issue with overtime pay. According to the audit, DOC spent $96.6 million on overtime hours in 2022 and $103.4 million in 2023. The audit found that a number of employees who were ineligible for overtime were paid a total of $81,500 in those two years. 
State Auditor John Geragosian said understaffing puts both the correction officers and incarcerated men and women at risk, which can lead to more people being injured and receiving workers’ compensation. 
According to Quiros, about 300 people completed training for correction officers at the academy in 2025, and the department was preparing to hire 100 people. But Quiros also noted that during that time, 287 people had left the department for various reasons. He said the department plans to bring on 300 more correction officers, filling between 92% and 93% of the open positions for officers.
But Quiros noted that even with every position filled, there are situations where overtime was necessary. He said the number of people on leave for workers’ compensation has been rising. In December, the department had about 200 people on workers’ compensation leave for more than a month and another 230 out on short-term leave.
“ Just throwing more resources into getting more correctional officers may decrease the amount of overtime. [It] will definitely decrease the facility emergency lockdowns that we have for lack of staff,” said Quiros. “But we’re still going to have the problem that, anytime a correctional officer is off on accrued time, it generates overtime.” 
State Auditor Craig Miner noted that there had been a wave of retirements within state government shortly before the audited time period. He said there was likely a high number of new employees at the department in those years, and that the findings of the audits might be more concerning if they were to continue in the future. 
But lawmakers expressed frustration over what they saw as persistent problems.
Rep. Renee LaMark Muir, D-Deep River, questioned whether the addition of more correction officers would really solve the problems. She said the department had the same number of officers as it had in 2010, despite having closed multiple facilities and decreased the number of people incarcerated. 
“It’s not just simply throwing more staff at the problem, it’s stepping back and fixing the management problems,” said LaMark Muir. LaMark Muir said she wanted to see a staffing analysis done. 
Quiros said he was open to the idea. Currently, he said, the department has nearly 500 vacancies. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, urged Quiros to ask the legislature this year for funding to create a better system. 
“ I need an ask that is visionary. I need an ask that has a vision for a prison system that works for everyone in the prison system,” said Winfield.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Quiros-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Tom Tiffany is ahead in  the Republican primary field. Tiffany has raised about $2 million, the most of any candidate. The reports cover the period from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2025.
There are about 11 months until the primary, which is scheduled for August 11. 
Crowley leads Democratic field
Crowley, who launched his campaign in September, has raised $800,949, including $789,281 in donations and $11,666 in in-kind contributions. About $138,000 was transferred to his governor’s campaign from his county executive campaign committee account. 
According to his campaign finance report, he spent $187,529 and finished the period with $602,181 cash on hand. Seven contributors gave the maximum $20,000 donation allowed in the governor’s race, including executive of the Milwaukee Bucks Alex Lasry. 
“People across Wisconsin are feeling the financial squeeze, and they want a governor who knows how to get things done,” Crowley said in a statement. He said the support is providing him “the resources to build a serious, statewide operation focused on delivering results for working families.”
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, who launched her campaign in July becoming the first Democratic candidate in the race, raised $618,284 in donations and $2,034 in in-kind contributions. She spent $174,894 and ended the period with $603,075. 
The Democratic Lt. Governors Association pledged in October to invest $2 million in independent expenditures in 2026 to support Rodriguez’s campaign. She listed a $86,000 contribution from the PAC. 
Former Department of Administration Sec. Joel Brennan, the latest candidate to launch a campaign, reported raising $566,212 in donations and $1,610 in in-kind contributions. He spent $13,873 and reported having $552,339 on hand at the end of the period. 
Former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes raised $555,647 since launching his campaign on Dec. 2 from 3,790 donations. He spent $88,265 and ended the period with $471,471. Shortly after launching his campaign, Barnes said his fundraising goal is $50 million over the course of his campaign.
According to his campaign finance report, he received donations of the maximum $20,000 from megadonors George and Alexander Soros. 
Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes reported raising $465,403 and $13,681 in in-kind donations. She spent $63,059 and ended the period with $402,344 on hand. 
State Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), a Democratic socialist, raised $368,685 in donations and $1,188 from in-kind contributions, though she also spent a majority of the funds during the period. According to her report, Hong spent $234,782 during the period and ended it with $134,588 on hand.
Hong’s fundraising came from over 7,300 donors. According to her campaign, the average donation was $49.96 and about 75% of the total dollars raised came from donors in Wisconsin.
State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) raised $355,455 in donations and $23,132 from in-kind contributions during the period. According to her report, she spent $84,930 and reported having $334,032 on hand.
Roys reported four donations of the maximum $20,000, including from her husband and Peter Gunder, a former executive at American Family Insurance, and his wife. 
In a statement, Roys’ campaign said that about 82% of the donations to her campaign came from Wisconsin residents and that she isn’t accepting corporate donations. 
“Kelda’s campaign is funded by grassroots donors from every corner of the state. With our disciplined financial management and a committed Wisconsin donor base that is growing every day, Kelda will have the resources necessary to win the primary on August 11,” Roys’ campaign manager Jasper Bernstein said in a statement. 
Tiffany leads Schoemann in fundraising
Tiffany, who launched his campaign in September, led the field of GOP candidates, reported over $2 million raised — raising the most of any candidate in the Democratic or Republican field. The Republican primary field is much smaller than the Democratic field with only two candidates.
According to his campaign finance report, Tiffany raised $2,122,489 in donations and also received $3,808 in in-kind contributions. He spent $438,160 and ended the period with $1,695,038 on-hand. 
Tiffany also received $20,000 each from Republican megadonors Diane Hendricks, Dick Uihlein and Liz Uihlein. 
The largest donation Tiffany reported was $86,000 from the Wisconsin Federation of College Republicans. Wisconsin state law allows for unlimited donations from political parties to candidates.The College Republicans, who boasted raising over $1 million, had received $500,000 from the Uihleins.
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, who launched his campaign in early May, reported raising nearly $1 million over the course of the year.
During the reporting period from July to December, he brought in $535,650 in donations and $3,649 in in-kind donations. He spent $381,394 during the period and ended it with $492,495 in-hand.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLegislators, religious leaders and community members gathered at Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta Friday to commemorate civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. the day after what would have been his 97th birthday. 
The ceremony, held amid a nationwide backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and growing calls for increased affordability, highlighted King’s efforts to fight for racial equality and economic justice.
In this year’s keynote address, John Hope Bryant, the founder, CEO and chair of Operation HOPE, highlighted King’s efforts to expand economic empowerment, calling him the “embodiment” of what it means to have financial freedom.

King’s family was able to send him to the historically Black Morehouse College in Atlanta when he was 15 years old in the 1940s. He would go on to earn advanced degrees.  
“That took economic freedom. That took the ability to have a voice,” Bryant said. 
Bryant also called on lawmakers, advocates and everyday Georgians to work toward improving financial literacy, calling it “the civil rights issue of this generation.”
“What good is it to get the lunch counter access if you can’t pay the bill for the burger?” he said.
The ceremony was also attended by some of King’s surviving family members, the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus and other elected officials.
Government facilities across the state will be closed Monday in observance of King’s birthday, celebrated every third Monday in January. In 1968, King was slain at the age of 39 after becoming the face of the nonviolent Civil Rights Movement fighting the systemic racism Black people endured across the deep South and other parts of America.
But this year, the celebration for some might look slightly different: visitors to national parks across the nation will no longer be granted free access on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday after the U.S. Department of the Interior removed the holiday from the calendar of fee-free days. Free access to national parks was also revoked on Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the official end of slavery in America.
Trump has also recently made comments to the New York Times criticizing the Civil Rights Movement, claiming that it led to white people being “very badly treated.”
But in Georgia, where King was born and lived for much of his life, representatives from both sides of the aisle were united in commemorating his birthday. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp celebrated King’s advocacy and legacy of nonviolence in his remarks to the crowd Friday.
“It goes without saying that one of the towering figures of America’s rich history is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,” Kemp said. “He did as much — if not more than anyone — to ensure we work toward fulfilling those founding principles that inspired the very birth of the United States: liberty, truth and justice for all.”
Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat and chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, spoke at a ceremony celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat and chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, urged attendees to continue fighting for King’s message of equality.
“Dr. King envisioned a world where children of all backgrounds could join hands as equals, and that vision is not a relic of the past,” Merritt said. “It is a living challenge to each of us every day.”
MLK Day celebrations across metro Atlanta will continue throughout the weekend, with a commemorative service at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King once served as a pastor, as well as a parade, a 5K race, and numerous community service events.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Leaders of the two federally-recognized tribes in Colorado spoke to the Legislature on Friday morning about the relationship between state and tribal governments, as well as a desire to further confer on policy proposals at the Capitol.
“In many places, state and tribal relations remain strained. But here in Colorado, we have chosen a different path,” said Southern Ute Indian Tribe Chairman Melvin Baker. “It is one rooted in collaboration, consultation and trust.”
Leaders of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe address the Legislature at the beginning of the session every year about their priorities, successes and challenges. The Southern Ute Reservation and Ute Mountain Ute reservations sit next to each other in the southwest corner of the state and have about 3,600 enrolled members combined.

Ute Mountain Tribe Councilmember Marilynn House said that she would like for tribes to formally meet with legislators more often. Tribal consultation is usually honored, she said, but is not always consistent.
“Open communication is what all tribes in this country should have and be entitled to, as the government has broken many promises and treaties,” she said. “A way to move forward from the past would be to always consult the tribes.”
House highlighted recently-passed legislation related to tribes, such as last year’s Colorado Voting Rights Act, which enables members to use their tribal identification cards for voter registration and requires drop boxes on reservation land if the tribe requests one.
“This allowed more access to voting for our tribal membership and provided the tribe with an opportunity to be involved in their state’s elections and have proper representation,” she said.
She also praised a law passed last year that gives tribal members free access to state parks. That law is the center of a lawsuit from the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in Utah, which alleges they also have longstanding rights to hunt, fish and access the lands now considered state parks in Colorado.
Baker used a portion of his speech to call on the state to help more with cleanup efforts from a major gasoline spill on the reservation over a year ago. An estimated 97,000 gallons of gasoline spilled from a ruptured pipeline owned by Texas-based Enterprise Products in December 2024. It is the largest spill in the state since 2016.
“This presence of gasoline contamination in the groundwater raises serious concerns for public health, environmental safety and long-term impacts to the Animas River, our wildlife, our reservation, our cultural resources and those who live downstream,” he said.
He said the spill is a reminder of the risk posed by aging infrastructure and weak oversight, and the state has not allocated “appropriate” resources to the cleanup, he said. Late last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would work with the tribe and the state to implement a corrective action plan.
“We believe that if a similar spill occurred on the Front Range, the response would be immediate and direct,” he said.
Baker also said the tribe has entered into mediation with the state over the tribe’s ability to launch an online sportsbook without being subject to a 10% tax, which the tribe said is not allowed under the state’s gaming compact with the tribes. Colorado voters legalized sports betting in 2019. The tribe sued the state over the issue in 2024 — the Ute Mountain Ute tribe joined the lawsuit later — but a federal judge ruled that the state is immune to the lawsuit late last year.
“Our relationship depends on cooperation,” he said. “We need to enter into agreements with the state and trust that they will be respected.”

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine has issued an emergency order suspending the license of a Des Moines surgeon accused of posing an immediate danger to the public.
In recent years, the surgeon, Dr. Qasim L. Chaudhry, has faced three lawsuits alleging negligence and medical malpractice. State records indicate the suspension of Chaudhry’s license stems from two separate board investigations that were launched in 2023 and 2024.
In public filings, the board alleges it has received complaints related to Chaudhry’s practice of medicine and concluded that he has failed to meet the required standard of care “in multiple patients and that failure led to significant harm” to patients.

Chaudhry, the board says, “poses an immediate danger to the public,” adding that it the board finds it is necessary to immediately suspend Chaudhry’s medical license through an emergency adjudicative order.
The suspension is “necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare until this case is resolved due the severity of the potential consequences of (Chaudhry) practicing medicine in a surgical or clinical setting,” the board stated, adding the imposition of any other “interim safeguards would not be sufficient to protect the public.”
Chaudhry is charged with professional incompetence and with knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of medicine.
The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that has given rise to the allegations and charges but has stated that Chaudhry is a “surgeon who practiced in the Des Moines area at all times relevant” to the emergency order.
A disciplinary hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 5 and 6, 2026.
Chaudhry has been an Iowa-licensed physician since June 2010. His practice specialty, according to board records, is transplant surgery.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Chaudhry for comment.
Three medical malpractice lawsuits
The board’s comes order comes four weeks after a medical malpractice and wrongful death case against Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center was dropped by the plaintiffs after an out-of-court settlement was reached.
In that case, the estate of the late Donna Burton of Des Moines alleged Chaudhry performed a hernia repair on Burton on Nov. 23, 2020. Six days later, Burton allegedly went to the Iowa Methodist Medical Center emergency room to report that she was in pain, had not had a bowel movement since the operation, and was vomiting two or three times per day. She was allegedly admitted to the hospital and was found in her room the next morning, vomiting and gasping for air. She died minutes later, the lawsuit alleged, due to a bowel obstruction.
Prior to the settlement in the case, Chaudhry and the other defendants denied any wrongdoing.
In February 2025, Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center were sued for negligence by Jasmine Hart, a 37-year-old woman who underwent a kidney transplant on Feb. 23, 2023. In her lawsuit, Hart alleged Chaudhry observed in his surgical notes that the donor’s kidney was “oozy,” and that after the surgery was completed, Iowa Methodist received a call from the Iowa Donor Network indicating the donor had tested positive for cancer.
The lawsuit claimed Chaudhry then determined the transplanted organ needed to be removed. After that operation was completed, Hart resumed dialysis and underwent regular cancer screenings as a result of her exposure to the cancerous donor organ, the lawsuit alleged.
In December 2023, Hart was allegedly diagnosed with kidney cancer. The cancerous kidney was removed, but Hart continued to suffer from nerve damage and pain as a result of the operations, the lawsuit claimed.
Chaudhry and the other defendants in the case denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit was dropped by Hart in August 2025, with no reference to any out-of-court settlement that may have been reached.
In May 2025, Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center were the focus of a third lawsuit alleging medical malpractice. In that case, the estate of the late Faye Jean Robinson of Waterloo alleged that in May 2023, Chaudhry performed surgery on Robinson to repair a hernia and to remove her kidney and spleen.
After the operation was complete, Chaudhry allegedly left the hospital and Robinson twice went into cardiac arrest and was placed on a ventilator. The lawsuit alleges that a second surgery was planned to repair suspected internal bleeding, but before it took place, Robinson went into cardiac arrest three more times, became “visibly swollen with blood coming from the orifices protruding from her body,” and then died.
Chaudhry and the other defendants in the case have denied any wrongdoing. A trial-setting conference in the case is scheduled for Jan. 29, 2026.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of South Dakota lawmakers deadlocked on Friday in Pierre on a bill that would remove an economic development fund from the governor’s exclusive control.
A motion to approve the measure tied on a 4-4 vote with one senator excused due to illness, leaving the bill to potentially be considered again later.
The bill would change how money is awarded from the Future Fund, which receives money from a fee paid by employers. The bill would require any Future Fund award to be approved by a majority vote of the governor-appointed Board of Economic Development, rather than by the governor alone, which is already a requirement of many other funds administered by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 
The bill would also require the office to write rules outlining an application process, methods of assessing economic impact, selection criteria, requirements to qualify for a grant, and the process for disbursing awards.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bill sponsor Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, told the committee the measure is not meant to eliminate the fund, but to add minimum safeguards and transparency. The only specific legal restraint on the fund currently is a state law that says it must be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” 
“Under current law, millions of dollars can be committed without mandatory board approval, without a standardized application process, without objective economic impact criteria, and without consistent public reporting,” Howard said. “This is not conservative governance. It’s simply an oversight failure.”
“And we have seen the consequences through the years,” she added. 
The Future Fund has drawn controversy in recent years over former Gov. Kristi Noem’s uses of it, including funding for a shooting range that lawmakers declined to fund, a rodeo where Noem rode in on horseback with the American flag and a workforce development advertising campaign that featured Noem as the star.
Opponents prefer governor’s new executive order
Opponents of the bill included Gov. Larry Rhoden’s economic development commissioner, Bill Even, along with multiple economic development and business organizations. They said the bill would slow South Dakota’s ability to compete for projects by adding bureaucracy and reducing flexibility. 
Even pointed to Rhoden’s recent executive order, signed Thursday, as a better approach, saying it adds transparency while keeping the governor as the decision-maker so the state can “move at the speed of business.” 
Governor pledges transparency in funding decisions that lawmakers might vote to take away

Rhoden’s executive order lays out procedures for how Future Fund awards are handled and requires public posting of awards and agreements, while still preserving the governor’s sole authority over the fund.  
When asked during a Thursday press conference if he’s pushing back against allegations that he and his predecessor improperly used the fund, Rhoden said that’s not the case.
“I think it’s just to put in writing and give the legislators a comfort level that this is what we’re looking at when we’re making these decisions on Future Fund projects,” Rhoden said.
Howard and other supporters of her bill countered that executive orders can be changed or rescinded by future administrations.
The tie vote was on a motion in the Senate State Affairs Committee to send the bill to the full Senate. Sen. Arch Beal, R-Sioux Falls, was excused due to illness, leaving the panel one vote short of the majority needed to advance the bill.
Among the seven committee members who were present, four Republicans voted in favor of the bill and three voted against it. The committee’s only Democrat, Sen. Liz Larson, of Sioux Falls, voted against the bill.
Broader debate over economic development
Separately on Friday, state senators declined to reconsider a nonbinding resolution from Sen. John Carley, R-Piedmont, asserting that “the free market and the private sector, left alone, will best serve our economic interests” without “enticement from tax credits and subsidies.” The Senate rejected the resolution Thursday, and after Carley had announced his intention to seek reconsideration, no reconsideration motion was made Friday.
Howard’s bill and Carley’s resolution are part of a broader discussion this legislative session about economic development in the state. 
Another bill, from Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, would require former state officials or employees to wait for two years before going to work for any entity that was the beneficiary of a contract the officials or employees approved, awarded or administered, if the contract value was more than $1 million. Existing state law requires a one-year waiting period for all such officials or employees.
Reed’s bill is a response to South Dakota Searchlight reporting about Steve Westra, who was the commissioner of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development during the Noem administration. 
Westra left his state job in 2023 and took a job with CJ Schwan’s a year later. While Westra worked for state government, he signed the first pledge of state aid benefiting the company. That aid now totals $69 million of grants, loans and tax rebates for the company’s $550 million, 650-employee food production plant under construction in northern Sioux Falls.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EM8A4379-copy-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

Free.,US Education Department delays plan to garnish wages of student borrowers in default,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-delays-plan-garnish-wages-student-borrowers-default,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education, for now, is backtracking on plans to garnish wages and seize tax refunds of student loan borrowers in default, the department announced Friday.Less than a month after the agency said it would begin garnishing wages by sending notices to roughly 1,000 borrowers in default the first full week of January, the department said that the temporary delay would allow it to implement “major student loan repayment reforms” under Republicans’ tax and spending cut bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2025.The delay would “give borrowers more options to repay their loans,” the department said. It was not immediately clear from the announcement how long the pause would last. Education Secretary Linda McMahon signaled earlier this week during the Rhode Island portion of her Returning Education to the States Tour that wage garnishment has been “put on pause for a bit.”  The agency resumed collections for defaulted federal student loans in May after a pause that began during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.A borrower can have their wages garnished as a consequence of defaulting on their loans, and a loanholder can order an employer to withhold up to 15% of their disposable pay to collect defaulted debt without being taken to court, according to Federal Student Aid, an office of the Education Department.The delay also applies to the Treasury Offset Program, which “allows the federal government to collect income tax refunds and certain government benefits (for example, Social Security benefits) from individuals who owe debts to the federal government,” per FSA. Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director for the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, said in a Friday statement that “after months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people’s hard-earned money directly from their paychecks and tax refunds simply for falling behind on their student loans.” “Amidst the growing affordability crisis, the Administration’s plans would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt,” she added, while pointing to a Jan. 7 letter from Protect Borrowers and other organizations calling on McMahon to “immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers’ wages.”",,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

Jan. 16, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. At the year’s first Consensus Revenue Estimating Committee, staff from the House Fiscal Agency, Senate Fiscal Agency and the Michigan Department of Treasury gathered to formalize estimates for economic growth both in Michigan and nationally, as well as state budget forecasts for upcoming fiscal years. 
“My biggest takeaway would be that the economy is stable,” State Treasurer Rachael Eubanks told reporters after the conference. “That’s not to say that there aren’t challenges. There’s a lot of uncertainty at the federal level, but despite that, Michigan has shown resilience and continues to see some growth.”
She added that this growth, fueled in part by revenue performance meeting expectations, allows the state to invest in services and infrastructure now while also planning for the future. 
Looking ahead to the upcoming year’s budget debate, State Budget Director Jen Flood added that, as “the federal government is passing the buck and handing the tab to states across the country,” there have been increased pressures on Michigan’s budget — though she expressed confidence in getting a bipartisan budget done on time. 
Flood noted that while some states have had to pull money from emergency “rainy day” funds amid major changes in federal policy, Michigan has continued to make deposits into its own. 
The consensus forecast that was approved during the conference forecast a 0.2% increase in the state’s combined general fund and school aid fund for FY26, a 1.1% increase in FY27 and a 2.4% increase in FY28.

However, those estimates —especially for the general fund — were much lower than the previous estimates for Fiscal Years 2026 and 2027, by about $780 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, than the last consensus forecast in May 2025. 
House Republican leadership took the chance to criticize spending that they considered to be “waste, fraud and abuse,” a refrain that has become common in the GOP through budget discussions. 
House Appropriations Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) said that she expected the state might have to cut down its budget in the coming year given the lowered revenue predictions. 
“I think that it actually supports our approach to the budget for the current fiscal year, and that we were very prudent, if not preemptive, and what’s ahead for us by taking that budget and going through it line by line and making cuts,” she told reporters after the conference.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) similarly cited GOP budget priorities — including the controversial cuts to $645 million in departmental work project spending, the constitutionality of which is currently being debated in court — as the correct response to the forecasts given in the conference. 
“Now, with all the COVID money gone and our $9 billion surplus wasted by the Democrat trifecta, we have a more than $1 billion hole in the next budget,” Hall wrote in a press release. “As I predicted, we now have to keep doing what House Republicans did in this last budget. Eliminate more ghost jobs. Stop the Democrat pork spending. And slash even more waste, fraud, and abuse.”
When asked about those statements, Flood declined to directly respond to the framing used by Bollin and Hall, but said that the results of the conference were “largely expected.”
“These are adjustments from the May CREC, which happened before reconciliation. It happened before the tax policy and budget that we passed in September, October, and so we’re not surprised by this,” she said. “The Fiscal Year 26 budget accounts for these changes, and we look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in the legislature to finalize another balanced budget by June of this year.”
However, Michigan Senate Appropriations Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) said Democrats had fought to make responsible investments in the state’s rainy-day fund. 
“As revenue growth flattens, we will remain committed to governing with discipline and maturity, always keeping the needs of the people and the financial health of the state top of mind,” Anthony said in a press release after the conference. “Thanks to smart investments and the extremely accurate forecasting of our state economists, I am confident in our state’s ability to create another fiscally responsible budget that delivers real results for the people of Michigan.” 
The budget analysts also provided more general forecasts for the economy in Michigan and the United States for the next three years. 
Unemployment rates for Michigan were predicted to stay relatively flat, between 5.3% and 5.6% — slightly higher than the national predictions, which sit around 4.8%. 
Those predictions aligned generally with a presentation from researchers at the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics at the University of Michigan. 
Gabriel Ehrlich, the director of the program, explained that Michigan’s unemployment rate has actually dropped since last April, despite the national rate increasing slightly — even though statewide, the number of employed state residents is falling. 
What that indicates is a declining labor force participation rate, even as the labor market in Michigan remains fairly tight — “the reasons for the decline in the unemployment rate aren’t necessarily the reasons we prefer to see,” Ehrlich said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3701-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

You can read more about the section here.

It has been 25 years since I lived in Jackson, Mississippi, and whenever someone finds out I’m Jewish and from there, their first response is usually, Wait, there are Jews in Mississippi?
I am proud to always answer yes.
Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson, and the loving community that calls it home, shaped me into the person I am today.
My family has been part of that community for decades. My grandfather and father served as temple presidents; my mom grew up in the community and later served as sisterhood president.
I have vivid memories of my grandmother walking up and down the aisles during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, asking people if they had somewhere to go and inviting dozens back to her house to make sure no one observed the holidays alone.
Beth Israel was where my parents were married. It was where my sister and I both became Bat Mitzvahs, where we formed our Jewish identity through religious school and participation in our small but mighty youth group. It was where my husband and I married.

Last Saturday, Beth Israel Congregation was set on fire by someone who hates Jews simply for being Jews. Seeing the charred images of the library is painful. I have vivid memories of being in that library playing hide-and-seek, participating in classes and youth group meetings, getting ready for my wedding  and signing my ketubah in that room.
If I close my eyes, I can see the ark where the Torahs—now reduced to ash—once sat. I can see the books lining the walls that held our community’s history. I remember showing my children the plaques commemorating congregants’ milestones, including several from my own family, which have now been reduced to debris.
Growing up Jewish in Jackson made me a member of two diaspora communities – the Jewish one and the Mississippi one. In the aftermath of the fire, I have received messages from many people who are part of my Mississippi diaspora—some Jewish, mostly not—who have beautiful memories of visiting Beth Israel with me. 
For many of my friends, Beth Israel and my family were the only meaningful encounters with Jews they have ever had, and this fire has affected them in ways they did not expect.
This is not the first time Beth Israel has been targeted. In September 1967, the Ku Klux Klan firebombed the synagogue in retaliation for Rabbi Perry Nussbaum’s support of the Civil Rights movement. I grew up always knowing it was part of my community’s history.
What history books rarely emphasize is how that bombing brought the Jackson faith community together. In its aftermath, white and Black clergy were among the first to condemn the hatred, and members of the Jewish community played a significant role working secretly to help uncover the KKK bombings of the 1960s.
Last week’s fire was not an isolated incident. It is the most recent symptom of the dangerous rise in antisemitism facing Jewish communities across the country and around the world. Since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, the European Jewish Congress reports at least 20 attacks on synagogues across the globe. 
Jews make up less than 2% of the U.S. population, yet we are the targets of roughly 16% of all hate crimes and nearly 70% of religion-based hate crimes, according to the FBI. American Jewish Committee’s State of Antisemitism in America 2024 report found that 56% of American Jews have altered their behavior out of fear of antisemitism, and 1 in 3 has personally experienced it. Each one of these statistics is a person — a mom or dad, a brother, sister or child.

These troubling numbers highlight why antisemitism is not just a Jewish problem to solve. We need people to listen when we explain why antisemitic violence must be confronted clearly, forcefully and without hesitation. Our fear — rooted in generational trauma — of rising hateful rhetoric from all sides of the political spectrum is real and has consequences.  We need allies who refuse to look away and choose to stand up and take action.
That was apparent last May, when I was staffing an American Jewish Community event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in which Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were murdered after leaving the event.
The event was devoted to how grassroots diplomacy can transform the Middle East through humanitarian aid and cross-cultural collaboration. Many of the more than 100 people there were not Jewish. But they came together in a time of need, unified in purpose and in hope. 
A few months later, a German journalist asked me how I can stay optimistic despite that horrible night. That wasn’t a question I have ever considered. Growing up Jewish in Mississippi has always meant that optimism is the only option.
Being a part of Beth Israel taught me many things, most importantly that community is an antidote to many of the problems of the world, that Jewish joy is always stronger than hate, and that showing up for people in their time of need is often the holiest thing you can do. Jews in Mississippi – and pretty much anywhere else, for that matter – need that help more than ever.

Meanwhile, attorneys for the State of Montana said the challenge to these laws should be dismissed.
In a court hearing Thursday afternoon in the Lewis and Clark County District Court, Judge Christopher Abbott heard oral arguments about when parents must be notified. EmpowerMT and the ACLU told the judge that two laws are overly broad, unconstitutional, and violate rights to privacy and a quality education. 
The lawsuit centers on Senate Bill 99, passed in 2021. The lawsuit was also updated to include House Bill 471, passed during the 2025 session, which an attorney for the state said was intended to fix issues stemming from SB 99.
It’s unclear, the complaint says, what teachers and school counselors are allowed to say and do in school, what books they are allowed to assign and even what they can do if a child asks a question about gender identity or sexual orientation. 
“As a result of SB 99 and the Defendants’ efforts to marginalize 2S-LGBTQIA+ students, a hostile environment has been created in Montana public schools that threatens 2S-LGBTQIA+ students,” the complaint reads. “The requirement that all teaching or presentations that reference gender related issues and human sexuality first be reviewed by parents along with the related prohibition on teaching these topics in the absence of parental notice, does a serious disservice to all Montana students.”
Legislators tried to pass a bill in 2023 in an attempt to adjust SB 99, with Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, a Billings Republican, saying some schools sent out notices once per year, while others would send them out daily. Attorneys for the ACLU pointed to the broadness of the law in their arguments.
The worry among school counselors as well is whether they could be potentially revealing information a child does not want their parents to know and potentially opening the child up to problems at home if counselors inform the parents they’d like to talk about a topic with their child. By not being able to provide some help to a student, there is concern that it’s also impacting their educational experience.
​​”Even before enactment of HB 471, school counselors report that they are routinely required to choose between violating SB 99 or breaching their ethical obligations, which require them to maintain confidentiality with students,” the complaint reads. “School counselors routinely meet with students to discuss or confer on issues related to gender identity or sexual orientation. Many students do not feel safe sharing that same confidential information with their parents, yet this is what SB 99 requires, regardless of whether students or counselors consent to such disclosures.”
It could also be confusing for teachers who might have a partner the same sex as them — for example: Does mentioning their relationship constitute a violation of the law?
“We’re talking about anything that has to do with a human being, because we’re talking about gender identity and sexual orientation anytime we acknowledge I’m a woman, I’m cisgender woman who’s married to a man, that’s talking about my sexual orientation and gender identity,” Ashlee Rossler, an ACLU Montana attorney, said during during arguments.
Attorneys for the state argued anyone with a state contract is expected to “promote government speech.”
“Any service that a school counselor provides is done in accordance with the contract with the school district,” said George Clark, a state attorney. “That is government speech that they are giving to the student under the guise of advice.”
He added in his rebuttal: “I don’t think a privacy right includes conversations with a government employee.”
Clark also said that he thinks there is a workaround for school counselors.
“The counselor doesn’t have to say, ‘Hey, your kid came to me. He thinks he’s gay. I need to talk to him about this,’” Clark said. “The counselor just has to say, your son approached me. He expressed some concerns. I want to ensure I’m complying with the law. Do you give me permission to discuss with him, you know any topics related to HB 471, under SB 99.”
The short title of HB 471 is “Revise education laws related to human sexuality and identity instruction” and for SB 99, it’s “Establish parameters for K-12 human sexuality education.” 
Montana legislators also tried to push through a bill allowing religious leaders to become school counselors, though that bill from Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, failed.
“Classrooms and learning spaces are supposed to support expansive and imaginative thinking. They’re not supposed to be limited by the whims of parents and legislators who are injecting their faith-based beliefs into curriculum,” Rossler said. “Especially given that parents do have a role in their child’s education, they have an opportunity every single year to democratically elect their school boards.”
Religious organizations, including the Montana Family Foundation, lobbied in support of HB 471. Clark called injecting religion into the case was “unfair” though a belief among some Christians that being gay is a sin is clearly present in the Montana Legislature and some legislators have used the Bible to justify proposed legislation targeting the state’s LGBTQ community. 
The lawsuit also mentions the inclusion of certain religious values into public education. According to 2024 report by the Public Religion Research Institute, only two major religious groups lack majority support for same-sex marriage, Hispanic Protestants and white evangelical Protestants.
“SB 99’s sponsor, Sen. Cary Smith, explained that the purpose of SB 99 is to reinforce ‘Christian values’ in Montana public education,” the complaint reads.
Clark added there’s due process for teachers and that they have a code of conduct they’re required to follow. Teachers found in violation of the law would have consequences, he added.
“Just like a teacher can be fired for showing a child pornography, a teacher can be fired for disobeying the law,” Clark said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/B86A4213-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

The $5 million proposal would staunch the loss of housing vouchers this year, but is much less than housing authorities had requested.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lawmakers take up stopgap funding for Section 8 housing vouchers .","Kathleen Berk, executive director of the Vermont State Housing Authority, speaks to lawmakers about financial challenges related to the Section 8 federal housing voucher program on Nov. 5, 2025 in Montpelier. David Littlefield / Vermont Public
This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
With federal funds dwindling for a key housing assistance program, Vermont lawmakers are looking at using state money to slow the loss of vouchers that help thousands of Vermonters cover rent. 
Legislators have said they want to earmark $5 million in a mid-year spending package to soften the blow of funding reductions to the Section 8 program. The bill has plenty more hurdles to clear, but a key housing panel registered its support for the funds on Thursday after local public housing authorities have spent months crying for help.

Still, the earmark falls far short of the $18 million housing authority leaders had originally bid for last fall, an amount that would have maxed out Vermont’s voucher ceiling set by the feds and boosted the number of vouchers in rotation.
“What we’re trying to do with this one-time, strategic intervention is to…slow the decrease in the number of vouchers in this calendar year as much as possible,” said Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais, who chairs the House General and Housing Committee.
As Vermont faces steep housing costs and persistently high levels of homelessness, federal housing vouchers play a crucial role in sustaining housing for low-income people who can’t afford market-rate rents. Voucher recipients pay a third of their income toward rent; a local agency administering the federal program pays for the rest. The vouchers offer one of the few avenues out of homelessness for the thousands of Vermonters sleeping in shelters, motels and outdoors.
But over the last year, local housing authorities in Vermont have seen reductions in funding from Congress. That has led many of the nine local authorities to stop issuing new vouchers off their lengthy waiting lists, rescind vouchers from people looking for an apartment to use them, and shelve vouchers when tenants have died or moved out. The state lost hundreds of housing vouchers in 2025 through attrition.
Still, many of the nine Vermont housing authorities are entering 2026 in a budget shortfall which they don’t expect to ease anytime soon. Berk is now worried VSHA might need to take the extraordinary step of withdrawing vouchers from people currently using them to help pay their rent if the state does not intervene.
Draft bills in Congress would result in the loss of roughly 300 to 600 more vouchers in Vermont – or $3.6 million to $7.2 million – according to Berk.
“Preserving housing assistance and keeping Vermont families stably housed has to be a priority,” Berk told lawmakers Thursday.
The federal government bases future years’ Section 8 voucher funding on past years’ spending by local housing authorities. That means that as Vermont authorities shrink their voucher rolls, they can expect to receive less money in the future even if need remains great, leading to what Berk has called a “downward spiral” in the number of vouchers available to Vermont renters.
The $5 million in state aid is meant to halt that spiral, at least for a year: It would allow Vermont housing authorities to slow down the erosion in the number of vouchers available to Vermont renters and ensure the state gets more federal money in the coming years. 
“It means that we will always get a greater share of whatever [Congress chooses] to give us [in] future years,” Mihaly said.
Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, chair of the powerful budget-writing panel in the House, said Friday morning that her committee is looking at the funding ask “very seriously.”
“If the Section 8 voucher goes away, these people will not be able to afford to pay full market value, and if they can’t pay, then they don’t have a place to live,” Scheu said.
The stopgap funding would help local housing authorities offset funding shortfalls and prevent the displacement of families, according to Berk.
The earlier public housing authorities can receive the funding, the more vouchers they can save this calendar year, Mihaly said – hence, lawmakers’ attempt to earmark the funds as part of the mid-year spending bill typically passed in March.
But Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has signaled it wants to hold off and consider the ask as part of the budget for fiscal year 2027, which begins in July.
“[The governor] believes that in the face of federal uncertainty, we should not be appropriating funds without first understanding the full budget picture and weighing all priorities before making those decisions,” said Amanda Wheeler, Scott’s press secretary.
The House Committee on Appropriations is expected to hash out its version of the mid-year spending package over the coming weeks, before the bill is sent to the House floor and then to the Senate.

(Photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  An Iowa-based hot sauce company is suing one of its manufacturers, alleging it turned out bottled products that bubbled, fermented and exploded.
Lola’s Fine Sauces of West Des Moines is suing EcoIdeas Innovation Inc. of Canada, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging it has incurred $700,000 in damages due to Ecoldeas’ breach of contract.
In court filings, Lola’s says that for the past 10 years, it has produced a variety of hot sauces and salsas using fresh and unique ingredients. In the process, the company says, it has grown from a farmer’s market stand to a large company that sells its products throughout the nation at retailers such as Target, Walmart and other grocery stores and supermarkets.

In 2023, Lola’s alleges, it attempted to address growing demand for its product by entering into a contract with EcoIdeas to manufacture “mini bottles” of certain Lola’s sauces for distribution to retailers. EcoIdeas allegedly promised it had the ability to meet Lola’s need for more than 1 million units that met stringent production standards.
Lola’s alleges that in 2024, EcoIdeas breached the contract by failing to prepare labels and products in the manner required. As a result, the lawsuit claims, Walmart was forced to remove defective products from shelves, and Lola’s incurred nearly $155,000 in expenses.
In addition, the lawsuit alleges, there were “issues with defective goods and raw materials that were unusable” due to a failure to follow protocols, resulting in an additional $20,000 in losses.
In 2025, issues allegedly arose with Lola’s Mango Scotch Bonnet products. “Several calls, emails, messages, YouTube videos, and complaints came flooding into Lola’s due to a manufacturing issue in which bottles were bubbling, exploding and fermenting,” the lawsuit claims. “Sauce in several of the bottles also was discolored, and the taste was not in line with Lola’s standards.”
Over the years, some brands of hot sauce are known to have had issues with bottles exploding on shelves due to a buildup of gas caused by fermentation in improperly processed sauces.
In the lawsuit, Lola’s states that it “appears that EcoIdeas failed to fill the bottles at correct temperatures and/or utilize a correct bottle-fill process.” Although those issues did not present any food-safety or health risks, the lawsuit alleges, they significantly affected taste and customer satisfaction.
In total, Lola’s alleges it has suffered reputational harm, plus $700,000 in out-of-pocket costs and product-disposal and shipping fees, and has struggled with retailer chargebacks and lost inventory.
According to the lawsuit, EcoIdeas has acknowledged its breach of contract and promised to take remedial action, such as filing an insurance claim and reimbursing Lola’s for losses, but has failed to follow through.
“EcoIdeas is now claiming it has no insurance coverage,” the lawsuit alleges, and it “has not reimbursed Lola’s for any costs.”
EcoIdeas has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was filed in Polk County District Court before being transferred this week to U.S. District Court. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach company officials or their Iowa attorneys on Thursday.

(Photo by Alexis Bonogofsky/U.S. Fish and WIldlife Service)Calling it an attempt to “prioritize profit over people,” the Gwich’in Steering Committee and twelve conservation groups renewed litigation Tuesday to block the federal government’s oil and gas leasing program in Alaska’s National Wildlife Refuge, one of the last vast, untouched habitats in the United States. 
The lawsuit marks the latest chapter in a decades-old dispute over the refuge’s coastal plain, an undeveloped expanse of roughly 1.5 million acres believed to hold billions of barrels of oil.  The area is also the ancestral homeland of two Indigenous groups long at odds about drilling there.  For the Gwich’in, the tundraland is the center of their creation story — “The Sacred Place Where Life Begins.”  For the Inupiat, who own the surface and mineral rights to a portion of the plain, it represents a  promise of prosperity yet to be fulfilled. 
Tuesday’s filing originates from a 2020 complaint entered during President Trump’s first term when he signed a 2017 tax bill that required two oil and gas lease sales for the area.  Characterized then as a leasing program that “flagrantly breaks the law,” Trustees for Alaska, the firm representing the coalition, temporarily paused litigation to re-draft a plan with Biden-era agencies. That resulted in fewer acres to lease in the refuge and called for a sale to be held in January 2025 which drew zero bids.   
In October, the Trump administration re-adopted the initial program and suggested that another auction would happen as soon as this winter.  Meanwhile, seven oil and gas leases, canceled under Biden, were reinstated to the only entity that currently owns leases — the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the agency that promotes economic development in the state.
The amended lawsuit, in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, now seeks to vacate those leases. 
“AIDEA’s leases were issued unlawfully on a number of grounds, as the Biden Administration acknowledged when cancelling them,” wrote Bridget Psarianos, a senior staff attorney with Trustees for Alaska.  
“The Biden Administration cited violations of the Tax Act as the primary reason for cancelling the leases, the very law that allowed the Leasing Program to be established in the Refuge,” she said in an email Thursday. 
In response to the litigation, AIDEA fired back with a prepared statement on Thursday.  
“Federal law says the Secretary of Interior ‘shall,’ which means ‘must,’ “establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain” read the statement.  
“The Department of Interior simply does not have the ability or authority to refuse to develop the Coastal Plain.”
The groups joining the Gwich’in Steering Committee’s lawsuit  include a roster of environmental organizations based in Alaska, nationally and in Canada. The Alaska Wilderness League, the Sierra Club, and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society-Yukon are each named as plaintiffs. 
Together, they are suing the Interior Department and its secretary, Doug Burgum, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The lawsuit names seven other intervenor defendants, including the State of Alaska, the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, AIDEA and the American Petroleum Corporation, to name a few. 
The debate of whether to drill in the Arctic Refuge has been mired in heated political and legal battles for nearly fifty years. The Gwich’in and Inupiat have long locked horns over the coastal plain. 
Gwich’in beliefs center on a profound, spiritual connection with the Porcupine Caribou Herd that uses the coastal plain, viewing them not just as food, but as integral to Gwich’in identity, culture and survival. 
“The Gwich’in have been fighting–and succeeding–for decades in protecting the calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd,” said Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee in a press release, Tuesday. 
Pro-oil Inupiats, meanwhile, see drilling in the refuge as their sovereign right.  Under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, commonly referred to as ANCSA, which ceded Native land to the state and organized more than 200 tribes as for-profit corporations, part of the idea was that capitalism through natural resource development would create quality-of-life improvements for impoverished villages.
The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which co-owns rights to parts of the greater Prudhoe Bay oilfield, is ANCSA’s most shining example.  In 2024, ASRC earned $5.5 billion in gross revenue, a financial windfall enjoyed by its eight affiliated Alaska Native villages — Kaktovik among them.
“In this modern time, we need the ability to be able to provide jobs and resources for our families,” said Charles Lampe, president of the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. 
The tribal leader and whaling captain said he took issue with Gwich’in interference in Inupiat economic affairs, backed by well-funded nonprofits, and especially by those from outside. He pointed out that Kaktovik is the only settlement situated within the coastal plain. 
“It’s unfortunate the way that our two Indigenous tribes have been pitted against each other,” Lampe said. “And the way they’re using that animal — the caribou — as a reason to push back on our Inupiat people, our Inupiat right to be able to provide an economic future for our community.” 
The Gwich’in Steering Committee did not immediately respond to questions addressing that criticism. 
As temperatures in the Arctic continue to warm far faster than the rest of the planet, the Trump administration has been working to commodify Alaska’s natural resources, opening up previously protected waters to oil and gas drilling, and allowing for other contentious projects, such as the 211-mile-long Ambler road to cut through the fragile foothills of the Brooks Range.  
Among these plans is also the repeated promise to ramp up Arctic drilling.  But oil companies have shown little interest in the last two lease sales. As of now, there has been no public notice for another lease sale. 
For AIDEA’s part, the company was seeking professional support to carry out three-dimensional seismic testing of the refuge’s coastal plain, according to a request for proposals posted last summer with an early August deadline. 
The only available seismic data for the area is dated by three decades and was gathered with less-advanced technology. As a result, no one knows how much crude actually lies beneath the plain, though the U.S. Geological Survey estimates it could be anywhere between four-to-11 billion barrels of oil. A more exact read will require heavy trucks with treads to roll across the snowy tundra sending acoustic signals below to detect oil and gas deposits. 
The Gwich’in and others warn in their amended complaint that the heavy equipment could harm maternal polar bears who make their dens and give birth in the snow along the coastal plain.
In its Thursday statement, AIDEA said the Gwich’in lawsuit “misses the mark.” 
“The Coastal Plain represents an estimated $2.3 billion a year from multiple revenue sources to the State of Alaska and royalties to grow and build the Permanent Fund.  Revenue that would be extremely helpful to the State Treasury,” it said.
The case is before U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason who determined, last year, that the Biden administration did not have the legal authority to cancel AIDEA’s leases.

Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, is proposing that lawmakers take up the issue during next week’s special session, but first he’ll need to pitch it to the Legislative Management committee.
The bill draft mirrors a proposed constitutional ballot measure that could be on the November ballot if supporters gather enough signatures. But while the ballot measure would add the meal program to the state constitution, the bill would add the program to state law, making it easier for lawmakers to adjust if the program becomes unsustainable.

“We need the flexibility for future legislatures in case we hit financially hard times,” Nathe said.
If advanced by Legislative Management, the bill will be introduced and debated by the full Legislature during a special session that begins Wednesday.
The Together for School Meals coalition spearheaded the ballot measure after lawmakers last year rejected two similar bills that aimed to provide free school meals to students. Instead, lawmakers narrowly expanded the number of families that qualify for free or reduced lunch.
The ballot measure would require public schools to provide free breakfast and lunch to students. Private schools, Bureau of Indian Education schools and other tribal schools could opt in to participate in the program. 
North Dakota lawmakers weigh impact of free school meal proposal

Under Nathe’s bill, the state’s free school meals program would start this fall, while the ballot measure would start the program in fall 2027.
The bill has a $65 million appropriation attached to it for the first year, with funding coming from the state Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund. That figure is on par with what the Department of Public Instruction has estimated the program will cost per year, although the agency has said the cost is difficult to project.
“When we come back in January 2027, we’ll have half a school year under our belt and we’ll see what’s working and what’s not working and we can adjust,” Nathe said. “At that time, we’ll figure out the funding going forward for the next biennium.”
Providing free school meals would provide about $1,000 in savings per student for North Dakota families, said Nick Archuleta, president of ND United and a member of the ballot measure sponsoring committee
“This is everything we’ve asked for, for two legislative sessions in a row,” Archuleta said. “We are absolutely going to support the passage of this.”
Previously, Robin Nelson, chair of the sponsoring committee, said the group remains cautiously optimistic about Nathe’s bill, but will move forward with signature gathering for the proposed ballot measure.
Legislative Management meets at 1 p.m. Tuesday to discuss the school meal proposal and other bills lawmakers plan to pitch for the special session. Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, who chairs that committee, has previously said he is not in favor of relitigating issues the Legislature debated last session.
If the committee does not advance a bill, a lawmaker could still attempt to introduce it from the Senate or House floor. The bill would need support from at least two-thirds of the members to be introduced.

Greg Gianforte formally requested a presidential major disaster declaration this week for a windstorm late last year.
The windstorm impacted most of the state, toppling trees and powerlines, blocking roads and generally creating hazardous driving conditions. The winds lasted for hours, as winds from the upper atmosphere blasted the state, with some areas just beginning the early recovery process from devastating floods.
Some schools also lost their roof in the storm, five in all, Gianforte said in a press release. And in one of those schools, vermiculite asbestos was found.
In a press release from his office, Gianforte stated the ask from the federal government for windstorm damages is $6.5 million. Flooding in western Montana, which Gianforte also asked for a separate presidential disaster declaration on Jan. 9, totaled almost $10 million.
“The totality of impact from the most detrimental windstorm in 30 years is estimated to be $13.3 million,” Gianforte said in a press release. “Damages, response, and recovery efforts impacted 45 of 56 Montana Counties, five of seven Tribal Nations including one with significant water system damages, five school districts, and 19 of 25 Rural Electrical Cooperatives. Damage from the storm is spread across 80 percent of Montana.”
Gianforte went on to say the damage was “unparalleled for this time of year.”

A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, as well as Democrats in Santa Fe, are calling on the Legislature to pass additional immigrant protection measures during the session beginning Jan. 20, 2026. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)A group of eight New Mexico immigrant advocacy groups say they’ll push the Legislature to expand data privacy protections and increase funding for services during the session beginning Tuesday. 
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office has said the governor will include for consideration a proposal banning public entities from enabling immigrant detention during the 30-day session, which is otherwise focused primarily on passing the state budget. 
Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos said in a news release this week that they support the detention measure, known as the “Immigrant Safety Act.” 
“The Immigrant Safety Act is a critical step to protect New Mexican families by closing existing gaps in state law and prohibiting new detention contracts,” the groups said in a statement. 
But they are also calling on lawmakers to go farther to protect immigrants. They released a platform in English and Spanish calling on the Legislature to restrict the sharing of license plate data; make permanent the existing Office of New Americans; expand funds for immigrant legal services; and expand workforce development opportunities for immigrants. 
NM governor will include proposed ban on immigrant detention on legislative agenda

Groups comprising the “New Mexico Immigration Legislation Working Group” include Contigo Immigrant Justice, the Semilla Project, Semilla Action, CAFé Accion and the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, along with the ACLU and El Centro. 
“During these unprecedented times of uncertainty and growing challenges for immigrant communities, it is essential that we work together to promote safety, expand opportunity, and support our families across New Mexico,” the groups said in a statement. 
On Friday, the Democratic Party of Santa Fe endorsed a similar platform, including a “New Mexico Driver Safety and Privacy Act” that the party says would ensure people “residing in New Mexico and engaged in lawful and constitutionally protected activities would not have their private and confidential information shared with any agency seeking to detain or deport them.” 
Earlier this week, New Mexico Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) pre-filed legislation that sought to provide “limitations on the sharing of automated license plate reader information and requiring reporting,” according to the bill description. 
The bill text was not immediately available, House Democratic leaders said during a news conference Friday, but they said they are pushing for the legislation. 
By the #s: See where the New Mexico governor, Legislature disagree on $11B in budget priorities

The advocacy groups said the state currently has “no limits” on automatic license plate reader technology, which means outside organizations including the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency can access it. 
So they called on the Legislature to pass a bill that “would establish guardrails so surveillance data cannot be misused against immigrants, patients seeking medical care, or protesters,” the coalition said in a statement. “The Legislature must adopt these protections to safeguard privacy and prevent federal overreach.”
Regarding the immigrant detention legislation, Democrats in the majority have said they have reached a consensus on the bill and are hoping to pass the “Immigrant Safety Act” within the first two weeks of the session. 
But Republicans said Thursday they oppose the legislation that they said would undermine federal immigration law and also would devastate local economies. 
“The only outcome of ‘banning’ ICE Detention Facilities in New Mexico would be the destruction of New Mexico jobs and economic support for local communities,” Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said in a statement. “Furthermore, by disrupting the enforcement of federal law with this virtue-signaling, Democrat lawmakers would enable violent criminals, who are in the United States illegally, the ability to continue terrorizing our neighborhoods.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9797-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

Legislation introduced Wednesday by Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican, would repeal the 2002 law that created the Mr. Potato Head […]","The Rhode Island Community Food Bank’s charity Mr. Potato Head license plate has been in production since 2002. It could come to an end under legislation filed in response to Hasbro’s plan to move out of the Ocean State. (Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles)As Pawtucket-based Hasbro Inc. makes its move to Boston later this year, one Rhode Island lawmaker thinks the state should stop issuing new license plates featuring one of the company’s most iconic toys.
Legislation introduced Wednesday by Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican, would repeal the 2002 law that created the Mr. Potato Head plates to commemorate the toy’s 50th anniversary and raise money for the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.
Newberry told Rhode Island Current Friday that repealing future production of the plates is “a matter of self-respect” for the state. 
Hasbro to move to Boston Seaport by end of 2026

“Hasbro has abandoned Rhode Island and there’s no reason we should be advertising their products on our license plates,” Newberry said. “It’s as simple as that — to make a point.”
The toymaker announced last September that it would move to Boston’s Seaport by the end of 2026 to the dismay of state leaders who scrambled to put together a counteroffer to try to keep Hasbro and its 1,000-member workforce in the Ocean State. They tried to entice the company to buy a prime piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1.
The 765 drivers who still have the special plates affixed to their vehicles would be able to keep them, Newberry noted. But their plates would not be allowed to be transferred to other vehicles, according to the legislation.
Newberry’s bill was referred to the House Committee Special Legislation, which has not yet scheduled a hearing on the proposal. 
As of this year, the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles issues 17 different charity license plate designs, ranging from shortfin mako sharks promoting the Atlantic Shark Institute to a Rose Island Lighthouse graphic featuring the Claiborne Pell Bridge — a design the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association named the world’s best last year.
State law authorizes the DMV to issue the charity plates after obtaining 600 pre-orders within five years of their creation by the state. 
“Some groups never reach the production minimum and their plate design option is pulled,” Paul Grimaldi, a spokesperson for the DMV said in an email.
But the only way to get an already-in production plate out of production is for the General Assembly to pull the plug— a power even the DMV hasn’t seen before.
“To the best of our knowledge this is the first time authorization for a plate that’s been issued would be repealed,” Grimaldi wrote.
Launched in 2002, the plates which say “Help End Hunger,” cost $43.50 to purchase. Half of the proceeds go to the DMV, while the rest go to the food bank.
Since its introduction over two decades ago, sales of the license plates have raised more than $60,000 for the Providence-based nonprofit — most of which came in the first few years of the plates’ existence, food bank spokesperson Kate MacDonald said.
“It was at a time when Mr. Potato Head was popping up everywhere!” she said in an email. “It hasn’t been as popular in the last few years.”
MacDonald declined to comment on Newberry’s legislation, but understands the negative feelings toward Hasbro after the company announced in September it would abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots after months of speculation about the company’s future in the Ocean State.
Should state leaders adopt Newberry’s repeal, MacDonald said the food bank is open to a new charity plate design. Newberry already had one in mind.
“Let’s come up with one with the Big Blue Bug,” he said, referring to Nibbles Woodaway, the giant termite mascot of Big Blue Bug Solutions on Interstate 95 in Providence.

Una victoria reciente puso fin a un despliegue de la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
A finales de diciembre, la situación cambió radicalmente en contra de la decisión de la administración Trump de desplegar la Guardia Nacional en tres estados, a pesar de las objeciones de sus gobernadores, incluido el de California.
 En primer lugar, el 23 de diciembre, la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos falló a favor de Illinois en su intento de impedir que Trump enviara la Guardia Nacional a Chicago como parte de su ofensiva contra la inmigración. El tribunal rechazó el mismo razonamiento legal que Trump utilizó para federalizar y desplegar la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles el verano pasado cuando estallaron las protestas allí.
“El gobierno no ha cumplido con su carga de demostrar que (la ley) permite al Presidente federalizar la Guardia en el ejercicio de la autoridad inherente para proteger al personal y la propiedad federal en Illinois”, se lee en la orden de la Corte Suprema.
 Luego, la administración retiró discretamente su apelación contra la decisión de un tribunal federal que establecía que el presidente no podía mantener a las tropas de la Guardia Nacional de California bajo control federal a perpetuidad. Esta retirada representó una victoria para el fiscal general de California, Rob Bonta, quien había presentado un escrito amicus curiae en el caso de Illinois.
 “La ley se desarrolló de tal manera que evitará que lo ocurrido en los últimos seis meses se repita”, dijo Bonta. “Creo que esta puerta está cerrada para Trump”.
 CalMatters habló con Bonta esta semana sobre estos casos y su opinión sobre el enfoque actual de la administración Trump en Minneapolis . La entrevista ha sido ligeramente editada para mayor claridad.
CalMatters: En términos de lo que el estado de California hará a continuación sobre este tema, ¿hay algo que estén haciendo en preparación para tal vez que (las redadas de inmigración a gran escala) regresen, o tal vez una escalada en tácticas como las que estamos viendo en Minnesota?
 Bonta: Estamos preparados para cualquier cosa. Creo que cuando se ven incidentes como los de Minnesota, hay que asumir que podría ocurrir aquí en California.
Ya saben, la administración Trump no ha ocultado nada. Van tras los estados demócratas, y solo a por ellos. Y es político, es instrumentalización, es partidista. Intentan controlar a los liberales y a los demócratas. Esa es su razón de ser. Y, sobre todo, el estado más grande del país, que ha rechazado a Trump tres veces durante su campaña, le molesta, no le gusta.
 CalMatters: En Los Ángeles, no recuerdo que fueran puerta por puerta para intentar atrapar gente como vemos en Minnesota. ¿Es esto una escalada?
Bonta: Creo que están escalando. Minnesota muestra que parece haber una escalada. O sea, hubo algunos momentos similares, horribles, aterradores, traumatizantes e inapropiados, como quitar las placas de matrícula, usar camiones de mudanzas, llegar a un Home Depot y ver a la gente salir corriendo por la parte trasera, y toda la discriminación racial (racial profiling) que se estaba cometiendo.
 Creo que es una escalada, y están haciendo más. Están intentando atacar duramente a Minneapolis y Minnesota. Es el hogar del candidato a la vicepresidencia que compitió contra Trump, ¿verdad? Es el lugar donde su racismo se manifiesta plenamente con sus ataques a los somalíes. Es donde el YouTuber intentaba insinuar que había guarderías sin niños y que había algo inapropiado en lo que mostraba.
 Minnesota es un objetivo importante ahora mismo. California siempre lo ha sido, y creo que nos volverán a poner en la mira en algún momento, y estaremos preparados.

 CalMatters: ¿Qué pasó en la Corte Suprema?
 Bonta: La Corte Suprema intervino y básicamente dijo que la teoría sobre la que el presidente había estado operando todo este tiempo era completamente ilegal y sin fundamento, realmente una bofetada en la cara y una pérdida vergonzosa y devastadora para Trump, quien cree que siempre puede acudir a la Corte Suprema y obtener lo que quiere.
 Y cumplieron la ley, la ley que, según argumentamos, siempre se aplicó, y que no tenían autoridad para desplegar al ejército, que las “fuerzas regulares” incluían a las fuerzas militares. No se analizó su incapacidad para ejecutar la ley, y que ni siquiera tenían autoridad para ejecutar ninguna ley, dada la Ley Posse Comitatus (que impide al presidente utilizar al ejército como fuerza policial nacional). Así que fue una derrota devastadora e impactante para Trump.
 CalMatters: El Tribunal de Apelaciones del Noveno Circuito de EE. UU. autorizó al gobierno de Trump a desplegar la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles en junio, pero emitió un fallo diferente seis meses después. El razonamiento del juez de distrito fue que Trump no podía refederalizar las tropas indefinidamente.
 Pero ¿eso le indica que si las condiciones materiales en Los Ángeles cambiaran, como lo mencionó la administración Trump en junio cuando afirmó que los manifestantes estaban cometiendo actos violentos contra personal y propiedad federal, la administración Trump podría autorizar un nuevo despliegue? ¿Es así como lo entiende, o me equivoco?
Bonta: Creo que estás equivocado, pero no creo que sea algo descabellado decirlo. Déjame explicarte mi razonamiento.
En el caso de Los Ángeles, en junio, fue el primero en todo el país, y el ejercicio de la autoridad de la administración federal aquí, al desplegar las fuerzas armadas, implica una gran deferencia. Creo que se demostró esa deferencia. Fue el primer caso. Hubo protestas mayoritariamente pacíficas, pero también hubo violencia, como se acaba de mencionar.
 Era la primera vez que veían lo que la administración Trump estaba haciendo aquí.
Y luego lo volvieron a ver en Washington D. C. Luego lo volvieron a ver en Portland, y lo volvieron a ver en Illinois. Los jueces vieron lo que estaba sucediendo, lo que se decía y la justificación. Vieron cómo Trump dijo que Portland era una zona de guerra cuando era una ciudad pacífica. Vieron cómo Trump dice: ‘Voy a usar a los militares para hacer precisamente lo que prohíbe la Ley Posse Comitatus, para hacer cumplir la ley penal, porque estas ciudades demócratas no están tomando medidas enérgicas contra la delincuencia’. ¡Justamente lo que los militares no pueden hacer!
Y entonces vieron lo que estaba haciendo con los militares y creo que se hicieron una idea de hacia dónde se dirigía realmente esto y de lo que estaba sucediendo aquí. … Así que ahora que la Corte Suprema de los EE. UU. ha dicho que hay que asegurarse de que las ‘fuerzas regulares’ sean fuerzas militares, hay que demostrar que todas las fuerzas militares no pueden impedir que se lance el bloque de hormigón ni el cóctel molotov (nunca podrá demostrarlo), entonces se puede recurrir a la Guardia Nacional.
 CalMatters: Solo una acotación al respecto. Dadas las circunstancias actuales, si se repitiera lo ocurrido en junio, ¿sería diferente la conversación si las condiciones materiales sobre el terreno cambiaran en Los Ángeles?
 Bonta: Sí, totalmente diferente. Acudiríamos a los tribunales de inmediato, ganaríamos, obtendríamos una orden judicial y el Noveno Circuito la ratificaría. Porque no habría pruebas de que las fuerzas armadas, todas las fuerzas armadas —es decir, miles de militares, hay múltiples bases militares en California— no pudieran impedir que una sola persona lanzara concreto. Creo que nuestras fuerzas armadas son plenamente capaces de eso.
 Entonces, las mismas circunstancias exactas de junio ocurren hoy, el 9º Circuito lo confirma y no lo suspende.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523
,DC,2026-01-16 21:05:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The 5 biggest legal fights in the first year of Trump’s mass deportation push,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/5-biggest-legal-fights-first-year-trumps-mass-deportation-push,,"WASHINGTON — The first year of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House was defined by clashes with the judiciary branch, as the president and his administration pushed forward with an aggressive immigration agenda.In the past year, the Trump administration has aimed to drastically change immigration policy in the United States, including by stripping millions of immigrants of their legal status and attempting to redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.  The moves have often run directly against the judiciary branch. Federal judges briefly stalled the Trump administration’s plans to deploy the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, for immigration enforcement. They also blocked the invocation of an archaic wartime law to expel immigrants from the country — a move that raised concerns, all the way up to the Supreme Court, about skirting the due process rights of immigrants.In response, the president for the last year frequently battled with federal judges, such as in June, when the Justice Department sued all judges in federal court in Maryland over a two-day pause in deportations to ensure due process rights for immigrants.Trump also fixated on certain judges that put his policies on hold, such as the District of Columbia’s Chief Judge James Emanuel Boasberg.Boasberg blocked the Trump administration from deporting certain immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and ordered the return of deportation flights that, despite his restraining order, still landed at a brutal prison in El Salvador. Trump’s singling out of Boasberg in late March, and calling for his impeachment, prompted a rare rebuke from conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.But the Supreme Court has often handed wins to the Trump administration on numerous emergency appeals. The high court allowed for deportations of immigrants to countries they have no ties to, referred to as third-country removals, and allowed the use of race in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The president has found himself at odds with a range of groups in response to his harsh immigration policy.A group of Quakers sued the Department of Homeland Security after officials removed a so-called sensitive locations policy that limited immigration enforcement in places of worship. The Trump administration also faced backlash in its attempt to quickly deport Guatemalan children in the middle of the night, where a Trump nominated judge said the Department of Justice’s arguments for the move “crumbled like a house of cards.”Out of the dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, here are the five most significant court cases related to the president’s immigration policies:Alien Enemies ActLast March, two deportation planes carrying immigrants removed under an 18th-century wartime law were ordered to return to the U.S. by Boasberg, chief judge for the District Court for the District of Columbia. But the planes still landed in El Salvador, and 137 Venezuelan men were sent to a brutal prison known as CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The wartime law would apply to any Venezuelan national 14 and older who was suspected of being a member of the Tren de Aragua gang. Boasberg then spent months probing whether Trump officials defied his order to turn the planes around. Last month, he concluded that the deportations were illegal and carried out in defiance of his order.The 137 Venezuelan men were eventually released from CECOT last summer through a prisoner exchange. Boasberg determined that even though the men are no longer imprisoned, they still need to be afforded their due process rights and he ordered the Trump administration to propose a way to afford those due process rights. In the latest major development, last month he directed the administration to create a plan on how to do that, such as providing some form of video interview before an immigration judge. The Trump administration has argued because of the U.S. military operations to extract Venezuela's president from the county, the situation is fluid, and they cannot provide a timeline for complying with Boasberg's order from last month. The Justice Department’s most recent filing, from Jan. 12, objects to the court's order to facilitate remote due process hearings, and “given the current political instability in Venezuela, there is a serious risk of intentional interference with remote proceedings.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio also submitted a Jan. 12 declaration to the court, saying that “introducing the matter of the disposition of the 137 class members into these discussions at this time would risk material damage to U.S. foreign policy interests in Venezuela.” He added that the U.S. does not know where the 137 Venezuelan men are. “Given the passage of time, the U.S. government does not know—nor does it have any way of knowing—the whereabouts of class members, including whether anyone has departed Venezuela or whether the regime subsequently took anyone back into custody,” Rubio said. Kilmar Abrego GarciaThe wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and longtime Maryland man, cast a national spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia’s case has highlighted the Trump administration's appetite for mass deportations. The case started last March in the District Court of the District of Maryland, after Trump officials mistakenly removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite removal protections placed by an immigration judge in 2019 because it was likely Abrego Garcia would face violence if returned to his home country. But in March, Abrego Garcia was placed on a plane, along with Venezuelans removed under the Alien Enemies Act, to the brutal El Salvador mega-prison known as CECOT.Federal Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, but the Trump administration took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that it could not force another government to comply with the U.S.The Supreme Court sided with Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of ordering his return.   Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. several months later to face a criminal indictment in Tennessee over allegations of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and another federal judge has found cause that the Justice Department brought the indictment in a vindictive move against Abrego Garcia.Since his return, Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at CECOT. The Trump administration has also tried to remove him to a country to which he has no ties because of the 2019 removal protections.Trump officials re-detained Abrego Garcia and have tried to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia, despite Costa Rica’s willingness to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and his willingness to go. For that reason, Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia’s release from an ICE facility in Pennsylvania and barred the Trump administration from re-detaining him. She is currently overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. A Jan. 14 hearing was the most recent development in Abrego Garcia’s case. There, Xinis briefly conferred with his lawyers and Department of Justice attorneys regarding the timing of a final order of removal for Abrego Garcia was issued — the question was whether it was in 2019 or January 2025. The timing of the order of removal could determine whether the Trump administration can re-detain Abrego Garcia for removal. Xinis in December ordered Abrego Garcia’s release, because she determined the Trump administration was unlawfully detaining him and said ICE failed repeatedly to show a final order of removal existed.Xinis said she plans to make a final decision in Abrego Garcia’s case by Feb. 12.Birthright CitizenshipOne of Trump’s first executive orders he signed on Inauguration Day was ending the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status. There is a small carve-out for the children born of diplomats. If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship and it would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.In response to Trump’s executive order, multiple lawsuits were filed and lower courts across the country have granted preliminary injunctions against the order. One of the challenges to birthright citizenship, brought by Democratic attorneys general, made its way to the Supreme Court, but the Trump administration asked the justices to weigh in on the issue of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts, rather than the merits of birthright citizenship. The justices decided on an order that limited nationwide injunctions, such as class action suits. The merits of birthright citizenship are now before the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear oral arguments in February. That birthright citizenship case is Barbara v. Trump, which stems from a case in New Hampshire. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to bar the executive order from taking effect against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025. Those children would have been denied citizenship under the president's executive order.  Lawmakers’ Access to ICE Facilities As the Trump administration continues with aggressive immigration enforcement and detention, one of the few tools Democrats have, as the minority party, is oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. More than 60,000 immigrants are detained across various ICE facilities in the country, and Democrats argue they need access to conduct oversight at the facilities. Under a 2019 appropriations law, any lawmaker can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants. But after several Democrats were denied access to ICE facilities in July, due to a policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice, a dozen House Democrats sued. Last month, a federal judge granted the lawmakers' request to stay the new policy by Noem. But after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to an ICE facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Democrats were back in court Jan. 14.Noem required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year. The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.Democrats who sued include: Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.Expanded Use of Expedited Removal A pillar of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign is the expanded use of expedited removal. The Trump policy allows the removal of immigrants through the interior of the country without an appearance before an immigration judge.In March, immigration advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, arguing it stripped due process rights of immigrants. In August, the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a stay in the policy, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using it. The Department of Justice appealed, and in September a panel of appellate judges denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the lower courts’ stay. Most recently, in December, the Trump administration defended the merits of its fast-track deportation policy before a panel of judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Department of Justice argued that immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years without legal authorization are not guaranteed due process.",,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)The First District Court of Appeal is looking to fill a seat — the one vacated by Adam Tanenbaum, who was elevated this week to the Florida Supreme Court by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The First District, located in Tallahassee, is the most important state court aside from the Supreme Court itself, as it adjudicates cases arising from state law and policy, such as the high-profile redistricting case Byrd v. Black Voters Matter.
Applicants must live within the jurisdiction of the court and have been a member of the Florida Bar for the preceding 10 years.
The Judicial Nominating Commission is accepting applications until Feb. 9. The commission will meet next month to review applications and schedule interviews. The group then meets and vets candidates to create a group of candidates to advance to the governor. The governor then gets to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
There are 13 seats on the court.
The court now consists of Chief Judge Timothy Osterhaus and judges Joseph Lewis Jr., L. Clayton Roberts, Lori S. Rowe, Stephanie W. Ray, Ross L. Bilbrey, Susan L. Kelsey, Thomas D. Winokur, Kemmerly Thomas, Rachel E. Nordby, Robert E. Long Jr., and Raymond F. Treadwell.

Andrea Hunley, the Indiana Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, isn’t seeking reelection this year amid speculation that she’ll be a 2027 candidate for Indianapolis mayor.
Hunley announced Friday she would give up her Senate seat, becoming the fourth state senator to say this will be their final legislative session.
At least six Indiana House members also won’t be seeking new terms, with the latest decision coming from Republican Rep. Brad Barrett of Richmond, who is chair of the House Public Health Committee.
Hunley is the Senate’s assistant minority leader after winning election in 2022 from a heavily Democratic district covering much of central Marion County.
Hunley, a former teacher and school principal, said she would complete her Senate term that runs until November. Hunley did not address talk of a mayoral campaign although her statement said she “continues to discern how she will be called to serve next.”
“While my role may change, my commitment to this work will not, “ she said in the statement. “Our city needs bold leadership to be a world class destination for people to work, play, study, and stay. I am not going anywhere.”
Although Democratic Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett hasn’t said whether he’ll seek a fourth term in the 2027 election, former City-County Council President Vop Osili announced this week he was running for mayor.
Other incumbent decisions

Less than a week later, the window closed on open enrollment for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, without any extension of the federal tax credits that made those plans affordable for thousands of Vermonters.
It’s no secret that Roberts assumes the role as the health care industry — and her new employer, specifically — faces dire straits.

BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont has faced serious risks to its solvency and intensely butted heads with Vermont’s main hospital system. All the while, Vermonters face some of the highest health care costs in the country. 
In an interview with VTDigger, Roberts said she was optimistic she will turn a new page on affordability in the state. 
“My career has been built on running towards the fire,” she said. “Even though it’s in a very complicated state right here, and health care is in a complicated way right now, I think there’s a lot of great work that can be done.” 
Prior to joining BlueCross BlueShield, Roberts worked as president of the Beth Israel Lahey Health Performance Network, a Boston-area health care provider. Prior to that, she built her career in health insurance groups across New England, including 20 years working at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. 
During her time at Beth Israel Lahey, she worked on negotiating contracts between the hospitals and health insurers — something that’s primed her, she said, for a healthier collaboration with the University of Vermont Health network. In negotiating past contracts and rates, the insurer and hospital network have had an “ongoing adversarial relationship,” as a state-appointed liaison described it, in part over the costs of care for patients covered by BlueCross BlueShield.
In October, the health network gained new leadership under Steve Leffler, who was officially named CEO in January after serving as interim following former CEO Sunny Eappen’s decision to step down in the fall.
Roberts joined BlueCross BlueShield on Nov. 10, and worked with outgoing president and CEO Don George to transfer responsibilities during the two months they overlapped.
Both of the new leaders at UVM and BlueCross negotiated the new contract for 2026. The outcome was “a better deal than what was expected,” Roberts said, though she did not elaborate further. That work has been a primary piece of Roberts’ first few months in the role.
“I think there was a strong desire by both BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont and UVM Health network to do something different,” she said. 
She sees more room for cooperation with the state’s hospitals, beyond UVM, like trying to “cut down the noise” and streamline policies across providers and insurers, so that there is less time spent tailoring rates for specific plans and providers. She also noted that the hospitals and insurers can share resources better — things like care managers and quality experts that each entity has. 
Both the hospital and the insurer are facing the loss of federal enhanced premium tax credits, the subsidies that made plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace actually affordable for thousands of Vermonters. 
Early data from the Department of Vermont Health Access shows that more than 2,000 people across the state unenrolled from those marketplace plans (including BlueCross BlueShield and MVP Health Care). 
Roberts said she is working on finding affordable pathways for those who have lost these subsidies. 
She said the insurer is working with Vermont legislators and the regulator to find “wiggle room” in what the plans cover, to make them less expensive. 
She is also exploring whether there is appetite for less expensive plans that cover preventative, wellness care and catastrophic care, without as much coverage for some standard care types that fall in the middle of that range of coverage.
“Affordable” has become something of a buzzword in the Vermont health care space — and Roberts is no exception to that. But she said she’s also added a new adjective to the mix: sustainable. 
She knows that bringing down premium costs in Vermont and making care affordable again is going to take a long, sustained effort. 
“We are so far off the mark on affordability in Vermont, with (spending on healthcare) being 19.6% of household income,” she said. “It is going to take a lot of years to get from the 19.6% to a more reasonable level, so we have to keep our eye on that frame for a duration of time before we can shift down.”

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Retaliatory tariffs could have harsh economic consequences for North Carolina’s agricultural sector, according to a new report from the John Locke Foundation.
Over the past year, President Donald Trump has raised tariffs on foreign imports to the U.S. Major trade partners like the European Union, China and Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs in response, leading to trade wars and increased prices across the board.
“How Tariffs Threaten North Carolina Agriculture: NC Farmers at Risk,” authored by Jeffrey Dorfman at North Carolina State University, estimates the tariffs could cost the state’s farmers about $695 million.
This figure represents roughly a third of average net farm income in North Carolina.
“Such a contraction would lead to a total of roughly 8,000 lost jobs, both directly in the agriculture industry along with the ripple effects from that lost revenue,” Dorfman wrote. “The job losses would be concentrated in North Carolina’s rural communities.”
Other indirect effects on the state’s rural economy would result in an additional $1.2 billion in estimated revenue losses, Dorfman wrote. This brings the potential total economic losses as a result of trade policy retaliation to $1.9 billion, which is more than 2% of North Carolina’s gross state product.
Donald Bryson, CEO of the Locke Foundation, a free-market think tank, said the organization commissioned the study because it has become increasingly concerned about the effect of recent agricultural policies on the state’s food supply chain.
“We are an export-dependent state,” he said. “Agriculture is the largest sector of North Carolina’s economy, and we wanted to know how this is going to be affected by the tariff regime.”
North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said tariffs are often difficult to quantify because a lot depends on short-term versus long-term impacts.
Troxler said they’re usually used as bargaining tools.
“If tariffs result in a more open market, that can be beneficial in the long term, but when it gets into a trade war, it does do harm in the short term,” Troxler said in a statement to NC Newsline. “It’s hard to paint tariffs with just one paintbrush.”
North Carolina ranks 15th in the country for exports and 13th for imports by dollar value. It’s also eighth for total gross farm sales of crops and livestock — especially poultry and hogs.
Farmers in the state have a limited set of options for minimizing damage from agricultural exports, Dorfman wrote. These include looking for new markets and focusing on domestic trade.
“Still, while all these are worth pursuing, they are not likely to be sufficient — especially in the short run — to mitigate the risks North Carolina farmers currently face from a potentially damaging tariff regime,” the report read.
The U.S. exported $24.5 billion worth of soybeans in 2024, with China, Mexico, and the EU as the top markets. North Carolina contributes heavily to soybean production.
Soybeans are the U.S.’s top agricultural export, but North Carolina soybeans are rarely exported; instead, they are used domestically to feed local pigs, chickens and turkeys.
Although the state’s soybeans go almost exclusively to animal feed, they are not protected from the risks of trade policy retaliation, Dorfman wrote. China chose not to buy American soybeans for much of 2025, causing the domestic supply of soybeans to soar and lowering their price in U.S. markets.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0628-scaled-e1768596460674-1024x758.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)DETROIT – U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens said Friday that the federal government’s most controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement deployments have happened in cities without input from local officials who don’t want or need their assistance with law enforcement activities.
Stevens, who was in Detroit on Friday to detail a new minority-focused policy initiative in her campaign for the U.S. Senate, spoke to Michigan Advance following the event to talk about her campaign and other pressing topics in national and state politics.
On ICE and its recent flurry of activity in Minneapolis, which led to the shooting death of an American citizen, Stevens said President Donald Trump’s iteration of the agency has by and large circumvented state and local law enforcement, in effect escalating tensions that already existed between activists and ICE as it slides into alarmingly authoritarian behavior.
She said time and again, local officials have pleaded with the administration not to take these actions, as it “will only escalate tension and make things worse.”
Stevens said with Trump now toying with invoking the Insurrection Act to prevent activists from tracking ICE activities and to end the resistance brewing against the agency, she has introduced legislation to close loopholes that allows him to do so.
“Trump has deployed a mismanaged federal agency into a city, in a neighborhood,” Stevens said, adding that whether it’s in Minnesota or here in Michigan, local officials need to be heard.
“I know how deeply important that is,” Stevens said.

Trump has in the last week threatened to cut funding to any state with openly defiant sanctuary city policies, and the impact in Michigan remains unknown. The U.S. Department of Justice has only identified one city in Michigan — East Lansing — as being designated as a sanctuary city for immigrants seeking refuge from federal enforcement.
That list is longer, however, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank. The group lists six Michigan counties — Kalamazoo, Leelanau, Muskegon, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties —as having some level of sanctuary policies.
The president has also made references to sending ICE or other federalized National Guard troops to Detroit, but officials have rebuffed that notion, noting that Detroit was not a sanctuary city. Still, that hasn’t stopped Republicans in the state and on the national stage from setting their sights on Detroit as another test for Trump’s incursions into states with federal forces.
In the case of Minnesota, some have called on Gov. Tim Walz to deploy the state’s National Guard troops as a hedge between federal ICE and Border Patrol agents and citizens, both to cool down tensions but to also prevent ICE from abusing its authority by targeting U.S. citizens with violence or unlawful arrests.
The Advance asked Stevens if she would support Gov. Gretchen Whitmer potentially doing the same if Trump decided to unleash ICE in Detroit or elsewhere in the state, and especially if ICE activity rises to the level of chaos in Michigan as it has in Minnesota.
“I think Gov. Whitmer has a tremendous track record of safety and security,” Stevens said. “We saw her leadership through the COVID-19 pandemic, and I have full faith and trust in her ability to keep Michiganders safe.”
On congressional softness against Trump, Stevens said she’s fighting back
One key source of frustration for Democrats and those who oppose Trump’s most hardline policies is that members of Congress in both chambers have done little to push back against the administrations and its worst abuses of power.
Stevens said she was not part of that camp.
“I’m very eager to call out the abuses of power we’re seeing in communities, particularly the mismanaged ICE that has brought a lot of chaos and concern,” Stevens said. “I’m hearing directly from Michiganders and, frankly, I am so frustrated and upset about what’s happening before our eyes.”
Despite accepting corporate PAC money, Stevens insists she can’t be bought
As Stevens continues her campaign for the U.S. Senate as the race’s frontrunner, up against state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former health official Abdul El-Sayed, of Detroit, she faces continued criticisms from being the only Democrat in the race to have not sworn off corporate donations.
Progressives looking for a candidate to support may very well skip on Stevens due to her acceptance of corporate dollars and also her stance on the war in Gaza and ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people — Stevens is a staunch supporter of Israel but has called for a meaningful ceasefire and an end to the war.
The Advance asked Stevens if she is worried that those corporate dollars will be an anchor to her campaign as activists and her opponents continue to note those dollars in her coffers.
Stevens turned her attention not to her opponents, but rather the leading Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake.
“Mike Rogers says that he wants to rubber stamp Donald Trump. That’s going to be the agenda that is going to continue to increase costs and wreak havoc on our economy, like we’ve seen playing out,” Stevens said. “I can’t be bought. I’m the only person in this race who is not a millionaire. My record speaks for itself, and that’s a record of voting for comprehensive campaign finance reform as a House member and seeing it blocked by the Senate. And that is one of the reasons why I’m running for the United States Senate, to see us actually get comprehensive campaign finance reform done.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7010-scaled-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(CRMC File No. 2025-06-048)A Jamestown oyster farm is poised for expansion, after receiving unanimous approval from the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council on Tuesday.
The council’s swift stamp of approval lets Rocky Rhode Oyster Co. owner Brad Boehringer add 3.5 acres to his existing, 7.8-acre oyster farm in Jamestown’s Dutch Island Harbor.
The uncontested review was an anomaly in the increasingly contentious debate between oyster farmers, fishermen and coastal residents warring over use and views of state coastal waterways. Rhode Island’s aquaculture boom has spawned public protests, late-night hearings and lawsuits, with protracted regulatory reviews that, in some cases, span years. 
It helped that Boehringer’s existing expanse of oyster cases, 900 feet off the western shore off Dutch Island Harbor, falls within an area already designated by town and state officials for aquaculture use. 
Rocky Rhode is one of six aquaculture farms covering a combined 35 acres within a 90-acre area in Dutch Island Harbor designated for aquaculture use, according to a 2024 report. The report helped inform a working group of town officials and state environmental administrators in developing rules and regulations for future aquaculture development in the area. 
Boehringer’s southwest expansion aims to meet increasing commercial demand, enabling Boehringer to keep his eight seasonal residents employed year-round and boost production to reach 1 million oysters and 100,000 scallops a year, according to his June 2025 application. He already produces and harvests enough shellfish to service 45 area restaurants and five regional wholesales.
The 3.5-acre addition, a mix of bottom cages and floating baskets, received positive recommendations from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, the Rhode Island Marine Fisheries Council, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the CRMC staff report. 
A preliminary application reviewed by the Jamestown Harbor Commission in December 2024 also revealed “very few issues,” Benjamin Goetsch, CRMC aquaculture coordinator, wrote in the Dec. 15 report. In fact, the expansion could have been approved by staff, without a public hearing or review by the politically appointed council, if it weren’t for two written letters of objection.
The letters, both from seasonal Jamestown residents, laid out concerns with debris and sand filling from the expanded aquaculture activity, and potential conflicts with area sailing activity. The objectors did not attend the hearing on Tuesday.
Goetsch’s report refuted each of these claims, noting that all human activity on or near the water could create debris, and that the Coast Guard had already indicated no navigational interference.
Boehringer told the council Tuesday that he had a “very good working relationship” with the Conanicut Island Sailing Foundation, which is the primary group of sailors in the area. 
New non-rusting oyster cages avoid the risk that pieces chip off and collect in the water – a problem of older versions of the equipment no longer in use, Boehringer said.
The CRMC’s approval requires any lost gear or equipment be retrieved within 30 days. Boehringer will also have to put up a $40,000 performance bond to cover potential costs associated with gear removal or abandonment.
Boehringer declined to comment on the council’s decision when reached by email on Wednesday.

But at this point, they haven’t landed on a united path forward.
Last week, Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly introduced three articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has defended the confrontational actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents.

Other Democrats have called for investigations, and reforms, cutting funding for immigration enforcement, or abolishing ICE altogether. 
But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office. Rep. Summer Lee, was among the first co-sponsors on the impeachment articles, while Chris Deluzio, who represents the broader Pittsburgh area, committed to adding his name to the co-sponsors, according to a spokesperson.
More than a week ago, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, as she tried to drive away from agents.

Footage of the shooting and the moments proceeding it went viral, stoking outrage and focusing the nation’s attention on the Trump administration’s militarized deportation campaign. But views among lawmakers split largely along partisan lines over whether the agent, who walked around the car to position himself in front of it when he fired the first shot, was acting in self-defense or using force unjustifiably. The second and third shots were fired from the side of the vehicle. 
The Capital-Star asked all eight Democrats in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation how the House and Senate should respond to the shooting and the resulting unrest. Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.
While the Capital-Star’s questions included whether they supported impeachment, only Deluzio and Lee responded to the question directly.
“DHS agencies have demonstrated a pattern of violence against people with little to no accountability, emboldened by an administration that acts without impunity and adds fuel to the fire,” Lee said in a statement before articles of impeachment were introduced. “I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.”
“It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.

“Renee Good’s killing in Minneapolis is a tragedy, and my heart goes out to her grieving family and community,” Deluzio said in a statement.” From what I’ve seen so far, it is outrageous and disturbing that the Trump Administration immediately called this a ‘domestic terrorism’ incident. We need an independent investigation—and for the Congress to bring real oversight and accountability to ICE and Secretary Noem’s failed leadership.”
Congressional Republicans have largely rallied around the federal officers and DHS’ defense of the shooting. 
The Capital-Star also reached out to the nine Republican members, but only one, Rep. Dan Meuser from Luzerne County, responded. A spokesperson sent the Capital-Star a Fox News interview from shortly after the killing of Good.
“I mean, law enforcement says, ‘Hey, stop, open up your door, let me see your ID,’ and then not only do you take off, but you go right at somebody as they jump out of the way of the car, basically you’re trying to run them over,” Meuser said. “That’s not what a normal person does to anyone, let alone law enforcement.”
President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that Good was trying to hit the officer with her vehicle, and he was acting in self defense. The administration has also called Good’s a “domestic terrorist.” Immediately following the shooting, Noem said that Good, “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” 
But Open Source Intelligence analysts at the New York Times, Bellingcat and the Washington Post all concluded that Good appeared to be driving away from the officer when he fired at her.
In the days following the shooting, protests against ICE erupted around the country, including in Pennsylvania. DHS ordered additional federal  agents to Minneapolis, where daily life has been disrupted for residents, schools and businesses. 
Where Pennsylvania’s other Democratic reps stand
Many of Deluzio and Lee’s Pennsylvania Democratic colleagues have stopped short of further action beyond calls for investigations and increased oversight. But, none ruled out support for impeachment.
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District)
Successfully removing Noem from office is unlikely. Impeachment would require a majority vote in the House, which Democrats don’t hold by a 218-213 margin. A two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict, which would require significant support from the Republican majority. 
Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-05), who has a background in immigration advocacy, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star. She was unequivocal in her condemnation of the shooting of Good, and ICE’s use of force across the country under the Trump administration.
“The whole enforcement push with armed and masked agents in American cities has been dangerous from the start,” Scanlon said. “There have been multiple incidents where these ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents have pulled their guns on people on American streets. There seem to be some serious questions about training, about the conditions in which they should be engaging with people, and huge questions about who it is they’re pursuing.”
Asked what she would support to rein in the agency, including impeachment, Scanlon said that effective measures would require a “Democratic majority.”
“I think we’re constantly struggling with the gap between what we should be doing and what we can be doing in the minority,” Scanlon said. The reality is Congress can’t act without a majority, and right now Congressional Republicans are too afraid of Donald Trump to do what the country needs.”
She called for investigations into the shooting and how ICE is spending its money.
Scanlon, Lee and Deluzio were also among the six of Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic representatives in the House who signed onto a letter to Noem calling for DHS “to take immediate steps to preserve evidence, bring in unbiased investigative partners like the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and ensure the officers involved comply fully with investigators.”

The letter also included specific questions for DHS, including what kind of training the officers involved in Good’s shooting received and what steps the agency is taking to prevent recurring violence against civilians.
Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-02) was the lone Pennsylvania Democrat who did not sign the petition. He did, however, call for Noem’s resignation in a post on the social media platform X.
A spokesperson for Boyle did not respond to multiple questions from the Capital-Star about what steps the congressman would support to provide a check on immigration enforcement, including impeachment, but referred to a social media post he made.
“Kristi Noem is lying,” Boyle said. “We all saw the video. She must resign. And this heinous killing must be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law.”
A spokesperson for Rep. Dwight Evans (D-03) referred the Capital-Star to a social media post.
“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE  agents,” Evans wrote. “There should be bipartisan outrage about this tragedy. The Republican majorities in Congress need to join with Democrats to demand reform and accountability. This violence cannot and should not be normalized.”
Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean (D-04) and Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but both called for investigations on social media. Houlahan also called for the firing of any official who lied about the circumstances of the shooting.
Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman did not respond to the Capital-Star, but called the incident a tragedy in statements to the press last week.

Patrick Morrisey told the public Wednesday night during his State of the State address that he wanted a 10% personal income tax cut, saying it should be a priority to put more money back into people’s pockets.
The next morning, his finance staff presented a budget to Senators seeking a 5% cut, and the budget was calculated with a 5% tax cut included. 
The same reduced request went before members of the House Finance Committee on Friday, prompting Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, to ask, “What was the thought process in going with 10% on Wednesday night, and then coming back here 12 hours later and saying 5%?
In response, Department of Revenue Deputy Secretary Mike Muchow said the governor “wants at least 5% and would like to get 10%, but he wants to involve the Legislature to make sure that everybody is comfortable with getting to 10%.”
Williams wasn’t sold on the explanation.
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia
“I feel as if that was said the night before, with 10% because there were cameras in the room, and everyone was talking about it,” he said after the meeting. “All of a sudden that changes.  I felt as if it was a disingenuous representation. It was like a bad dating profile.”
The state’s tax-cut trigger formula, passed by lawmakers in 2023, didn’t trigger a tax cut this year because West Virginia didn’t meet the revenue goal in this past fiscal year. 
Morrisey’s tax cut isn’t a done deal for lawmakers, who this week began vetting the governor’s proposed budget. A 5% tax cut would cost about $125 million; a 10% would equal around $250 million.
The governor and his budget office say the state can afford the tax cut, pointing to strong rainy day funds and general revenue numbers as a reason lawmakers can pass a tax cut. Changes to the Public Employees Insurance Agency plan have saved money, and finding “inefficiencies” in agencies’ spending helped too, they said.

Del. Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, said, “the math doesn’t make sense.”
“What happened between last year and this year that we have overcome a $400 million structural deficit in the out years, and we can afford a 10% personal income tax cut?” Hite asked.
A six-year plan, used as a budget forecasting tool put together by the Morrisey administration, projects a $204 million gap in fiscal 2028. Additionally, State Budget Director Mike McKown told lawmakers that looming federal cuts under President Donald Trump threaten the state’s budget health.
“You’re kidding ourselves if we think that we can make up for federal loss. Federal funds dwarf the general revenue funds,” McKown said.
There’s also budget pressures — the largest one being increasing the cost of the Hope Scholarship, the state’s education voucher program. The voucher will be available to all students for the first time next school year for an estimated price of $230 million — an increase of about $127 million in the coming fiscal year.
“The big one is fully funding the Hope Scholarship,” Revenue Secretary Eric Nelson told lawmakers.
Morrisey’s request for a pay raise for all state employees would cost around $78.4 million, and an increase for the employers of the PEIA is estimated to cost $35.1 million.
Williams said the projected budget gap in coming years along with decreased federal dollars coming into West Virginia are factors to consider as lawmakers weigh Morrisey’s tax cut proposal.
Morrisey’s budget request included a $13 million increase from last year to cover administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program after the Trump administration shifted more costs for the food aid program onto the state.
“Right now, to say a 5% cut, maybe a 10% cut, I don’t see how that’s fiscally responsible,” Williams said.
McKown told lawmakers that 2026 revenue collections are $128 million above estimate.
“We anticipate to end the year with a healthy surplus,” he said.
Nelson told lawmakers, “We all should be extremely proud of where we are right now.”
State agencies were asked to cut 2% this year, and Nelson told lawmakers that strategic cuts were estimated to save the state $120 million. 
Kelly Allen, executive director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said in a statement that the budget presented by prioritized deeper tax cuts and paying for the Hope Scholarship, which opens up to all students next school year for an estimated price of $230 million. 
“He said himself these budget priorities will create hard decisions for many years to come, while his administration’s six year plan shows growing deficits in upcoming years that will strain our ability to invest in PEIA, health care, infrastructure and other needs,” Allen said.
West Virginia’s constitution requires that lawmakers pass a balanced budget.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)COLUMBIA — More than 550 people have been sickened with measles in three Upstate counties, the state health department said Friday.
The number of cases exploded in the beginning of the new year, with 148 reported in the past week. Since Jan. 7, the case count has more than doubled, according to the health department.
South Carolina has among the largest outbreaks in the nation, second only to Texas, which reported more than 800 cases in 2025.
Eight people have been hospitalized for complications of measles, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters. The state health department does not track cases after they are reported, so she did not give any more information about how they are doing or what type of care they received.
Travel and gatherings over the holiday season are the likely culprits for the spike in cases, she said.
When schools let out for winter break, health department officials struggled to track down unvaccinated students to let them know they’d been exposed to the virus. They continued going out and seeing family, often without knowing they were infected, increasing the disease’s spread, Bell said.

More than 180 students at 10 schools were in quarantine as of Friday, according to the Department of Public Health. For the first time since the outbreak began in October, that includes schools outside of Spartanburg County, the epicenter of the outbreak.
At Crestview Elementary School in Greenville County, 22 students are in quarantine. And Starr Elementary School in rural Anderson County reported a measles case this week, causing 10 students to quarantine.
Vaccination is the only sure way to prevent cases from continuing to spread, Bell said.
Most people receive two doses of the vaccine, which also covers mumps and rubella, during childhood. Anyone who is unvaccinated but wants protection from measles can get the shots at a doctor’s office or health clinic.
At least 87% of those diagnosed with measles during the outbreak are unvaccinated, according to the health department. The agency has not been able to determine a vaccination status for another 56.
“This is a disappointment, to see these now hundreds of cases that a majority of them could have been prevented, and we have an opportunity to prevent further cases if people can adopt available tools and help us stop this outbreak sooner rather than later,” Bell told reporters this week.
Measles can cause dangerous complications, especially for children, who make up the majority of those sickened during the outbreak. Symptoms typically start with a fever, followed by a rash that often begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. In severe cases, measles can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can sometimes be fatal.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A push in the Kansas Legislature for greater transparency in the way Kansas Supreme Court Justices are selected furthers a revolt against the current merit-based system.
An attorney and Republican legislator teamed up to introduce Senate Bill 299, which would force the Kansas Supreme Court Nominating Commission to make public most of its records, including information on candidates for the commission.
Current Supreme Court rules dictate that all nominating commission records be confidential, but the commission has discretion to release judicial applicants’ names, employment history, educational background and home cities. A nine-member nominating commission selects three candidates based on merit, and the governor appoints a justice from the list of three.
Joshua Ney, an attorney who sits on the 2nd Judicial District’s nominating commission, was the lone proponent who testified Thursday to the Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee.
To him, the Supreme Court nominating commission “sure looks like a smoke-filled room.”
The commission is still subject to public meeting laws and has historically released information on its three selected candidates upon sending them to the governor. The commission’s interviews with hopefuls are also open to the public before members select their three nominees. But Ney took issue with the commission refusing to release the names and information of candidates for commission seats, including the chairman.
Ney said he helped brainstorm the bill, which Republican committee chair Sen. Mike Thompson of Shawnee introduced last April on Ney’s behalf.
“I don’t see a reason for secrecy in nominating commission proceedings,” Ney said. “I don’t see a parallel in any other public office where you can’t get the name of who else has filed for the office you’re considering filing — or someone else is considering filing for — ʼtil afterwards.”
Ney filed last spring to be considered for a vacancy on the nominating commission, he said in written testimony. He and his former law firm partner, Ryan Kriegshauser, who was recently appointed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Kansas, repeatedly pressed appellate court clerk Doug Shima for explanations as to why candidate records were exempt from disclosure, according to emails from March included in Ney’s testimony. Shima repeatedly cited Supreme Court rules and existing law, stating he, as secretary of the commission for the past decade, does not release candidates’ names until the nomination process is closed.
The nominating commission consists of one attorney and one non-attorney from each of Kansas’ four Congressional districts, and one attorney chair. The chairman and two members from the 4th Congressional District were appointed last year, and the terms of two members representing the 1st Congressional District will expire in 2026. Lawyers are appointed to the commission by their peers, and the governor appoints non-lawyer members.
No one publicly opposed the bill.
If the House and Senate both pass the bill, and the governor signs it into law, it would go into effect July 1, around one month before voters are scheduled to weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to change the way Supreme Court justices are selected.
Voters will have the option on Aug. 6 of retaining the current merit-based system, or voters can choose to switch to a popular vote system, involving ballot races for a seat on the bench and public-facing campaigns.
If voters choose the popular vote system, the proposed records rule would have to be repealed entirely or significantly modified in subsequent legislation, said Jason Long, a legislative researcher and adviser, during testimony.
The issue is layered, with Democrats advocating for retaining the existing system and many Republicans arguing for a popular vote. Some have added the context that motivations for changing the system could be rooted in dissatisfaction among Republican leadership with Kansas Supreme Court decisions on education and abortion.
Former Chief Justice Marla Luckert announced earlier this month her intention to retire by February, and selecting a replacement is likely to be a monthslong process. Luckert began her time on the bench in 2003 after she was appointed by Republican Gov. Bill Graves. Her retirement will be outgoing Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s fifth appointment to the court, resulting in four sitting justices out of seven on the bench.
Lisa Taylor, a spokesperson for the Kansas Supreme Court, declined to comment on Ney’s allegations and the merits of legislation, citing an inability to discuss policy issues.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/senator-Thompsonb-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City topped national charts this week under a blanket of the dirtiest air in the country, with more to come. 
Tuesday’s air quality ranked worst in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s three-day forecast projects conditions will remain “unhealthy for sensitive groups” through Sunday. 
The Salt Lake Valley’s unique geography, encircled by the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains, creates an inversion – where cold valley air traps pollution and harmful particles in the valley under a layer of warmer air at higher elevations. Low-pressure weather conditions, including strong storms, are needed to clear an inversion. 
Downtown Salt Lake City is shrouded in a thick pollution haze on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
An average Utah winter has “about five to six multi-day inversion episodes on average,” according to the Utah DEQ, and 18 days with high levels of harmful inhalable matter, PM2.5. A longer high-pressure weather system creates more extreme conditions, prolonging the inversion. 
Salt Lake City recommends taking public transit, driving less and reducing idle times to limit contributing to the smog. Transportation contributes almost 50% of wintertime particulate pollution, according to the city’s sustainability website. Solid fuel burning is prohibited during periods of poor air quality.
Health impacts
A Nov. 2020 study from Brigham Young University found air pollution in Utah can decrease median life expectancy by 1.1 to 3.6 years, causing between 2,500 and 8,000 premature deaths each year. Exposure to dirty air increases risk of heart attack, asthma, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
The study also found risk of “stroke, cancer, reproductive harm to mothers and children, mental illness, behavioral dysfunction, immune disease, autism” all increase with prolonged exposure to poor air.

Everyone is vulnerable to negative health effects after exposure to high pollution, according to University of Utah Health, but some populations face a higher risk. Older adults, children, pregnant women, people with underlying heart and lung conditions, and those who work outdoors face a higher risk of severe health complications. 
During times of high pollution, U. Health recommends staying hydrated, limiting outdoor activity, using protective masks outside (such as N95 or N99), and utilizing indoor air purification.
Economic Impacts
The same BYU study estimates Utah’s air pollution costs $1.9 billion annually, citing “healthcare expenses, damage to crops, and lost earning potential,” as well as indirect costs such as “loss of tourism, decreased growth, and regulatory burdens.”
BYU’s study notes that those loss assessments “are on the low end of national estimates, which range up to $9 billion a year for Utah.”

The state board vacated Enich’s position and appointed Walter Saunders to replace him. (West Virginia Board of Education livestream Screenshot)The West Virginia Board of Education voted Friday to intervene in the operation of a financially struggling county school district, terminating the superintendent and appointing a replacement. 
Dan Enich’s position as superintendent of the Hancock County Board of Education is vacant as of 4 p.m. Friday, according to a motion made by State Superintendent Michele Blatt and approved by the school board. The state board appointed Walter Saunders to be county superintendent as of 4:01 p.m. Friday. 
Associate state superintendent Jeffrey Kelly said the Hancock County county’s financial shortfalls pose an immediate threat to the ongoing operation of schools.
“Hancock County Schools’ financial situation has escalated from a monitored concern to a fiscal emergency,” he told the school board. “As conditions deteriorated. The district formally requested emergency state aid to meet payroll obligations.”
Uriah Cummings, the state school financial operations officer, told the board that Hancock County had been getting state assistance for financial purposes for three consecutive years as of October. Prior to that, Cummings said, there was nothing to suggest the county had major financial problems.
The county board used funds from its career and technical center to make payroll in September, Cummings said. Those funds were returned to the center, he said.
The county has been operating with 140 more positions than what the county school aid formula called for, according to the state, an overage that costs the county school board about $10 million per year, Cummings told the school board. 
In addition, the school board had numerous construction projects going on, including sports-related projects and had overspent on a construction project at Weir High School by nearly $1 million. 
Those expenses come out to be about an $8 million increase in expenditures from fiscal year 2024 to 2025, he said. 
Enich asked state officials to keep the administration in place and allow officials to continue taking steps under the direction of the state school board. 
“I’m well aware that this has happened under my watch, but would like to add that what I estimate as being the decades-long problem was identified and eliminated under my watch,” Enich said. “And [we] want to be the first ones to fix it, with help and assistance of the Board of Education and any assistance that can be provided our way.”
The Hancock County school board fired Chief Financial Officer Joseph Campinelli in November, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews. 
Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, told West Virginia MetroNews Talkline last week that the financial crisis was caused by mismanagement, a lack of accounting and a number of other issues. Student enrollment has declined in the county just as it has in other parts of the state, he said.
“The books were just wrong, likely just from gross incompetence,” McGeehan said. “Hopefully it’s nothing more than that.”
In the news release Friday, state school board president Paul Hardesty assured Hancock County teachers and school staff members they would be paid, despite concerns the school board can’t make payroll. 
“This board has to make some very tough decisions,” Hardesty said in the news release. “But we must operate within code while also protecting the children and taxpayers of our state. We have told our counties for several years that using one-time COVID money for personnel would lead to a day of reckoning. That day has come in Hancock County.”
The county assistant superintendent and the positions of any personnel serving at the will and pleasure of the county school superintendent will also be vacant as of Friday afternoon, according to the state school board. The assistant county superintendent position will stay vacation in order to conserve resources.
According to the state school board, Saunders has been the director of federal programs and assessment for Ohio County Schools for 10 years. Saunders is an Air Force veteran with an undergraduate degree in mathematics education from West Liberty University and a graduate degree in educational leadership from West Virginia University.
“We are grateful for the service of Mr. Saunders, and we look forward to supporting him and his team to address the crisis in Hancock County,” Blatt said in the news release. “We appreciate the work of the WVBE and know that together, we will resolve the challenges and protect the students and education community of the county.”

Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha over her removal and later return of part of an art display at the Nebraska Capitol.
Sheriff Terry Wagner told the Lincoln Journal Star on Friday that an investigator had been assigned to review evidence related to the incident and conduct interviews. He said his office was looking into whether the incident might fit the definitions of theft, criminal mischief or disturbing the peace.

On the first day of this year’s legislative session, Cavanaugh, a progressive lawmaker in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, removed several frames of artwork in the hallway near her legislative office. The art depicted moments and figures of American history from conservative nonprofit PragerU.
Cavanaugh said she did so because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.” She said any such display would typically be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways.
The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which Speaker John Arch said had approved the display’s use of the walls. The frames were returned to their spots the same day.
The incident got amplified by conservative influencers and media outlets after Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, tweeted security footage of the incident and wrote that he was “disappointed in this shameful and selfish bad example.”
Cavanaugh apologized last week as State Sen. Jared Storm of David City asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand her.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, which handles internal issues of discipline, said the board had discussed the incident at least once. He said he expects the board will advance some formal action against Cavanaugh, but they are waiting to see what the Sheriff’s Office does first.
On Wednesday, Pillen released a statement saying he consulted with law enforcement and legislators, and he “concluded this warrants a criminal investigation by law enforcement.” Pillen said he told the Nebraska State Patrol to refer the materials from the incident to the sheriff’s office.
Wagner told the Journal Star he was surprised to receive the call Wednesday evening and said this may be the first time his office has ever investigated a state senator.
Hansen said he felt the governor was “not unjustified” to call for the investigation considering the nature of the incident.
Cavanaugh declined to comment on the investigation Friday.

According to some reports, explosions were heard in Caracas and other cities near airports and military bases around 2 a.m. (Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)This week provided more proof that Congress — and our two Kansas senators — are unwilling to check the powers of President Donald Trump. 
A vote in the Senate on Wednesday could have blocked Trump’s ability to conduct further military action in Venezuela without congressional approval. Since Jan. 3, the U.S. has staged a military intervention, removed the president and claimed power over the country’s oil industry. 
The vote narrowly failed, 51-50. 
We are looking at you, Kansas Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall. 
Kansans might dispute how consequential this vote was, especially compared with other opportunities to slow down Trump. Both senators could have voted against other measures that have inched us closer to an imperial presidency. For instance, both sided with Trump during impeachment votes in his first term. 
Kansans might also argue that the vote on Venezuela was less significant than congressional action on domestic policies, such as deployments of the National Guard or widespread raids by immigration officials. The Kansas senators could have stood up when Trump asserted those powers. (In fact, they still can.) 
Nevertheless, the Venezuela vote is useful as a timely litmus test for Moran and Marshall, both as Republicans and surrogates for their constituents. Wednesday’s vote shows where they sit after almost one year of Trump’s second term. That is to say, on the sidelines. 
To understand this, let’s inspect the conservative coalitions on this vote. Republican ranks broke down into three camps. 
In the first group — let’s call them the Principled Objectors — there were three Republican senators: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Beginning last week, they broke unexpectedly from their party to force the Venezuela roll call vote and stuck by their convictions in the face of public and private threats from Trump. 
Marshall and Moran joining this group would require an extraordinary upgrade to their courage and wild swings to their ideologies. Both have long-term voting records that support the conservative cause. Perhaps it’s fantasy (or folly) to expect this level of resistance. 
In the second group — let’s call them the Equivocaters — there were two Republican senators: Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri. 
How do they earn the title of the Equivocaters? After first signaling their hopes of restraining the president, both waffled back to supporting Trump by voting with fellow conservatives. In doing so, they took a position of some courage before retreating, never fully committing themselves. 
We can associate them with equivocation in another way: They insisted on nothing more than weak language from the administration. 
From a statement by Young: “I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force.” 
Sounds like asking for congressional approval without actually mandating by legislation. 
Hawley said his assurance came from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 
If you are shaking your head at weak tea that the Equivocaters served, consider the posse that our Kansas senators joined — I call them the Compliant Coalition. Forty-eight Republican senators, including Moran and Marshall, helped Trump get his legislative wish this week with the Venezuelan vote. Vice President JD Vance was needed to break the tie. 
The Compliant Coalition appeases. It cedes power. It responds to threats. It holds its tongue. 
During Congressional votes. During campaigns. During election disputes. And during two Trump administrations. 
Lest the coalition say that they are simply representing the will of the American people, read the polls. According to an Associated Press poll this week, 61 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling foreign policy, in general. Only 35 percent believe this administration’s intervention has “been about right.” 
Recent polling from Reuters shows how divided and nervous Americans are about Venezuela. Polling from Jan. 4-5 shows Americans almost perfectly split on their approval of US military action to remove the nation’s leader Nicolás Maduro: 33 percent in support, 33 percent don’t know and 34 percent disapprove. 
Asked if they are concerned that the U.S. will get too involved in Venezuela, 72 percent said yes. 
These seem like the exact conditions when a robust Congress — and an empowered Kansas delegation — would want a say. The country is unsure and divided. Our president is volatile and threatening, while also vague about his military intentions. And the administration is pulling a U-turn from its first term, one that kicked off with an inaugural address trumpeting the wisdom of “America First.” 
If not now, if not on this issue, then when does Congress want power?
Perhaps these categories — the Principled Objectors, the Equivocators and the Compliant Coalition — are in flux. Maybe leadership will reel in the rogue Republicans. Maybe the Equivocators will develop further backbone when it comes to balance of powers. 
Or maybe — just maybe — a Republican from the heartland will assert Congressional power and grab the steering wheel. 
After all, we have at least three more years on this highway.

Chad Caldwell’s tagline last session when passing a one-year statewide cellphone ban in schools was “try it before you buy it.”
Now, Caldwell, R-Enid, and the law’s Senate author, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, are ready to buy. Both have filed bills that would permanently ban student cellphone use during the school day.
“I think the reason we got to that is because it’s been clear from our educators and from our parents and communities that they want the state to buy it,” Caldwell said. “I think it’s been well received, and it just, to me, makes sense to make that change permanent.”
Caldwell and Seifried said they’ve received an overwhelmingly positive response to the policy, which bars students in public schools from using their cellphones from the morning bell until dismissal.

Under the current law, each school district will have the choice to continue the ban or make a change after the 2025-26 academic year.
Neither lawmaker said they worry many districts would reverse the policy once it becomes optional. Rather, Seifried attributed part of the success to the fact that “the state was the bad guy,” rather than local schools having to take criticism for requiring the ban.
“There is a part of me that (thinks), ‘Maybe having the law gives everyone the sort of cover that they need,’” she said. “There were a couple of conversations that I had that said it was so successful because everyone was all in it together. It was a collective decision. There was no option. It was state law.”
Educators and school leaders have told Oklahoma Voice the policy has had a positive impact by removing a major distraction and that families have been willing to comply because of the equal implementation statewide.
House Bill 3715 from Caldwell and Seifried’s Senate Bill 1719 would strike statutory language allowing local school boards the opportunity to change their district’s cellphone policy after the current academic year. Cellphones and non-school-issued personal electronic devices would be prohibited during the instructional day for “each school year thereafter.”
Both bills will be up for consideration once the 2026 legislative session begins Feb. 2.

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Mid-January marks the start of the legislative season, with the 30-day finance-focused session set to begin Jan. 20. Lawmakers and lobbyists will descend on the capital city to build the budget. But crucial election deadlines sit just around the corner. Candidates must declare by Feb. 3 if they wish to participate in New Mexico’s June 2 primary and Nov. 3 midterm elections.
Here’s an overview of campaign activity in the first few weeks of 2026.
Campaign finance and more in the U.S. Congressional races
New Mexico’s three members in the U.S. House of Representatives, all Democrats, each face challengers in the 2026 elections.
In Congressional District 1, which spans from Albuquerque east to Santa Rosa, incumbent Melanie Stansbury thus far will campaign against two Republican challengers: Steve Jones, a former accountant who’s run for congressional seats several times; and Ndidiamaka “Didi” Okpareke, a Rio Rancho pharmacist.
Gabe Vasquez represents Congressional District 2, which covers southern New Mexico along the border, up to the western part of the state and a slice of Albuquerque’s South Valley.
Democratic Socialist Tom Wakely, an Air Force veteran and peace activist in Deming who ran an unsuccessful 2024 campaign as a Green Party member for the U.S. Senate, is challenging Vasquez in the Democratic primary.
So far three Republican challengers have thrown in their names for the swing district (Vasquez held on to his seat in 2024 against a challenge from its former representative, Republican Yvette Herrell).
Those Republican candidates are: Eddy Aragon, a conservative talk radio host and former Albuquerque mayoral candidate; Greg Cunningham, marine veteran, former detective and two-time state legislative candidate; and Jose Orozco, a former contractor with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and unsuccessful two-time state representative candidate.
Congressional District 3, which spans the state’s northern half and runs along a stretch of its eastern border, is represented by incumbent Teresa Ledger Fernández. She is so far facing one challenger: Republican Rep. Martin Zamora, who was first elected as a state lawmaker in 2019.
In the U.S. Senate, no one has filed yet to challenge Democratic incumbent Ben Ray Luján, who has more than $3.1 million cash on hand, according to federal campaign documents. A “Toby Smith,” from the “Jewish/Christian National Party” — which has no online presence —  filed to run for the seat in October, but with erroneous information (such as using the address from Walter White’s “Breaking Bad” home). The Federal Election Commission already sent a notice to Smith that the filing did not contain a checking account for any campaign donations, which could open an audit or further enforcement.
Forward Party leaders say they’re moving… forward.
Leaders of the New Mexico arm of the Forward Party told Source NM this week they have gathered enough signatures to qualify as a minor party in the state, and also endorsed two Democratic candidates.

The Forward Party — founded by Democrat Andrew Yang after an unsuccessful bid in the 2020 presidential election and former Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey — posits itself as a centrist party focused on a return to civil politics and improving U.S. democracy.
The party is hosting a Southern New Mexico Town hall from noon to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Hotel Encanto in Las Cruces. The town hall will include two endorsed Democratic candidates: gubernatorial candidate for governor Ken Miyagishima, the former Las Cruces mayor; and Tilli Villalobos, a former federal prosecutor running for House District 37.
Deb Haaland announces education platform

Former U.S. Interior Secretary and U.S. Congresswoman Deb Haaland, who is running in the June 2 Democratic primary, promoted her ideas to bolster outdoor learning for K-12 kids, expanding trade pathways in middle schools, continuing universal pre-k and bilingual education and backed by chairs of the House and Senate Education committees, and Picuris Pueblo leadership.
Haaland said she will announce platform policies on affordability, health care and public safety  in the coming weeks. Other candidates in the race include Miyagishima and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman.

Carrie Sorensen, a Portsmouth Democrat, speaks before the House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee about her bill seeking to provide diapers to parents on Medicaid. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A group of lawmakers led by state Rep. Carrie Sorensen wants New Hampshire to become the third U.S. state to cover the cost of diapers for infants under its Medicaid program.
House Bill 1798 would provide eligible families on Medicaid with funding for 100 diapers a month for the first 12 months of an infant’s life. If the bill became law, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services would have to submit a request — known as a Section 1115 waiver — to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to begin the program because Medicaid is run jointly by the state and federal governments.
In a fiscal note presented to the Legislature, state staff told lawmakers they anticipate roughly 3,600 infants will be eligible and take advantage of the service and put the cost of diapers at 46 cents each. Thus they estimate the program could cost the state $919,000 per year in addition to roughly $1.07 million that the federal government would provide annually for the program. For reference, New Hampshire’s entire Medicaid program is projected to spend $2.57 billion in the state’s fiscal year 2025 with 56% of that coming from the federal government. HB 1798 appropriates $100,000 a year for the program, but gives the governor the authority to pull more money as needed.
Sorensen, a Portsmouth Democrat and mother, framed the bill as a way to help new mothers with the financial burden of raising an infant. She noted that SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — doesn’t cover diapers and that new mothers are regularly facing high costs.
“I can personally attest to this,” she said. “You all heard my baby in the House last year.”
Sorensen argued low-income families are forced to ration diapers, which can lead to urinary tract infections and other medical complications from children not being changed often enough.
“Low-income parents have to make more difficult choices of whether they spend their money on diapers or whether they spend money on food or their heat or their rent,” she said. “Or do they ration diapers, risking their skin and their health? Neither choice is acceptable for a child’s well-being.”
Sorensen said she considered having her bill provide reusable diapers, but decided to go with disposable diapers because of the complications for families that use laundromats. 
In 2024, Delaware and Tennessee became the first states in the country to cover diapers under Medicaid after CMS approved their requests.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diapersbill-1024x534.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican, is okay with first cousins getting married but not with same sex couples. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)New acquaintances, when finding out that I’m a journalist, often ask what beat I cover. 
My response is that as editor, I rarely write news stories but as the creator of a regular column, I choose to focus on the hypocrisy beat. 
God knows there’s no shortage of hypocritical behavior from Tennessee’s lawmakers and politicians, and I’m pretty sure I could churn out columns about it on a weekly basis. 
It’s still early in 2026, but in the last week, two lawmakers — one at the state level, one at the federal — showed they aren’t wasting any time indulging in hypocritical hijinks. 
Rep. Gino Bulso 
In first place for the Hypocrite of the Month is Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican. 
Two years ago, Bulso made headlines when he became the only member of the Tennessee House of Representatives to vote against a measure prohibiting marriage between first cousins. That Republicans and Democrats could agree on even something that seems like a no-brainer is rare in a chamber so deeply cloven by partisan division that it’s doubtful a proclamation recognizing Santa Claus would earn bipartisan support. 
Bulso gave an impassioned defense of the practice, informing his colleagues that his grandparents, who immigrated from Italy, were first cousins who came to Tennessee from Ohio because it was legal for them to marry in the Volunteer State. 
Stockard on the Stump: Bulso doubles down for first-cousin marriage

I’m not here to shame Bulso for his ancestors’ behavior: none of us can be held accountable for what previous generations did, and I’m certainly not privy to the social mores of small town Italy, from whence his grandparents immigrated, in the early 20th century. 
But Bulso has no shame about litigating and legislating how others should lead their lives, and with the legislative session just kicking off, he’s already filed three bills targeting LGBTQ+ Tennesseans. 
One measure, House Bill 1473, would render Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage the law of the land. Obergefell guaranteed the right through both the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process clauses and required states to perform and recognize same sex marriages. 
At the time in 2024 when Bulso took his stand for first cousin marriage, he made plain his view on same-sex marriage, saying that Obergefell “was a grievously wrong decision.” He also made the bizarre claim that the ruling should also protect marriage between cousins: if the 14th Amendment offers protections to same-sex couples, it should also offer the same protections to cousin couples, he said. 
Now, apparently, he sees no need to follow the Constitution at all and why should he? Failure to abide by the Constitution is all the rage among senior Republicans, chiefly President Donald Trump setting an example. 
Honorable mention: U.S. Rep. David Kustoff
I’ve subscribed to U.S. Rep. David Kustoff’s newsletters for several years, and he’s one of the state’s more reasonable congressmen, rarely making hay out of culture issues and typically focusing on community events and meetings.
But in his Sunday newsletter, he highlighted a recent appearance on Fox News. 
“I joined Rich Edson on Fox News Live to discuss the fraud in Minnesota. Governor Tim Walz has a lot of excuses. When it comes to waste and fraud, taxpayers deserve answers,” Kustoff wrote, referring to allegations of fraud in state social service programs.
First, the fraud is alleged. 
U.S. Rep. David Kustoff touting his appearance on Fox News. (Screenshot from Kustoff’s newsletter.)
But secondly, I feel sure there are already plenty of politicians on top of the Minnesota fraud investigations — clearly, it’s become a raison d’etre for the Trump administration, which has virtually occupied Minneapolis — and Walz, who, while not running for office again, surely does not want his legacy to be one of unchecked fraud. 
Perhaps, instead of devoting his energy to another state’s governor, Kustoff should turn his eyes toward Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. 
Of late, Lee declined to accept $84 million in federal funds for a summer food program for kids. All he had to do was have the state express their intent to take the funds — no application necessary — but for the second year in a row, he did not. And he provided no comment as to why. 
Mind you, Tennesseans are already paying federal taxes for this program, among the other programs our taxes cover. I’d call it fraud of a sort that we can’t reap benefits from the taxes we’ve paid, while other states are getting these federal dollars. 
Yet, I’ve heard not a peep from Kustoff, or other members of Tennessee’s federal delegation. 
Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers are fond of posting verses from the Bible on their social media feeds each Sunday, usually apropos of nothing. 
I know my Bible, too, so let me offer a verse that is apt for Bulso and Kustoff. 
The Book of Matthew, Chapter 7, verses 3-5 says, in the New King James translation: “And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?”
Or, to put in the Tennessee translation, don’t be such a dang hypocrite.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas’ reversal of its offer to hire Emily Suski as its next law school dean has sparked concerns that the decision chills faculty’s free speech.
The university said it was withdrawing the offer after key Republicans raised concerns about Suski’s background and legal positions on transgender athletes.
The Fayetteville school is the latest to be embroiled in a debate over academic freedom as Republicans nationwide focus on college curricula. 
Here’s what to know about what’s happened at the UA:
 
Who is Emily Suski?
Suski is a professor and associate dean at University of South Carolina’s Joseph F. Rice School of Law. Her areas of expertise include education law, particularly Title IX and civil rights in public schools, according to her USC biography. 
She holds degrees from Georgetown University Law Center and the University of North Carolina. 
She’s spoken regularly in public and been quoted in multiple media outlets about Title IX. When she was hired, the UA praised Suski’s “extensive experience” in legal education and the practice of law.

Why did the university reverse course?
The university announced to law school faculty on Wednesday that it had changed its mind, saying it “decided to go a different direction in filling the vacancy.”
The university said it had heard from “key external stakeholders” before its abrupt decision. Though university officials haven’t identified those stakeholders, top Republicans have said they raised concerns about Suski.
 
What were Republicans’ complaints? 
Republicans who have said they were concerned about Suski include Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester and Attorney General Tim Griffin. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders hasn’t said whether she intervened, but released a statement applauding the university for its decision away from Suski.
Hester has said he objected to Suski signing on to a friend-of-the-court brief along with other law professors. The brief was on behalf of attorneys challenging laws prohibiting transgender athletes in school sports.
Hester also cited a 2022 letter Suski signed with other professors in support of Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s pick for the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
What has Suski said?
Suski has said she was disappointed by the university’s decision and the influence outside critics had. 
“I have been informed that the decision was not in any way a reflection of my qualifications to serve as dean, but rather the result of influence from external individuals,” Suski said in a statement released Thursday night. “Questions concerning that feedback are best directed to the University of Arkansas.”
 
What do critics of UA’s decision say?
The decision has prompted criticism from Democratic lawmakers and advocates around the country, who say it sends a dangerous message to professors.
An official with the American Association of University Professors called the university’s decision move “really chilling.” Other groups criticizing the move include the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
 
What happens next?
It’s unclear what the next moves are for the University of Arkansas and its search for a new law school dean. 
UA spokesperson John Thomas said, to his knowledge, nothing like this has happened at the law school previously. 
“Next steps for the search are still being determined. Beyond that, we have nothing further to add at this time,” Thomas said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260115_UALawSchool3_Grajeda-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Los legisladores progresistas y sus aliados en los sectores laboral y de la salud parecen tener la esperanza de que Newsom apoye una idea de financiación diferente y poco viable.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Los activistas de la atención médica de California, los sindicatos y los legisladores progresistas han instado al gobernador y a la Legislatura a encontrar nuevos fondos para financiar la atención médica y otros servicios sociales para millones de californianos de bajos ingresos y discapacitados.
 Su coalición, conocida como “Lucha por nuestra salud”, exigió el miércoles en las escaleras del Capitolio que la Legislatura y el gobernador Gavin Newsom, que pronto dejará el poder, tomen medidas para compensar los recortes de fondos que el presidente Donald Trump y los republicanos aprobaron el año pasado.
 El dilema sobre cómo responder a los miles de millones de dólares en recortes a los servicios sociales —en particular al presupuesto de Medi-Cal, el programa de Medicaid del estado de casi 200 mil millones de dólares— presagia un enfrentamiento que dominará tanto la sesión legislativa de 2026 como las elecciones de mitad de período.
 Mientras un sindicato impulsa una controvertida propuesta de ley sobre el impuesto al patrimonio para compensar los recortes, los demócratas progresistas en la Legislatura están proponiendo un impuesto corporativo independiente, aunque los detalles son escasos. Si esto se materializa en un proyecto de ley, es probable que también divida al partido, sensible a las acusaciones de que los californianos pagan impuestos excesivos y que recientemente ha declarado que sus líderes se centrarán en reducir los costos para los residentes del estado.
En su último año como gobernador, Newsom se enfrenta a un tira y afloja entre dos opciones políticamente costosas: aumentar los impuestos o permitir que caduquen los beneficios de millones de californianos de bajos ingresos y con discapacidad. Aunque su administración solo ha buscado culpar a Trump por los recortes federales, los activistas de la salud dejaron claro que presionarán a Newsom para que ayude a prevenir una pérdida drástica de la cobertura.
 “Quiero dirigirme al gobernador y a la Legislatura estatal”, dijo Judy Mark, presidenta de Disability Voices United, desde la escalinata del Capitolio. “Sabemos que ustedes no son responsables de estos terribles recortes, pero ahora la responsabilidad recae en sus manos. Tienen el poder de protegernos”.
El gobernador enfureció a los activistas de la salud al no incluir fondos para compensar por los recortes en su propuesta de presupuesto estatal , la cual reconoce que decenas de miles de personas perderán cobertura y considera menos servicios entre los ahorros proyectados. Este año, el estado comenzó a congelar las nuevas inscripciones a Medi-Cal para adultos inmigrantes indocumentados debido al aumento de los costos del programa, a pesar de las objeciones de progresistas y activistas.  
 Los analistas de Newsom prevén que unos 522,000 californianos perderán su cobertura de Medi-Cal en el año fiscal 2026-2027, cifra que aumentará a 1.8 millones en el futuro. Su administración ha afirmado que el estado simplemente no tiene los fondos para cubrir la cobertura de quienes sean excluidos del programa debido a las nuevas leyes federales.
Un sindicato, el Sindicato Internacional de Empleados de Servicios-Trabajadores de la Salud Unidos Oeste o  Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West, ha propuesto una iniciativa de ley que impondría un impuesto al patrimonio a los multimillonarios de California para ayudar a cubrir los aproximadamente 30 mil millones de dólares que el estado perdería anualmente debido a la ley de impuestos y gastos de Trump. Los promotores afirman que el impuesto único del 5% generaría unos 100 mil millones de dólares para el sistema de salud estatal. Aproximadamente el 10% de los fondos recaudados se reservaría para las escuelas públicas.
Pero Newsom se opone a la medida, que aún no ha sido aprobada para ser sometida a votación, pero que ya ha generado inquietud en Sacramento y Silicon Valley.

 Los multimillonarios son cruciales para el presupuesto estatal
La propuesta ha generado una oleada de oposición. Los fundadores de Google, Larry Page y Sergey Brin, supuestamente habrían intentado trasladar algunas entidades comerciales fuera de California, mientras que otras compañías amenazan con irse. Estrategas demócratas cercanos a Newsom están organizando un comité de campaña para derrotar la medida mientras el sindicato recopila las casi 900,000 firmas necesarias para que se presente en las elecciones de noviembre.
Newsom, quien se ha opuesto repetidamente a las propuestas estatales de impuesto al patrimonio, declaró esta semana a Politico que ha estado presionando personalmente a los promotores de la medida para que la abandonen, debido a la preocupación de que pueda llevar a los millonarios a  taxar a salir de California. Además, el gobernador mantiene vínculos personales de larga data con muchos de los gigantes tecnológicos que probablemente estarían sujetos a la propuesta de impuesto al patrimonio, y tiene motivos para mantenerlos cerca: son posibles donantes en caso de que se presente a la previsible candidatura presidencial tras finalizar su mandato como gobernador este año.
 Aunque los progresistas presionan a Newsom para que aumente los ingresos y refuerce Medi-Cal, pocos han apoyado la propuesta del impuesto al patrimonio, y la mayoría se mantiene expectante. Tampoco critican la oposición de Newsom, una posible señal de que los legisladores liberales esperan que esté dispuesto a buscar otros fondos para la atención médica.
El portavoz de Newsom, Izzy Gardon, se negó a comentar si el gobernador consideraría propuestas fiscales alternativas.
 Los defensores de la salud afirmaron que la sustitución de la financiación federal sería una prioridad clave en esta sesión legislativa. Los legisladores progresistas, que lideraron la oposición a la propuesta de Newsom de recortar costos congelando Medi-Cal para inmigrantes indocumentados , han señalado que también se sumarán a la lucha.
 La presidenta del Comité de Salud de la Asamblea, Mia Bonta , demócrata de Oakland, sugirió que el estado considere imponer nuevos impuestos a las corporaciones que emplean a trabajadores a quienes se les paga tan poco que califican para recibir asistencia de atención médica pública.
 “No podemos permitir que estas corporaciones sigan beneficiándose”, dijo. “California tiene la responsabilidad de actuar con decisión, y lo haremos”.
 Pero no ha presentado ningún proyecto de ley y los defensores de la atención sanitaria dicen que todavía esperan tener más opciones sobre la mesa.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01142026_-FightForOurHealthCoalition_RA_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Senate President Thomas Alexander, R-Walhalla, brought bags of the vapes confiscated from students to show senators. (File photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)As the South Carolina General Assembly reconvened this week, lawmakers did so in the wake of a major joint state and federal law enforcement operation that exposed the scale of illicit activity taking place in smoke shops across the state.
“Operation Ganjapreneur” resulted in the seizure of large quantities of illegal THC products and the arrest of multiple individuals on narcotics-related charges. More importantly, it revealed how
openly and routinely illegal products are being sold in communities across South Carolina, often with little consequence for retailers.
The operation underscored a troubling reality: many of the unregulated products sold in smoke shops are tied to broader illicit supply chains that strain law enforcement resources and pose real threats to public safety.
While federal law already prohibits many of these products, gaps in state law have limited the ability of local officers to act.
That enforcement gap has allowed an illicit vape market to flourish in plain sight.
Flavored disposable vapes are mass produced overseas, smuggled into the United States, and sold openly despite clear federal prohibitions. The result is a growing public health and safety crisis that state and local law enforcement currently lack the authority to fully address.
Roughly 90% of disposable vapes sold in the United States are manufactured in China, where they are banned for domestic sale. Many have been explicitly denied authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, a decision upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Yet anyone can walk into smoke shops across South Carolina and find rows of these illegal devices, marketed openly and aggressively to kids. This is not accidental. It is a business model built around exploiting enforcement loopholes.
The consequences are increasingly visible in communities across the state.
Nearly half of South Carolina teenagers now report using disposable vapes. Parents, teachers, and school administrators see the impact every day in classrooms, hallways, and parking lots.
Devices are disguised as pens, USB drives, toys, or school supplies. Flavors like cotton candy, bubblegum, and pink lemonade are designed to hook young users early. These products are sold with no testing, no oversight, and no accountability.
Despite these realities, enforcement remains limited. Federal agencies cannot police every storefront, and current state law does not clearly empower local law enforcement to remove illegal vapes from shelves or hold retailers accountable.
Without explicit authority, officers’ hands are tied, allowing bad actors to continue operating with near impunity.
Congress has recognized the scope of the problem and responded by allocating $200 million in federal funding specifically for illicit vape enforcement. Those resources are intended to support
states that align their laws with federal standards and partner in coordinated enforcement efforts.
For South Carolina to fully access those funds and participate in meaningful enforcement operations, state law must change.
Legislation currently under consideration, Senate Bill 287, would close this gap. The bill aligns state authority with federal law and gives the attorney general, as well as state and local law enforcement, the tools they need to identify illegal products, remove them from store shelves, and hold retailers accountable.
It passed the South Carolina Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support and rests on the floor of the House.
Opposition from some smoke shop operators has focused on claims of unfairness or economic harm. But that argument ignores a basic question: Why should any business be allowed to profit
from selling products that violate federal law and deliberately target children?

South Carolina now faces a clear choice. It can continue to allow illegal vapes to flood its communities, putting kids at risk and leaving law enforcement powerless.

(Photo by Mike Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A former Senate Majority leader whose opposition to legalizing same sex marriage over a decade ago drew renewed scrutiny last summer is one of four attorneys Gov. Dan McKee nominated Friday to lifetime appointments to Rhode Island’s courts.
The nominees were made to fill vacancies in Superior, District and Family courts. Each will require vetting by the Rhode Island Senate, where chamber President Valarie Lawson said hearings are still being scheduled.
“Today, I am nominating four experienced judges to serve our state’s judicial system,” McKee said in a statement. “Each brings qualifications and perspectives that will contribute to the effective administration of justice in Rhode Island.”
The most high-profile name on the list is Michael McCaffrey, a Warwick Democrat who served as the Senate’s majority leader from 2017 through the end of the 2022 legislative session. A practicing lawyer since 1989, McCaffrey is a partner at his private practice in Warwick.
McCaffrey’s candidacy drew outrage from nearly a dozen speakers who testified against a potential appointment during his July 8 interview before the state’s Judicial Nominating Commission over his opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage in Rhode Island in 2013.
Judicial Nominating Commission forwards five names to McKee for District Court opening

During his July interview with the commission, McCaffrey said his understanding of such social issues “has evolved” and promised his past political influences would not impact any decision if he became a judge.
Lawson, who was first elected to the Senate in 2018, endorsed McCaffrey, saying he has “the highest integrity, a deep knowledge of the law, and a fair-minded demeanor that will serve our state well.”
“I had the honor of working alongside Michael McCaffrey in the Senate for several years,” she said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “He is a dedicated and distinguished public servant who is exceptionally well qualified for the District Court bench.”
If confirmed, McCaffrey would fill the District Court vacancy created by Melissa R. DuBose, who now serves as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The annual base salary for a District Court judge is $199,075.
Picked to fill a Providence County Superior Court opening made following Judge Daniel A. Procaccini’s retirement May 31 is Assistant Attorney General Shannon Signore. A graduate of the Roger Williams School of Law, Signore has worked for the AG’s Office since 2002 where she now works in its Special Victims Unit.
Signore was a 2016 Beau Biden Foundation Fellow and was recognized with the Crime Victim Service Award in 2019.
A Superior Court seat comes with a $205,567 base salary.
McKee is recommending two Family Court appointments to fill  vacancies left by the retirements of judges Debra E. DiSegna and Patricia K. Asquith last year.
Picked to fill DiSegna’s seat is Andrea Iannazzi, a graduate of Suffolk University who has served as a magistrate for the Family Court since 2017. McKee’s office notes Iannazzi previously worked as a staff lawyer and mediator in the Rhode Island Family Court system and served as Gov. Gina Raimondo’s deputy counsel and as counsel to her campaign.
She also served on the Cranston School Committee for a decade.
Magistrate Alberto Aponte Cardona Sr., was picked by McKee to replace Asquith. A U.S. Army veteran and 2004 graduate of the Roger Williams School of Law, Cardona was the first Latino appointed to the Family Court bench in 2019.
He is a former assistant city solicitor in Central Falls who has served on the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and is an active member of the Blackstone Valley Advocacy Center’s board of directors.
Both Family Court seats come with a base salary of $205,567.

Listening to families, to health care providers and to experts. That principle guided my approach as an elected leader, and it guides my work with Immunize Colorado today.
Colorado recorded 36 measles cases in 2025, far exceeding the total number of cases from the previous decade. Five people have been hospitalized. Cases have appeared in 10 of our 64 counties, from Mesa County in the west to the Front Range. That may not seem like many, but for an infectious disease that can spread quickly, any uptick in numbers is cause for concern. In some of our rural communities, health officials worry the disease may be spreading undetected.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but now we are at risk of losing that status. While it may feel like a technicality, this is an important indicator of the health of a country and how safe it is for children and families.
This is preventable. Vaccines are safe and effective and one of the best ways parents can protect their children.
Unfortunately, families today are receiving dangerous mixed signals about vaccines. In early January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Housing and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced it would be changing the childhood immunization schedule, reducing the number of diseases the CDC recommends vaccinating against from 17 to 11. This change was not because of new scientific evidence or eradication of diseases. It was against the recommendation of the health care community, and it will have serious impacts on generations of American children.
Families deserve better than this. Parents deserve accurate information from trusted sources, which should include our nation’s health agencies. Here’s what the evidence actually shows: Routine childhood vaccinations have prevented an estimated 508 million illnesses and over 1.1 million deaths among American children born between 1994 and 2023.
I talk with Colorado parents regularly, and I know what they want: real information to make the best decisions for their children. They trust their doctors and nurses to give them recommendations backed by science.
Elected leaders should be reinforcing that trust, not undermining it. They should be supporting the health care providers and local public health departments doing the hard work in communities across Colorado, and the country, not creating confusion that makes that work harder.
Colorado families are counting on our elected officials to put children over politics. That means following the science, listening to the experts, and speaking up for vaccine access.
We owe it to our children to keep them safe and healthy, and leaders, like our members of Congress, must do the same. Not staying silent while RFK Jr. creates confusion for Coloradans and our children pay the price.

While in the House, he championed welfare and workers compensation reform.
Shannon most recently served as senior adviser to the Secretary for Rural Prosperity in the Trump administration.
“I got to see firsthand how, when you have a leader that has a vision, how that can make a difference,” said Shannon, who holds a law degree. “I’m coming home because I want to take that same type of America First agenda and make sure we in the state of Oklahoma are applying the same principles.”
He previously made two unsuccessful bids for the U.S. Senate and served as the former CEO of Chickasaw Community Bank in Oklahoma City and on the Oklahoma Transportation Commission. 
Shannon, 47, said because he has run for public office before, he has some name recognition, which is an advantage.
He is among seven Republicans, one Democrat and one independent who have announced plans to seek the post.
Formal candidate filing for state and legislative posts runs from April 1-3.

Ilhan Omar helped organize a hearing including dozens of Democratic members of Congress on Friday, Jan. 16, in St. Paul to discuss the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Immigrants, activists and local politicians on Friday implored members of Congress to use their influence to stop the violent arrests conducted by federal immigration officers who have flooded Minnesota under President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.
Dozens of members of Congress gathered in Minnesota to hear on-the-ground testimony and bear witness to how federal agents have menaced Minnesotans in recent weeks, especially Somalis and Latinos. But they also learned of how immigration agents’ actions have hardened Minnesotans’ resolve to fight for their constitutional rights.
Immigration raids are resulting in injuries, idling vehicles left in the streets, abandoned dogs wandering through neighborhoods and destruction of property, testifiers said. Agents are also scanning the streets for Minnesotans of color and asking for their papers.
“People are walking around on the street with their passports. That’s not American. That’s the furthest thing from it,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told the federal lawmakers. “Please take back to your respective constituencies and your colleagues the message of, if you love your own community, do not let this happen in ours.”
Friday’s hearing was not a formal hearing, but the sixth in a series conducted by U.S. House Democrats to highlight the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. The committee also invited both Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. No Republicans attended.
Newly elected St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Laos, told the committee that advisors recommended she carry her passport in case she gets stopped by federal agents. Her’s parents, who are U.S. citizens, are afraid to leave their homes for fear that their “neighbors would tell (federal agents) that that house was an Asian house.”
Trump has used fraud in Minnesota’s public programs to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending 3,000 immigration agents to the state.
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota, said many Somali Minnesotans are afraid to send their children to school, and elders are carrying immigration documents to their mosque.
“Do your job. Stand up for the Constitution of the American people. Our lives depend on it,” Hussein said.
Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Unidos Minnesota, said the immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota have caused many to distrust the federal government.
“People should not have to worry that an encounter with a masked, armed federal agent could cost them their lives. This is not about whether immigration law exists. This is about how power is exercised,” Gonzalez Avalos said.
A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens. Minnesota and the Twin Cities are also suing the Trump administration to stop the immigration surge.
U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu of California encouraged Minnesotans to keep documenting the unlawful actions of federal agents and noted that the statute of limitations for violations of federal law is five years.
“While this administration may not hold anyone accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will,” Lieu said. “All of us are here today to let the people in Minnesota know that you are not alone, that the Constitution protects you and you are on the right side of history.”
In D.C., Congress is rushing to pass annual appropriations by the end of January to avoid another government shutdown.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan hinted that House Democrats may use the actions of federal agents in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, as leverage in the upcoming budget battle.
“We have passed policies to tell them not to do ICE actions in front of schools, health centers, funerals … but we still have violations,” Tlaib said. “When Speaker (Mike) Johnson says ICE is doing what it was created to do, remember this when the funding comes up next week.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ilhan--scaled-e1768590794467-1024x666.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

John Carney from 2017 to 2025, including education policy adviser, chief of policy and deputy chief of staff.
Sheehan’s nomination is pending confirmation by the Delaware State Senate, and once approved, he would assume leadership of the State Board for the Redding Consortium decision.
DOVER, Del. Gov. Matt Meyer has nominated longtime education policy adviser Jon Sheehan to serve as president of the Delaware State Board of Education, positioning a veteran public servant to lead the board as it prepares to weigh a major school governance decision in northern New Castle County.
Sheehan’s nomination, announced Thursday, comes as the State Board of Education is expected in the coming months to review a pending redistricting proposal from the Redding Consortium, a multi-district body established under state law to recommend changes to school attendance boundaries.
The nomination requires confirmation by the Delaware State Senate.
“Jon Sheehan understands that strong public education is the foundation of a strong Delaware,” Meyer said in a statement. “He brings the rare combination of classroom experience, policy expertise and steady leadership that this role demands.”
Extensive education and policy background
Sheehan recently joined the University of Delaware’s Biden Institute as interim executive director. Before that, he served as senior adviser and deputy chief of staff for strategic operations in Meyer’s administration, working closely with cabinet agencies on education, workforce development and children’s policy.
He also served in a series of senior roles under former Gov. John Carney from 2017 to 2025, including education policy adviser, chief of policy and deputy chief of staff. During that time, Sheehan helped oversee implementation of Delaware’s Every Student Succeeds Act plan, coordinated education and childcare policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and advanced initiatives such as Pathways 2.0 and the Wilmington Learning Collaborative.
Earlier in his career, Sheehan worked for the New York City Department of Education in family and community engagement and began his professional career as a fifth-grade teacher.
Why the timing matters
The president of the State Board of Education is one of seven voting members but holds additional leadership responsibilities, including setting meeting agendas, presiding over hearings and guiding the board’s regulatory and appeals processes.
Those duties take on added significance as the board prepares to consider the Redding Consortium’s pending school boundary proposal. Under state law, once a consortium submits a plan, the State Board must vote to approve or reject it within a defined timeframe.
The issue has taken on heightened visibility after Meyer publicly called for acceptance of the Redding Consortium’s recommendation during remarks Monday at the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce’s annual dinner, signaling the administration’s position ahead of the board’s formal review.
If approved by the State Board, the proposal would advance to the General Assembly for consideration through a joint resolution and then to the governor for final action. If rejected, the board must issue written findings, and the consortium would have an opportunity to revise and resubmit its proposal.
As board president, Sheehan would oversee the review process, preside over the board’s vote and serve as the primary public spokesperson as the decision moves through the state approval process.
Reaction from education leaders
Monica Moriak, president of the Christina School District Board of Education, said Sheehan brings both experience and a collaborative approach to the role.
“Jon is an experienced policymaker who understands education and knows we must improve our education system,” Moriak said. “He’s open to ideas and input from others, and he’s a good leader.”
What’s next
Sheehan’s nomination is pending confirmation by the Delaware State Senate. If approved, he would assume leadership of the State Board during a period of heightened public attention to education policy, school funding and district governance across the state.
Sheehan holds a master’s degree in teaching from Fordham University and a bachelor’s degree in government from Wesleyan University.

It happened in Illinois in 2008, after then-governor Rod Blagojevich slashed $55 million from the state budget that was intended to fund substance abuse prevention programs and treatment centers. 
At the time, Howe was employed by the Illinois Association for Behavioral Health, a statewide organization that represents agencies that focus on prevention, treatment and recovery for addiction.

“I know of people who were thrown out of treatment who did not survive,” Howe said. “I saw it firsthand. I lived it and it was devastating.” 
Howe is currently chief executive officer of Addiction Professionals of North Carolina, a trade association for substance use professionals and providers. She spoke to NC Newsline just as the Trump administration reversed its sudden decision to terminate $2 billion in funding for drug addiction treatment and prevention programs.
The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) sent letters to service providers late Tuesday night, announcing that several critical federal grants supporting mental health and substance abuse prevention services were being terminated effective immediately “due to a shift in federal priorities.”
In North Carolina, the loss of the federal grants would have affected several programs funded by that money through the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS).
“It was eerily similar to what I saw and what I lived in Illinois,” Howe said. 
Howe’s organization receives funding through NCDHHS from one of the substance abuse prevention grants that was targeted for termination. She said it would have been “devastating” for service providers and patients. 
“It was really a wholesale decimation of the system, and I don’t say that lightly or hyperbolically,” Howe said. “When we started talking to our members, these grant terminations cut across every part of the system.”
Just as suddenly, SAMSHA sent a second letter Wednesday night reinstating the grants, but didn’t provide an explanation for the abrupt reversal. 
 “Your award will remain active under its original terms and conditions,” SAMHSA told service providers. “Please disregard the prior termination notice and continue program activities as outlined in your award agreement.”
The reversal came as a huge relief to Howe and other providers. But the chaos created by the federal move left many of them shaken and worried about the Trump administration’s commitment to their mission. 
“That’s a concern because the work we do directly saves lives,” she said. 
Howe said it forced service providers to consider tough decisions. “Providers in Illinois had to consider the same types of decisions that our providers were making yesterday,” she said. “Who do we lay off? What services do we close down? Who do we get rid of?” 
Cutting funding for drug treatment would impede the administration’s goal of stopping the flow of drugs into America, Howe said. 
“You can stop the supply all you want, but if you do not address demand, you’re not going to fix it,” Howe said. “Where there is demand, there is a supply. It’s street economic principles. I think we have to work hand in hand and recognize that we need both.”
Amy Brundle (Photo: NAMI NC)
Amy Brundle, director of marketing and communications for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) NC, said the decision to restore the $2 billion in grants was a welcome surprise. “But we really shouldn’t need to be having this conversation at all because these grants have already been approved by Congress,” Brundle said.
NAMI NC provides education and support programming to people with mental health disorders and their families. It also works to raise public awareness around mental health-related issues and how they impact people in North Carolina. 
Brundle said that “boots on the ground organizations” providing community support and direct service are meeting a need by helping to make sure that people are “alive and safe and able to function and thrive in society.”
The federal grant NAMI NC received was not targeted for termination, Brundle said, but many of the organizations the group works with would have been affected.
“Without them, I don’t really want to think too deeply about what the impacts would have been,” Brundle said. “We’re talking about catastrophic impacts over time.” 
NCDHHS grants that would have been impacted include: 

NC Healthy Transitions for Youth and Young Adults with Serious Mental Disorders
FY2023 Strategic Prevention Framework – Partnerships for Success for States (North Carolina)
North Carolina Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose-Related Deaths (PDO)
North Carolina Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs (SPF-Rx)  
NC System of Care Expansion: Focus on Governance Development and High-Fidelity Wraparound Program 

Brundle said the loss of federal funding for those programs would have created severe hardships for people with mental illnesses who rely on grant-funded health care providers for treatment.   
“Without these organizations being fully funded to do their work, there would be no community support for mental health, and not everything can be thrown back on the healthcare system,” Brundle said. “Organizations like ours exist for a reason.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/drugs_gettyimages-1004637310-1024x6271768496806-darwin_brandis__istock_getty_images_plus_720-1.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

(Photo by Ted Alcorn/NM In Depth).When the legislative session begins next week, Democratic lawmakers intend to revive a long-running effort to raise alcohol taxes as a means of reducing excessive drinking, which killed 1,755 New Mexicans in 2024, according to new Health Department estimates.
The latest proposal would create a new 3% sales tax on alcoholic beverages, according to one of the bill’s architects, Rep. Cristina Parajón, D-Albuquerque, while preserving the existing excise taxes that alcohol distributors are assessed based on the volume of alcohol they sell.
That is half the 6% levy Parajón and co-sponsors sought last session. “We think the proposal that we have this year is of the most reasonable,” she told the audience of a recent town hall meeting in Albuquerque.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth

For decades, excess drinking has been a top killer of working-age New Mexicans. In the latest estimates, a third of the deaths are attributable to acute causes like alcohol-fueled violence or vehicle crashes, and two-thirds are due to chronic causes such as liver disease and cancer.
New Mexico’s death rate declined 20% from a peak in 2021, according to the health department, but remains above pre-pandemic levels, underscoring an emergency which the state’s leaders have paid lip-service to but taken few steps to address.


Among the most effective ways of reducing demand for alcohol is increasing its price, according to public health experts, and raising alcohol taxes are the typical means of doing so. New Mexico’s existing alcohol taxes, which do not adjust for inflation, are at a 30-year low — between 4¢ and 7¢ per drink, depending on the type of beverage.In each legislative session since 2022, lawmakers have introduced bills to lift those rates. Each time, even as they have broadened their coalition and moderated their request, they have fallen short. Time and again, a wide spectrum of businesses that sell alcohol — from brewers to wholesalers to restaurants and even gas stations — has fought off the measures.In 2025, Parajón worked closely with Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, vice chair of the House tax committee, but that is still where the bill died, after two Democrats voted against it.
The pair — Patricia Lundstrom, D-Gallup, and Doreen Gallegos, D-Las Cruces — both had ties to the alcohol industry and afterwards, Cadena took the unusual step of speaking out against what she perceived as her colleagues’ conflicts of interest.
During an interim committee hearing in October, Cadena seemed more determined, and said her duty as a lawmaker “is to our people, not to the alcohol lobbyist or industry or what they determine or decide.”
Lundstrom, on the other hand, remained unconvinced. McKinley County, which she represents and which has long struggled with high rates of alcohol dependency, is allowed to tax alcohol 5%, which she said was “a good thing.” But she was skeptical of imposing such measures statewide. “I’m not going to add more taxes on to McKinley County if I don’t see a clear path,” she said.
At last weekend’s town hall, when Parajón was asked whether the new bill had a better chance of passing the committee, she hedged. “I can’t really speak to how representatives are going to vote, especially when a new bill is brought forward.”
There is a precedent for adding a 3% sales tax: Maryland did exactly that 2011. In the years that followed, multiple studies found the change reduced alcohol–related harms.
At the town hall, another bill sponsor Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, D-Albuquerque, acknowledged the lawmakers had lowered their ambitions as they sought a bill they could pass. On a $2 beer at a convenience store, for example a 3% tax comes to little more than a nickel.
“How many of you would support paying five cents for a drink?” she asked the audience, who responded with a round of applause.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention long ranked New Mexico’s alcohol-related death rate the highest in the nation but it no longer does — because last year the Trump administration dissolved the agency’s alcohol unit, and disbanded its staff.
New Mexico Health Department communications coordinator David Barre said states were sharing data with each other to make such comparisons, “but it’s a work in progress.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/parajon-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798
