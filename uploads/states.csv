(Kentucky Lantern photo by Isabella Sepahban)Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg has appointed Kentucky Senate Democratic Whip David Yates to serve an unexpired term as Jefferson County clerk. 
Yates will serve the remainder of the late Republican Jefferson County Clerk Bobbie Holsclaw, who died in early September. She was elected to the office in 1998. 
Yates will be sworn in on Wednesday, Oct. 8. The election for the next term will be in 2026, with a primary in May and a general election in November. 
Yates had announced his plans to run for Jefferson County Clerk earlier this year. He told the Lantern in May that he wanted to only serve two terms in the state Senate as he strongly believes in term limits. Yates is also a former Louisville Metro councilperson and past Metro Council president.
Another Democratic candidate, election worker Rosalind “Roz” Welch, had also declared her candidacy for county clerk. 
“David is a proven leader from the South End who has served this community in various capacities for more than a decade,” Greenberg said in a press release. “I know from personal experience that he’s focused on doing the right thing for this community every single day.”
Yates thanked Greenberg “for the faith and trust you’ve placed in me with this appointment” in the press release. 
“At the heart of the County Clerk’s office is one of the most sacred responsibilities we have in a democracy: running free, fair and transparent elections,” he said. “I promise to safeguard that trust with everything I have.”  
Yates represents the 37th Senate District and won reelection in 2020 taking more than 60% of the vote in the general election.
When Yates leaves the legislature, the Democrat’s caucus in the Senate will dwindle to five seats to Republicans’ 32 members.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSC_0452-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-03 09:57:39.285266

About two dozen residents gathered at Marydale Park Thursday to show solidarity with a group of Latino roofers who were detained by federal agents while on a job in the North End neighborhood of St. Paul.
The federal agents are “destroying the fabric of our community in which immigrants are integral,” said state Rep. Athena Hollins, DFL-St. Paul, who represents the neighborhood where the raid occurred at about 8:30 a.m. Thursday. 
The demonstrators listened to speakers, briefly chanted and sang the activist anthem, “We Shall Not Be Moved.” 
Photos and videos taken by St. Paul neighbors showed a number of agents present at the scene early Thursday, including at least one with a vest that read, “POLICE HSI,” indicating the federal agency Homeland Security Investigations. A few agents were wearing face coverings.
The agents arrived in unmarked vehicles and refused to show their identification, according to a press release from the Immigrant Defense Network and Comunidades Organizando el Poder y la Acción Latina, two groups that organized Thursday’s demonstration.
Officials have not shared the identity of the men who were detained, and speakers at Thursday’s vigil said they didn’t know their current status. Hollins said the men — estimate to be six or seven, she said — are believed to be going through processing at Fort Snelling. 
Thursday’s raid is among the thousands of operations targeting immigrants across the country as part of the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportation. 
As Sahan Journal reported this week, “Federal immigration officials announced Tuesday that they recently conducted 900 site visits and in-person interviews across the Twin Cities.” 
Demonstrators held a prayer vigil earlier this week in Appleton, MN, where the Trump administration is considering reopening a 1,600-bed prison in west central Minnesota as an immigrant detention center.
The administration is facing resistance even among unlikely sources, including a Republican-appointed judge this week.  
U.S. District Court Judge William Young, a Reagan-appointee, slammed the Trump administration for using deportations as a way to stamp out the free speech rights. 
On the subject of masked agents, Young wrote, “Masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.”
Mark Sacay, a rapid responder for a local immigrants’ rights group, said he arrived at the scene of the roofer raid just 12 minutes after he received an alert to dispatch. But even by that time, all of the men on the roofing crew were gone, as were the federal agents, Sacay said.
The roofing job looked as if its entire crew had abandoned it, with a ladder still leaning against the house, tarps covering the yard and materials sitting at the peak prepared for a productive day. 
According to a yard sign at the property, Nordic Construction was the roofing contractor.
Sacay said he met one roofer’s wife when he arrived, turned off an idling pick-up truck, attached its trailer and gathered information from neighbors. They told him that about a dozen federal agents came to the house, and there was no indication that anyone had a warrant.
Ramsey County Commissioner Garrison McMurtrey shared his anger and support for the immigrant community with the vigil’s attendees.
“They are trying to get us to divide amongst each other, and we’re saying ‘no’ to all of that,”  McMurtrey said. 
Hollins said the incident should be an awakening and a falling away of the fiction that “this couldn’t happen where we are, [that] this would never happen in our neighborhood.” 
She said she is now organizing an intervenor’s training session to educate residents about how they can help in the midst of a raid. She said she has already hosted events to educate immigrants on their rights.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5366-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-03 09:57:39.285266

“I am thankful and thrilled for the opportunity to contribute to a newsroom that has done so much work to hold people in power accountable and to serve my home state,” Santhanam said. “This moment demands fearless journalism, and I cannot imagine a place more ready to deliver on that need than Mississippi Today.” 
Santhanam has covered health stories across four presidential administrations, including the overdose crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and reproductive health care. As a fellow for the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Center for Health Journalism, she mentored journalists from across the country as they completed long-term investigations.
“We are so excited to gain the perspective of someone who not only has an impressive career in health journalism, but also an intimate knowledge of the state and its strengths and shortcomings,” said Kate Royals, managing editor of Mississippi Today. “Laura will undoubtedly strengthen our newsroom’s health coverage and be an amazing resource for the state as a whole.”
Mississippi Today’s award-winning health team was created in 2022 and is made up of three reporters and an editor. The team has covered stories including HIV prevention among minority groups, the state’s high rates of low-risk C-sections and state and local governments’ spending of opioid settlement funds.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185133/MT-Featured-Image-General-Logo.jpg,,,2025-10-03 09:57:39.285266
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-03 12:54:22+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"New FEMA flood maps prompt questions, concerns across Massachusetts",Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/environment/new-fema-flood-maps-prompt-questions-concerns-across-massachusetts/,Massachusetts property owners are navigating the need for flood insurance as disasters become more widespread and the state looks to reverse an urgent housing shortage.,"IT DIDN’T TAKE LONG for the calls to start flowing into Peabody City Hall. 
Just a week or two after the Federal Emergency Management Agency updated flood maps across the Charles, Nashua, and Merrimack watersheds this past July, residents who found their homes newly included in the updated flood zones complained to city officials that they would likely need to pay for flood insurance for the first time. 
Eventually, those concerns reached Curt Bellavance, Peabody’s director of planning and community development. For the 100 or so households in Peabody now in FEMA’s special flood hazard area and an untold number of others across the three watersheds, the bill for increased flooding in Massachusetts is literally coming due.  
“They all got a notice from their mortgage company that said, ‘Oh by the way, you owe this premium,’” Bellavance told CommonWealth Beacon in an interview. “People were like, ‘What? I’m not in the floodplain. Is this new?’” 
The frequency and severity of heavy precipitation events and flooding is increasing in Massachusetts and is projected to continue to grow over time. While coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, inland communities located near rivers and streams are also at risk and have experienced some of the most devastating flooding and corresponding property damage in recent years.  
In Massachusetts, where housing markets are already strained, FEMA’s recent expansion of its flood maps is butting up against the state’s drive to supercharge new construction. In February, the Healey administration released a plan to add 222,000 housing units by 2035, but the increase in flooding — and the fact that it’s not clear how many existing houses are now encompassed by the new maps — introduce more risk into the process, as more parcels fall into flood plains and require additional insurance to qualify for mortgages. 
When a home or business is placed in a FEMA flood zone a government-backed mortgage lender will have to require flood insurance for the property. About 55,000 homes in Massachusetts already have flood insurance, two-thirds of which have their flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program, according to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs 
“When someone says, ‘I grew up in this house, and I bought it from my parents and we never had water in 65 years,’ it’s hard to argue with that and say, ‘Well, you’re in the floodplain now,’” Bellavance said. 
The financial impact of these new maps on Massachusetts property owners is far from clear.  
FEMA doesn’t track how many new households or properties are added to a flood zone when new maps are created, according to an agency spokesperson. The state doesn’t have that information, either.  
That leaves it up to municipalities to figure out how to translate FEMA’s maps into tangible, actionable information for their residents to know their risks and to identify which households could be required to purchase flood insurance — before their lender comes knocking on the door. 
Some communities, like Peabody, have calculated the new number. In Wellesley, an additional 150 parcels of land are now in the FEMA flood zone compared with the prior map, said Eric Arbeene, the town’s planning director. And in Brookline, there are 33 additional properties in the flood zone under FEMA’s new maps, with five properties previously in the flood zone removed from the map, according to Maria Rose, an environmental engineer at Brookline. 
Others, like Middleton and Boxford, don’t have a sense of the scale of how the new changes impact their municipality’s residents, though in general more people are at risk of flooding.  
“The process was broken, in terms of getting the information out to people that were impacted,” Bellavance said.

Those data gaps and thorny flood risk questions involved in the map-making process are only bound to generate more scrutiny in Massachusetts.  
New FEMA flood maps for the Blackstone, Hudson-Hoosic, and Housatonic watersheds and in Worcester, Franklin, and Hampshire counties are all expected to move forward by the end of 2027, according to FEMA. The state estimates that some of those areas will be getting their first flood zone updates since the early 1980s. 
The new maps that FEMA rolled out for the Nashua, Merrimack, and Charles watersheds earlier this summer better incorporate data around inland flooding — a process that first started a decade ago, the agency said.  
Healey is using the new maps to further justify her environmental bond bill, which is sitting before the Legislature and would direct about $400 million to upgrading inland dams, flood control projects, and coastal infrastructure.  
“The legislation also ensures experts in disaster prevention and housing production shape the building code and requires flood risk disclosures to protect homeowners and renters,” said Maria Hardiman, a spokesperson for the state energy and environmental affairs office. “These changes will help prepare Massachusetts for the future.” 
Pricing in flood risk over time could lead to smarter decisions about where people choose to live, where the state should invest in new housing and spur property owners to protect themselves with flood insurance to minimize costly damages. The vast majority of U.S. homeowners aren’t prepared for that risk: Just 4 percent of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance despite 99 percent of counties being impacted by flooding since 1996. 
But policymakers, advocates, and homeowners are sifting through FEMA’s updates skeptical of how best to make use of the new federal data. By law, the agency only takes historical flood data into account when establishing the flood zones used to set insurance rates, not forward-looking projections that model future conditions and incorporate the effects of climate change. 
That’s created large disparities between FEMA’s flood maps and the actual risk experienced by residents. A 2023 report from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council found that 96 percent of flood damage claims filed after the historic 2010 downpours were in areas outside of FEMA’s special flood hazard areas. 
Meanwhile, an analysis by First Street, a climate risk financial modeling company that does incorporate future projections, says that there are tens of thousands more properties in flood zones in several Massachusetts counties than FEMA’s flood maps show. For example, there are 42,447 properties in the flood zone in Middlesex County compared to the 9,093 properties identified by FEMA, according to First Street’s estimates. 
“We don’t use FEMA maps that much, and we encourage communities to also not use them for planning purposes,” said Julie Wood, climate resilience director at the Charles River Watershed Association. “I know there’s a regulatory structure around the National Flood Insurance Program that these maps are central to, and that’s, of course, critically important. But our focus is on climate resilience planning and planning for the future that we know is coming, and these FEMA maps are not a good tool for that.” 
Massachusetts communities are navigating how best to build housing given their flood risks at a time in which the state is confronting a large-scale housing shortage.  
Peabody is preparing for a new 128-unit affordable housing building in its downtown section that’s fully permitted, Bellavance said. That section, near North River, has historically had flooding issues and the city has worked to improve stormwater management there. 
In Wellesley, where the median home sold for $2.4 millon in August, the town is weighing a proposal from a developer to knock down several office buildings in a flood plain on the bank of the Charles River to construct a 28-unit, four-story multi-family housing building with two parking spots per unit, Arbeene said.  
“There is a housing crisis. Everybody is aware of that,” Arbeene said. “I do think you can develop housing in a responsible manner. Development pressure in Wellesley is intense. But you don’t want to build in a risky area. That doesn’t work for anybody. I think there’s a way you can do both, and that’s why we have a flood plain bylaw and review process to ensure any development adheres to proper protocol.” 
In order for communities to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program, municipalities must adopt the new maps and minimum zoning and building code standards for structures within the flood zones, like adequate draining requirements and additional permitting for development in the floodplain, as the state model bylaw recommends.  
On the other side of town from the proposed housing project, Wellesley is confronting the fact that the town’s high school is now, according to FEMA’s new maps, in the flood zone. FEMA previously designated the high school in the flood zone during the agency’s last update of the town’s flood maps in 2012, Arbeene said, but the town successfully challenged that designation — a process any property owner can go through to contest FEMA’s determination.  
“I think most people find it burdensome,” to be newly placed in the flood zone, said Theresa Hatton, CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. “But we live in New England, and there’s so much land that is in the floodplain, therefore anyone buying a home should investigate the flood maps. If individuals opt not to buy flood insurance, if a flood event occurs and they have no insurance to help them rebuild, they’re very frustrated by that, as well.”  
The release of the latest maps put Wellesley’s high school right back in the flood zone. The town decided not to challenge that decision this time and instead pay the $3,200 annual flood insurance cost, Arbeene said. “Sometimes, it’s a cost-benefit decision to determine the cost of challenging the maps and hiring the engineers and consultants versus just paying the flood insurance,” he added. 
Those types of choices are likely playing out across the state, with more still to come as FEMA finalizes more maps. 
To better plan for a warmer and wetter world, state and local officials and nonprofit groups are building more predictive and comprehensive flood tools to inform development decisions. 
In Peabody, for instance, Bellavance said the city is reviewing a draft resiliency plan that includes models for projected conditions decades down the line. The city aims to adopt new zoning regulations around that plan early next year. 
The Charles River Watershed Association, in partnership with 20 municipalities, has developed its own flood modeling to support planning and necessary infrastructure upgrades along the river. The state, too, has developed its own coastal sea level rise projections and is working on similar efforts for inland flooding.  
“People are concerned,” Arbeene said. “They don’t want to be in a flood zone. We have been getting calls from people who said, ‘Hey, my mortgage lender said that I’m in the flood zone, can I get out of it? How do I get out of it?’”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Charles-River-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)FARGO — It wasn’t just how steep the federal cuts to public broadcasting were, but how immediate they were that is taking a toll, Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS told people in Fargo on Thursday. 
In response, PBS is trying to provide a financial bridge to affiliates that are most reliant on federal funding, which she said are often in rural and remote areas. 
“A lot of people are coming together to help us figure this out,” Kerger said. 
Federal and state funding cuts caused Fargo-based television and radio broadcaster Prairie Public to lose about 25% of its revenue.
Thursday’s event titled “State of the Station: The Road Ahead for Prairie Public” came a day after Prairie Public announced it eliminated 12 staff positions because of the cuts.

Kerger said a silver lining is seeing philanthropists, foundations and other supporters stepping up. 
“Every amount is important,” Kerger said. 
Prairie Public set a fundraising goal of $25,000 before the event, which it exceeded, though an official total raised at the event was not immediately available. 
Greg and Rebecca Hauge of Fargo said they increased their financial support of Prairie Public a couple of years ago. 
Greg Hauge called the funding cuts a “big setback” but said he hoped that it might also create some opportunities to stimulate fundraising. 
The Community Foundation of Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and Region stimulated the fundraising by announcing a $30,000 grant if Prairie Public raises matching funds. 
Spencer and Danielle Salmon are North Dakota natives who live in Moorhead, Minnesota, raising two children. 
They said they appreciate the programming from PBS Kids that promotes inclusion of children with disabilities and other aspects of diversity. 
“It’s safe content and no one is trying to sell them something,” Spencer Salmon said.
Their family was included in a video highlighting Prairie Public supporters. Danielle Salmon singled out an episode of “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” that dealt with food allergies, something her daughters deal with. 
“That was so helpful to help explain what was going on and some of the testing they would have to do,” she said. 
Danielle Salmon said she was hoping to come away from the night with a sense of community among other Prairie Public supporters.

Those supporters got a chance to ask questions of Kerger and Prairie Public President and CEO John Harris.
Asked where other cuts might be made, Harris said “that’s what we’re evaluating.” He added  that the staff positions cut were over a variety of departments. 
Kerger said some people expected the Public Broadcasting Service to go away with the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
In July, federal lawmakers rescinded about $1.1 billion in previously approved congressional spending that was to be distributed to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and its affiliate stations across the country. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced Aug. 1 its plans to close in response to the federal cuts, with a majority of staff positions ending Sept. 30.
While that entity is winding down, Kerger said PBS will carry on, though it, too, may have to adjust what it is able to offer. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Kelly Armstrong proposed $2.9 million for Prairie Public for the 2025-27 budget cycle, including $1.7 million in one-time funding for transmitter replacement and maintenance. Lawmakers reduced the overall state funding to $400,000, providing money for tower improvements. Some lawmakers had advocated for cutting off funding to Prairie Public completely.
Armstrong and first lady Kjersti Armstrong stopped at Thursday’s event briefly after spending the day in Fargo. 
Kjersti Armstrong had served on the Prairie Public Broadcasting board, a position she resigned when Kelly Armstrong was elected governor. 
“Prairie Public serves really important needs in North Dakota for education and safety and information. I am sure that it will continue to thrive and serve the population,” Kjersti Armstrong said.

,California,2025-10-03 12:35:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers keep dodging tough bills by not voting. Here are the worst offenders,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/california-lawmakers-dodging-votes/,"In the California Capitol, lawmakers almost never vote “no.” These three Democrats have decided it’s OK to buck protocol and vote against their colleagues’ bills","In summary
In the California Capitol, lawmakers almost never vote “no.” These three Democrats have decided it’s OK to buck protocol and vote against their colleagues’ bills


There’s a green button for “aye” and a red button for “no” on Concord Assemblymember Anamarie Ávila Farías’ desk.
She feels obligated to push one of those buttons for every bill that comes her way in the California Legislature – even if hitting the red one might make her an outlier among her Democratic colleagues. After all, they almost never vote against bills, particularly those authored by their fellow Democrats.
She voted “no” this year 41 times. That’s the most of any of California’s 90 Democratic lawmakers, who each voted “no” on average less than nine times in about 2,200 opportunities. That’s less than 1% of the time.
“There’s no third button,” Ávila Farías said in an interview. “I feel that people sent me to Sacramento to make hard decisions, and I have to answer to the voters, and laying off a bill is not showing up to represent my constituents.”
“Laying off” refers to a widespread practice in the Capitol: Instead of casting a “no” vote, lawmakers regularly choose not to vote at all. Not voting counts the same as “no.” It also counts the same as when a lawmaker isn’t there to cast a vote.
An analysis of the CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database, which tracks every vote in the Legislature, found that the average Democratic lawmaker missed close to 100 votes on bills this year. Republicans miss even more votes, despite, on average, casting a “no” vote 53 times more than the average Democrat. The minority party’s 30 lawmakers missed an average of nearly 400 votes this year, the analysis found.
It’s extremely difficult for the public to know if these non-votes were because a lawmaker had an excused absence or if they just dodged tough decisions. The Legislature’s public-facing bill tracking website, where Digital Democracy gets its information, records all missed votes exactly the same: “NVR,” short for “no vote recorded.”
Critics say the Legislature has made voting records opaque for a reason: It allows lawmakers to avoid accountability.
“Somebody’s voting record is the single most appropriate way for a voter to understand how they’re being represented in Sacramento, because it’s black and it’s white,” said Jon Fleischman, a longtime political strategist and conservative commentator. “When you go to look and you see that there’s ‘no vote recorded,’ you obviously don’t know what that means.”
Such criticism isn’t new. Last year, CalMatters and its partners at CBS News collaborated on an Emmy award-winning investigation on the consequences of lawmakers killing popular legislation by not voting on bills. Yet the practice shows no sign of abating. At least 22 bills failed in roll-call votes this year due to so many lawmakers not voting. They include controversial measures on criminal sentences, bear hunting, suing oil companies, streamlining housing permits, rural schools staffing and ballot initiative disclosures.
Why one Democrat doesn’t dodge votes
There seems to be little appetite in the Capitol to provide the public with a better accounting of missed votes versus absences.
The Legislature’s Democratic leaders, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire of Santa Rosa and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas of Salinas, did not respond to interview requests for this story.
Former lawmakers and Capitol insiders tell CalMatters that lawmakers who vote “no” risk annoying colleagues who might see a public rebuke of their bill as an insult and retaliate. They say lawmakers also fear angering wealthy lobbying organizations that have come to expect lawmakers to “hold off” on the rare times Democrats aren’t voting “aye” in lock-step. Democrats who control the Legislature voted “aye” on bills this year an average of 95% of the time, according to Digital Democracy’s analysis, which excluded votes on routine resolutions.
Ávila Farías voted “aye” at a pace in line with her fellow Democrats, but instead of not voting when she didn’t like a measure, she decided early this year to vote “no.” 
Ávila Farías said the only time she chose not to vote on a bill happened near the start of the session shortly after being sworn in for her first term. Someone later asked her if she didn’t vote because she was “wandering” the hallways, implying she shirked responsibility. After that, she said she decided to always cast a vote.

“I’ll make sure that I’m very consistent and that you always know where I am on these bills,” she said.
So far, she said she’s not experienced any retaliation from her colleagues. If anything, she said her “no” votes have led to productive conversations that helped her colleagues improve their bills.
Meanwhile, she said was disappointed to learn from CalMatters that she had missed 22 votes this year. She said she tried her best to be present and vote on every measure, but a few inadvertently slipped by her.
“I’ll do better the next round and make sure it’s a zero,” she said.
Two other Dems aren’t afraid to say ‘no’
Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains had 36 “no” votes, the second most of any Democrat.
Bains, who’s running for her Bakersfield-area congressional district, has never been particularly shy about voting “no,” even if it irks her Democratic colleagues. 
In 2023, she cast the lone Democratic “no” vote against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s bill that sought to punish oil companies for raising gas prices while earning record profits. Her vote drew immediate rebukes from Democratic leaders and Newsom’s office.
“At the end of the day,” she said, “I just hear what my community tells me and what they thank me for.”
Bains also missed 202 votes this year, causing her to have the tenth-highest rate of missed votes among Democrats. She said she usually chooses not to vote on a bill if she’s not comfortable with the current version but she believes it can be changed later to address her concerns.
“Sometimes it does, and then I end up supporting,” she said. “And sometimes it doesn’t.”
Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat representing the Rancho Cucamonga area, said he decided to vote “no” while he was running for his first term last year after reading a CalMatters story on Democratic Assemblymember Mike Fong of Alhambra. CalMatters reported that until then, Fong had never voted “no” in his legislative career.
“No knock on Mr. Fong,” Garcia said. “But I did feel that if you’re … going there to Sacramento, it’s to know the bills and to take a position and, you know, and not be on the sidelines.”
Garcia voted “no” 31 times this year, the third most of any Democrat. He missed 57 votes, which he said he didn’t intend to do.
Garcia said he got his schedule mixed up during the frantic final day of the legislative session, and he ended up not being present for part of the marathon push to vote on the hundreds of remaining measures pending before the deadline. Digital Democracy data shows that Garcia missed 25 votes on the final day of the session. 
For his part, Fong voted “no” four times this year. He only missed six votes, the lowest rate of any rank-and-file lawmaker. Fong didn’t return an interview request for this story.
Republicans skip votes even more
Republicans continued this year to have substantially more missed votes than Democrats, due, they say, to having so little input in the legislative process. Republicans cast plenty of “no” votes though. The average Republican voted “no” 22% of the time.

Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego had the highest percentage of “no” votes among the GOP legislators. He voted against bills 36% of the time.
DeMaio, who missed 135 votes this year, said he’s been trying to press his Republican colleagues to vote “no” more often instead of holding off.
But DeMaio leveled his sharpest criticism about not voting on the Democrats who control the Legislature.
“It’s the chickenshit way of saying, ‘Well, I think this is a really bad bill, but I don’t want to offend my colleague by voting ‘no,’ ” he said.
Fleischman, the conservative political commentator, says Republicans chicken out plenty, too.
He noted that several Republicans declined to vote on a slavery-reparations bill because they didn’t want to appear “against descendants of slaves, even though they knew the policy was bad.”

Tom Lackey, one of the nine Republicans who did not vote on the measure when it was on the Assembly floor, didn’t deny that rationale. 
Lackey, who represents the Palmdale area, said he didn’t want to appear insensitive to Black members of his community. To him, since not voting counts the same as a “no,” it was a more polite way to oppose the policy.
“The way you say ‘no,’ sometimes it matters,” Lackey said. “And sometimes a soft ‘no’ is called for.”
Should absences count differently?
There’s also the question of whether it’s fair for legislators with excused absences to have their missed votes count the same as “no” votes. Some other states do it differently. Hawaii’s Legislature, for example, doesn’t count absent lawmakers when tallying votes.
Some of the lawmakers with high numbers of missed votes had excused absences this year.
They include Republican Assemblymember Kate Sanchez of Orange County, north state Republican Sen. Megan Dahle, Democratic Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes of San Bernardino, Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan of San Ramon and Democratic Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove. Each missed hundreds of votes due to medical reasons or other excused absences.
Bauer-Kahan and Nguyen responded to CalMatters requests for an interview; the others did not. Bauer-Kahan sent an emailed statement that said of her 299 missed votes, more than 200 were due to excused absences.“Many, if not most, were while I was participating in critical discussions with global policy leaders about government’s role in fostering AI innovation while ensuring the safety of our communities,” Bauer-Kahan said.
Her office didn’t answer questions about whether the public should be able to more easily determine if their lawmakers missed votes because they weren’t there.

Nguyen said in an email that 75% of her 313 missed votes were due to absences, but she said she believes abstaining is a “responsible tool that reflects careful judgment” when a lawmaker doesn’t fully support a bill. 
She also doesn’t feel the vote-tracking system needs fixing, saying the Legislature shouldn’t add more bureaucracy “because the system already makes clear whether a member voted yes, no, or did not vote.” 
Republicans Lackey and DeMaio said they’d prefer the option of voting “present” as members of Congress do when they don’t want to take a position on a bill. At least that way, Lackey said, people would know they were at work that day.
Fleischman said it would be relatively easy for legislative leaders to change the vote tally to reflect absences on the Legislature’s website.
“You’ve got ‘NVR’ for ‘no vote recorded,’ and you should have an ‘ABS’ for ‘absent,’ ” he said.
Bains, the Kern County Democrat, said she thinks it’s worth considering such a change.
“I think that transparency would be welcomed by both sides,” she said. “I don’t see why it wouldn’t be.”

Jim Berk
Jim Berk is CEO of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.


Whether by design or by quiet submission to a rapidly-evolving digital landscape, the world’s largest social media companies have allowed their platforms to become factories of division, dehumanization and, increasingly, real-world violence. 
What began as tools for connection have become engines of rage. It’s no accident. It’s business.
At the heart of this transformation lies the engagement algorithm: a seemingly neutral mechanism that curates what billions of people see, like, share and believe. 
Algorithms are not neutral. They are engineered with a single purpose — to keep us on the platform, clicking, commenting and scrolling. In the race to capture attention, one emotional trigger outperforms others: anger.
Outrage spreads faster than facts. Posts that inflame generate more engagement than those that inform. The algorithm doesn’t care if a post is divisive or harmful — only that you can’t look away. The result is an attention economy where the most profitable content is often the most toxic.
This isn’t a theoretical concern. We see the consequences every day, as online harassment and hate speech metastasize into offline assaults. 
A measure now awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature, Senate Bill 771, represents a vital step toward a safer and more civil digital arena. The bill would give Californians the ability to hold the largest social media corporations accountable when their algorithms materially contribute to violations of civil rights under California law.
Social media companies may protest that they never set out to radicalize users or to profit from polarization. That may be true. But intent is not the measure of accountability. And their refusal to actively prevent these outcomes amounts to complicity. 
Consider a few examples: Facebook’s internal research confirmed that its algorithm promotes divisive content because outrage drives clicks, and in Myanmar its negligence in moderating incitement against the Rohingya minority helped fuel a campaign of ethnic cleansing. X, formerly known as Twitter, has admitted that hate speech surged following changes in its content moderation. In Los Angeles and New York, antisemitic hashtags trending online preceded attacks on Jewish institutions. 
The dots are no longer hard to connect. Online hate fuels offline harm.
If signed, SB 771 would not establish speech codes. It would not punish free expression. It would ensure that platforms face consequences when their business practices amplify harassment, threats or discrimination already unlawful under state law.
This is a narrow but essential intervention. Just as product liability laws hold car manufacturers accountable for defective airbags and pharmaceutical companies accountable for unsafe drugs, so too must we hold social media companies accountable for foreseeable harm caused by defects built into their core business models. 
California has led the nation in establishing guardrails for industries that shape our lives, from consumer product safety to environmental protections. This bill would follow that tradition. 
The stakes are high. In Los Angeles County, antisemitic crimes rose by 91% last year, while hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities hit record highs. Teachers report that slurs and bullying spread through classrooms at the speed of a trending meme. And parents are finding their children radicalized by extremist content that algorithms push into their feeds.
This is not about politics. Protection against hate must transcend ideology. This is about whether Californians have recourse when hate becomes harm. Teachers, parents, faith leaders —Californians of every background have a stake in this fight.
Imagine logging on tomorrow to digital spaces where hate is sidelined by design rather than rewarded with reach, where algorithms are aligned with human dignity instead of inhumane rage. 
With SB 771, California can set that precedent. Newsom can send a clear message: the safety and civil rights of Californians take precedence over Silicon Valley’s bottom line.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/032721_Asian_Hate_Crime_LA_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/10/immigration-raids-kids-mental-health/,Kindergartners repeat worries heard at home. Older kids text to check on parents during class. Therapists say mental health is at risk now and in the long term.,"In summary
Kindergartners repeat worries heard at home. Older kids text to check on parents during class. Therapists say mental health is at risk now and in the long term.  


A new school year brings an array of feelings: excitement, anticipation, nervousness, homesickness. Maria Caballero Magaña, a K-8 school counselor in Oxnard, knows these feelings well — familiar companions as students return to campus. 
This year, however, she and other counselors detected acute emotional reactions: anxiety, sorrow and fear after a summer of intensified immigration raids. 
Families in this majority Latino, agriculturally-centered part of Ventura County are still coming to terms with the mental health consequences of immigration enforcement. Children and their parents express worry that they may be ripped apart at any moment. Some already have.
“People were emotional, angry, fearful, and it affected everyone,” Caballero Magaña said from her office at Juan Lagunas Soria Elementary School. “Because if it wasn’t happening to you personally, it was happening to your neighbor, it was happening to your best friend’s family.”
“I have never experienced anything like that,” she said.
The Oxnard School District isn’t alone. Immigration raids are straining mental health among children and school communities across California, a state where about 1 million children have a parent who is undocumented and about 300,000 students are undocumented themselves.
Experts say these raids and their aftermath may also have long-term consequences. Constant vigilance and worry puts children at greater risk of developing chronic anxiety and depression. Those who are separated from a parent face a host of social and emotional challenges.

Instead of focusing on classes and friendships, children and adolescents in targeted communities are forced to confront issues beyond their years, said Mario Prietto, a psychotherapist at Sylvia Mendez Clinic, a student and family wellness center operated by St. John’s Community Health in Boyle Heights, just east of downtown Los Angeles.
“They set these big dream goals for the future, but then they also are stuck in this present,” Prietto said. “They’re like, ‘Can I just be a kid or do I have to all of a sudden be an adult?’”
Oxnard’s summer of fear
In July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swarmed a licensed cannabis farm in Camarillo, detaining hundreds of workers. One man died trying to flee from agents. That event and raids prior brought panic into Oxnard classrooms, said Vanessa Ruiz, a mental health clinician with 14 years of experience. 
During summer school, Ruiz said, she was called into a classroom where kindergartners were repeating their parents’ worries — often, what parents heard on the news — but not understanding the gravity of the situation. 
“I know some of the kiddos that I was working with [would say] ‘Oh, my mom is crying, my dad is crying,’ and so that’s what they wanted to talk about,” she said.
Children with a parent in detention told Ruiz they couldn’t sleep at night. They stayed up wondering when mom or dad would come home.

The seaside city of Oxnard is one of the most diverse communities in Ventura County.  The influence of immigrants has long been established here. Vibrant murals downtown tell the story of early settlers and of immigrants working and building the region’s agricultural industry. 
Ruiz and Caballero Magaña described the days following the raids as heavy in Oxnard schools. According to the school district, at least half a dozen children were separated from a parent over the summer, most often a mother. 
School officials called the families of every student in the weeks after the raid, checking in on them and offering counseling and support if needed. Ruiz said students who were separated from a parent were connected to more intensive county mental health services.
Ruiz says she’s noticed a particular burden for oldest children. They speak to her about having to protect younger siblings if a parent is taken, she said.  First-born children are taking on new responsibilities, like helping their parents look for and speak to immigration lawyers. 
Caballero Magaña says students she has counseled who don’t know if their parents will come home from detention may react in a range of ways.

“You’re starting to see a bit of a shutdown in some cases,” she said. “Others are super emotional, and others are like, ‘I’m OK.’ There’s a variety of emotions going on.”
Absences and cancelled appointments
Around the state, the consequences of immigration raids have shown up this year not just in the emotions of children and teens, but in their behavior. 
Children in areas affected by raids are more likely to skip school. After immigration operations in the San Joaquin Valley earlier this year, according to one Brown University study, schools in Kern, Tulare, Kings and Fresno counties saw a 22% increase in absences compared to previous years.
In Los Angeles, therapist Maria Jarquin directs school-based mental health centers on behalf of Venice Family Clinic. She estimates that schools refer about 10 to 15 students to her mental health center each week. As many as a third of those referrals are prompted by stress and anxiety over ICE activity, she said. 
“Just in this short [school] year, I’ve seen promising students withdraw from activities that they love because this fear consumes their energy,” Jarquin said. 
Some students have told Jarquin that they like to keep their cellphones on their desks so they can text their parents every so often and make sure they’re safe. 
“Can you imagine taking a lesson of geometry when a part of your brain is tracking and texting your parent every once in a while?” Jarquin said. “That’s really, really difficult to do.” 
But at a time when kids and their parents may need significant support, they may also be more hesitant to seek it, said Prietto. Most of his youth patients are students at Los Angeles Unified schools who are growing up in mixed-status households.
Prietto says that he’s noticed more cancellations and openings in his calendar in recent months. He suspects that’s because families are choosing to isolate, only stepping out for the absolutely necessary. Over the summer, medical clinics in Los Angeles reported a similar trend of missed and cancelled appointments when raids started escalating there. 
He follows up with families and offers virtual visits. Some families, he says, are glad to accept the virtual option, but others are too burned out by screens, a common sentiment since the online learning days of the pandemic.
Overwhelmingly, the youth of Generation Z — a group ranging from teens to 25-year-old adults — report mental health challenges, according to a recent poll from Blue Shield of California and the youth advocacy and policy group Children Now. They worry about guns, about the economy, climate change and discrimination. At the same time, says Prietto, teens are savvy and some will seek help on their own, noting they need to vent or that they’re “crashing out.”

Prietto says he is often impressed by young people’s resilience, but he also acknowledges some of his patients are up against harsh realities. They do talk to him about immigration worries, especially what their life would look like were a parent to be detained. “‘Well, if my dad’s deported, I have to step up and work,’ that comes up a lot, he says. Children and teens feel the burden to support their families. 
Some teens even talk about leaving California themselves if their parents were to be deported. That’s another thing Prietto hears: “‘Maybe I’ll go back with my dad.’”
Over time, ‘layered forms of trauma’ 
In September, the Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower-court order that had barred immigration agents in Los Angeles from “roving” patrols. The Trump administration has regained the authority for raids that are based on multiple factors, including appearance and accent, in Southern California. 
Immigrant and mixed-status households are likely to be on heightened alert for the foreseeable future, experts say, raising health risks for children and adults.
Research has shown that children who are at risk of deportation or who have a parent who is at risk tend to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues. These types of events are what experts call adverse experiences — and a higher number of adverse experiences can lead to toxic stress, which can negatively impact brain development and overall health.
A team at UC Riverside compiled clinical data and research on children across the country for a report detailing lasting harms from immigration policy. Dr. Lisa Fortuna, a child psychologist and the report’s lead author, wrote that children and parents face “layered forms of trauma.”  
Her report cites a a 2020 study published in JAMA Pediatrics, that showed that Latino children ages 11 to 16 who had family members who were detained or had been deported in the last year were at higher risk for suicidal ideation. 
Fortuna said that tracks with what she saw when she worked in hospitals in years past — cases where teenagers attempted suicide related to the terror of deportation and family separation. 
It’s the feeling of “I will not be able to exist if my life is turned around this badly,” Fortuna said. 
Schools offer stability, and an escape
When students miss school, it’s a warning sign for school counselors and mental health clinicians. Children usually need a routine to thrive, both academically and emotionally – and counselors and therapists like Caballero Magaña and Ruiz say if children are absent from the classroom, it’s harder to notice behavior changes and other mental health symptoms. 
In its public education system, the state has been investing in mental health needs, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic.

A growing number of public schools in California provide on-site mental health services: access to therapists, psychologists and wellness coaches.  A much smaller number of public schools have entire health centers on campus or next door, sometimes in partnership with local clinics; they offer medical and dental services along with mental health care.
In 2021, California launched a one-time $4.7 billion initiative to support youth mental health programs both outside and inside schools. Those programs include setting up hotlines, wellness apps, support groups and training more staff who can support and screen children. 
But while some of that state funding is meant to be sustained — schools will soon charge the Medi-Cal program for health services — other state grants, particularly from the pandemic era, were designed to expire. Federal mental health dollars are precarious, as the Trump administration yanks and changes grant programs. 
That can make it hard to plan for sudden increases in mental health threats like immigration raids.
Ruiz and Caballero Magaña remind their students of their open door policy — anyone is welcome to come and talk. Their goal, they say, is to simply hold a safe space for students.
Schools provide children and teenagers routine and stability, Ruiz said, and, if even for a brief time, a space where they can escape the heaviness of the outside world.
Child psychologist Fortuna said there is a role for schools, health providers and community groups to rally around youth during times when they may be feeling especially stressed and vulnerable. 
“If young people feel like they’re cared about, they’re heard, people are concerned about what’s happening to them, and are trying to implement things to help them, then that can go a very, very long way, and we can’t lose track of that,” Fortuna said.

Pregnancy Justice, a nonprofit that defends the rights of pregnant people, found that Alabama prosecuted 192 women from June 2022 to July 2024, the first two years after the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. 
Most of the prosecutions are related to drug use, according to the report. Many are concentrated in Etowah County, which in recent years has cracked down on drug use while pregnant, using a 2006 chemical endangerment law intended to protect children from meth labs, according to a 2023 AL.com analysis. A message seeking comment from the Etowah County District Attorney’s Office was left Thursday afternoon. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the report, at least 412 prosecutions have happened in the two years following the Dobbs decision, most of which were involved accusation of drug use during pregnancy.
A’Niya Robinson, policy and organizing director of the Alabama American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said in an interview Thursday that prosecutors should prove that any drug-related crime was done with the intent to harm a woman’s unborn child before they punish them. 
“That’s a really big issue. If you’re going to charge a mother with harming her child, you at least need to be able to prove that that’s what she set out to do,” Robinson said. “They’re not necessarily proving that intent element, or if they are, we’re not really seeing it in the records.”
The report found that about 85% of cases did not require proof of harm.
Robinson also said that for a state that prides itself on a pro-family platform, prosecuting pregnant women without proof of intent is not true to the platform.
“The fact that someone who maybe does suffer from substance abuse, the fact that that is being met with incarceration and not something that feels a bit more merciful, like treatment, that’s also something that is weighing on me as well,” she said.
Robinson said that incarcerated pregnant women are generally not taken care of, including not having time with her child when they are born during the mother’s sentence. The ACLU worked on legislation last year to allow a pregnant woman’s report date to be delayed until 12 weeks after birth. The bill was never considered. 
“For a state like Alabama that prides itself on really caring for families and mothers, we don’t always do the best job at that,” Robinson said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alabama’s infant mortality rate was 7.64 death per 1,000 live births in 2023. In Alabama, the infant mortality rate for Black infants was 12.4 per 1,000 live births in 2022. That’s an increase from 11 deaths per 1,000 in 2018, when numbers started to increase after a drop from 15.3 per 1,000 live births in 2015. For white infants, the mortality rate in 2022 was 4.3 per 1,000 live births, an all-time low. 
White infants account for 69.8% of births in Alabama but make up 44.5% of deaths. Black infants account for 28% of births but 51.4% of deaths, according to the CDC.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pregnantwoman-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234
,California,2025-10-03 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California businesses bear brunt of  growing unemployment benefit debt,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/businesses-unemployment-benefit-debt-california/,California employers and taxpayers are paying off the state's growing debt from a $20 billion federal loan used to cover unemployment claims.,"Companies owned by President Donald Trump have declared bankruptcy six times, a reminder that a corporation that defaults on repaying money it has borrowed is often forced into bankruptcy court.
Several California cities, including Stockton and San Bernardino, that unwisely made pension promises to their employees that they could not keep also wound up before a federal bankruptcy judge.
And then there’s California’s state government.
Five years ago, California borrowed $20 billion from the federal government because its unemployment insurance system didn’t have enough money to pay a strong surge of claims. More than two million Californians had lost their jobs after Gov. Gavin Newsom forced many businesses to shut their doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
California was not alone in borrowing to maintain benefits for jobless workers, although no other state approached its huge debt, and all others — most recently New York and Connecticut — have repaid their loans. And California’s debt is still increasing.
Even though the state’s unemployment rate, currently at 5.5% of its workforce, is just a third of what it was in 2020, it’s still the nation’s highest, with more than a million jobless workers. California’s Employment Development Department is paying out $7.4 billion to those covered by unemployment insurance this year while collecting less than $5 billion in payroll taxes.
California’s debt will reach $23.2 billion by year’s end, according to the state’s most recent report, and it’s likely to grow even more in 2026. The state’s also on the hook for more than $600 million a year in interest.
Since California hasn’t repaid its loans and is still borrowing money, federal officials have hiked payroll taxes on California employers. As the California Business Roundtable recently noted in a report, the state’s employers will soon pay a 5.2% payroll tax — nearly nine times as much as those in other states that are debt-free — plus their state payroll taxes.
This is a gigantic mess born of shortsighted political decision making and cowardice.
A quarter-century ago, California had a comfortable surplus in its Unemployment Insurance Fund but the Legislature and then-Gov. Gray Davis began draining it with a sharp increase in benefits.
When the Great Recession struck the state a half-decade later, the fund was quickly exhausted and California borrowed about $10 billion to keep benefits flowing, eventually to be repaid through an increase in federal payroll taxes.
However the fund never regained substantial reserves because even after recession ended, benefits continued to take everything the state was collecting via payroll taxes.
Meanwhile there was a political stalemate, pitting employers against unions over what should be done about the income/outgo conundrum that continues to this day.
There’s a widespread belief, even among officials who should know better, that California unemployment insurance debt stems from billions of dollars in fraudulent claims that also occurred during the pandemic-caused recession.
In fact, the fraud, while real, involved a separate program of extended benefits financed completely with federal recovery funds. California’s huge debt involves only the state’s unemployment insurance system.
It’s questionable whether employers should even be on the hook to repay the loans, because the underlying surge in unemployment was caused entirely by the state-ordered business shutdowns, not a natural recession or employer-ordered layoffs. It’s a cost that should have been born by the state budget, like other impacts of pandemic.
Financing unemployment insurance benefits with federal loans and imposing taxes on employers to service the debt cannot continue indefinitely. It also leaves the system vulnerable to any future economic downturn.
The crisis is another reminder of California’s chronic lack of accountability for wrong-headed governance.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/051424-Unemployment-EDD-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

(Photo courtesy of the SC Governor's Office)COLUMBIA — Local law enforcement would get bonuses for helping find and arrest immigrants living in the country illegally under a grant program U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday he planned to propose.
Nationwide, the number of law enforcement agencies signing cooperation agreements with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has skyrocketed since the Trump administration encouraged participation in the 287(g) program — named for the section of a 1996 law that authorized it — and revived its controversial “task force” model earlier this year, despite concerns about racial profiling from advocacy groups.
As of Thursday, 20 sheriffs and five police chiefs had inked agreements. As had the State Law Enforcement Division and the Department of Public Safety, which operates the state Highway Patrol, according to the program’s website.
The tally includes three South Carolina counties — Horry, York and Lexington — that initially signed so-called “jail enforcement model” agreements more than a decade ago.


The counties and cities that agreed to help out the federal government took on extra responsibilities with no promise of more funding, even as they face staffing shortages, said Graham, a Republican who spent Thursday talking to sheriffs about the problems they faced.
The massive tax policy and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 included funding to reimburse law enforcement agencies for salaries and benefits of officers hired to carry out the agreements, as well as quarterly bonuses based on the number of immigrants an agency finds who don’t have permission to be in the country.
Graham, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, wants to take that a step further, creating a national fund of $1 billion, which participating states, counties and cities could use to give officers bonuses. The amount of funding would depend on the type of 287(g) agreement the agencies entered into, Graham said.
Sheriffs and police chiefs can choose any of three types of agreements.
Officers operating under the so-called “task force model” can challenge a person’s immigration status during their normal police duties and work alongside ICE officers on enforcement. The two state agencies participating have opted into this agreement. As have a dozen of South Carolina’s local law enforcement departments.

Another agreement trains officers to serve warrants on undocumented immigrants already in jail for something else — called the “warrant service officer” model. The third, the “jail enforcement model,” lets local agencies identify people in their jail subject to deportation, according to the program website.
During the first seven months of the year, only two counties, Horry and York, reported using the agreement, according to monthly updates compiled by ICE. Both counties have jail enforcement agreements most recently signed in 2020.
The most recent ICE report, issued in July, came before only two new participants signed on: the state Department of Public Safety and the Olanta Police Department, which serves a Florence County town of about 550.
Part of Graham’s goal is to get the state enough money to do away with state law limiting veteran officers’ ability to collect both a salary and retirement benefits. Officers who can retire but still want to work must take a year off after officially retiring in order to collect both a salary and their full pension.
Their other option is to take a 30-day break. But then they’re limited to $10,000 annually in pension payments as long as they continue to work.
The rules for rehired retirees, written into the state budget to help rein in the state’s pension debt, forces longtime officers to leave already understaffed police departments, Graham said.
“These are the cream of the crop,” he said. “These are the best of the best.”
Newberry County, which has an agreement with the federal government to serve warrants on immigrants, has lost three of its top officers in the past year because they reached retirement age, said Sheriff Lee Foster.
All three found higher-paying jobs for private companies during their year off, keeping them from wanting to return to the department, Foster said.
“I said, ‘If you were able to retire and return, would you have stayed and served the people of Newberry County?’” Foster said. “And each one unequivocally said they would have stayed.”
Graham estimates it would take about $150 million to end the rule and not add to the state’s pension debt.
“I want to help fix that problem, and the way to do it is to have the federal government reward states like South Carolina, who help the federal government with one of its biggest problems, illegal immigration,” Graham said.
With the government shut down as senators butt heads over temporary funding, any proposal Graham might make is far from reality. A quicker solution might come from a similar state-funded program, Gov. Henry McMaster said, without giving details.
SLED joins law agencies nationwide helping street-level immigration enforcement

“This plugs a gap in our system,” McMaster said. “As we grow — and we are growing, and more people want to invest in our people here — we’ve got to keep this state safe, and this takes us a long way toward doing that.”
Advocates for the American Civil Liberties Union disagree that the agreements make the state safer. Instead, immigrants may be less likely to report crimes out of fear of being questioned and deported, said Dulce López, who oversees the human rights organization’s strategy on immigrant rights.
“It erodes public trust,” López said.
The “task force model,” especially, could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling as officers search for people who they believe might be in the country illegally, López said.
“For South Carolina to encourage this type of policing is very concerning,” López said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2SEhMXWYAAI2b6-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Tonya Jones was days away from being evicted when she began scouting out bridges and tunnels around Southern Nevada where she and her 3-year-old daughter could potentially sleep if they couldn’t find a place to stay.
Jones had been able to work from home since the pandemic. But in the summer of 2022 when she unexpectedly lost her child care, she couldn’t make it to work, lost her job, and quickly fell two months behind on rent. 
“I found a job in the middle of September, a week before my actual eviction day,” she said. “I just needed a little bit more time.”
On a rainy September morning as a lockout of her apartment loomed, Jones remembered calling and emailing countless resources looking for help when she stumbled upon Family Promise of Las Vegas, a nonprofit that provides shelter and support services for families and children experiencing homelessness. 
The organization put Jones and her daughter in an extended stay motel for the next several weeks until she was able to save up money and move into her own place. Jones, 43, and her now 6-year-old daughter, have been stably housed ever since. 
The number of families experiencing homelessness has grown over recent years in Southern Nevada, but there aren’t a lot of shelter options, especially private rooms, available for them, said Family Promise’s chief operations director, Marisa Cervantes. 
Gender and age restrictions often lead to families being asked to go into separate shelter spaces.  
“A lot of times they’re often faced with a hard decision to make, whether it’s to separate and go into different shelters or to maybe sleep in their car, a park or somewhere where people are not meant to be,” Cervantes said.
Family Promise recently opened its 10-room Family Navigation Center to provide much needed transitional housing for families with minor children who are experiencing homelessness. The organization hosted a grand opening of the complex near Twain and Eastern avenues Sept. 30. 
In addition to private rooms, families will receive case management and wraparound services to help them obtain secure housing  stay employed. 
The opening of the complex comes as Nevada, like much of the country, is seeing a rise in homelessness. Nevada saw a 17% increase in the number of unhoused people last year, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Southern Nevada’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count, an annual snapshot of homelessness on one particular night, identified 7,906 unhoused people. The finding was a 20% increase from the previous year, and a 13-year high. 
The count, often called the homeless census, is unable to capture the complex nature of homelessness, and the figure is considered an undercount. 
Of the number counted in 2024, the report found nearly 20% included families with children. The report doesn’t include the actual number of families counted.
The 2023 report found there were 794 families with children experiencing homelessness in Southern Nevada, 12% of the total point-in-time count that year. 
As the need for housing grows, Family Promise receives hundreds of calls every day from families seeking help, Cervantes said. 
The end goal is to make sure all families they assist become stably housed, but some families need a transitional space to stay while they stabilize. 
These families “just need some extra support so they can get that job, save the income and they can find housing that fits their needs,” Cervantes said. “We’re here to, like, step in and fill that gap.”
The Family Navigation Center cost about $14 million and utilized funds from Clark County andthe City of Las Vegas as well as private donations. 
The first family moved into the complex June 29. Another nine families joined shortly after. The first two families to reside at the complex have already moved on to stable permanent housing, Cervantes said. 
A private space
Family Promise wasn’t the first time Jones had sought shelter in Southern Nevada. 
After leaving an abusive partner in 2019, she and her then 4-month-old baby stayed at a domestic violence shelter. 
“I stayed in a room when there were eight women and children,” Jones said. “We shared one bathroom.”
Because the location of the shelter was kept confidential for the safety of residents, Jones would get up at 5 a.m. every morning and walk several blocks before calling a rideshare.
She would then drop her baby off for care before heading to work. Jones would pick up her child and return to the shelter late in the evening, doing same thing over and over again for several weeks before she transitioned into her own apartment. 
“It was not the best model,” Jones said of the shared shelter space, especially compared to a private room she stayed in with Family Promise. 
In both instances, it didn’t take long for Jones to find her footing and get stably housed. She wouldn’t have been able to do it without a place to stay in the interim. 
Filling the gap
When Family Promise was first founded 29 years ago, it relied on a network of interfaith organizations to house families experiencing homelessness inside churches.
Like other government agencies and nonprofits, Family Promise began placing families experiencing homelessness in extended stay motels as shelter several years ago.  
Even though they have the new Family Navigation Center to house up to 10 families, Cervantes said they still plan to use extended stay rooms to serve the sheer volume of clients in need of help.  
The organization served 788 families, or roughly 2,400 individuals, last year, with 91%of those families moving on into stable housing, she said.
Families usually stay with the organization’s program for about 90 days before moving on to permanent housing. Even after they leave the program, families get 30-day check-ins from the nonprofit over the next several months to ensure unforeseen problems didn’t arise. 
“Many people are aware that there’s a major affordable housing crisis in our community,” Cervantes said. “For every 100 households who are low income in need or looking for affordable housing, there’s only 17 units available.”
The figure Cervantes cites comes from a 2025 National Low Income Housing Coalition report, which found “Nevada needs to make 78,000 more homes affordable for extremely low-income households.”
Even before Covid-19 shut down the state, the nation, and most of the world, Family Promise had been working toward opening up its own transitional housing complex. 
It had secured federal and local funding to build the complex prior to the pandemic and had land donated from Clark County.
“Then the pandemic hit, inflation happened, and the cost for construction skyrocketed,” Cervantes said. 
The vision to open the facility was pushed back several years while the organization raised additional funds and applied for more federal and local grants.
The complex means the organization is able to expand the number of families experiencing homelessness it serves. 
Families Promise also tries to help people obtain rental assistance and other support services to stave off homelessness, Cervantes said. 
“If they experience some type of unexpected hardship, loss of a job or loss of hours because of illness, child illness, or whatever it may be, if it’s a justifiable loss of income we can step in to pay their rent and utilities,” she said, as an example. The organization can help “fill that gap, to prevent them from losing their home.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1468-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

Gavin Newsom is raising money from labor unions and Democrats all over the country for his redistricting ballot measure. Republicans are pouring in money to fight it.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom is raising money from labor unions and Democrats all over the country for his redistricting ballot measure. Republicans are pouring in money to fight it.


With five weeks until election day, the fight over changing congressional districts in California to favor Democrats has already become one of the most expensive ballot measures in recent state history.
The official campaigns supporting and opposing Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Proposition 50 reported raising more than $215 million as of Oct. 2, with more than $100 million raised in September alone –  the third most of any proposition for at least the past decade. Campaigns only spent more money on Prop. 22 in 2020, which would have changed the employment status of Lyft and Uber drivers, and Prop. 27 in 2022, which would have legalized online gambling.
The campaign to support Prop. 50, led by Newsom, raised more than $138 million with $49 million, or about 40% of the total, coming from donors who gave less than $100. Most of those contributions were reported by the House Majority PAC. Five major donors collectively contributed a little more than $25 million. They were:

$10 million: House Majority PAC, a SuperPAC focused on electing Democrats to Congress;
$10 million: George Soros’ Fund for Policy Reform, which focuses on drug policy and electoral reform, according to IRS filings;
$6.9 million: MoveOn.org, a liberal grassroots organization;
$3 million: The California Teachers Association, a powerful union with close ties to Democrats;
$3 million: The National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country that gives overwhelmingly to Democrats.

Newsom also transferred $2.6 million from his 2022 gubernatorial campaign. More than 68,000 unique contributors gave money to the “Yes” campaign, according to a CalMatters analysis of data from the California Secretary of State.
The groups opposing the redistricting measure are relying on two major donors who gave more than 90% of the $77 million raised for their campaign. They have a smaller share of small donors, raising $8,300 from people who gave less than $100. Below are the top five donors:

$42 million: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Super PAC controlled by Republican leadership in Congress;
$33 million: Charles Munger Jr., who contributed to the original ballot measure that created the independent redistricting commission;
$1 million: Kevin McCarthy, former Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who transferred the money from his campaign account, far less the $100 million he said he would raise a few weeks ago;
$1 million: Thomas Siebel, a Bay Area billionaire businessman who is related to First Partner of California Jennifer Siebel Newsom;
$50,000: Republican donor Susan Groff.

Other groups unaffiliated with the campaigns are spending money, too.  At least fifteen organizations spent more than $540,000 in support through ad buys and outreach, while at least seven groups spent more than $570,000 in opposition.
Newsom proposed the ballot measure after the Trump administration pressured the state of Texas to gerrymander its congressional districts in a way that would flip five Democratic seats to Republican in the upcoming 2026 midterm election. 
Newsom needs voter approval because Californians created an Independent Redistricting Commission through a 2008 ballot measure. Prop. 50 would suspend the maps drawn by that independent commission until 2030.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/093025-PROP-50-FINANCING-1-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234

Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, in the Alabama Senate chamber on Tuesday, June 6, 2023. (Stew Milne/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama senator is refiling a bill that would change some provisions to sexual education in public K-12 schools.
SB 3, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, would require schools to “exclusively teach sexual risk avoidance and encourage abstinence from all sexual activity.”
Sexual risk avoidance is defined in the bill as “primary prevention approach to sex education that seeks to achieve the most favorable health outcomes for all Alabama youth.”
The bill prohibits schools from “providing a referral to or information about how to acquire an abortion;” “misrepresenting the efficacy of or demonstrating the use of contraceptives,” and “using images that are sexually explicit.”
A message seeking comment was left with Sen. Shelnutt Thursday. Shelnutt filed a similar bill in the 2025 legislation session. It got approval from a Senate committee but failed to move out of the chamber, in part due to a Democratic filibuster.
Christina Clark Okarmus, executive director for Alabama Campaign for Adolescent Sexual Health, a non-profit organization that works to reduce the rate of teen pregnancies in the state, said the bill’s provision to prevent schools from “using the services of any individual or organization that does not endorse sexual risk avoidance or that advocates for or performs abortions” is harmful.
“There are a number of organizations that provide good, adequate sex education that may also, in another branch of their organization, provide abortions or referrals for abortions. And those two things should not cancel one another out,” Okarmus said.
The state’s teen birth rate is significantly higher than the country as a whole. Alabama’s birth rate for females aged 15 to 19 in 2023 was 20.3 per 1,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the seventh-highest in the nation. The national average that year was 13.1 per 1,000, according to the CDC. 
Nationally, in 2023, people aged 15-to-24 made up 48% of all reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
Okarmus said abstinence should not be the only message students are taught in sex education classes.
“We believe that abstinence is a very important part of the conversation, but it is not the only part of the conversation, and that is what the goal of this bill is, to make it to the absence only until marriage is the only thing taught in public schools. So we are firmly against that,” she said.
Okarmus said contraceptive demonstrations such as showing students IUDs, birth control pills and condom demonstrations are helpful. 
“Condom demonstrations are a really important tool in ensuring that young people know how condoms should be used, and so that they can use them themselves if and when they need to do so,” she said. “There’s lots of research that shows that showing young people [how to use a condom] and then letting them practice on the model is very helpful for them.”
The bill would also require that parents are given a 14-day notice to opt their children out of the classes. Okarmus said this is a good measure.
“We believe that parents should be the first teachers of sex ed, and we want to be partners with them in teaching sex ed. So if a parent is not comfortable with a sex ed class being taught, that is of course, like we support their ability to opt out,” she said.
The Alabama Legislature will begin meeting on Jan. 13.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Leg-7267-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-03 08:57:00.808234
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-03 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"At manufacturing summit, CT businesses highlight tariff concerns",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/03/ct-manufacturing-summit-federal-tariffs-cbia/,Business owners and executives said federal policy changes are adding uncertainty to an already complex business environment.,"With a shifting international trade landscape and unexpected federal policy announcements, tariffs are top of mind for Connecticut’s manufacturing sector. As the state’s manufacturing community gathered this week, business owners and executives said federal policy changes are adding uncertainty to an already complex business environment. 
Hundreds of those business leaders turned out Thursday for the annual Made in Connecticut: 2025 Manufacturing Summit, hosted by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state’s largest trade group. The event served as part celebration and part brainstorming session, with speakers noting that while the manufacturing industry is still seeing some growth and strong profits, that success is offset by job losses and other challenges. 
In the past several decades, Connecticut manufacturers have been frustrated in their efforts to attract a skilled workforce and state support while jobs and output rose in sectors like healthcare, education and insurance. Recently, large shifts in federal policy have further complicated the landscape.  
Those hurdles have prompted some adjustments in how Connecticut officials view progress. Last year, Gov. Ned Lamont pivoted away from calling for manufacturing job growth, instead urging companies to focus on boosting productivity — as new tools like AI, automation, and robotics play a larger role.
National trade policy complicates operations
In recent months, the Trump administration has pursued sweeping tariffs, raising import taxes on goods brought in from numerous countries. The tariffs, the administration argues, will ultimately help American manufacturers by igniting increased domestic production to replace items that were previously imported. 
Some countries have responded with their own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, making it harder for U.S. producers to send goods overseas and — in the case of some agricultural products like soybeans — shutting down exports almost entirely. These policies have strained tensions with countries like China, Mexico, and Canada — some of Connecticut’s strongest export and trading partners. 
Speakers at Thursday’s summit noted that the frequent shifts in tariff policies this year have been difficult for some local manufacturers to navigate, in part because the new taxes have often been introduced with little warning.
“We need more of a flow of information between industry and the administration before tariffs go into effect,” said John Murphy, a senior vice president and head of international trade policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Concerns over tariffs have been raised by manufacturers across the state. In a survey of Connecticut manufacturers CBIA released Thursday morning, 66% of manufacturers said tariffs were affecting their work negatively. Nationally, businesses have cited the recent tariffs as affecting supply chains and raising costs. 
At Thursday’s event, several speakers questioned whether the tariffs were necessary or beneficial. “The breadth of these tariffs is broader than it needs to be, than it should be,” Murphy said.  
With new tariffs on imported furniture and other items set to go into effect this month, there’s little indication that the administration intends to back down from its strategy.
That’s left some manufacturers frustrated, with speakers suggesting the tariffs could be blunting the impact of other pro-business actions taken by the administration in recent months.   
“Somebody can say, ‘Oh, it’s just short-term pain for long-term gain,’” said Martin Baumann, president of ARBURG Inc., a manufacturer of plastic processing machines. “But the short-term pain is real, and I don’t think it’s that short-term.”
In 2025, CT manufacturers are seeing growth – and facing headwinds
Connecticut’s manufacturing industry is also looking to reinvent itself and reverse declines that were intensified by the pandemic. So far, the industry has only recovered 39% of the manufacturing jobs lost during the pandemic, according to the report. And in the past year — between September 2024 and August 2025 — the sector lost 1,800 jobs.
Currently, there are 4,591 manufacturing companies in the state according to the manufacturing survey. The majority are classified as small businesses, a category spanning companies with fewer than 50 employees to those with as many as 500. In total, the sector employs some 153,600 people in the state.
Manufacturing is still a significant part of the Connecticut economy: In 2024 manufacturing accounted for 11.6% of the state’s GDP. Connecticut ranked 27th nationally and second in the New England region for exports. 
And many businesses are having financial success, 70% of surveyed firms turned a profit last year, while another 14% broke even. The remaining 16% reported losses.
Even so, profits alone don’t tell a complete story of the state of local manufacturing. According to the survey, 82% of manufacturers are having difficulty with worker recruitment and retention. And nearly all said they are also dealing with rising costs.
“This year’s report highlights both the enduring strengths and the pressing challenges facing Connecticut manufacturing,” Chris DiPentima, CBIA’s president, said in a press release. “Manufacturers are growing despite navigating numerous headwinds including increased labor, healthcare, and energy costs.”
Many of the findings of the manufacturing survey echo concerns previously raised by the broader Connecticut businesses community. In September, a separate survey from CBIA found that employers in all sectors were facing a challenging trifecta of labor woes, rising costs and uncertainty due to federal policy.
With so many shared concerns, Connecticut’s manufacturers are proposing a shared solution: collaboration and investment in initiatives aimed at bringing companies together. One such effort, the CBIA Manufacturing Coalition, was formally announced on Thursday.
The hope, supporters say, is that Connecticut’s manufacturers will build something together that they can’t accomplish alone. 
Beatriz Gutierrez, head of manufacturing consultancy CONNSTEP, said, “Amid ongoing labor shortages and supply chain uncertainty, it is strong partnerships like these that will give manufacturers the tools and voice to position the industry to grow and thrive.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MadeinCT2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 07:57:13.821868

A year ago, we found out one of New Jersey’s oldest and most well-respected papers, the Star-Ledger, would stop print production. Now, after two brutal rounds of layoffs, NJ PBS will cease as well. While media conglomerates promise high-quality digital content, we have lost sight of the importance of accessible, reliable, local journalism. Too many of our “local” outlets have become overrun with generic listicles and click-baity national headlines.
New Jersey has invested millions in becoming a hub for the film and entertainment industry — yet here we are poised to let our only public broadcast station fall. What does it say about us, as a state, if we’re willing to spend more money vying to attract Hollywood productions than in ensuring our citizens have access to reliable, quality news about their communities?
The state’s film tax credit program is allocated $100 million a year, and yet NJ PBS lost $750,000 in this year’s budget, leaving them with a fourth of the funding they had in years prior. As more and more outlets shift to online-only models, we’re leaving behind a huge swath of our population who simply want to pick up their daily paper or tune in to a nightly broadcast. We seem to forget that not everyone has the same access to smartphones and computers.
Having worked in the Legislature, I recognize the importance of accessible, quality journalism. It is not just about those of us “inside the beltway,” it is about the everyday citizens of our state who are continuously asked to work harder and shell out more money to find out what is happening around them. NJ Spotlight News anchor Briana Vannozzi has done an incredible job keeping the public informed, and while WNET has promised to keep her nightly broadcast going, it is not enough to rely on their good nature for such an intrinsic public good.
Throughout my time working in Trenton I’ve watched the Statehouse press corps dwindle, and adapt to the ever-changing news media landscape. We’ve seen storied institutions continue to cut veteran beat reporters and refocus their attention on what can garner the most views and bring in the biggest ad buys. It’s not to say there isn’t outstanding work being done by reporters across the state. New Jersey is fortunate to have many incredible reporters holding public officials accountable and keeping the public informed, but they are constantly asked to do more with less, and we’re all suffering for it.
At a time when people are inundated with fake news and misleading headlines, we have a responsibility as a state to ensure access to well-researched, easy-to-understand, nonpartisan coverage of what is happening both in Trenton and within our communities.
NJ PBS and NJ Spotlight News have been a mainstay in statehouse reporting for years, reliably offering in-depth coverage of complex issues facing our state. For New Jersey to lose our only public broadcast station would be a tremendous loss. I am hopeful that the Legislature and the incoming governor will see the value in continuing the station and work towards a solution. We owe it to our residents.

Burlington is facing serious challenges. They are complex but solvable — and they require exactly what we do best: creativity, collaboration, optimism and good old-fashioned hard work. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sam Donnelly: Let’s build a better Burlington.","This commentary is by Sam Donnelly, of Burlington. Donnelly is the executive director of Building Burlington’s Future.


Burlington is more than just a beautiful place. Just like the rest of Vermont, it’s full of neighbors who are always willing to show up for one another — a community that doesn’t look away from hard problems. Burlington is a city where people care deeply and are willing to take action to make it better.
But right now, our city is facing a pivotal moment. Lately, a lot of people in and around Burlington don’t feel as safe as they used to, whether they’re downtown for work, running a small business or spending time with their family. 
For some, a sense of public safety in our community is at a historic low. At the same time, we know that some of our neighbors and community members are struggling with issues like substance use, mental health and homelessness. 
Today, Burlington residents have seen an increase in those experiencing homelessness, and although our average household income is around $97,000, our poverty rate is roughly 23% — nearly double the national average.
This is not OK, and as Burlingtonians, we must vehemently reject this as our status quo.
Over the past decade as a community organizer, I’ve learned that inclusion is not a spectator sport. Community building and bringing about positive change requires engagement, hard work, trust and a strategy that empowers people. It also takes an incredible amount of empathy for others, even if you disagree with someone. 
When I worked for Planned Parenthood on the Reproductive Liberty Amendment campaign, I met a lot of people with whom I passionately disagreed — and many of whom the campaign won over because we took the time to meet voters where they were and took their concerns seriously, never invalidating their views simply because of those disagreements. That is what movement building looks like in practice. So, above everything else, I’ve learned that grassroots organizing can cut through anything. 
That’s why earlier this summer, we — former city leaders, local employers, advocates and activists — launched Building Burlington’s Future, a new nonprofit focused on policy change and grassroots advocacy. 
Our primary goal: Be the unifying grassroots force that our city desperately needs right now, so we can build a community where everyone has opportunities for long-term success. 
Building Burlington’s Future will focus on a shared vision for our city’s future. Here’s our core set of beliefs that will guide our policy and advocacy work:

We believe in a city that is safe, healthy, inclusive, welcoming and diverse.
We believe in a city where both long-time and new residents can afford a life here. 
We believe in a city where there is ample housing of all kinds — and for everyone. 
We believe in a city that looks out for everyone and takes action when people are at risk, whether from violence, crisis or neglect. 
We believe in making access to services straightforward, local and timely — so people get what they need, when they need it. 
We believe our city should be a place where no one feels ashamed to ask for help — and where support comes without judgment or stigma. 
We believe in a city that supports its local businesses.

Burlington is facing serious challenges. They are complex but solvable — and they require exactly what we do best: creativity, collaboration, optimism and good old-fashioned hard work. This is the approach Building Burlington’s Future has used in our first few months since launch, and we’re just getting started.
We’ve supported the Peace & Justice Center and Vermont Harm Reduction Advocates to help clean up trash and used needles in downtown Burlington. Soon, Building Burlington’s Future will be introducing a Burlington City Council resolution to secure more permanent funding for this weekly clean-up program. 
We’ve offered accessible organizing and advocacy resources to residents in support of City Council resolutions that make sure residents can voice their thoughts directly to our city’s elected officials. Most recently, we supported a City Council resolution that aims to bolster City Hall Park as a shared, public space, which ultimately would make our downtown a safer place for all. 
Ensuring residents feel seen and heard as part of the city’s policy-making process is key to our collective success.
We’re supporting the Burlington Police Department in their revamped recruitment efforts because everyone in our city has a stake in bringing high-quality candidates into the force. At the same time, we are backing community-led initiatives, like needle pickup and clean-up crews, practical steps that make shared spaces safer and more welcoming for all, and gives residents a way to get involved.
These early initiatives for Building Burlington’s Future are just the tip of the iceberg. Our main objective is to remove barriers and make it as easy as possible for everyday Burlingtonians — no matter if you’ve lived here your whole life or if you’re just moving in — to have an impact on what’s happening in our city.
I will never stop loving Burlington and I know you feel the same. So what do you say — will you join us?

Since 2020, the state Department of Natural Resources has made N95 respirators available upon request to wildland firefighters not engaged in directly attacking fires, a department spokesperson confirmed. 
This lines up with the new guidance issued for federal wildland firefighters last month, allowing those not working directly on the fireline to wear an N95 mask if they want to.
Even with the state policy and new federal mask guidance, advocates for firefighters say there are still significant gaps in protecting firefighters from smoke and other toxins they encounter.
Federal policy previously prevented wildland firefighters from wearing face coverings other than bandanas under the reasoning that masks could interfere with their work or cause them to overheat. 
N95 masks can provide some protection against exposure to smoke, which decades of research links to cancer, lung disease and heart problems. 
Allowing wildland firefighters to use N95s is a step in the right direction, said Bobbie Scopa, a retired federal wildland firefighter and member of the wildland firefighter advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters. 
“But N95s are not the answer to our problems,” Scopa said. 
A well-fitted mask requires a clean seal to be effective, which makes them difficult for men with facial hair to use. 
The masks typically aren’t fitted well enough in the first place to maintain that seal and stay in place through the intense manual labor firefighters regularly do. 
“It’s hot, and it’s sweaty, and it’s moving all around your face,” Scopa said. 
The masks also muffle voices, which can make verbal communication a challenge. 
Because of those difficulties, and because the masks are not mandatory for wildland firefighters to use, Scopa said that wildland firefighters are unlikely to use them regularly.  
Additionally, while N95s protect against smoke and particles in the air, they do not protect against gases, vapors, oils and other chemicals wildland firefighters are regularly exposed to. 
There are no respirators currently available for wildland firefighters that do filter all the harmful substances they are exposed to on the job. 
Mandatory protection gear for wildland firefighters has not changed much since 1977, even though their exposure to smoke and other dangerous fire-related substances has increased dramatically in that same timeframe. 
Some companies have dabbled in making full-face respirators for wildland firefighters over the years, but the discomfort of wearing them in the heat and the inability to communicate through the filter made them impractical. 
“This is something that, from our perspective, needs more research and some better understanding as far as best practices and recommendations,” said KC Whitehouse, a battalion chief with a county fire department and a representative of the Washington State Council of Firefighters, a coalition of firefighter unions that advocates for professional firefighters, including wildland firefighters, across Washington. 
Without adequate respiratory protection for wildland firefighters, the Washington State Council of Firefighters and Grassroots Wildland Firefighters advocate for reducing firefighters’ exposure to smoke and harmful substances when possible. 
In an effort to reduce exposure, incident managers for large fires have begun bringing in air resource advisors to monitor air quality, according to Whitehouse. 
He recalled being part of the response to the Sourdough Fire in the North Cascades in 2023, and how the data collected by the air resource advisors contributed to the decision to pull firefighters off the line. 
“The air quality was so poor that we couldn’t justify the risk-benefit of having firefighters up there,” Whitehouse said. 
The Department of Natural Resources will continue evaluating new ways to protect the state’s wildland firefighters, an agency spokesman said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wildland-firefighter-california-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 07:57:13.821868

(Courtesy Indiana Department of Labor)Indiana’s business climate has been an advantage for a decade or more — consistently landing the state enviably high in various economic development metrics. But that tide might be turning, and some mayors are concerned about the change.
Gov. Mike Braun brings a different style — and fewer handouts to corporations. He repeatedly attacked the state’s previous goals for focusing only on large companies while failing smaller businesses while on the campaign trail.
Crawfordsville Mayor Todd Barton said that sudden shift is causing companies to back away from the Hoosier state.
“They don’t trust us. They don’t trust the state of Indiana,” he told a panel of lobbyists and public relations experts last month. “There’s a loss of sense of direction. And I’m not going to say I totally was always on board with the direction before, but we had a direction, right? And sometimes it was a little confusing, but at least we had a sense of direction.”
Barton said on recent trips with site selectors he has seen a decided shift against bringing investment and job growth to Indiana.
“For years, we’d go to those meetings and they were like, ‘Oh, you’re from Indiana. You guys are rock stars…we’ll put projects in Indiana every single day.’
“This year, I’ve been on three different trips, and every single trip, all we heard was, ‘Eh, we don’t know.’ We do not have — to the outside world — a clear economic development policy in the state of Indiana right now. Period. “
And it’s not just anecdotal.
In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth. The state especially excelled in the key categories of overall cost, access to qualified labor, business incentive programs, logistics and infrastructure.
Compare that same ranking for 2025. Indiana dropped to 12th for top states to do business.
And here is how Indiana fared in key categories:

Overall cost – 1st to 5th
Access to qualified labor – 4th to 6th
Availability of sites – 4th to not ranked
Business incentive programs – 3rd to not ranked
Logistics and infrastructure – 3rd to 7th

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation has had some organizational changes in the last nine months. Its executive director left in September after being hired in January. Braun replaced the entire board in June, and the quasi-governmental agency has been part of a forensic spending audit.
Lawmakers also mandated the hiring of a second leader, and that still hasn’t happened five months later.
“Gov. Braun’s economic development strategy is to grow jobs and increase wages. He is prioritizing regional input and leadership from around the state, which is a shift away from the central Indiana-focused approach of recent years,” said Commerce Secretary David Adams. “This strategy is already working, as the most recent numbers show, with incentivized jobs paying on average $8,000 more per year and costing only a third of what they did a year ago.”
Braun has urged his administration to focus less on large employers in central Indiana, instead looking at growth opportunities for communities around the state. A large swath of counties also have resisted energy-related developments such as wind, solar and data centers, which could be impacting rankings.
Last week, the governor highlighted that year-over-year, the average wage of jobs incentivized by the IEDC to come to Indiana has increased from $37 to $41, a 10% increase. The average cost per incentivized job decreased from $55,000 per job to $16,000 per job.

That’s partly because the state no longer has federal money to spend for incentives. Under former Gov. Eric Holcomb there was hundreds of millions to give out. But the budget for the IEDC has dropped 60% — meaning less money to spread around.
The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.
From an outside perspective, I can say that the IEDC was a free-wheeling, secretive entity that had entirely too much leash. And I appreciate that Braun is taking initiative and getting it under control.
Noblesville Mayor Chris Jensen said on the same panel with Barton that there are two things business leaders ask about most: health care and utility costs — both things lawmakers have wrestled to get under control.
Braun has recently targeted high energy costs in the state, appointing a new official to represent ratepayers and urging state regulators to think less about utility shareholders and more about Hoosiers paying the bill. His administration pushed certain health priorities over the finish line during the legislative session, but some had to be scaled back to get votes.
But Jensen also acknowledged that part of the problem is a changing of the guard since Braun took over in January.
“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor. And I think what we need to do right now is get out of our own way and go tell our story — and boldly tell our story. Not just in Indiana, but around the country and around the world. And have a clear message and a clear messenger,” Jensen said.
“I think it starts at the very top. We have to be visionary, we have to be bold, we have to be excited. We have to be transformational, and we have to get out of our own way.”

Last year I spent 730 hours — one month — running, logging a total of 4,105.2 miles.
I was not running along the North Shore of Lake Superior in my hometown of Duluth, which is my favorite place to run. I was not running on any one of the numerous trails in this great state. I did not even run a single official race last year. 
No, I was running all year in the tiny prison courtyard at Minnesota Correctional Facility Lino Lakes.
There is nothing I would rather be doing than distance running. I love the rhythm of my footsteps as I trudge through the snow as the wind whips my face. I feel alive when I am running. It is as though all the anxiety and cares of this world fade away. I have found a way to take all the nervous energy I hold inside and burn it as fuel when the going gets tough. Pushing my body to its limit has provided a new sense of freedom that I have not experience outside of running.
I am 38 years old and have been a distance runner my entire adult life. But I never ran an ultramarathon — anything over the traditional 26.2 miles — until I came to prison. 
Prior to the pandemic, the prison yard and courtyard were open for just 45-minute intervals throughout the day. My motto was: All Yard, Every Yard, I Run. 
This equated to 20 miles on a good day.
During the peak of the pandemic, I was confined to my cell for 21 hours a day. The other three hours I was allowed to go outside to the courtyard. I decided I was going to run the entire time — every day. The pressure created by the quarantine was my fuel to run. After six  months of running, I propelled myself into the best shape of my life. Little did I know, I was training for an ultramarathon.
In January 2022, the COVID-19 protocols were finally lifting. I anticipated the schedule to return to normal. 
The unthinkable happened: Everything changed — for the better! The courtyard was now open from 7 a.m. until sunset when the yard lights came on. I could not believe it — for the first time in my life I ran an ultramarathon — by accident. I set out that first day under the new policy to run as long as I could; it never even crossed my mind that I may run farther than I have ever run before — I put in 30 miles.
This was the beginning of my ultra career.
I have never looked back since leaping forward into this new realm of freedom. For 14 months, I made the best use of this inadvertent policy change. I ran as much as I could, as often as I could, for as long as I could.
The courtyard I ran on is a paved concrete triangle between two living units. One unit was shut down due to staffing issues, and the other was my housing unit.
The triangle was super small. I measured it using dental floss and found it was 294 feet for one lap, or 18 laps per mile.
One long leg of the triangle was 40 strides long, and two short legs were 26 strides apiece. That’s 92 steps per lap. There were two acute angles and one right angle with a few feet of elevation change. It is the oddest track I ever ran on, but necessity turned it into the ground of my greatest triumphs.
The weather was my friend. The -40° F windchill or 106° F heat index did not stop me last year. I have lived in Minnesota my entire life and know there is no such thing as bad weather — only bad clothing. In the winter, I dressed in layers, including a pair of mittens that I sewed out of socks. I used petroleum jelly under my eyes to prevent frostbite. 
In the summer, I ate ramen noodle seasoning packets in lieu of salt pills, drank water by the gallon, and changed my wet clothes as often as I could. 
Feeling the weather was how I knew I was still alive.
The cool thing about my running track was that it sat next to the Lino Lakes water tower, a large outcropping of cottonwood trees, and the southbound lanes of I-35W. 
If you looked west when you drove by during those years, you might have seen me out running.
It might not seem like much to the everyday person, but I found a new appreciation for the small things. I had a gopher friend who poked his head up every once in awhile. A pair of bald eagles flew overhead and patrolled this piece of land. Small airplanes flew overhead, as if to see what is going on at this facility. The sunrises were a beautiful way to start a run and the sunsets signaled the end.
On March 12, I started running at 7:19 a.m. and — except for two mandatory counts — did not stop until 7:08 p.m. for a total of 56 miles. It was the best run of my life.

(Photo of audit's cover page)The Indiana Economic Development Corporation released a lengthy forensic analysis after a legal review Thursday, part of an ongoing effort by Gov. Mike Braun to reform the embattled, quasi-public state agency to restore public trust. 
In particular, the private company tasked with reviewing the entity flagged eye-popping spending by its nonprofit — which is funded by an opaque system of donors — on international trips. 
“When questions are raised about how taxpayer dollars are being used, we take that seriously.  That’s why we ordered a full forensic audit — no shortcuts, no politics,” said Braun in a statement. “The results are clear and this matter is resolved. We are now forward-focused on investing in, building and growing Indiana companies together.”

The final, 127-page report reviews past practices and provides recommendations for future action, emphasizing both transparency and identifying areas where governance and oversight must be strengthened.
“We have already begun this work,” said Secretary of Commerce David Adams, in a memo briefing Braun. 
Adams said all votes must now occur before the IEDC’s full board of directors and not in small committees. Additionally, the nonprofit arm — the Indiana Economic Development Foundation — had spending frozen in April. That entity will now “wind-down.” 
A formal investment policy will “ensure taxpayer dollars are directed toward Indiana businesses,” and “conflict-of-interest checks with board members are now part of standard procedure.” 
“These steps are not merely corrective. They reflect a deliberate effort to protect taxpayer resources, restore confidence and position Indiana’s economic development funds as a model of best practice,” concluded Adams. 
In addition to the IEDC and its foundation, the audit also focused on Elevate Ventures, the Applied Research Institute and the Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace District — otherwise known as LEAP, which has become a controversial Boone County economic development project. 
Braun promised an “audit” of the IEDC in April, after Indiana Legislative Insight reported allegations of self-dealing and more among IEDC and its partners. In May, Washington D.C.-based FTI Consulting began work. The contract is worth up to $800,000 and extended for a year.
In a preview last week, Braun’s office said there were no criminal findings within the audit. However, FTI flagged “concerns about the potential for favoritism and misuse of public funds.” 
 More from the audit

The Indiana Economic Development Foundation was set up in 2005 as a nonprofit organization to raise and manage private contributions and help fund the state’s economic development priorities.
Administrations in the past have refused to disclose who the major funders are for the entity, which largely paid for international travel for the governor and other economic development officials.
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb traveled extensively on the foundation’s dime, including 27 international trips during his eight-plus years in office.

The review ran from Jan. 1, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024, and identified 107 entities that donated $6 million. Sixteen donors made up 78% of the total. They included NIPSCO, Duke Energy, CenterPoint Energy, AES Indiana, Indiana Michigan Power, Rolls-Royce, Hoosier Energy and Old National Bank.
But the identity of eight others is still shielded by a state law that prohibits public agencies from requiring nonprofits to share certain personal information. Public agencies are also prohibited from disclosing personal information. 
Of the 107 entities that made donations to the foundation, 46 were identified as having received $238 million in either payments or tax credits from the IEDC during the review period. 
“Discussions with IEDC personnel indicated that due diligence is conducted and ‘waivers’ are used to ensure there is no quid pro quo. As such, FTI requested supporting documentation (e.g., invoices, evidence of due diligence, etc.) for a sample of contributions. While invoice support was provided, no additional documentation was made available to demonstrate that any review or due diligence was conducted on the contributions, including consideration of potential conflicts of interest,” the audit read.
The review found the foundation spent $13.4 million, mostly on dozens of domestic and international trips.
FTI noted several expenses that appear to be excessive in nature. In 2022, the foundation paid over $86,000 for international car race tickets and events while incurring $70,000 in expenses for expedited VIP airport services and $700,000 in payments to hotels, including some high-end brands.
“Furthermore, travel accommodations were not limited to state employees and officials, as FTI also identified approximately $167,000 in international travel costs related to three family members of state officials,” the review found.
On one 2022 trip to Egypt for an international climate conference, the budget for the trip estimated $90,000 in airfare costs, but the credit card expenses suggest actual airfare costs incurred for the trip were at least $200,000.
The audit included 19 findings and observations indicating that the foundation lacks dedicated policies and processes, including a framework to evaluate donations against potential conflicts of interest arising from IEDC funding. Additionally, the foundation has “inadequate” financial management practices, such as insufficient budgeting and approval processes for travel and entertainment, poor documentation of contributions and expenditures, and a lack of expense controls.
Its governance structure is also intertwined with the IEDC, blurring the lines between the two entities, the report said.

During the review period, one-third of overall IEDC expenses went to the LEAP Project, or $495 million.
As of August, Indiana has bought 6,345 acres of land through IIP LLC, purchasing at just under $75,000 an acre for a total of more than $475 million.
An Indiana Capital Chronicle report put overall costs closer to $1 billion because it included spending from other state agencies.
FTI requested and received accounting documentation reflecting payments made by the IEDC to third-party vendors in connection with the LEAP project. In total, the IEDC and the Indiana State Budget Committee allocated and paid $191 million to outside vendors in connection with the LEAP project, including costs associated with infrastructure and site development, legal fees, taxes and utilities.
Of the $191 million, $77 million went to Pure Development — which kept about $18 million for its work and passed the rest to subcontractors.
The Pure contract was “sole sourced,” meaning no competitive bids were taken. The audit said the IEDC should consider implementing a competitive bidding process for all contracts over a certain dollar threshold.
 Looking at potential self dealing

One particular focus was a review of conflicts of interest, which comes after an Indianapolis Star story last month detailed how entities controlled by three men benefited handsomely from taxpayer-funded grants and no-bid professional services contracts: The IEDC under Holcomb doled out more than $180 million over less than six years in awards to entities controlled, either in whole or in part, by at least one — and sometimes all — of the three men.
One of those entities was Applied Research Institute, which is included in the audit findings.
Applied Research Institute, which FTI describes as “a partner in advancing research, technology and defense-related initiatives that drive Indiana’s innovation economy,” deals with sensitive, high-value projects. 
The former IEDC’s chief innovation officer moved on to the Applied Research Institute in December 2022. But the potential conflict wasn’t discussed nor was it disclosed to the Indiana State Ethics Commission when the IEDC awarded the entity a $17.5-million contract. 
That former executive also didn’t obtain a required post-employment waiver. The FTI review “suggests that approximately 82%” of that person’s salary at ARI “is directly related to this specific IEDC contract, indicating a potential violation of post-employment restrictions.”
IEDC deems Elevate Ventures, affiliates in breach of all active loans

FTI identified 30 entities in which an IEDC board member or employee had a potential conflict of interest — but found that just four were discussed in board or committee meetings and only one was disclosed to the appropriate oversight agency. 
Future action could include adding third-party oversight and beefing up accountability in the conflict-of-interest process, FTI’s authors wrote. Some recommendations, such as travel and donation policies, have already been updated. 
Elevate Ventures, which FTI describes as a “state-supported venture capital firm,” was allowed to resume investment operations last week. During the two years analyzed, it made 336 individual investments in 227 unique companies for more than $55 million. 
Of those, FTI identified five entities receiving public funds through Elevate Ventures that “presented a conflict with one or more EV employees.” Four of those were disclosed and approved by board members.
“At a high level, FTI found that the IEDC’s limited communication with and governance of EV, along with a lack of transparency into EV investment- level details, contributed to an environment that increased the risk that state and federal funds were being used in a manner that was inconsistent with their stated purpose,” concluded FTI. 
But FTI also reported that Elevate Ventures had “already taken significant steps to remediate” identified problems, which includes improving their customer resource management.
In a joint release with Braun, Elevate Ventures emphasized that no illegal activity was identified, touting its accomplishments with the state.
“We appreciate the thoroughness of this review and welcome its conclusions. Our team has remained focused on building Indiana’s innovation economy, and we’re proud of the impact we’ve made. We look forward to continuing our work with entrepreneurs and communities across the state,” said CEO Christopher Day.
Additionally, EV has hired an outside firm to validate investment returns with bank records.

Johnson, in a campaign announcement video, said that if elected to the seat serving northeastern Mississippi, he would work to expand access to affordable healthcare, protect Social Security benefits, and preserve the state’s land and water resources.

“As Mississippians, we were taught that we are measured by how we treat those around us who are struggling and need help,” Johnson said. “But in Washington, too many career politicians have forgotten those values and callously bury Mississippi families under a heaping pile of oppressive policies that make life harder rather than easier.” 

If Johnson wins his party’s nomination, he will face incumbent Republican Kelly, a former district attorney and a retired officer in the Mississippi National Guard. Kelly currently serves on the House Armed Services and Agriculture committees and on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 

A spokesperson for Kelly did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Johnson’s campaign announcement. 
Former state Rep. Kelvin Buck, a Democrat who represented Marshall County, has also qualified to run for the congressional seat. 
So far, no Republican has filed paperwork to run against Kelly.
Johnson’s announcement follows several other candidates who have announced that they’re running for Congress in the 2026 midterm election.

Despite the chaos emanating from Washington, D.C., there is a sense of stability here where individualism, respect for differing opinions, and self-sufficiency are a way of life. 
It seems impossible that the Republicans, who control majorities in both chambers of Congress, the White House, and a majority of the Supreme Court, cannot keep the federal government funded and operating to provide “the greatest good to the greatest number.” 
In fact, far from that goal, our nation seems to be in the clutches of an ideologically blinded and incredibly vindictive GOP that likes to point fingers a lot more than looking in the mirror to see who, exactly, is causing the problems swamping the nation. 
Good example: Who cut DOGE loose on the federal workforce with their “Chainsaw Man” Elon Musk and his teenage tech goons running rampant?  Nope, it wasn’t the hapless Democrats who were totally incapable of stopping the ill-informed, poorly prioritized slashing. 
Who has turned much of the world against the U.S. through incredibly punitive tariffs on global trade?  Nope, no “D” behind their name.  And as those global supply chains upon which our consumer-driven economy are re-directed to more favorable nations, who cannot even manage to pass a federal budget to keep the government they control functioning — yet blame the Congressinal minority for their utter failure?  That would be the GOP.
Maybe the befuddled Republicans in Congress and the White House should contact Montana’s Llew Jones, who has served as a Representative and Senator while leading both the House Appropriations and Senate Finance and Claims budget committees.  
Perhaps Montana’s senior senator, Steve Daines, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, could ask Jones how he managed to not only pass a two-year state budget, but establish a new trust fund dedicated to taking care of Montana’s long-term infrastructure needs.  
Moreover, as required by Montana’s Constitution, Jones had to negotiate with the Democrat legislative minorities to pass a balanced budget — not the short-term, stop gap, and deficit-laden budgets Daines and his fellow Republicans are struggling to pass in Washington.
None of this, at least in Montana, is particularly a mystery — and both Democrats and Republicans have passed balanced budgets for decades, somehow managing to treat each other with enough respect to actually hammer out agreements instead of just hammering each other. 
But that can’t happen when what spills daily from the White House is brutal invective against anyone and everyone who doesn’t agree with the president.  It can’t happen when the nation is artificially divided into red states and blue states by so-called “leaders” that tolerate no dissent or difference of opinion on the complex issues facing the nation. Montanans don’t ask for political affiliation before we help someone out of a snowbank. 
While our state relies significantly on federal dollars, the shut-downs and short-term “continuing resolution” budgets do no one much good.  In fact, fiscal stability is critical for business, education, infrastructure, health care, and resource management.
Since the D.C. chaos will likely continue for the next four years, it behooves Montanans and our politicians to make state stability and self-sufficiency a high priority.  Not only do we have the resources to be largely self-sufficient, we have a populace that understands people have a right to differing opinions — and good governance is achieved through negotiation, not by threatening and punishing those with whom you disagree.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TrumpDaines-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-03 06:59:19.063950

(Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)The morning of Sept. 25, federal agents and immigration authorities swept into Manitowoc to arrest people alleged to be in the country without proper documentation. Agents first went to a Walmart parking lot where dairy workers are known to meet up before driving to the farms where they work. The action then moved on to private residences, where migrants were arrested as they left the house. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims the ICE raid in Manitowoc was aimed at dismantling an international sex and drug trafficking ring, but has so far provided little evidence to support that claim. Federal authorities initially said 21 migrants had been arrested in the raid, before later saying 24 had been picked up. 
On Tuesday, DHS released the names of six of the 24. Only one individual named in the release has been charged with a sex crime — Jose Hilario Moreno Portillo, who was charged in Manitowoc County court in May with the 2nd degree sexual assault of a child. However, Moreno Portillo has not yet been convicted and court records show he’s been in ICE custody since July. 
ICE did not respond to a request for comment on why Moreno Portillo was named as being arrested in the Manitowoc action when he was already in ICE custody. 
The five other named individuals have been convicted of identity theft, hit-and-run, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence, possession of narcotic equipment, traffic offenses and a failure to appear charge. 
In Wisconsin, immigrants without documentation aren’t able to obtain driver’s licenses, which often causes them to wrack up several criminal traffic offenses when they’re pulled over and ticketed for driving without a license. 
With little proof that ICE actually broke up a ring of sex traffickers, immigration advocates and farm groups see the raid as a direct threat to the state’s dairy farms and the immigrant workers that keep the industry afloat. 
Farmers and immigrant advocates in Wisconsin have been watching ICE’s actions on dairy farms across the country closely. In March, ICE raided a dairy farm and petting zoo in New York. In April, a raid on a dairy farm in Vermont resulted in eight arrests. And in early June, ICE arrested 11 immigrants in a raid on a dairy farm in New Mexico. 
But so far, enforcement against undocumented people on dairy farms had been sporadic and far from the midwest. In June, President Donald Trump announced and then retreated from guidance that ICE would not aggressively target farms and the hospitality industry. 
While last Thursday’s raid in Manitowoc didn’t take place on a dairy farm, most of the individuals arrested were dairy workers. Beyond that, they were dairy workers in the county with the highest concentration of dairy factory farms in the country. Manitowoc County and its northeast Wisconsin neighbors are the epicenter of the modern farming powerhouse that maintains Wisconsin’s status as “America’s dairyland.” 
“It’s just sending an economic ripple effect across the dairy industry, which is Wisconsin’s rural economy,” says Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera. “And then also there’s the symbolic and political dimension to it as well. We are America’s Dairyland, and so this enforcement is not just an administrative matter, but it threatens the industry’s well being. Who are we going to be after all of this? Are we still going to be America’s Dairyland?”
Velasquez says the raid sent a “big anxiety wave” through immigrant communities across the state. 
“These views have just spiraled out of control in terms of the rumors that have been sent out across the community, rumors of ICE coming into their neighborhoods, to their homes, to their schools,” Velasquez says.  
“I have had serious conversations since the raid in Manitowoc of folks who are planning to leave after many years of being here,” he adds. “They just don’t feel like this is a humane lifestyle anymore. They’ve given many years of their lives, and many of them have children here.” 
Michael Slattery, a Manitowoc County farmer who grows grain and raises Holstein steers, points to data that shows 70% of the labor on Wisconsin’s dairy farms comes from immigrants and estimates that the dairy industry is the driver of 20% of Manitowoc County’s economy. 
Slattery says farmers can’t survive without that migrant labor because no one else is willing to do the work.
“Do you want to get up at 3 a.m. seven days a week to go out in the cold, the heat, to get kicked by cows when you’re putting the suction cups on, to be shat upon, pissed on, pushed around by 1,400 pound cows? People don’t want that,” he says. “I’ve tried to hire part time labor here, I cannot get people, they don’t want to do this sort of stuff.”
Simply expecting farm families to pick up the slack isn’t the answer, he adds.  “These dairy farms, they don’t have enough family members that can come out and replace immigrant labor, both documented and undocumented, that are leaving,” Slattery says. “They’re in a money-losing situation now.”

Losing the dairy labor force would have ripple effects across the economy in Wisconsin and the country. 
“What do they do in that situation? If your cows cannot be milked, in two, two and a half weeks they’ll go dry,” he says. “The cows get milk fever, get ill, that’s your cheap hamburger in the stores. They’re selling the cows at a loss, that’s what they’ll do. There’s less milk in the market, that will drive up prices for cheese, milk and butter.”
Danielle Endvick, executive director of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, says if Wisconsin’s immigrant workers leave the state — either from being arrested by ICE or leaving on their own to avoid arrest — farms could close and prices could increase. 
“Immigration raids and mass deportations can shrink rural economies, are terribly destabilizing for communities and can harm schools, churches, just the fabric of our rural communities too,” Endvick says. “Our rural spaces, our farmers can’t thrive if we’re treating a key workforce like they’re disposable. I think that immigrant workers are essential to Wisconsin dairy, and that when they are threatened, farmers in our rural communities are threatened too.”

If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, you can call or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
This story was reported using data from The Trace’s Gun Violence Data Hub, a national nonprofit reporting project.
Wyoming’s lonely landscape, sparse access to mental health resources and widespread firearm access are all considered factors behind a suicide rate that for decades has topped most other states, leaving families and the state’s tightly knit communities to confront one loss after another.
After several years as the state with the worst suicide rate, Wyoming, beginning in 2022, gave up that ignominious distinction, though it has remained in the top three states.  
But a new data set places Wyoming above the other 49 states in a specific metric — the number of adults over 70 who kill themselves using firearms. 
From 2009 to 2023, 252 older Wyoming residents died by gun suicide, according to data compiled by The Trace, a national nonprofit media outlet focused on tracking firearms and gun violence in the U.S. That’s a rate of 29 suicides per 100,000 Wyoming residents over the age of 70. The majority of those deaths are of older white men, according to The Trace’s data.
All told, more men over the age of 70 in both Wyoming and nationally die from gun suicides than they do from car crashes, the news outlet found.
For Wyoming health officials, the numbers aren’t surprising. While the state no longer has the nation’s worst suicide rate, national rates tracked by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention are adjusted to account for some states having larger elderly populations. Called “age-adjusted” data, those ratings account for the fact that suicide risk is higher among adults 85 years old and up, in order to give a broader sense of whether a state carries an elevated suicide risk for reasons beyond just demographics.
According to Wyoming Department of Health data, suicides in the state are lower among people aged 70 to 80 than they are among some younger age groups. But the rate spikes to 72.13 per 1000,000 residents over the age of 85. 
While valuable, such numbers don’t capture the reverberating pain and trauma a suicide death at any age brings to family, friends and community, experts said. 
“Behind every data point is a person, a grieving family, a community that is impacted,” Wendy Morris, who conducts suicide prevention trainings for Healthy Park County, told WyoFile. 
“Unfortunately, suicide does not discriminate, so we don’t focus on a particular population,” Morris said, but experts know that older people carry particular risks. 
Morris works with senior centers, churches and civic organizations like Rotary clubs, whose members skew older, to raise awareness about signs of suicide risk and the best practices for prevention and intervention.
Older people who live alone, who recently lost a longtime partner, and who are confronting increasing physical debilitation or a mistaken perception of burdening relatives, are people who, Morris suggests, benefit from community and family support. Just lending an ear can have a meaningful impact, she said.
“A medical condition, a chronic pain, that rancher who is getting a little bit older and might feel not as confident, they might not be able to work the way they used to and maybe they don’t have the help and they don’t want to feel they’re a burden. We know that those are times when people can be vulnerable.” Morris said. “But if somebody was able to sit down at the kitchen table and have that conversation, it could very much change things.” 
The Trace found particularly high rates of suicide by elderly people using a firearm in rural western states. Behind Wyoming came Nevada, with a rate of 25.7 suicides per 100,000 residents over 70, and then Montana, with a rate of 24.4. 
Within Wyoming, Carbon, Park, Fremont and Sweetwater counties carried the highest rates of suicide among elderly people. 
The Wyoming Department of Health publishes age-adjusted suicide rates by county. Under that age-adjusted ranking, which accounts for data from 2014-2023, Hot Springs County suffered from the worst suicide rate. 
Gov. Mark Gordon has made improving the state’s mental health services a goal of his second term in office. His administration has contracted with an expert in suicide prevention who has provided suicide intervention training in several counties. 
The Trace’s findings showed there is much more work to be done, Gordon said in a statement to WyoFile on Wednesday. He encouraged people who want to learn more about suicide prevention and help protect family and community from further losses to sign up for upcoming trainings online and around the state. 
“Simply put: our suicide rate is too high,” Gordon said. “While we have made progress through our collaborative community efforts to bring awareness and lower the number of deaths by suicide, there remains much to be done. I am grateful for the many volunteers — citizens from every walk of life — clergy, first responders, and professional wellness and healthcare providers — for working together. We all have a role to play — checking on one another and being ready to help.”
Guns a third rail 
Gordon’s statement did not mention firearms, which are used in the vast majority of Wyoming’s suicide deaths. From 2020 to 2024, firearms were the mechanism for 74% of the state’s suicides. Guns are the most lethal method of suicide, and according to an expert interviewed by The Trace, it can be particularly traumatizing for those who find a loved ones’ body.
But in such a gun-friendly state, reducing the number of firearms accessible to someone with suicidal intent hardly seems possible to advocates.
“I wouldn’t even have that conversation,” Morris said. “For me, the conversation is using safety around our firearms. It’s not about giving away guns, it’s about giving family and family members practical tools.” Those include gun locks and gun safes, which create a pause before someone can pull the trigger, or that people experiencing depression or suicidal thoughts give their guns to a family member or someone they trust for a time.

In Wyoming, as in other western states, some gun shops are offering safe storage — where a person can come in and store their gun, with no questions asked by the shop staff — according to a 2024 report by National Public Radio. 
But on the whole, advocates in the state say Wyoming will likely have to learn to reduce its suicide rate without lessening its firearm count. 
“Firearms are common, very common in Wyoming homes, and that’s a fact,” Morris said.
Advocates say call centers are a success
Wyoming in 2023 had the third-worst suicide rate overall among the 50 states and Washington, D.C., with 157 deaths. The state was behind Alaska and Montana — two rural states with which the Equality State has for years shared the ignominious distinction of being the top three worst states for suicide. From 2018 through 2021, Wyoming carried the worst suicide rate in the nation. 
In 2022, when Wyoming’s rate reduced enough that Montana and Alaska surpassed it, government officials and public health industry professionals celebrated the drop as a sign that new investments in prevention and increased public discussion of suicide were having an impact. That same year, the state had launched its 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, giving Wyomingites in crisis an easy-to-remember number to call. In its first year, the line received 4,000 calls, according to previous WyoFile reporting. 
“Every person in this state knows of someone who has committed suicide,” Jon Conrad, a former Uinta County lawmaker who brought unsuccessful legislation to create an investment account that would have funded the 988 line in perpetuity, said in an interview Tuesday. Conrad became involved in suicide prevention after a spate of deaths among trona miners in his part of the state, he told WyoFile. He has since held talks to large groups of miners, urging them to check on one another and keep an eye out for someone isolating themselves or showing other worrying signs.
“We communicate very, very clearly that suicide occurs regardless of age, gender, sex, etc.,” he said. “And that does include those older folks and helping elderly people recognize that I’m not a burden on my family and or society.” Doing so, he said, can help stop old people from leaving the burden of a violent death on their surviving loved ones. 
Conrad worried that funding to tackle Wyoming’s mental health problems, including its high suicide rate, would be in short supply with the conservative Wyoming Freedom Caucus controlling a voting majority in the House of Representatives. 
“While they’re in power, we will never get money to where it needs to be,” Conrad said. 
Like everything in the state’s budget for the coming two-year period, funding for 988 would face scrutiny by conservative lawmakers, House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, a Gillette Republican and Freedom Caucus leader, told WyoFile. But, he noted, the caucus has previously supported funding the hotline call centers — there are two in Wyoming — on a two-year basis. Conservatives have opposed shifting the 988 funding into an inviolate trust fund, Bear said. 
“We want to look at the data, if it’s working it’s an important part of the front-line defense against suicide,” said Bear, who’s recalled his son’s death by suicide in past legislative discussions on the subject. “We’re trying to look at everything and take a holistic approach to budgeting.”
Having call centers based in Wyoming allows for a better connection between the distressed caller and the worker who picks up the phone, Morris said. “It feels reassuring to [callers] that they’re not calling New York City or California,” she said. “It’s OK to ask for help, it’s not a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength.”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Wisconsin Republicans want to restrict school districts’ ability to seek referendums if they haven’t turned in financial reports to the Department of Public Instruction on time. 
At a public hearing Thursday, the Assembly Education Committee Thursday heard testimony on a bill drafted in reaction to the historic referendum that voters approved for the Milwaukee Public Schools last year, and that was followed by the revelation that the district was months late in submitting financial documents to the state.
The school district’s tardiness has led to upheaval throughout the district, including the decision to replace the MPS superintendent and additional audits ordered by Gov. Tony Evers.
The education committee also took testimony on a bill that would allow education students to complete their student teacher requirements during the summer and a bill to change curriculum requirements for human development classes if districts offer them. 
Rich Judge,  assistant state superintendent in the Division of Government & Public Affairs for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI), registered against each bill, but did not provide testimony. The agency has not yet responded to a request for comment from the Wisconsin Examiner about its opposition to the bills.
AB 457, coauthored by Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), would require DPI to certify schools are in compliance with all applicable requirements to submit financial information to DPI. 
If a district is not in compliance, the school board would be prohibited from adopting a resolution to hold  a referendum. A resolution adopted or a referendum passed without the certification would be void.
“If a district cannot even meet its minimal statutory reporting duties, how can voters trust them to be responsible?” Nedweski asked rhetorically during her testimony. “This bill places no additional cost or burdens on school districts. It simply reinforces accountability and transparency… Trust is the foundation of strong schools and strong communities, and AB 457 helps ensure that that trust is never taken for granted.” 
MPS sought a $252 million recurring operating referendum in April 2024 to assist with staff pay and educational programming costs. The measure passed narrowly, and by the end of May 2024, DPI announced that the district was months late in submitting required financial reports. 
The DPI was still withholding about $42 million from the district as of June of this year due to its late financial reports. 
Nedweski said she didn’t know how many other districts might be late in their financial reporting to DPI. School districts need to be in compliance before they seek a referendum so that voters have adequate information, she said 
“If you’re going to pass a $252 million dollar recurring referendum, I think you should be able to make an informed decision,” Nedweski said.
The legislation comes as school districts continue to rely on funding raised from property taxes through referendum requests, requiring voter approval.
Democratic lawmakers on the committee expressed concern about the potential barrier the legislation could pose.
Rep. Angelina Cruz (D-Racine) noted that there have been a record number of referendum requests t in recent years and that the state Legislature opted not to provide any additional general aid in the 2025-27 state budget. School district leaders have said the lack of state aid will put them in tough positions when it comes to funding, even with the additional aid that the state is providing for special education costs. 
“With the state Legislature putting zero dollars in state [general] aid forward in this last budget to local school districts, we’re going to see that pattern of referendum continuing,” Cruz said. “I’m just concerned that we are creating another barrier in terms of our local public school districts having access to choosing to… fill the gaps that the state is intentionally creating.”
Even with the recent referendum, MPS is still looking at a $100 million budget shortfall and newly hired Superintendent Brenda Cassellius is looking for ways to tighten its budget.
This is not the only bill lawmakers have introduced that would place additional barriers and limitations on school districts seeking referendums. A bill introduced in March would eliminate the ability for school districts to seek recurring referendums, which are ongoing into the future, in part due to Milwaukee’s referendum. 
“Are you saying that people shouldn’t have access to the financial data for school districts before they make a decision to raise their own taxes?” Nedweski replied. 
“Absolutely not,” Cruz said. “I’m seeking clarity in terms of are we trying to create an additional barrier for public school districts, local communities to fund their schools? [The financial reports are] already a requirement by law.” 
Changing human development requirements 
The committee also took testimony on AB 405, also authored by Nedweski, which would change requirements for school districts that offer human development education.
Wisconsin doesn’t require public schools to teach human growth and development, or sex education. If they opt to do so, the state makes recommendations for the curriculum and state law imposes some requirements. Those include presenting abstinence from sex as the preferred choice of behavior for unmarried students, providing instruction in parental responsibility and the socioeconomic benefits of marriage for adults and their children, and explaining pregnancy, prenatal development and childbirth. 
Nedweski’s bill would add to those requirements. If it is enacted, students would have to be shown a “high-definition ultrasound video that shows the development of the brain, heart, sex organs, and other vital organs in early fetal development” and a “high-quality, computer-generated rendering or animation that shows the process of fertilization and every stage of fetal development inside the uterus and that notes significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy until birth.”
Nedweski said that allowing students to “actually see the real life process of fetal development in action will be more tangible to them than simply reading in a textbook or seeing it in the still diagram or drawing.” 
“We have the resources at our disposal to bring this science into the classrooms, and we should use it to our advantage to give students a stronger educational experience,” she added. 
Nedweski’s bill would also require schools to include a presentation on each trimester of pregnancy and the physical and emotional health of the mother if they opt into teaching on recommended topics. She said this would help address mental health concerns.
“This bill simply builds off of those existing requirements to incorporate more scientific resources, such as the ultrasound video as well as lessons pertaining to the mental and physical health of the mother,” Nedweski said. “This bill is not a mandate because school districts are not required by law to offer human growth and development instruction. It merely makes modern enhancements to the topics required of districts that choose to teach it.” 
Nedweski was the sole person to testify on the bill. 
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) asked Nedweski whether she consulted public health officials, noting that the Wisconsin Public Health Association and Wisconsin Association of Local Health Departments and Boards are registered against it, according to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission lobbying website.
Nedweski said she didn’t speak to any public health officials or either statewide group in the process of authoring the bill, but spoke to a member of one of the local health departments in her district. 
Cruz asked about how much the curriculum would potentially cost. 
“There are all kinds of free materials available to any school district that would be wanting to utilize the video portion or the high resolution animation,” Nedweski said. She added that the curriculum decisions would ultimately be made at the local level.

Although the Idaho Supreme Court frequently hears cases at the Idaho Supreme Court building located on State Street in Boise, the state’s highest court is a traveling court that is required to hear cases outside of Boise occasionally. 
The Idaho Supreme Court is scheduled to hear three cases beginning at 8:50 a.m. Mountain time on Wednesday at the Bingham County Courthouse, 501 N. Maple St., in Blackfoot.
At 8:50 a.m. Mountain time on Thursday, the Idaho Supreme Court will hear three other cases at Idaho State University’s Stephens Performing Arts Center, 1002 Sam Nixon Ave., Building 88 in Pocatello.
Oral arguments are open to the public, and students have been invited to attend each day of hearings in eastern Idaho, according to a press release issued Thursday by the Idaho Supreme Court.

Eighth graders from a Blackfoot charter school have been invited to observe oral arguments on Wednesday, while Idaho State University students have been invited to watch oral arguments on Thursday, officials said. 
“Bringing the court into Idaho’s communities helps ensure that justice remains open and accessible to the people we serve,” said Chief Justice G. Richard Bevan. “These visits also educate our public about their courts, and we are excited for the chance to do so.”
More information about attending court and the hearing schedule is available on the Idaho Supreme Court’s website.

The post Home on the range ‘east of Farson’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s ungulates know better than to linger too long when a vehicle slows and stops, especially in the fall. Oftentimes, it’s a source of danger: next comes a door opening and a human hunter emerging.
But early on Sept. 24, a small bunch of pronghorn, mostly does and fawns, tested fate for a few moments in view of the Lander Cutoff Road. 
They paused from breakfast-hour foraging, which allowed for a few photographs, in the so-called Golden Triangle — a region known for retaining the largest and most unsullied, intact tracts of sagebrush left on Earth. Those plants glistened, looking gold themselves, in the morning light. 
Within moments, the herd wisely bounded off, fleeing the potential source of danger.

As the days shorten and temperatures drop in the weeks and months ahead, the same animals will likely be headed south from their summer range near the Prospect Mountains to their lower-elevation winter range near U.S. Highway 191 down toward Rock Springs. Their migration paths are part of a spaghetti-like complex of corridors traveled every fall and spring by the Sublette Pronghorn Herd, a 2.6-million-acre expanse that extends from Interstate 80 all the way north to Grand Teton National Park. 
Unbeknownst to the fleeing pronghorn, they’d recently been the subject of a political dispute. Their migration routes, known as the “East of Farson” segment, were in line to be excluded from protections under Wyoming’s migration policy. The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission, however, put the kibosh on that plan, voting that the “East of Farson” and Red Desert pronghorn ought to be included and protected.

The Air Force is wrapping up a large study of the cancer risks people who maintained the nation’s land-based nuclear missile arsenal across the Northern Rockies may have faced.
The post Nuclear missile workers are contracting cancer. They blame the bases. appeared first on WyoFile .","At a memorial service in 2022, veteran Air Force Capt. Monte Watts bumped into a fellow former Minuteman III nuclear missile operator, who told him that she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Watts knew other missileers with similar cancers. But the connection really hit home later that same January day, when the results of a blood test revealed that Watts himself had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
“I don’t know if it was ironic or serendipitous or what the right word is, but there it was,” Watts said.
Within the community of U.S. service members who staff nuclear missile silos scattered across the Northern Rockies and Great Plains, suspicions had long been brewing that their workplaces were unsafe. Just months after Watts was diagnosed in 2022, Lt. Col. Danny Sebeck, a former Air Force missileer who had transferred to the U.S. Space Force, wrote a brief on a potential cancer cluster among people who served at Minuteman III launch control centers on Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.
Sebeck identified 36 former workers who served primarily from 1993 to 2011 and had been diagnosed with cancer, including himself. Of those, 11 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma; three had died. The Air Force responded swiftly to Sebeck’s findings, launching a massive investigation into cancer cases and the environment at three intercontinental ballistic missile bases and a California launch facility. The goal is to complete the research by the end of 2025.
“It’s documented that there is a large cancer cluster in Montana, probably also in Wyoming.” Former Air Force missileer Lt. Col. Danny Sebeck
The service has released portions of the studies as they conclude, holding online town halls and briefings to highlight its findings. But while former missileers say they are heartened by the rapid response, they remain concerned that the research, which crosses decades and includes thousands of ICBM personnel and administrative workers, may address too large a population or use statistical analyses that won’t show a connection between their illnesses and their military service.
They need that tie to expedite benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Historically, the Department of Defense has been slow to recognize potential environmental diseases. Veterans sickened by exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam, Marines who drank contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and service members who lived and worked near burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan fought for years to have their illnesses acknowledged as related to military service.
In the case of the missileers, the Air Force had already studied potential contamination and cancer at Malmstrom in 2001 and 2005. That research concluded that launch control centers were “safe and healthy working environments.” But with Sebeck’s presentation and the decision to pursue further investigation, Air Force Global Strike Command — the unit responsible for managing nuclear missile silos and aircraft-based nuclear weapons — said the earlier studies may not have included a large enough sampling of medical records to be comprehensive.
Sebeck, who serves as co-director of the Torchlight Initiative, an advocacy group that supports ICBM personnel and their families, told congressional Democrats on April 8 that the Defense Department has not accurately tracked exposures to the community, making it difficult for veterans to prove a link and obtain VA health care and disability compensation.
“I had to go to a VA person and pull some papers,” Sebeck said, referring to the government system for recording service members’ environmental risks. “It says that I visited Poland once. It doesn’t mention that I pulled 148 alerts in a launch control center with polychlorinated biphenyls and with this contaminated air and water.”
PCBs are synthetic chemicals once used in industry, including missile control electrical components, such as display screens, keyboards and circuit breakers. They have been banned for manufacture since 1979, deemed toxic and a likely carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Air Force’s Missile Community Cancer Study compares 14 types of common cancers in the general U.S. population and the missile community and also studies the environments at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California to determine whether they may have contributed to the risk of developing cancer.
The Malmstrom, Warren and Minot bases together field 400 Minuteman III missiles, the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear triad, which also includes submarine- and aircraft-launched nuclear weapons. The missiles are housed in silos spread across parts of Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska, staffed around the clock by missileers operating from underground, bunkerlike launch control centers.
So far, the Air Force investigation has found no “statistically elevated” deaths from cancer in the missile community compared with the general population, and it found that the death rates for four types of common cancers — non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung, colon and rectum, and prostate cancer — were significantly lower in missileers than in the general population.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounted for roughly 5.8% of all cancer deaths among people who worked in launch control centers from January 1979 to December 2020.
Early results, derived from Defense Department medical records, found elevated rates of breast and prostate cancers in the missile community, but a later analysis incorporating additional data did not support those findings. The studies also did not find increased rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Air Force officials noted during a June 4 online town hall, however, that these assessments are based on roughly half the data the service expects to review for its final epidemiological reports and cautioned against drawing conclusions given the limitations.
The final incidence report will include federal and state data, including information from civilian cancer registries, and delve into subgroups and exposures, which may “provide deeper insights into the complex relationship” between serving in the missile community and cancer risk, wrote Air Force Col. Richard Speakman in a September 2024 memo on the initial epidemiology results.
Gen. Thomas Bussiere, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, said during the June town hall that only the final results will determine whether the missile community’s cancer rates are higher than the general population’s.
Some lawmakers share the concern of missileers about the Air Force study. The release of a University of North Carolina review of Torchlight Initiative data that showed higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma — at younger ages — among Malmstrom missileers, motivated U.S. Rep. Don Bacon. The Nebraska Republican introduced an amendment to a defense policy bill calling for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to review health and safety conditions in the facilities.
“Let’s make sure that we have some outside experts working with the Air Force studying cancer rates with our ICBM missions,” Bacon posted July 30 on the social platform X. “We want to ensure credibility and that whatever results come out, we’ve done total due diligence.”
Regarding additional studies on the working environments at the installations and a possible relationship between exposures and cancer risk, Speakman, who commands the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, said Malmstrom had two types of PCBs that the other two missile wing bases did not.
He added that benzene, found in cigarette smoke, vehicle exhaust and gasoline fumes, was the largest contributor to cancer risk in reviews of the bases.
The assessment concluded that the health risk to missileers is “low, but it’s not zero,” Speakman said. He said it would be appropriate to monitor the health of launch control workers.

Watts, whose story has been highlighted by the Torchlight Initiative, has asked the Defense Department’s inspector general to investigate — the watchdog agency referred his request to Global Strike Command — and is closely watching the Air Force research. He said the bulk of the cancer cases reported to Torchlight occurred in the 2000s, when ICBM personnel still used technology that contained PCBs, burned classified material such as treated paper and plastic coding devices indoors, and possibly were exposed to contaminated water.
“I open the door and there’s guys standing there in pressurized suits with sampling equipment,” Watts recalled. “They said, ‘We’re here to check for contaminated water.’ I look at my crew commander, and we’re standing there in cotton uniforms. I said, ‘Do you see anything wrong with this?’”
Launch control operators no longer burn code tapes indoors and the Air Force has made improvements to air circulation in the centers. Sebeck wants Congress to consider including missileers and others sickened by exposure to base contamination in the PACT Act, landmark legislation that mandates health care and benefits for veterans sickened by burn pits and other pollutants.
“It’s documented that there is a large cancer cluster in Montana, probably also in Wyoming,” Sebeck said. “People act surprised, but all they have to do is go to the oncology office in Denver. I can find my missileer buddies there. We are sitting in the same chairs getting chemotherapy.”
Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson Maj. Lauren Linscott said in response to Sebeck’s remarks that the unit understands the impact of cancer on its personnel and is committed to supporting them.
“While current findings are preliminary and no conclusions can yet be drawn, we are dedicated to a rigorous, peer-reviewed, data-driven process to better understand potential health risks because the safety of our airmen is our top priority,” Linscott said.
Bills introduced in the House and Senate would address the situation. In addition to Bacon’s amendment, the Senate version of an annual defense policy bill would require a “deep cleaning” of launch control centers every five years until the sites are decommissioned as a new ICBM, the Sentinel, replaces the Minuteman IIIs.
The Air Force aims to release its final epidemiological report by the end of the year.

A prescribed fire, also commonly called a prescribed burn, is a planned and controlled fire that may be used for eliminating overgrown vegetation, reducing the risk of larger wildfires or restoring the health of an ecosystem that depends on fire.
“When we manage land with prescribed fire, we potentially set ourselves up to avoid more severe impacts that would occur if it burned in a wildfire,” said Stacy Tyler, a fuels management program manager for the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho. 
“There is a lot of preparation work that goes into it, and we do a lot of science-based modeling to pick the best window to accomplish the best objective we have lined out, whether that is a restoration objective, protecting communities or reducing fuels, or it’s a combination of those,” Tyler added.  
On Wednesday, a U.S Department of Agriculture spokesperson said firefighting operations on national forests will continue through the government shutdown, at least for now. 
“Currently, the National Forests and Grasslands will remain open to visitors and wildland firefighting and disaster response will continue,” a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson, who did not identify themselves by name, said in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “This may change due to length of the shutdown.”
The U.S. Forest Service is an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Although crews strive for safety during prescribed burns, accidents do happen. 
On Friday, Idaho Department of Lands seasonal firefighter Isabella Oscarson was killed after being struck by a falling tree while assisting the U.S. Forest Service with a prescribed fire in the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests, state officials said. 
Gov. Brad Little ordered that all U.S. and Idaho flags be flown at half-staff until sunrise Sunday to honor Oscarson, the Sun previously reported.  
 Prescribed burns in Idaho began in September and are scheduled to continue throughout the fall

Some prescribed burn operations have already begun in Idaho, while others are planned throughout the fall. 
Officials with the Caribou-Targhee National Forest announced in a press release that they began prescribed fire operations on the Westside Ranger District on Friday. 
Forests, national parks to stay open during government shutdown, but services may be limited 

In the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho, crews plan to conduct prescribed burns this month as weather conditions and permitting allows. 
Sawtooth National Forest officials announced they plan a prescribed fire treatment of up to 5,000 acres in the southern portion of the Minidoka Ranger District’s Albion Division, located west of Almo, as well as up to 1,000 acres of single-tree burning located south and west of Oakley in the Cassia Division. 
The Sawtooth National Forest also plans up to 3,700 acres of prescribed fire treatment on the Fairfield Ranger District near the South Fork of the Boise River, north of the Methodist Church Camp, officials said. 
Tyler said Sawtooth National Forest officials are working with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game for the larger prescribed fires with the goal of restoring Aspen tree stands that serve as a barrier to wildfire spread and an important habitat for wildlife. 
“Aspen is a pretty wildfire resistant species, unless it has been encroached upon by other trees and shrubs and has additional fuel loading,” Tyler said. “As long as we’re not in a drought year, we expect aspen stands to be a barrier to fire spread, so we’re creating future fire suppression opportunities for our firefighters.” 
Tyler said crews will post signs and issue online alerts to keep the public informed about prescribed fire operations and any road or area closures. 
“We do try to minimize our closures for our planned operations,” Tyler said. “And as the public may be coming back into an area afterwards, we place signs in the area warning them they are entering a burned area.”
On Tuesday, before the federal government shutdown, Jessica Maddock, a public affairs officer for the Sawtooth National Forest, said officials will post information about closures due to prescribed burns on the Sawtooth National Forest’s alert’s page.
On Wednesday, the Sawtooth National Forest’s alerts page featured a new message at the top indicating the site would be updated periodically during the government shutdown.
“The Radical Left Democrats shutdown the government,” the new message on the Sawtooth National Forest’s alert’s webpage said. “This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
On Wednesday, Maddock referred all questions about the impact of the government shutdown to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s press office, which responded to the Sun with a nearly identical statement about the shutdown and Trump.

Public lands' cumulative value far exceeds any price that others might try to place on them, write three Lander business owners.
The post Wyoming stands strong for public lands appeared first on WyoFile .","From sagebrush steppe to Wind River summits, Wyoming’s public lands are as vast and varied as those of us who treasure them. Whether you were born in Wyoming or are among those who got here as soon as you could, you surely recognize that this wouldn’t be the same place without these defining spaces. 

Opinion

Our hometown of Lander, “where rails end and trails begin,” has long relied on adjacent public lands for its outdoor recreation economy. As neighbors on Main Street, both our businesses are no stranger to the value these public lands bring to the community. 
Hiker or ATV-rider, Wyoming’s public lands are something we all have in common. And protecting those lands is something we can all agree on. Despite our diverse backgrounds and sometimes differing political opinions, we stand on common ground when it comes to the importance of defending Wyoming’s public lands legacy.
As Wyomingites, we stand resolved in the belief that public lands should remain in public hands. As business owners, we understand that their cumulative value far exceeds any price that others might try to place on them. The Code of the West says it best: Some things simply aren’t for sale.
Freedom to access public lands is central to the Wyoming way of life. Our wide-open spaces, combined with Wyoming’s pro-business policies, make for a state where both people and commerce can thrive. The state’s outdoor recreation economy measured at $2.2 billion in 2023, growing by more than half a billion dollars over the last five years, and employed nearly 16,000 people. Then there’s the 61,000 (and counting) natural resource jobs in Wyoming — like energy development and ranching — on BLM lands alone. That’s more than 10% of the state population.
Public lands power our economy and are the reason so many of us live here. As entrepreneurs, we understand the value of the state’s natural beauty and high quality of life. And, whether as natural resources or recreational amenities, we recognize that our economic future depends in no small part on maintaining our open and free access to Wyoming’s public lands.
Yet, both Wyoming’s outdoor heritage and economic future remain threatened by a plan ill-conceived by reckless government actors to sell off our national public lands to the highest bidder. 
Already this year, we’ve seen Congress attempt to add a provision to the federal budget bill that would have sold off more than 500,000 acres of public land without any public input. When bipartisan opposition forced House sponsors to kill the provision, Utah Sen. Mike Lee revived it in the U.S. Senate, boosting the sell-off goal to more than 3 million acres. Opposition from Republican Senators in both Montana and Idaho, as well as massive public backlash from Wyomingites and other impacted Westerners, forced him to drop the plan.
But that doesn’t mean we’re done. Some politicians are still floating the idea of selling public lands to address government debt or for housing development, or finding other ways to make it seem reasonable to sell off our public lands. We know other attempts are looming in the future.  
When they do, we’ll be ready to take up the fight.
The rapidly growing Keep it Public, Wyoming coalition that we’re proud to be a part of has been hard at work to promote the importance of keeping public lands in public hands, raising awareness and mobilizing individuals, organizations and businesses like ours against the serious threats facing our public lands. 
In the spirit of Public Lands Day, celebrated by Wyomingites last Saturday with stewardship projects and gatherings across the state, we also invite you to follow the advice of Gov. Mark Gordon’s Wyoming Public Lands Day proclamation, which the Keep It Public coalition helped attain. 
“I encourage people across the state to engage in service and habitat restoration projects, to fish, hunt, hike, camp, enjoy wildlife, play, re-connect, find solace, and work on these public lands,” the governor’s proclamation states. “I encourage our public schools to observe this day by discussing the dynamic role Wyoming’s public lands play in our state’s history, economy, and the diverse benefits we derive therein; and by creating opportunities to connect our youth with the federal and state public lands and land managers within our borders.”
We understand that selling off public lands is a non-starter for Wyomingites, and we are willing to back that up with the clout of the business community because we recognize the devastating impacts public lands loss would have on our state and nation. Impacts to our economy, our communities, our way of life.
Sure, that might mean something a little different to all of us individually, but collectively we can all appreciate the important pillar that Wyoming’s public lands provide in sustaining that way of life — whatever it may mean to you.
Public lands have been called the great equalizer — places where everyone has the same freedom to roam, ride the trails and enjoy our wide-open spaces. But they’re also an incredible generator — of jobs, health, resources and so many other elements that contribute to what we know as prosperity.
Here in Wyoming, that equalizer is really our advantage. And we intend to keep it.

Jody Barrett floating in water, and the words “swamp politician” emblazoned across the screen. 
Another cutout-based commercial features Matt Van Epps, the former Tennessee General Services Commissioner, in his U.S. Army uniform in various shots, emphasizing that he’s a “MAGA warrior.”
These are two of the advertisements created through part of the nearly $2.5 million spent by independent groups to influence the U.S House race to replace former Clarksville Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green. 
Over 90% of that money has been spent on Barrett and Van Epps in the special election primary set to take place on Oct. 7. 
The 7th District is a Middle Tennessee-based seat that runs west of the Tennessee River, covering about a dozen rural counties, before taking a claw-like bite out of a third of north and west Nashville and the western half of Williamson County. It’s considered a Clarksville-based congressional district. 
Green resigned from the seat in July, triggering the special election.

There are 12 candidates running in the GOP primary and four in the Democratic. Barrett, Van Epps, Brentwood state rep. Gino Bulso and Franklin state rep. Lee Reeves have emerged as the frontrunners in the Republican primary. 
Businessman Darden Copeland and Nashville state reps. Aftyn Behn, Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell are the Democratic candidates.
Only Dixie has received independent support in the Democratic primary. A group called United We Succeed has spent $80,000 supporting him, but none of its donors were listed on the Federal Election Commission website as of Oct. 2.  
Pro-voucher group goes at Barrett
The School Freedom Fund, a national pro-private school voucher group, has spent almost $700,000 opposing Barrett, which includes the TV advertisement calling Barrett a “swamp politician” and says he’s not a true backer of President Donald Trump or Gov. Bill Lee.
The School Freedom Fund is funded by Club For Growth, whose main backer is Jeff Yass, a billionaire investor who most notably owns a significant stake in Chinese social video company TikTok. 
The group spent over $3.3 million in 2024 to elect a slate of pro-private school vouchers to Tennessee’s state legislature. The plan, pushed by Lee, narrowly passed and Barrett opposed it, fearing its impact on rural school districts. 
“I just think it’s a dangerous bill fiscally for us that creates an entitlement program that will never go away,” Barrett said to the Lookout before the legislation’s passage at the state of the 2025 legislative session. 
Lee endorsed Van Epps in the final days of the campaign. 
A group called Conservatives For American Excellence Inc. has spent almost $600,000, about half to oppose Barrett and half to support Van Epps. The organization has received most of its donations from Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, billionaire owners of two hedge funds.

Van Epps has also received over $300,000 in support from the Patriotic Fund, a group whose layering of donations through several political action committees that lead back to Miguel Bezos and his now deceased wife, Jacklyn, the parents of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. 
The House Freedom Action Fund has spent $450,000 in the race, with about two-thirds of the funds supporting Barrett and the remainder opposing Van Epps. The organization is the political arm of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus, generally considered a group of the most conservative GOP members.
Most political rating agencies, including the nonpartisan Cook Political Index, predict whoever emerges from the GOP side will win the Dec. 2 general election to become Tennessee’s next 7th U.S. Congressional District representative.

The tour coincides with Banned Books Week, which raises awareness about legislation that aims to restrict access to books in libraries and schools.
Lawmakers in more than 30 states introduced legislation seeking to regulate content in public libraries between January and July 2025.
In North Dakota, the Legislature passed a bill that would have required schools and public libraries to move “sexually explicit” content to areas not easily accessible to children, but the legislation was vetoed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0269edit-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-10-03 06:59:19.063950

(Photo by Jerry McBride for Colorado Newsline)Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountain’s efforts to reopen its Durango clinic come amid an increasingly difficult landscape for reproductive health providers in southwest Colorado and rural communities like it around the country. 

Tracy Anselmo, director of the La Plata County Public Health Department, said because Durango is the largest municipality in the area outside of Farmington, New Mexico, people seeking health care come from all over the Four Corners region. 
“The landscape in the southwest part of the state related to sexual and reproductive health is quite grim,” Anselmo said.
After being shuttered for just over a year, the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic will reopen this month for two days a week. 
Democratic state Rep. Katie Stewart, who lives in Durango, said southwest Colorado has “a limited number” of hospitals that offer birthing services and reproductive health care, “so Planned Parenthood has been pretty integral in making sure people have access.”

Stewart has driven to Denver from Durango several times for health care herself, which she said creates a burden that takes time away from her family and work. Having the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic open again will be “really wonderful for southwest Colorado” as fewer people will need to make the trek out of town. 
When the Durango clinic closed, she said she was in close contact with Planned Parenthood leaders who wanted to ensure their patients continued to have access to care. 
“Planned Parenthood really stepped up, and they didn’t want to leave patients in Durango without an alternative, so they did transition a number of their Durango patients to their virtual care center during the site closure,” Stewart said. 
Without the Durango Planned Parenthood, most patients in the area transferred their care to telehealth or a different local provider, said Adrienne Mansanares, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.
It closed as a result of “the impact of COVID on the labor market” in September 2024, she said. Around the country, Planned Parenthood clinics have announced permanent closures, often due to hostile federal and state policies. And the demand on other local providers has increased with changing policies affecting Planned Parenthood’s ability to provide care in the Four Corners region.

County public health administrators had just started talking about offering sexual health services at their clinic when the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic closed. Anselmo said it was key for those in need of reproductive health care in the area. 
“There’s just been a lot of change for southwest Colorado around reproductive and sexual health that have really necessitated us to step up our game here,” Anselmo said.
The closure also coincided with the local Title X family-planning provider declining to renew its contract and a prominent OB-GYN clinic closing. The county public health office was not prepared for the demand it would face for its brand new services, Anselmo said, some of which used to be provided by Planned Parenthood.
Tiffani Roberts, the county’s health access programs manager, says the clinic now offers various forms of contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing, vaccines and cancer screenings.
Just over 1,400 patients went to the Planned Parenthood in Durango for health care before it closed, about 20% of whom specifically sought abortion care, most often medication abortion.
When the clinic reopens this month, a nurse practitioner who works at the Cortez Planned Parenthood clinic will commute to Durango in the short-term, but Mansanares said the goal is to hire a full-time nurse practitioner. 
The La Plata County Public Health Clinic does not offer abortion care, and without the Planned Parenthood clinic up and running, people in need of in-person abortion care have had to travel to New Mexico or the Front Range, Roberts said. 
The clinic in Cortez is 45 miles from Durango, or just under an hour drive, and Planned Parenthood operates another in Farmington, which is 50 miles away. PPRM spokesperson Fawn Bolak said neither saw an increase in the rate of abortion care sought after the Durango clinic closed last year.
Colorado and the national fight over funding
During its recent special session, the Colorado Legislature approved money to cover Medicaid reimbursements to reproductive health care organizations, namely Planned Parenthood, whose federal Medicaid funding was eliminated for a year by the recent federal Republican tax break and spending cut law.
Republicans in Congress included a one-year prohibition against federal Medicaid dollars going to Planned Parenthood in their “big, beautiful” law, which President Donald Trump signed in early July. A federal appeals court allowed the provision to take effect last month after a lower court temporarily paused it. 
The freeze on Medicaid reimbursements led to canceled appointments and delayed care for patients “who already face long travel distances and limited provider options,” Bolak said. She said the law allowing the use of state funds is “a critical lifeline” for Medicaid recipients who rely on Planned Parenthood in Colorado, but workforce shortages and increased housing costs still present challenges for rural communities, among other issues “that are only getting worse” under Trump.
The La Plata County clinic saw an uptick in patients seeking sexual and reproductive health care soon after the Durango Planned Parenthood clinic closed, Roberts said, and again in July once remaining Planned Parenthood clinics could no longer accept Medicaid. The county applied for grant funding through the Caring For Colorado Foundation specifically to increase rural access to contraceptive care as the clinic saw increased demand once it started offering those services.
Roberts said the county clinic has worked with the Planned Parenthood clinics in Farmington and Cortez as they saw an influx of shared patients seeking care covered by Medicaid after the July freeze on Medicaid reimbursement for Planned Parenthood. Collaboration in small communities like Durango is much more prevalent than in larger communities “because we have to,” Anselmo said.

“We’re all really out here to help our community members get the services that they need, so we reach as far as we can into every single crack and beat the bushes as much as we can to make sure that people are getting what they need to maintain their health,” Anselmo said. 
Democrats in the Legislature are proud of their work in the special session to create a state fund for Medicaid recipients seeking care from Planned Parenthood, Stewart said, as legislators “should absolutely be supporting people and their access to health care.” But she said other health care cuts in the federal spending bill will be felt in rural Colorado. 
“Our health care system in the United States and Colorado, it’s an ecosystem, so having access in rural Colorado means it’s better for the entire state,” Stewart said. “Patients can stay in their communities and get care there versus driving hours, whether it’s to Grand Junction or Denver to get that care. It just keeps the health ecosystem healthier.” 
Job vacancies in rural areas can be “really challenging” to fill, Mansanares said, which is why the Durango clinic had to close after the nurse practitioner who previously worked full-time at the clinic changed jobs. 
“Planned Parenthood is a beloved partner and community presence for Durango, but the issues for our candidates were about the housing crisis and how expensive it is to live in that area,” Mansanares said. “We do have some providers that live all throughout the Four Corners region, but then when winter comes, it can just be dangerous or uncertain in driving.”
The health care provider shortage is amplified particularly for reproductive and sexual health care by anti-abortion advocates and “extremist politics, and certainly now with Trump,” Mansanares said.
Reopening the Durango clinic “has been a long journey” that Bolak said “is about honoring our commitment to rural communities and ensuring that everyone — regardless of where they live — can access the high-quality, compassionate care they deserve.”

(Spencer Platt | Getty Images)A dozen bills, some aimed at addressing the need for affordable workforce housing according to their Republican authors, passed the Assembly’s Housing and Real Estate Committee Thursday, with all but three gaining bipartisan support.
Several of the measures have already been put on the tentative calendar for the Assembly floor session scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 7.
AB 182, would modify Wisconsin’s low-income housing tax credit and require the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) to ensure that 35% of the tax credits it allocates are for projects in rural areas of Wisconsin.
AB 449 would require local municipalities with zoning to permit accessory dwelling units on the property of existing single family homes.
AB 451 would create residential tax incremental districts, to encourage residential developments with the resulting increases in property tax collection used to fund infrastructure investment. That measure passed the panel 12-2.
AB 454 would establish a workforce home loan fund through WHEDA to provide gap financing for new construction or significant rehabilitation of a single family home for the borrower.
AB 455 would establish a grant program at WHEDA for the owners of apartment buildings to offset converting their properties to condominiums. In an unanimous vote, the committee approved an amendment from state Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh) requiring grant recipients to give current occupants in a building being converted an opportunity to purchase their unit.
State Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) persuaded a majority of the committee, including four Republican members, to adopt an amendment allowing the proposed grants to be used for conversions to housing cooperatives as well as condominiums.
“Housing co-ops are an important alternative for households in our communities that lack the means to individually purchase and maintain stable housing,” Clancy said in a statement issued after the vote. “They provide the assurance of predictable costs, create the potential for innovative forms of cost sharing and cost reduction, and help strengthen the communities that embrace this well-proven model.”
Clancy’s statement also included a thank-you to the Republicans who voted with the committee’s five Democrats to pass the amendment, as well as the committee chair, Rep. Robert Brooks (R-Saukville), “for giving my proposed amendment to AB 455 a fair hearing.”
Clancy’s statement prompted Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) to email Republicans and Democrats in both chambers castigating Clancy and the Republicans who voted for his amendment for adding “communes” to the bill.
Four other bills involved largely technical matters, one lowering real estate transfer fees, one updating the requirements for renting mobile homes, one enabling subdivision developers to certify that improvements comply with state requirements, and one on changes in real estate practices for single- to four-family homes. All passed with unanimous or nearly unanimous votes.
Divided on party lines
Committee members split on a bill that would allow landlords to demand a written statement from a licensed health professional attesting to a tenant’s need for an emotional support animal.
The bill’s author, state Rep. Paul Tittle (R-Manitowoc), asserted at a public hearing that there was a “rising trend of emotional support and service animal misrepresentation in Wisconsin.” All nine committee Republicans voted for the bill and all five Democrats against it. 
On a second party-line vote, a bill giving developers an automatic rezoning right for residential projects if they met certain conditions passed with only the Republicans voting in favor.
The committee also passed on party lines legislation that would put off the effective date of Wisconsin’s updated commercial building code until April 1, 2026.
The building code update had been blocked in 2023, but a state Supreme Court ruling this July held that state laws giving the Legislature the power to block executive branch administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
After the Court’s ruling, the Department of Safety and Professional Services moved ahead to promulgate the new code, originally setting a Sept. 1 starting date. The department later postponed the effective date to Nov. 1.
In addition to the committee’s 9-5 vote Thursday on the bill postponing the date again, 29 Republican lawmakers sent DSPS Secretary-designee Dan Hereth a letter Wednesday also seeking to postpone the effective date to April 1.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s correction commissioner is blaming officers at Trousdale Turner for a June riot that led to a staffer’s stabbing, not the private operator that runs the prison.
The riot could have happened at any prison in the state, Commissioner Frank Strada told a Senate Corrections Subcommittee Wednesday. He added he couldn’t guarantee another one wouldn’t happen anywhere in the state, though one senator pointed out that Trousdale Turner had plenty of warning signs for trouble.
“The incident that occurred there was just due to staff error. It wasn’t because of CoreCivic. It wasn’t a CoreCivic problem. It was just that the staff that were working there didn’t do what they were supposed to do,” Strada said.
Isn’t that convenient: blaming the lowest people on the totem pole instead of management and top leaders.
Nevertheless, since the incident took place, CoreCivic installed a new warden, increased officer pay and adopted new procedures as the state took out roughly 600 inmates and limited the population to inmates 50 years and older with four years or less on their sentences, according to Strada.
His comments came after Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, asked what it takes to bring the prison under control.
The problems at Trousdale Turner are well-documented: officer vacancies and constant staff turnover, high death rates and sexual violence, gang extortion and smuggling. The list could go on.
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

“When is enough enough?” Yarbro asked.
The Department of Justice has been conducting a civil rights probe of Trousdale Turner for more than a year, and lawmakers met recently with family members of Trousdale Turner inmates to hear their concerns, according to Yarbro. 
Three inmates suffered minor injuries and a staff member was stabbed in the riot when inmates commandeered an inner yard, destroyed property and refused to take orders, according to CoreCivic.
Formerly Corrections Corporation of America, the company runs four prisons in the state but has lost roughly $45 million in penalties since 2022 for failing to meet contractual requirements, mainly for staffing shortfalls.
Yet even though Strada said he’s not giving CoreCivic “a pass,” he added that he believes in Tennessee’s “partnership” with the company. 
The question is: How many free passes will CoreCivic get before the state decides to say farewell?
Prosecutorial headache
District Attorney General Jason Lawson detailed to lawmakers Wednesday the constant steps his office takes to deal with Trousdale Turner crime. 
Lawson’s district includes Wilson, Macon, Smith, Jackson and Trousdale counties but he spends an inordinate amount of time on prison crime.
Lawson’s office receives reports on new cases every four days, and the grand jury indicts about 90 a year, he said.
The state has experienced investigators who handle the cases on everything from murder to smuggling contraband, but the internal investigator at Trousdale Turner is overwhelmed with work, Lawson said, leading to problems with misplaced evidence and lost video of criminal activity.
Clearly, some inmates have reached the point of no return and don’t care if they have more time tacked on to their sentences.
CoreCivic inmate sues Trousdale Turner prison staff over alleged extortion

The penalty for possessing a cell phone is only a fine, Lawson said (That’s how gangs operate from inside prisons). But when caught with one, inmates “laugh and say, ‘Put it on my tab,’” Lawson said.
He described a litany of other problems, including inmates exposing themselves to female guards, staff having sexual relationships with guards, visitors smuggling items to inmates, inmates bribing guards and worse, inmates killing cell mates. Sometimes they pack a bag in advance of the murder, knowing they’ll be transferred, he said.
“Recurring problems is the reason we had the riot in June,” Lawson said. “The jury’s out. I’m praying that CoreCivic or the state gets this under control.”
Lawson suggested several changes, including body cams for officers, to bring the prison under control. 
Lawmakers told Strada later in the meeting to put together a financial analysis for equipping guards with body cameras. He agreed to do it but balked at the potential high cost as well as privacy concerns, saying not even the federal Bureau of Prisons uses body cams.
Maybe they could take some of the money CoreCivic foregoes for failing to meet state contracts and buy a handful of cameras. Of course, the guards have to turn them on before they work.
The cold shoulder?
A former client of the state’s Community Corrections program told lawmakers his problems started with a beer after baseball games and led to his sticking a needle in his neck to get high.
Yet after numerous jailings connected to addiction, Dickson resident Zach Grace said he found new life through the intensive probation program for people who, otherwise, would be bound for prison.
Grace isn’t the first person to tout the effectiveness of Community Corrections and the tough love it puts into rehabilitating people.
“I’d be dead” without the help of the Community Corrections program, Dickson resident Zach Grace told a legislative committee. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Still, Community Corrections agencies across Tennessee went out of business in 2022 when the Department of Correction put out a new request for proposals that would require them to spend more money on licensed counselors and day reporting centers. 
Since then, agencies such as Decatur County Community Corrections battled to keep operating. But after the state took a new set of bids this year, more agencies got back in the business, forcing 15% budget cuts and causing layoffs and service cuts.
Decatur, for instance, needed $192,000 to maintain its operations. Sen. Ed Jackson, a Jackson Republican, said he searched Cordell Hull and the Capitol high and low but couldn’t get anyone to agree to spend the money. He came up empty even though the Department of Correction has roughly $14 million in “carry-over” funds for Community Corrections, which has a yearly total budget at $13 million. 
They could take less than $2 million out of that pot and solve everyone’s problems.
Strada told the Lookout he doesn’t have the authority to tap the fund for extra money, saying he has a “responsibility” to taxpayers. Only the commissioner of Finance and Administration can release the funds, Strada said, adding he would bring up the matter during budget talks this year. 
Has he bothered asking?
Circular talk continued after the meeting as Strada said, “I will consider the request.”
Grace, who came out on the good side of a bad habit, was a bit more supportive of the spending, saying, without the program’s intervention, “I’d probably be dead.”
Who’s really in charge
Are Tennessee and federal leaders setting up a complete Memphis takeover?
Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower recently suspended Shelby County Commission’s ability to borrow money, without the comptroller’s approval, after declining to approve the county’s budget for fiscal 2026.
In a letter to Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and Shelby commissioners, Mumpower said the county failed to provide a detailed budget for all funds, including Memphis-Shelby County Schools, and neglected to explain negative balances and cash and fund balances for every county fund. Thus, he is suspending borrowing until July 2026. He had warned them last year to do a better budgeting job.
That’ll teach ’em. Cut off money to a city and county struggling with schools and losing jobs.
But it’s nothing new.
The legislature’s top leaders threatened to hold up Memphis’ share of state tax revenue a year ago for putting gun control measures on an election ballot.
Shelby County 2026 Budget Letter - 10.01.2025
Lawmakers wanted to take over the Shelby County-Memphis school district this year, too, but couldn’t muster the votes to hammer the majority minority city.
The latest decision brought criticism from Democratic Sens. Raumesh Akbari and London Lamar, who said in a joint statement the decision “jeopardizes critical investments in our community – from schools and roads to public safety and hospitals like Regional One.”
“While no one disputes the need for accountability and accuracy in country budgeting, the state’s approach here would punish families, workers and patients who depend on these investments the most,” they said.
Mumpower also took control of the finances in the town of Mason, a majority Black city of 1,500 in West Tennessee, even though its budgeting woes were caused by a previous administration. Similarly, he put Tennessee State University on notice that it needed to get a better handle on its budgeting. 
That came amid reports that the state shorted TSU up to $544 million over several decades and a separate federal analysis that found funding for the university fell short by $2.1 billion. Ask any TSU supporter, and they’ll give you an earful on this topic.
Getting back to the Memphis situation, this arises as President Donald Trump and Gov. Bill Lee agreed to send Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis as part of a massive federal-state law enforcement buildup. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth,U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller flew into Memphis Wednesday, signaling that the feds are in control.
It’s always comforting to see top brass on the ground. Maybe they can help the Shelby County Commission balance its books.
Entering the fray
Gov. Lee is inserting himself into one of most combative Republican primaries to come around in – oh – about a year, choosing to endorse his former General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps in the special election for the 7th Congressional District seat.
Lee called “MAGA Matt” the “conservative, America First fighter we need representing Tennessee.” 
Days before the primary in a special congressional election, Gov. Bill Lee endorsed former Commissioner of General Services Matt Van Epps in the GOP primary. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Van Epps, a West Point grad, former Army special operations pilot and National Guard member, appeared to be floundering somewhat in the race against Republican Reps. Jody Barrett, Lee Reeves and Gino Bulso until he said he was going to Washington to hammer the “woke” people ruining America.
The governor’s endorsement gives him a boost against Barrett, of Dickson, who landed the endorsement of the American Freedom Caucus and former Rep. Mark Green’s ex-wife. 
In fact, most of the mud-slinging has been against Barrett, who had the gall to vote in opposition to Lee’s private-school voucher bill this year.
Reeves must be miffed since he was the governor’s favorite last year, drawing major independent expenditures from the School Freedom Fund in its effort to push the voucher bill to passage.
All is fair, of course, in love and war (and politics).
Surf’s up (not)
Republican Rep. Todd Warner’s lake quarry project was turned down this week in a Marshall County planning and zoning hearing, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Residents spoke out against the quarry lake, saying it was damaging their homes and disrupting the area.
Warner’s representatives said it should be approved because it is a legitimate agricultural operation. Eventually, it would take up 60 acres and require two pumps to bring in water from the Duck River to water two large fields.
But the county’s planning and zoning director said it is a mining operation with commercial rock sales and transportation, which he said are not farm uses.
The state initially told Warner he didn’t need a permit to operate it but then reversed course because of the quarrying and required him to get a federal pollution permit.
Warner previously told the Tennessee Journal he was being targeted by “political adversaries.” He declined to comment on the record to the Lookout last week and didn’t respond to a text message question Thursday.

A new tool from a nonprofit climate coalition spearheaded by former Vice President Al Gore aims to help Louisiana residents see how the invisible threat travels — and who’s most at risk.
Introduced at New York Climate Week in late September, Climate TRACE is a new website that aims to show an inventory of emissions. The tool models the spread of particulate matter, tiny particles that can lead to heart and lung problems as well as premature death when inhaled.
On a given day, the map uses thousands of dots to show how the pollutants disperse into the air from facilities and into nearby communities. The tool also shows how much the same facilities contribute to human-caused climate change, as both the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels.
“The connection between the climate crisis and the public health crisis driven by particulate pollution from the burning of fossil fuels to make petrochemicals, power transportation or generate power has not often received adequate attention,” Gore said in an interview.

Gore teased the release of the tool at an August event in St. James Parish. His group first developed it to depict how pollution travels in Louisiana’s 85-mile-long petrochemical corridor along the Mississippi River, nicknamed “Cancer Alley.” After working with groups in the region, Gore said he was shocked by how severe health problems had become for local residents. Then, his group decided to expand the project.
“When we succeeded in visualizing the particulate pollution in Cancer Alley, it became apparent that this was something we should do all over the country and the world,” Gore said.
He said he hoped the new data and modeling will help community groups make their case to local officials and hold companies accountable.
“There could be some companies that want to swap out their supply chains so that they are not contributing to the disease burden in communities like the River Parishes,” Gore said.
Climate TRACE is already working with some subnational governments, business leaders and other organizations to choose suppliers with lower emissions, Gore said.
The tool itself was developed by Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab, combining pollution and weather datasets to model the plumes of particulate matter as the prevailing wind changes. It also uses satellite data and remote sensing to more accurately track greenhouse gas emissions.
Amy Gottsegen with the CREATE lab said Climate TRACE is a much larger, global version of plume modeling her lab creates for the Pittsburgh area each day to help people reduce their exposure to bad air quality.
She noted the tool is limited by the data available. For example, facilities don’t report how much particulate matter they emit each day, so the team uses monthly data to create a daily average. They’ve also estimated what pollution plumes look like on days with the greatest emissions. The visualization can’t be used to precisely say how much pollution a community is exposed to, but the denser concentrations of particles indicate where more pollution was modeled to be at ground level.
Eventually, Gore hopes this global plume modeling tool — which currently depicts pollution across 9,500 urban areas — will mimic CREATE Lab’s Pittsburgh model, providing new plume modeling as close to real-time as possible. The timeline for such a roll out would likely take years, though, Gore said.
When he announced the tool in St. James, Gore noted that this tool alone won’t help reduce pollution, but communities empowered with information could.
“The information doesn’t do anything by itself unless you turn it into action,” he said. “If you’ve got neighbors and friends to whom you’ve been talking about this, and you have not been able to strike a spark, show them this … Maybe it’ll make it easier to see clearly.”

Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett is pushing back on the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals’ call for increased funding to keep Family Treatment Courts open in the state. Barrett says the courts’ budget includes $30 million that could be put toward the successful program and other judicial needs. 
“This is just a scare tactic by the Supreme Court,” said Barrett, R-Berkeley. “We shouldn’t overfund any state agency or any branch of government so that they can build up a slush fund to be able to purchase things without Legislative approval.”
West Virginia’s 14 specialized Family Treatment Courts support parents in overcoming substance use disorders while working toward safe reunification of their children. They operate in 19 counties and have graduated 309 participants so far, with 437 children reunified with their families.
This year, the Family Treatment Courts received a $1 million grant to continue the program over the next year after Legislative funding fell short, Justices announced in September. 
While the Supreme Court acknowledged a $30 million carryover this year, they said a large part of that money is already earmarked for projects. Jared Hunt, communications director for the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, said that $16.5 million was tied to a needed technology upgrade for magistrate and circuit courts.
“This is a large contract, and it’s going to be awarded in the next couple weeks,” Hunt said. “That money is something that the court has been planning to spend over the past several budget cycles.”
There are mounting budget pressures for the Supreme Court; the judicial branch this year received less funding than it requested from the Legislature while more judicial positions were added across the state. There have been rising public employee insurance costs, and the courts are now grappling with a $7 million funding gap in its payroll, Hunt said. 
“This misunderstanding about the nature of our reappropriated funds likely could have factored into the steep cut the Legislature enacted in our budget this past session, and we are now working with lawmakers to update them on the reality of our financial situation and our needs going forward,” Hunt said. “The simple fact is the steep cut to our budget this year has created a significant, structural deficit in our operating budget.”
The courts maintain that the Legislature must increase funding for Family Treatment Courts that serve a state hit hardest by the substance abuse crisis. 
“Given our existing structural gap created by the last budget bill, we’re unsure how we’ll be able to cover our existing payroll — let alone take on the more than $1 million in costs of operating Family Treatment Courts — without additional appropriations from the Legislature,” Hunt said.  “ … The math just doesn’t add up.” 
He added that the justices are committed to working with members of the House and Senate to restore an adequate level of funding to the courts and its Family Treatment Courts programs. 
Family Treatment Courts each cost around $85,000 to $100,000 per year to operate. Judges volunteer their time to oversee the program, and most of the cost is for a case manager at each court. 
According to the state Supreme Court of Appeals, West Virginia has saved $7 million in foster care or kinship subsidy payments through Family Treatment Courts.
“We think it’s a worthwhile investment,” Hunt said. 
For now, Barrett isn’t convinced that more money from the Legislature is the answer. He believes the courts should prioritize funding the Family Treatment Courts from their own budget.
“They’re out here blaming the Legislature for not funding $1.2 million to the Family Treatment Courts when they’re sitting on $30 million, and that’s what I think the voters need to know.”

Supreme Court’s past spending scandal still gives pause 
Barrett said he doesn’t think the current Supreme Court was doing anything improper with their available funds, but the court’s problematic spending history was still on his mind.
In 2018, every sitting member of the state Supreme Court of Appeals faced articles of impeachment from the House due to “unnecessary and lavish” spending of state taxpayer dollars to renovate their offices, among other charges. A temporary state Supreme Court later stopped those impeachment proceedings from continuing. Following Justice Beth Walker retirement in April, there are no active justices who were around during the scandal.
Following the spending corruption, West Virginia voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 that gave lawmakers the option of reducing part of the state judiciary’s annual budget. It also would require the Supreme Court’s chief justice to answer budget questions before lawmakers.
Barrett pointed to the 2018 ballot measure as to why the Legislature should continue to vet their spending.
“I don’t have any reason to believe that they’re storing this money to use it any inappropriately. I’m not making that accusation at all,” he said. “I think the way in which they feel like they should operate is inappropriate. They feel like they should be able to build up large balances so they can spend how they see fit, without any accountability to the Legislature.”
Hunt responded, “Since 2018, the new and remaining justices and new administrative office leadership have been absolutely committed to restoring public trust in the integrity of the judicial branch of government. 
“They have always sought to be open and transparent regarding their practices,” he continued. “They have worked to conservatively manage the budget, and have in fact, cut the budget several times.”
Early next year, Barrett will parse through the Supreme Court’s budget when they present their FY 2027 funding request at the State Capitol. He emphasized that lawmakers want to see Family Treatment Courts continue. 
“We will vet them thoroughly,” he said. “We are not just going to rubber stamp their budget request.”
Hunt said the courts are exploring if money from the First Foundation, which oversees the spending of opioid lawsuit settlement dollars, could be used to fund Family Treatment Courts. 
“The new court and leadership staff have maintained an open and respectful dialogue with virtually everyone in House and Senate leadership in recent years, and have worked to be completely transparent through our budget process,” Hunt said, adding that the justices have a meeting planned next week with legislative leaders to update them on fiscal operations.

(Photo by Sean McCallister/HD Media)Note: This piece contains references to suicide. The national Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is 988. 
What’s the point of solitary confinement? Rehab? Wrong. Reform? Nope. Remorse? Not even close. Public safety? No. It makes criminals more prone to crime. Creation of mental illness? Yes. Death? Yes — those in solitary keep attempting suicide. We have no cap on how long an adult prisoner can be isolated. A year, 10, 20 or more. The point: It’s cruel, unusual and morally indefensible. It’s time West Virginia abolished it.
The Mountain State’s penitentiary system suffers from extreme overcrowding and soaring jail death rates. Incarceration rates continue rising. The state’s correctional infrastructure deteriorates. 
Poor leadership does not help. In April, 2025, President Donald Trump announced via Truth Social that William “Billy” Marshall, previously the head of West Virginia’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR), would lead the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Wow. Bad news. 
That appointment should raise alarms.
Under Marshall’s watch, West Virginia’s correctional system faced damning allegations. A 2022 lawsuit was filed by the West Virginia ACLU and Mountain State Justice. It detailed inhumane conditions and overcrowding in jails.  
Marshall’s response? He said prisoners were lying while his department hid evidence related to that lawsuit. Two staffers were fired. Marshall remained. This is haunting. Our prisons are a mess. Solitary confinement makes it even more appalling.  
Remember COVID? What it was like to be isolated? Imagine being in a cell, unable to go outside or have social interaction for a decade. How would you fare? Would you go crazy? It’s not just biology — it’s barbarism. It is a sanctioned erasure of identity, memory, and cognition. If someone is isolated for years, how are they expected to function in society? Or be safer than they were going in? 
One prisoner’s story is on my mind. I can’t forget Keith Lowe, who recently made headlines. He has spent over 12 years in solitary confinement at Mount Olive Correctional Complex in West Virginia. Locked in darkness with no end. 
He had been diagnosed — long before his isolation — with numerous mental health issues. Do you think complete isolation helped? Heck no. Isolation destroys minds, not criminal behavior. Anyone would be driven mad under such circumstances. 
A judge’s order on May 23 required his immediate transfer to a mental health facility. His transfer order was ignored according to WVPB. This was after at least one suicide attempt. Then, he attempted to take his life once more. Somehow he procured a razor. 
As of Sept. 26 Lowe was transferred to a medical facility in Springfield, Missouri. Finally. But eventually he will likely be returned to indefinite solitary confinement back in West Virginia. Endless hell. 
Unlimited solitary confinement is often used by authoritarian regimes. Not democracies. The United States and West Virginia are outliers in their unfettered usage. 
International standards are much stricter. For instance, the United Nations’ “Nelson Mandela Rules” defines solitary confinement of over 15 days as torture. Most European countries and Canada have limited time. 
Some states such as New York and Colorado are reforming. West Virginia? Nope. As of now, no statute in West Virginia expressly prohibits or limits the duration of solitary confinement for adult inmates. Horrific. We cannot reform through prolonged isolation. 
Few politicians go out on a limb for this issue. What do they have to gain but a good conscience? Prisoners can’t vote. Doubtfully make large political donations. In money-saturated politics, solitary confinement is rarely top priority. But some care. 
In 2022, former Del. Danielle Walker introduced House Bill 4822 in the state Legislature to restrict solitary confinement to three days every two weeks. It failed. It was brought up in 2023. Failed again. Nothing changed.
Meanwhile, West Virginia’s incarceration rate remains troubling. According to the ACLU, West Virginia jails are the deadliest in the nation. When including all forms of incarceration, West Virginia remains one of the most heavily incarcerating states in the country according to the Prison Policy Initiative. It is unclear how many people wither alone in cages for solitary confinement. Or how long they have been there. 
Let me say this: America needs to abolish solitary confinement. At minimum, put strict limits on usage. Solitary confinement is legal torture. It’s also a lazy convenience. It’s easier to lock someone up indefinitely than to rehab them. Bottom line: We are supposed to be better than this. At the very least, we should be.

(Getty Images)In September, two short notice reductions were announced affecting at-risk populations. One was the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP) under the Department for Community Based Services (DCBS); the other a senior citizen meal program under the Department for Aging and Independent Living. Both agencies fall under the purview of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS). 
Things feel flawed.  Maybe it’s short notice reductions. Maybe lack of public discussion in legislative or other forums; maybe lack of stakeholder opportunities to provide impact statements on the how/who will be affected.  Maybe because we have months before we get a new state budget. What’s not a “maybe” is that vulnerable Kentuckians often suffer silently.  For me, silence isn’t an option as it feels we are cutting the “families” out of family services.
Three weeks ago, a single grandmother tearfully asked, “Can you help me?  I need financial assistance.”   Her daughter struggled with opioids and was incarcerated; her granddaughter is now in her care.  None of this was planned.  
This grandmother is one of thousands in Kentucky caring for kids in kinship care. Kinship is when a relative (other than biological parents) or family friend steps in and cares for a child. 
One assistance option for Kentucky kinship families comes from a federally funded grant known to us as KTAP.  It’s managed by CHFS. Typical recipients are 25% or more below poverty level.
In December 2022, during an Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee meeting, I sat alongside CHFS requesting a KTAP increase. Families hadn’t seen a KTAP cost of living adjustment since 1995, though inflation had increased 92%! Given that Kentucky had millions of dollars of unobligated federal funds,  legislators consented to the CHFS proposed rates which were doubled.
Last week, CHFS announced a KTAP reduction effective this November. Reasons such as more kids in foster care, social worker overtime and rising costs, etc. CHFS didn’t publicly share the reduction rate but one caregiver’s letter reflected approximately a 35% loss.
Sadly, that grandmother who called for help was already receiving KTAP. KTAP typically helps with shelter, food, gas, insurance and all things to raise a child. In about a month, her assistance will decrease while the granddaughter’s odds of going to foster care will  increase because her grandmother will not be able to support her. The grandmother cried before, she will probably cry again.  
I’ve got so many questions: Shouldn’t legislators be involved as they were in 2022?  Where’s our Kentucky “situation room” bringing in stakeholders (legislators, nonprofits and others) to assess impacts, tradeoffs and options first?  Where were the public alarms targeting KTAP?  Are decisions only made within closed off buildings without voices of those affected?  Are we robbing one child for another?  
Shifting to another recent reduction — senior citizen meals. On Sept.12, The News- Enterprise of Elizabethtown published “Funding shortfall forces cuts to local senior citizen meals.”
The article reports that CHFS insisted it had correct funding projections of approximately $10 million for the senior meal program; legislators were willing to fund up to $14.5 million.  
Daniel London, the Lincoln Trail Area Development District’s (ADD) executive director, said that area development districts were notified at 4:30 on Sept. 8 to immediately begin cutting meals. Their regional reduction is estimated at a loss of 600-800 “Grab and Go Meals” for seniors. There are 15 area development districts statewide resulting in the loss of thousands of meals. An empty plate for a senior citizen is not trivial.  
State Sen. Matt Deneen said in the News-Enterprise article that lawmakers “were willing to bring the funding up to $14.5 (million) based on the data from the districts but we were told the funding was not needed. It’s disappointing to learn that the Cabinet’s number appears not to (have) been correct.  I hope the Cabinet rethinks their formulas.”  
I absolutely understand that if the checkbook starts to get low, action is warranted. However, it doesn’t feel like we are doing our best in the current approaches. Many seniors, children and families might agree.
I believe that whoever is budgeting and forecasting in CHFS needs to get a new calculator and practice using a megaphone. Consider more voices in the room before proclaiming decisions. This work impacts the lives of thousands of vulnerable human beings. Don’t cut the “families” out of family services.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)HCA Virginia plans to open three freestanding emergency rooms by the middle of next year in the city of Richmond as well as Henrico and Loudoun counties. Officials say the facilities will help reduce emergency department wait times at other hospitals both in and outside of the HCA umbrella.
While celebrating the groundbreaking of the Richmond location on Thursday morning, speakers emphasized that the facility is an example of  “meeting people where they are.”
The freestanding ERs are expected to operate 24/7 everyday of the year. They’ll be staffed by board-certified emergency physicians, along with nurses and supported by full diagnostic and imaging capabilities. 
“It will mean quicker access to emergency expert care,” said Dr. Bjorn Bernhardsen, a medical director with HCA. “It means confidence that when emergencies happen, help is close by.”
The decision  to open new facilities in Richmond, Chesterfield and Loudoun County stems from the localities’ noted population growth and anticipated projections through the Weldon Cooper Center For Public Service at the University of Virginia. 
Dubbed Scott’s Walk ER, the Richmond facility will be built in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood. While the city has hospitals in its eastern and western reaches, the freestanding ER will fill a gap in the area and is also located near I-95 — an access point for Henrico County residents that might need it. 
Devin Tobin, chief operations officer at Henrico Doctors’ Hospital, said that neighboring facilities were seeing patients coming from within Richmond city limits and that helped signal the need for a facility in the area. HCA Virginia is also investing $5 million to open three new urgent care centers in the Richmond region over the next two years.
Virginia lawmakers, health officials brace for Medicaid changes

The forthcoming facilities are in development at a time when some health systems are bracing for federal funding changes and expected drops in Medicaid patients stemming from a reconciliation bill that Congress passed this summer. 
Formally titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the legislation was aimed at reducing taxes for some and increasing federal spending on the U.S. military and border security, and was fully backed by President Donald Trump. It came at the cost of major changes to federal health care funding that affects hospitals and adjustments to Medicaid eligibility. 
Last month, Augusta Health announced the closure of two primary care clinics and an urgent care clinic and cited the OBBBA as one of the factors in the decision. Six hospitals in Virginia were also flagged as vulnerable to potential service cuts or closures when the federal funding changes take effect and thousands of Virginians may lose their health insurance through Medicaid. 
Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, an association that speaks on behalf of hospital chains and health systems in Virginia joined several other states in writing a letter to Congress expressing concerns about the bill. While Democrats opposed the legislation, some Republicans expressed similar concerns. U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virignia Beach, were among a small group of Republicans cautioning against the bill before ultimately voting to pass it. 
While the six vulnerable Virginia-based hospitals are not owned by HCA, the health system has about 180 hospitals around the country, Tobin said Thursday morning. She explained that HCA leadership has been in conversations regionally and nationally about their needs. 
“Learning from each other of how we’re adapting with the regulatory changes has really been a focus, and then really relying on our relationships with our political leaders to educate them on what we need in order to care for the communities has been, I think, a big benefit and success,” she said.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAfter much hand wringing and consternation from lawmakers who feared detrimental effects to Michigan’s cannabis industry, the Michigan Senate voted early Friday morning by a thin margin to pass a 24% wholesale tax on marijuana products sold in the state.
The measure is estimated to raise $420 million in new revenue to fund road repairs and construction in the new fiscal year, a key component of the budget deal reached by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids).
If the vote had failed, the entire deal would more than likely fall apart, sending the respective chambers and the governor’s office back to the negotiating table. Such a development would have also sent the state into a full government shutdown. House leadership said Thursday that it would not entertain another continuation budget after the one passed Wednesday expired after Oct. 8.
Although many members of the cannabis industry rallied at the Capitol and lobbied lawmakers against passing the legislation, the implications of the entire deal falling through weighed heavily on the Legislature’s mind.

The House and Senate on late Thursday and early Friday morning passed their respective conference budgets to fund the whole of government, K-12 schools and higher education, but all of that hinged on passage of the marijuana tax.
The bill passed by a slim 19-17 vote, which had nearly as much bipartisan dissent as it did support.
Brinks and the following senators voted in favor of the bill: Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), Mary Cavanagh (D-Redford Township), Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), John Cherry (D-Flint), Kevin Daley (R-Lum), Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe), Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway), Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan), Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia), Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), Roger Victory (R-Georgetown Township) and Paul Wojno (D-Warren).
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) voted no against the bill. He was one of the legislation’s strongest opponents. 
Irwin was joined by Sens. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe), Jon Bumstead (R-North Muskegon), John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs), Roger Hauck (R-Mount Pleasant), Kevin Hertel (D-Saint Clair Shores), Michele Hoitenga (R-Manton), Mark Huizenga (R-Walker), Ruth Johnson (R-Groveland Township), Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), Jim Runestad (R-White Lake), Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township), Lana Theis (R-Brighton) and Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills).
A large portion of the day was spent debating the measure in caucus meetings and whipping votes to ensure the tax did not go up in smoke.
Brinks and Hall were repeatedly seen in the Capitol meeting on the chamber floors and entering offices to discuss the status behind closed doors. Whitmer also called groups of lawmakers into her Capitol office at multiple points throughout the afternoon and evening on Thursday.

One of those lawmakers was Chang, who on Tuesday put forward an amendment to the marijuana tax that would have brought the rate down to 20%, with the caveat of a tie-bar to the senator’s proposed nicotine products and e-cigarettes tax. Chang surmised that the amendment would not be taken up in an interview with Michigan Advance.
When she left Whitmer’s office on Thursday evening, she was asked if she and the governor had discussed her proposal. Chang said that they had. 
As to whether the proposal was likely a new vehicle for what appeared to be a flailing 24% rate, Chang would not comment on how the Senate planned to vote. She also said then that she was undecided on the 24% tax.
The conversation in the House veered wildly as the day and night wore on. At first, Hall was confident that the measure, which originated in the House, would pass because Brinks proposed it when they began negotiations for new revenue. The House speaker also cautioned that not following through on passage would scuttle their loose deal with Whitmer on revenue for roads.
That would have also meant a new phase in the budget crisis – a real government shutdown, given Hall’s unwillingness to pass another continuation budget.
With several senators expressing opposition to the tax, it became possible that the deal could careen off a cliff of Brinks’ own making, and key members of the House started shifting their tone from hopeful anticipation to stark warnings about the deal falling apart.
In the end, the Senate whipped up just enough bipartisan votes to get the tax across the finish line.
For Irwin’s part, he issued a floor speech echoing some of his comments made earlier when the tax was proposed.

Lindsey also said he would vote no in a floor speech. He indicated that it bothered him that some members of the upper chamber were gleefully willing to vote yes, specifically due to the potential impacts: a shrinking of the industry because of a higher tax burden and potential closures of dispensaries across Michigan.
McBroom was one of those yes votes on the GOP side. In his own floor speech, he said that the industry failed to meet its promise to fill state coffers with new tax revenue to a significant degree, and that maybe a right-sizing of the industry was in order. McBroom said he wished the tax rate was even higher than what was proposed.
To some of the industry leaders who vehemently opposed the tax, McBroom said the law that legalized marijuana and set up a regulatory and tax scheme always referenced avenues for collecting other taxes related to marijuana sales.
Brinks had a fight on her hands to get the necessary votes, but she was victorious at 4 a.m. on Wednesday morning when she spoke to members of the Capitol press corps.
“It was tough to fit it in with the rest of the demands of the budget and still be responsible, but we managed to do it,” Brinks said. “I think there was a willingness to consider multiple ways to get enough revenue … this just happened to be the one that could get the votes. I do know that politics is really the art of what’s possible, and in this case, that’s the road it led us down, no pun intended.”

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. 
 FOIA data exposes soaring ICE arrests in Virginia

ICE arrests in Virginia have surged under the administration of President Donald Trump, with agents making 4,264 arrests in the state during the first seven months of 2025, nearly triple the total from all of 2024, according to federal court records and analysis by the Deportation Data Project, WHRO’s Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism reported last month.
That seven-month figure eclipses the combined total ICE arrests in Virginia for the same period in each of the previous four years — 2021 through 2024. At its peak in June, Virginia saw a daily average of about 34 arrests per day, mirroring national trends.
The data underpinning the reporting was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act-based lawsuit against ICE by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, giving researchers access to previously redacted enforcement datasets. These anonymized records include arrest dates, locations, past criminal history, country of origin, age and other case‐level details.
Notably, most people arrested by ICE in Virginia had no criminal record. Only about 29% had prior convictions, and fewer than 16% had pending charges. Some lawful permanent residents and even U.S. citizens were among those detained and later released.
Professor David Hausman, director of the Deportation Data Project, suggested that a July court ruling in Los Angeles — which temporarily barred DHS from engaging in illegal profiling — may have contributed to the arrest decline seen in late June and July nationwide.
Virginia, which hosts around 872,000 immigrants, ranks among the top 10 states in ICE arrests per capita.
 Push for FOIA library sparks debate at Richmond City Hall

A Richmond city councilmember is advancing a proposal she calls “radical transparency,” urging the city to establish a FOIA library that would make public every request the city receives, the documents released and the associated fees. The idea emerged during a tense Sept. 24 council committee meeting, according to a report by WTVR.
“It’s clear that residents today in Richmond, they don’t trust their city’s government,” Councilmember Kenya Gibson said in introducing the ordinance. 
Gibson’s push follows years of scrutiny over City Hall’s handling of transparency, including a recent lawsuit from WTVR alleging FOIA noncompliance. 
At the meeting, several citizens supported Gibson’s plan. One advocacy group volunteer recounted “extreme delays … fragmentary information, and very high charges” in past requests. 
A representative from the Richmond Education Association acknowledged recent improvements in the FOIA office but argued that a formal library would cement transparency gains. “Unless you put in permanent structures … you can only create maybe temporary improvements,” she said.
Gibson referenced a pending lawsuit filed by former FOIA officer Connie Clay, who claimed she was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about the city’s “repeated unethical and unlawful practices” in suppressing information. “The optics in this case are not good,” Gibson added.
City officials expressed mixed views. Chief Administrative Officer Odie Donald said discussing open litigation in public is “quite dangerous for the city” and asked for additional time to refine what the library would publish. He acknowledged support for the concept but raised concerns about liability and unintended consequences.
Ross Catrow, Richmond’s communications director, said the city receives around 5,500 FOIA requests annually. To run a FOIA library, he estimated Richmond would need three new staffers — with salaries totaling about $350,000 — and extra effort to categorize and vet documents. 
Ultimately, the committee declined to vote on the ordinance, opting to continue discussions over the next 30 days.
 Protesters shut out of UVA board meeting, raising FOIA concerns

A University of Virginia Board of Visitors meeting last month drew protests after dozens of students and community members were unable to enter the small Rotunda boardroom, raising questions about whether the university violated state open meeting laws.
UVA’s Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy graduate student Eli Weinger, among those blocked from entry, accused the board of intentionally limiting access. “We’re here, lined up to try to get in the room … we know the Board of Visitors has set up a structure that makes being heard impossible, and that’s intentional,” Weinger told The Cavalier Daily. “They don’t want to listen to what we have to say.”
In a statement, university spokesperson Brian Coyne said UVA complied with state requirements. “We accommodate as many members of the media and public into open sessions as possible, without violating fire code restrictions … We also make all open sessions available via livestream,” Coyne said.
The Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes meetings are open. A 2013 advisory opinion found UVA’s Board violated FOIA by denying students entry, recommending larger venues when public interest is high. The Virginia Supreme Court reaffirmed that principle in 2023, ruling public bodies must admit people up to capacity even if a livestream is offered.
Kevin Martingayle, a Virginia Beach attorney and UVA Law alumnus, said the university is “highly likely” to lose if sued. “They were told of this requirement in 2013 … and the Supreme Court of Virginia said it again in 2023,” he said. “They are inviting litigation and that’s a real mistake.”
The Rotunda boardroom holds about 60 people, including board members.

(Photo courtesy of Brown University Health)CJ was living alone, struggling with bipolar disorder and past trauma. Isolated and fearful, she had lost trust in both law enforcement and health care institutions. When police needed to enter CJ’s home during a crisis, the outcome could have been tragic.
Instead, the moment became a turning point. 
The local police department connected CJ with MaryKate, a clinician at Gateway Healthcare, one of Rhode Island’s largest nonprofit behavioral health care providers. Over time, MaryKate helped CJ restore her home, reunite with her dog and supported her in reconnecting with family members. Through a community program that partners behavioral health clinicians with local police, CJ built a trusting relationship with MaryKate that helped to transform her life.
CJ is one of thousands of clients helped by Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics like Gateway Healthcare each year. These clinics deliver integrated mental health care and substance use treatment in homes, schools, shelters, and other community settings, often before a crisis escalates. Through 24/7 mobile crisis teams, clinicians like MaryKate embedded in emergency rooms and police departments meet people in crisis before hospitalization becomes necessary. We are addressing barriers to health care like housing, finances, transportation.
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics are crucial to our health care system. Formerly called community mental health centers, they are jointly supported by federal and state Medicaid funding and make it possible to treat significant volumes of clients enrolled in government insurance programs. State and local governments must keep prioritizing them as essential solutions to addressing our country’s behavioral health crisis.
The evidence is clear: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics work. A 2024 report by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that clients receiving care saw up to a 72% reduction in hospitalizations. These clinics improve outcomes, prevent long stays in emergency departments and reduce pressure on hospitals, especially in states like Rhode Island, where Emergency department overcrowding and longer wait times are a growing concern.










The evidence is clear: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics work. A 2024 report by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that clients receiving care saw up to a 72% reduction in hospitalizations.


Continued investment doesn’t just maintain access, it enables innovation. Gateway’s co-responder model and partnerships with law enforcement helped CJ heal and rebuild, made possible through this flexible structure.
The Rhode Island General Assembly took an important step in increasing Medicaid funding for community providers earlier this summer. Our state must continue to protect Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics as a cornerstone of its mental health and substance use response. These clinics are more than providers — they are embedded support systems helping our neighbors, our family members, and those who too often fall through the cracks.
Policymakers, providers, and the public must recognize the full value of providers like Gateway Healthcare, not only through clinical data, but by their impact on the lives of people like CJ. 
When we invest in community-based behavioral health care, we are investing in prevention, wellbeing, and stability. We ease the burden on emergency departments. And most importantly, we give people a real chance to heal wherever they are.

,DC,2025-10-03 09:10:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Renewal of health subsidies backed by big majorities in poll, including Trump voters",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/renewal-health-subsidies-backed-big-majorities-poll-including-trump-voters,,"WASHINGTON — The vast majority of Americans, including Republicans and those who identify as strong supporters of President Donald Trump, want Congress to renew the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, according to a poll released Friday. More than 78% of people surveyed by the nonpartisan health organization KFF in late September said they want lawmakers to keep the enhanced credits. Their extension has become a major linchpin in debate about the government shutdown. When broken down by political party, 92% of Democrats, 82% of independents and 59% of Republicans supported renewing the credits.Within the Republican Party, 57% of people who identified as supporting Trump’s Make America Great Again policies and 70% of GOP voters who identified as non-MAGA supporters want to see the tax credits extended, according to the poll.  Spending bill held up over tax credit debateThe ACA tax credit expansion was created by Democrats in a coronavirus relief bill approved during the Biden administration and set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have repeatedly called on Republicans to negotiate an extension of the enhanced tax credits and have held up a stopgap spending bill to force those talks to happen now, rather than later in the year. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Thursday the discussion should happen during the next few months and that GOP lawmakers will press for “major reform.” “That's not a simple issue. That's going to take weeks to deliberate and discuss and debate, but that's the beauty of the process. We have three months to do that. That is not an issue for today,” Johnson said. “Today the only issue is whether they're going to vote to keep the government operating for the people.”Democrats strongly disagree, saying a bipartisan accord must be struck before the open enrollment period for ACA plans begins on Nov. 1, when consumers will see large cost increases for next year. “We can't accept an empty promise, which is, 'Oh, we'll deal with this later,'” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said on a call with reporters Thursday. “The fact is that this crisis is in front of us now. People are getting this month their premium increases if the Senate does not act.”Murray said she finds it “ironic” that Republican leaders are saying they’ll negotiate with Democrats on health care once the government reopens after they “refused to negotiate with us during that entire time when government was open.”The House voted mostly along party lines in mid-September to approve a seven-week stopgap spending bill that has since stalled in the Senate, leading to the shutdown.The upper chamber, where major legislation needs at least 60 votes to advance, is set to vote again Friday to try to advance Republicans’ short-term government funding bill, though it's unlikely to move forward amid the stalemate.  Many of those polled knew little about shutdown debate The KFF poll looked at public knowledge and understanding about the enhanced tax credits for ACA Marketplace health insurance plans, finding 61% of respondents knew nothing or only a little about the issue. Another 32% of those surveyed said they know some about the policy debate and 7% said they know a lot. The poll of 1,334 adults took place Sept. 23 to Sept. 29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for a full survey. Each political affiliation question has a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.The government shutdown began on Oct. 1, just after the poll wrapped. Concern about the ramifications of letting the enhanced tax credits expire fluctuated when KFF asked the question in different ways, though those who said they were “very concerned” never dipped below a majority. Fifty-six percent were very concerned and 30% were somewhat concerned when told “health insurance would be unaffordable for many people who buy their own coverage” if the enhanced tax credits weren’t extended. The number of people who would be very or somewhat concerned was high among Republicans, 78%, and MAGA supporters, 76%. Respondents who were very concerned rose to 60% when told “about 4 million people will lose their health insurance coverage” if they do not keep receiving the enhanced credits. An additional 26% said they were somewhat concerned and 10% said they were not too concerned, with the rest of those polled saying they were not concerned at all. When broken down by political party, the number of people very or somewhat concerned remained high, with 76% of Republicans and 73% of MAGA supporters citing worry. Small business staff, self-employed peopleFifty-one percent of those polled said they were very concerned when told “millions of people who work at small businesses or who are self-employed would be directly impacted as many of them rely on the ACA marketplace.”Another 33% said they were somewhat concerned, 11% said they were not too concerned and the remainder said they were not concerned at all. Seventy-five percent of Republicans and 72% of MAGA supporters responded they would be very or somewhat concerned when asked that question. The poll showed that Congress extending the enhanced tax credits as they exist now comes with some trepidation about the price tag. When asked how concerned people would be if they heard “it would require significant federal spending that would be largely paid for by taxpayers,” 27% said they would be very concerned, 36% somewhat concerned, 28% not too concerned and 8% not at all concerned. Forty-one percent of Republicans said they would be very concerned, with another 41% responding they would be somewhat concerned. An additional 15% said they would be not too concerned with the rest saying they were not concerned at all.",,,,2025-10-03 05:57:11.579949

(Photo by Barbara Davidson/Pool/Getty Images)An estimated 1.4 million immigrants who are in the country legally but are not citizens stand to lose their government-subsidized health care coverage under the sweeping tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law this summer, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts federal spending on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. It also places new eligibility restrictions on lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, who are enrolled in a variety of government-subsidized health programs: Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally have long been ineligible for federally funded health coverage.
But seven states — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington — plus the District of Columbia have extended state-funded coverage to some income-eligible noncitizen adults regardless of their immigration status. Fourteen states plus the district provide state-funded coverage to noncitizen children whether they are here legally or not.
The new restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with other Trump policies limiting public benefits for immigrants, put those states in a financial bind. With less federal money to provide health benefits to immigrants who are here legally, states will be hard-pressed to maintain their programs that offer coverage to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.
Health care would be slashed even for immigrants with legal status under massive Senate bill

“We’re taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it,” said Tanya Broder, a senior counsel specializing in immigrant health policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.
“And the result will be that our health — individually, as families and as communities — will be in jeopardy, and the health care infrastructure that serves all of us will also be compromised,” Broder said.
Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants — regardless of status — have been pulling back.
To help close a $12 billion deficit, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Current enrollees between the ages of 19 and 59 will have to pay a new $30 monthly premium beginning in 2027. In July 2026, the state will eliminate dental care for noncitizens.
Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64. The state still operates a state-funded plan for residents 65 and older regardless of immigration status, but enrollment has been paused. And Minnesota also plans to exclude adult immigrants who are here illegally from a program that used to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.
New York is in an especially tough spot, since its state constitution prohibits discrimination against lawfully present immigrants in providing public benefits.










We're taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it.


– Tanya Broder, National Immigration Law Center 


“States have had some type of leeway to fund resources for migrant communities if they want to,” said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor and the founding director of the Medical-Legal Partnership Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law who studies immigrants’ access to health care. “But now this [federal] law makes it difficult for them to do that.”
Making it less attractive to stay
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration policies, said these efforts are part of both Trump’s larger anti-immigration stance and “Congress’ interest in getting rid of any incentive or benefit for people who are in the country illegally.”
“It’s a way of making it less attractive for people to stay here illegally, right?” Vaughan said. “They’re trying to give people reasons to leave rather than reasons to stay.”
As noncitizens who are here legally lose access to federally funded benefits, the demand for state-funded coverage is “likely to increase,” Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, told Stateline.
“However, at the same time, states are facing increasing budget pressures, especially with the Medicaid cuts,” Pillai said. “So it’s almost a double whammy, where there will likely be increased demand for state-funded coverage programs, but also states will have fewer resources to cover people.”
Makhlouf said the Trump administration’s policy changes reflect a broader strategy of stripping public benefits from marginalized and poor communities.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

“Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what’s happening to immigrants,” she said. “When it becomes normalized to be able to sacrifice certain people’s humanity or their vulnerability, or to minimize their contributions to society, and say, ‘You don’t deserve access to health care,’ then that can be turned on to any group.”
Under Trump’s domestic policy law, California expects to lose at least $28.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding, according to Newsom’s office.
On the California Senate floor June 27, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo expressed her sorrow at the state’s decision to deny coverage to immigrants.
“I can’t express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,” Durazo said. “Today, that joy that I was so happy about, that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame.”
Democratic Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, however, said the state had little choice.
“We are a state of immigrants, 10.6 million strong. And we will never turn our backs on those who are part of the heart of the largest economy in the United States of America,” McGuire said during the debate. “So we’ve had to make some tough decisions. I know we’re not going to please everyone.”
Obligated in New York
One state, New York, is particularly in a bind, because its constitution requires it to provide coverage to lawfully present noncitizens.
Roxana, 27, has been living in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, since she was 8 years old and is using her first name only out of fear she will be targeted. At the end of 2019, she experienced a range of debilitating symptoms, including pelvic pain and chronic fatigue, and discovered a noncancerous lump on her breast.
“Chronic illness has impacted my career trajectory with a lot of fatigue and chronic pain,” said Roxana, who lives in the Bronx, New York.
Roxana cannot get federally funded Medicaid. But she qualified for state-funded public health coverage in New York. A 2001 court case, Aliessa v. Novello, requires the state to offer publicly funded health coverage to all lawfully present residents under the state constitution. So, she could afford to go to the doctor, where she learned that she had a hormonal condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, and she was able to get the lump removed.
Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

New York mostly picked up the tab for immigrants and other lawfully residing immigrants until 2016, when it launched coverage it called the Essential Plan under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, the plan has no deductibles or monthly premiums for patients, and the federal government has picked up almost the entire cost — 90% — of the plan, a huge economic relief for the state.
Now, New York faces an annual loss of $13.5 billion in federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funds. Additionally, the phasing out of premium tax credits for noncitizens under Trump’s law would lead to a loss of $7.5 billion in annual funding to the state’s Essential Plan, which covers 1.7 million New Yorkers.
“These are billions of dollars that are being taken away and out of New York’s delivery system,” Amir Bassiri, director of Medicaid at the New York State Department of Health, said at a United Hospital Fund conference on July 30.
It’s unclear whether and how the state will afford to cover people like Roxana, even though it’s required under the state’s constitution. Like other immigrants, she is terrified that in the face of cuts and shrinking safety net access for noncitizens, she will lose continuous health care coverage and that her condition will get worse.
“My PCOS symptoms have just been getting worse over the years. I really want to try my best with the health access that I have to get it under control.”

Here, a bee works on a flower in Henniker last month. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The familiar velvet-brown wings of the mourning cloak butterfly, rimmed with sunny yellow edges and bright blue spots, were a sight that once marked the onset of mud season in New Hampshire.
In recent years, though, the butterfly — which typically emerges from hibernation before the last patches of snow have receded — has become less common. Populations of mourning cloaks, or Nymphalis antiopa, have declined about 70% across the Northeast in the last 26 years, said Emily May, an entomologist with insect conservation nonprofit Xerces Society.
“Butterflies that New Hampshire residents have grown up seeing, like mourning cloaks, the first ones to come out in spring, (and) tortoiseshells [Nymphalis vaualbum and Nymphalis milberti], have declined by over two-thirds since 2000,” May said.
Broadly, butterflies have become one-third less plentiful across the Northeast since the turn of the century, May said. Half of all butterfly species native to the region are experiencing a decline – and this trend extends across many insect families. From bees to beetles, moths, and aquatic insects, bug populations are shrinking across the region, country, and the world.
“Twenty years ago, you’d be driving at night and you’d have insects all over your windshield,” said Rep. John MacDonald, of Wolfeboro. “You don’t see that anymore.”
Several pieces of proposed legislation will attempt to address this trend at the state level in the upcoming session, including a study committee proposed by Rep. Peter Bixby, of Dover, and two related to pesticide use proposed by MacDonald. The answer will be complex, said May, and will likely require collaboration and attention from farmers, conservationists, and policymakers. 
Identifying the causes – and ripple effects – of insect decline
Both Bixby and MacDonald said the legislative service requests they filed this fall were inspired by constituent concerns about insect decline and its spillover effects.
Insects form the base of many food chains and pollinate both wild plants and cultivated crops. They recycle nutrients, spread seeds, and aerate soils; the ubiquity of their contributions to ecosystems and agriculture, May said, means their disappearance has broad implications, too.
“When insects decline, it ripples outward,” she said. “It affects farms, streams and lakes, forests, and people, and these butterflies and stream insects, like mayflies, are really the canaries in the coal mine.”
An array of factors contribute to insect decline, May said, but among those, she pointed to three major drivers: habitat loss, climate change, and insecticides. 
Insecticides
In addition to pushing for native habitat restoration and climate change action, May sees regulating pesticides as a direct way for legislators to protect insect populations.
“The science is really clear, that these are contributing to declines, and that we have some of the solutions available, including through policy,” she said. “We know some of the largest pesticide threats to insects, to pollinators, to aquatic insects, and so there are policy tools available to help stave off insect declines.”
Pesticides are regulated nationally by the Environmental Protection Agency and by each state’s government. In New Hampshire, the Division of Pesticide Control, within the Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food, oversees pesticide regulation and collects data on commercial and private uses across the state.
Anyone applying pesticides to a crop they intend to sell, and anyone applying pesticides professionally to someone else’s property, must attain a license, according to the division’s website. And certain pesticides are also classified as “restricted use,” meaning they can be sold only by licensed dealers and used with a permit. Licenses and restricted-use permits both require passage of a written exam.
In New Hampshire, 128 pesticides are classified as restricted use, according to the administrative rule code of the Pesticide Control Board. More strictly regulated than those are the eight pesticides classified as “prohibited-limited use,” some of which require specialized additional permits for each use or are restricted to use by government agencies; and most strictly regulated of all are the 17 pesticides whose use the rules prohibit entirely — a list that, among others, includes DDT, mercury, and aldrin.
A class of pesticides called neonicotinoids are the focus of MacDonald’s two insecticide proposals. Neonicotinoids, or “neonics,” are the most widely used pesticides in the United States, according to May.
In recent years, neonics have received attention from conservationists concerned about their impacts on off-target species. As long-lasting compounds that are neurotoxic to many species, the chemicals can have off-target effects when they escape into the environment, May said. 
A 2023 analysis by the EPA found that three neonicotinoid pesticides had contributed to the decline of hundreds of endangered species, though some conservationists said then that the true impact could be worse. The compounds are particularly toxic to bees, and as such, “have become well known as something that has been really a red flag for pollinators,” May said. The chemicals can also have negative effects on birds and other animals.
One of MacDonald’s proposed bills, he said, seeks to define and recognize the class of neonicotinoid pesticides in statute, then increase regulations on them by categorizing them as restricted use. That change will prevent the use of neonicotinoids in some non-agricultural cases and keep them from being sold over-the-counter, MacDonald said – it is not intended to prohibit their use in farming. The bill would also seek to prevent the use of neonicotinoids on state properties, he added.
“That’ll set an example for our citizens,” MacDonald said. “… It’s to help the birds, the bees, and the beneficial insects in our state.”
MacDonald’s second neonicotinoid proposal does encompass agriculture, by proposing outlawing neonicotinoid-coated seeds. Seed coatings are a major way the pesticides are applied in some forms of agriculture, particularly in the treatment of crops like corn and soybeans, May said. 
However, it is not clear how widespread use of the treated seeds is in New Hampshire. The EPA does not track the use of such products from state to state, and Division of Pesticide Control Director David Rousseau said in an email he did not know how common the practice was in New Hampshire. 
A balanced approach can minimize, but not eliminate, farmers’ need for ‘hot chemicals’
Among growers, pesticides and their regulation has become “a touchy subject” over the years, said farmer Stephen Wood, who has grown apples at Poverty Lane Orchard in Lebanon since 1965. 
Wood said he and the New Hampshire growers he knows take the ecological well-being of their orchards, farms, and the surrounding area, as well as the health of their employees, seriously. While he said that insecticides warrant concern and a measured approach, he also said it was important to recognize that they can be a crucial part of a farmer’s toolkit when it matters most.
“We call them hot chemicals — I mean the things that you want to protect yourself and your workers from, or that you want to be careful of what their ecological effect is,” he said. “But we use them because they are the most efficacious, in the big picture way, of accomplishing the goal we need to accomplish, which is to grow marketable crops. And, you know, my land … This would be house lots if we couldn’t grow marketable things on it.”
Farmers are motivated, Wood said, to take a modern approach to spraying to efficiently preserve their crops, and to minimize the spillover effects. But that motivation, according to Wood, comes not from state-level regulation but from a simpler desire for healthy orchards and fields.
Wood recalled the evolution of mainstream approaches to pest management throughout the decades he has spent growing apples in New Hampshire. In the 1960s and ’70s, farmers sprayed “by the calendar,” Wood said, applying insecticides on a strict schedule regardless of conditions in the field. But since then, the accumulation of research into other ways of managing pests more efficiently has led many growers to adopt a more measured approach.
Now, “integrated pest management,” or IPM, which relies on weather data, an array of management techniques, and careful observation of the pests threatening a crop at any given moment, has taken the place of by-the-calendar spraying, Wood said.
“This is conventional for a lot of us,” he said. “You know? I mean, we are IPM growers, and we have been forever.”
Through IPM, farmers like himself have been able to significantly reduce their reliance on pesticides, Wood said. Techniques are varied, but could involve monitoring crops to determine when a pest is about to take hold — then deploying a means of control, such as an insecticide, at the targeted moment when it will be most effective.
Farmers may also lure insects to specific trees in their orchard using cocktails of synthetic pheromones before treating only those specific trees, Wood said — another way to reduce the amount of insecticide necessary to control the threat. 
Such a method is currently one of the best ways of dealing with the plum curculio, a “totally erratic” pest that could sabotage an entire season’s apple crop in the course of one spring evening, according to Wood. But to execute it, Wood said, farmers need flexible access to pesticides to respond nimbly to different insect threats.
Wood said he broadly considered attempts to regulate pesticides at the state and local level counterproductive and misguided. The testing and regulation conducted by the EPA, he said, are enough to guide growers.
“There is no reason for state or local regulations, and they’re damaging, because the amount of knowledge and research that goes into the federal regulations is not going to be undertaken by a state or a municipality,” Wood said. “It’s too involved and too expensive.”
Wood, who carries a hand lens around his neck to inspect the insects in his orchard, said he values beneficial insects from pollinators to the predatory insects that can naturally control other, more threatening pests. Citing the example of different pollinator species that visit plants at different times, keeping pollination going throughout different weather conditions and times of year, May similarly said that a rich diversity of species is crucial to agriculture.
For that reason, May said, she also advocates for integrated pest management — which she expanded to “integrated pest and pollinator management” to include the positive management of beneficial insects, too. 
“That framework alone can help limit the amount of pesticide input entering the system, and really places the emphasis on … ecologically sound pest management practices based on cultural, mechanical, and biological tools first, before the use of pesticides,” she said.
“IPM, you know, it ain’t perfect, and it’s always evolving,” Wood said. But he considers it better, and cheaper, than other ways of controlling pests.
May said she believes there are ways to ensure agriculture can remain productive and profitable while also allowing insect populations to flourish. That includes reducing pesticide harm through IPM, rotating crops, and introducing more plant species variability and native habitat, she said. 
“When it comes to insect declines and pesticide reduction, there’s always more we can do,” she said. 
But she and Wood both said the answer, when it comes to pesticides, is not all-or-nothing, and will take an evolving approach.
“It would be great if things were simple. They’re not,” Wood said. “It would be great if there were straight answers to all these questions. There aren’t. The only solution, the only improvement is systemic applied research, a slow increase in knowledge and understanding, and its application.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/beeflower-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-03 05:57:11.579949

If Republicans get their way on one of those programs, insurance premiums for 427,000 Ohioans could double on average. Insurers in the state are already asking for big increases in premiums.
The government shut down at midnight Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans failed to agree to a spending plan. Democrats are demanding that the GOP roll back nearly $1 trillion in cuts they made to Medicaid earlier this year as part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
That bill also gave giant tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans, largely by extending tax breaks passed in 2017 during the first Trump administration. Even though congressional Republicans were eager to extend those tax breaks, they’re digging in over demands to extend health subsidies for average and low-income Americans.
Known as the “enhanced premium tax credit,” it was created during the COVID-19 pandemic to subsidize premiums for insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The average subsidy they provided was $705 a year in 2024.
Since they were introduced in 2021, the number of people using the exchanges more than doubled, from 11 million to 24 million, KFF, a health-care analysis nonprofit, reported this week. The subsidies have been credited with helping to push the rate of uninsured Americans to an all-time low.
In the same report, KFF said that premiums for insurance purchased on the exchanges “will more than double” if the subsidies are allowed to expire at the end of the year. As with the cost of health care, the size of the subsidies has grown annually, so their expiration means bigger losses for recipients going forward, the KFF report said.
“Based on the earlier federal data and other more recent publicly available information, KFF now estimates that, if Congress extends enhanced premium tax credits, subsidized enrollees would save $1,016 in premium payments over the year in 2026 on average,” it said. “In other words, expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits is estimated to more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay annually for premiums — a 114% increase from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.”
Individual impacts will vary based on age and income. 
For example, a 45-year-old making $35,000 a year would see an annual increase of almost $1,600. Meanwhile, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see an $18,000 premium increase, the KFF report said.
With the credits in jeopardy, insurers who offer plans on the Ohio exchanges are proposing big increases. Open enrollment for 2026 begins on Nov. 1, so insurers and state regulators have to plan without knowing what the fate of the subsidies will be.
In Ohio, eight companies are offering 17 plans for 2026. All are proposing premium increases ranging from 2.5% to 42%. While increases at the top end of the spectrum are big, it’s not clear they’ll keep pace if the subsidies are allowed to expire.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCentene, owner of Buckeye Community Health Plan, insures the largest number of Ohioans using the ACA exchanges — 75,ooo in 2023. In an email, a spokesman cited several reasons for proposed increases of 25% to 28% for its 2026 plans.
“Over the past several months we have been working closely with Ohio regulators and their third-party actuaries to balance rising healthcare costs with the needs of Ohio citizens,” the spokesman said. “Our rate adjustments reflect higher-than-expected care needs than in previous years, including increased hospitalizations, emergency room utilization and behavioral health services.”
The company is “committed to ensuring affordability of health care coverage” and is urging Congress to extend the enhanced premium tax credits. 
“These tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year, are essential to keeping coverage affordable for Ohioans and working people throughout the country,” the spokesman said.
Dayton-based CareSource was the state’s second-biggest provider as of 2023. For 2026, it’s proposing to hike premiums by about 17%.
Asked why the increase was needed, spokesman Joseph Kelley didn’t specifically mention the looming expiration of the subsidies.
“The ACA Marketplace is facing significant challenges nationwide, driven by a more competitive landscape, rising health care costs and anticipated regulatory shifts,” he said. “These factors led us to adjust our rates to maintain sustainability while continuing to provide quality care.”
Regulators have until Oct. 15 to finalize next year’s rates.
America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, goes further than KFF did in its report. It said that millions of American families will face a 75% increase in health premiums if the enhanced subsidies are allowed to expire.
In a Sept. 22 blog post, the group’s president and CEO cited polls saying that more than 70% of Americans want the insurance subsidies to be renewed.
“Public opinion is clear, with polls from leading Democratic, Republican, and independent researchers showing overwhelming support for continuing these tax credits,” said CEO Mike Tuffin. “The issue is poised to play a significant role in how millions of Americans vote in the 2026 elections.”

(Photo by WEWS.)Ohio Senate Republicans have joined the House in overriding one of Gov. Mike DeWine’s school-related vetoes, which restricts the types of levies that can be put on the ballot.
After 90 days, school districts will no longer be able to put emergency or substitute levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. Levies on the ballot this fall will not be impacted by the law.
In the two-year state operating budget, DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions.
On Wednesday, the Senate voted 21-11 to pass the override. Republican state Sens. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) and Tom Patton (R-Strongsville) joined the Democrats in voting no.
“We eliminated, on a going-forward basis, a number of potential levies that would result in tax increases after reevaluations,” Senate President Rob McColley said.
McColley said the override is important to provide the first step in much-needed property tax relief for homeowners, while Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) said this could cause massive cuts for schools.
“More struggles for the schools, less funds coming to the schools and now with this override that we passed, it also means that there’s less ability of the locals to have control,” Antonio said.
The schools would now have to “beg” the legislature for a bailout if their roof collapses, the minority leader continued.
DeWine, while vetoing, created a property tax working group to evaluate each of the Republicans’ proposals to decrease taxes. House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said that the group’s new recommendations could encourage more movement from the lawmakers.
“What I understand is that the report largely supports the veto overrides,” Huffman said.
The working group came out with 20 ideas to reduce homeowners’ burdens, which include allowing counties to take money away from schools and changing state spending calculations — two of DeWine’s other school-related vetoes.
“Most of the report was more of the same gimmicks that will not actually lead to cash in people’s pockets and don’t solve the underlying problem,” House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) said.
Some Democrats said the full report is worth reading through before making decisions.
“I was glad they finally took some of our best ideas for what to do about this: the circuit breaker or the homestead exemption that would provide real relief using state resources,” Isaacsohn said.
McColley was asked if he would take up any of their ideas.
“There are a number of things on there that we would probably look into; some of the ideas are already ideas that have been introduced in one chamber or the other,” he responded. “But I don’t believe all of the recommendations that they put forward are going to actually fix the problem or deliver the extent of the reform we needed, particularly with the backdrop of this constitutional ballot initiative that’s impending potentially for next November.”
Each Republican leader says more overrides are likely coming soon.

Republish photo only with original story.)This week, an Ohio property tax reform group set up by the governor released its recommendations. The question now is whether anyone in the General Assembly is listening.
The day after the proposals got released, the Ohio Senate voted to override one of Gov. Mike DeWine’s property tax vetoes in the state budget — one of several vetoes that led him to establish the working group.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, is claiming the working group sided with lawmakers on two other provisions the governor vetoed. What the working group actually came up with is more like a counterproposal.
Still, Huffman wants to try to override both vetoes by the end of the month.
“I think it’s going to be easier now, because this group that the governor put together says, essentially the House is right in what they did,” Huffman said.
The working group issued 20 ideas in all. For the most part, those proposals fall in three buckets — support for existing legislation (with some tweaks), placing restrictions on the growth of levies and changes to way current taxes get collected.
Existing legislation
In terms of existing proposals, the working group voiced explicit support for four pieces of legislation. One, House Bill 186, limits the increase in property taxes to ensure they don’t outpace inflation metrics. Another, House Bill 156, would provide property tax credits for low-income seniors and disabled Ohioans. The working group recommended an amendment limiting the size of that credit.
Two other proposals get into the weeds of property tax exemptions. The working group endorsed House Bill 154 which would give school districts a voice in residential Community Reinvestment Areas, or CRAs. In these districts, improvements get big tax breaks, encouraging developers to build new homes or renovate existing ones. But school districts have complained those improvements mean more kids with little or no increase in revenue to schools.
Senate Bill 42 borrows the CRA model to deliver targeted property tax relief. Instead of blanket exemptions, local authorities could designate specific areas where low-income seniors could get a tax break. The working group likes the idea but argued there should be a cap on how many census tracts get included in the program and that the school board should have a veto.
More broadly, the members voiced support for an increased homestead exemption or a so-called “circuit breaker,” which limits property tax increases based on a homeowner’s income. But instead of endorsing specific bills, they voiced support for the concept.
Closing the tap
The working group dug through the property tax provisions DeWine vetoed in the budget to see if they could maintain the spirit of lawmakers’ proposals through a more palatable package. Both vetoes rejected proposals to choke off levies.
The members partially endorsed giving a county budget commission the right to roll back “excessive” or “unnecessary” levies. The governor argued that under that language a commission could overturn a levy voters approved just months before.
The working group determined the roll-back idea could work, but only with guardrails. Both “excessive” and “unnecessary” would need explicit definitions, and new voter-approved levies should have a five-year safe harbor before allowing any reductions.
One of the most highly publicized provisions in the state budget would have required immediate tax reductions if a school district carried over more than 40% of its operating budget in cash from year-to-year.
DeWine vetoed that idea and the working group agreed it was too harsh. Instead, the group set the carryover limit at 100% of a district’s budget. And rather than immediate tax reductions, it directed the district to justify its carryover to the county budget commission.
The working group proposed several other tweaks, too. To keep levies under control, county agencies with an unelected board should have the county commission sign off before putting levies on the ballot. Emergency levies should only be available for districts in financial distress, according to the state auditor; ballot language itself should be clearer and; to keep agencies from repeatedly going to the ballot, the working group wants them to keep as much of the interest those levies generate as possible.
Current collections
The working group also suggested the state use a lighter touch when it comes to delinquencies. Although the members argued fees and interest are an incentive to pay on time, they contend a short grace period and lower interest rates would really help homeowners stay in their homes.
In a similar vein, the working group proposed a tax deferral program for low-income seniors. That proposal wouldn’t reduce what they owe, but it would give them additional time to pay.
Group members also want lawmakers to go take a closer look at the books. Right now, transferring property through an LLC allows a buyer to avoid conveyance fees and conceal a property’s actual value. The working group said lawmakers should close that loophole. It also argued state officials should be checking for people claiming the owner-occupied credit or homestead exemption on multiple properties, and regularly reassessing all tax exemptions to ensure they’re doing what lawmakers intended.
Lawmakers’ take
In the General Assembly, the working group’s recommendations got a mixed reception.
For his part, Speaker Huffman welcomed the ideas.
“If these are suggestions of the governor, (the) legislature should always consider those suggestions,” he said.
But, Huffman emphasized working group support for existing bills and set aside its compromise proposals on school board carryover or county budget commission rollbacks. He promised a veto override on both.
“We’ll probably get that issue taken care of, well, certainly before we’re done at Thanksgiving, and likely before we’re done in October,” he said.
Senate President Rob McColley expressed more skepticism about the recommendations.
“I don’t believe all of the recommendations that they put forward are going to actually fix the problem or deliver the extent of the reform we needed,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio praised the working group for coming up with a reasonable compromise.
“They sound like really positive solutions,” she said, “the kinds of which people can say on either side, well, it’s not everything I wanted, but I could live with that — that’s what we should be doing.”
But House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn said the report amounted to “gimmicks” that wouldn’t put cash in Ohioans’ pockets.
“The real problem is that we rely on property taxes to pay for too much of our public services,” he said. “So, the funding our police and our fire and our schools and our libraries all falls on the back of individual property taxpayers, and it’s too much.”
“The state has to pay its fair share for public services,” he continued. “Otherwise, property taxes are always going to remain way too much of a burden for people in Ohio.”

Ohio’s law previously only required those age 17 and younger to go through driver’s training — meaning those 18 and older were previously able to skip the training and simply apply for a driver’s license. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under the new law, Ohio drivers younger than 21 will be required to complete driver’s education training in order to get a driver’s license, which includes 24 hours of education in the classroom and eight hours with an instructor on the road. 
“We know that a driver is safer if they’ve had driver’s training,” Gov. Mike DeWine said during a press conference Monday.
This new law came out of Ohio’s two-year state operating budget DeWine signed into law in July. 
“What is happening is a number of teenagers didn’t ever get driver’s training,” DeWine said. “We know inexperience is really the number one killer, the number one cause of crashes.” 
Nearly 60% of at-fault teen drivers were 18 to 19 years old at the time of fatal traffic crashes in 2024, according to the Ohio’s Teen Crash Dashboard. Nearly 100 teen-related fatal crashes were reported in 2024 and the teen driver was at fault in 67 of those crashes. 70% of those were the fault of the teen driver, according to the state data. 
DeWine’s daughter Becky died in a car crash in 1993 when she was 22. 
Ohio Department of Public Safety Director Andy Wilson, a former prosecutor, said he has been called to the scene of many fatal car crashes. 
“I’ve stood over bodies of young drivers at crashes, and there’s nothing that fills the loss … in someone’s life who’s lost someone dramatically and unexpectedly,” he said.
“We believe that this change … will, in fact, save a lot of lives,” he said. 
It is expected to affect about 36,000 people in Ohio every year, according to Judy Converse, spokesperson for the Ohio Traffic Safety Office. 
Wilson said a teenager’s crash risk drops when they get the right training and practice.
“Just because you can pass the driver’s desk when you’re 18 doesn’t mean you’re a good driver,” Wilson said. “That test is kind of a bare minimum threshold to get you out on the road.” 
Most driver’s schools charge about $100 for 24 hours of classroom instruction and then it’s another $300-400 for the eight hours behind the wheel with an instructor, according to Converse.
“We know, without a doubt, that a barrier to driver’s education is the cost,” Wilson said. 
DeWine and Wilson both support putting driver’s education back in schools as a non-mandatory elective.
“We think that driver’s ed in school makes sense,” DeWine said. “It is more convenient. We think that’s very, very important.”
Some Ohio schools have driver’s education courses, but many schools dropped those classes in the 1990s. Capacity is an issue when it comes to having enough driver’s education courses, Wilson said. 
“If you try to get your kid in driver’s ed, you have to wait a little while,” Wilson said. “An easy answer is to put driver’s ed back in the schools where we’re making you take an elective instead of study hall.”

(Eric Thomas illustration for Kansas Reflector)My family knows to bring soccer questions to me. 
Given the trappings of my soccer fanaticism — a hat for my son’s high school team, a jersey for my favorite Premiere League team, an app for my fantasy team and a podcast for my fandom — I am the extended family’s commissioner of soccer, earning the office even over my son who plays soccer nearly every day.
Despite my expertise, I couldn’t help my mother-in-law a few weeks ago when she came to me looking for some way — any way — to buy World Cup tickets for an upcoming charity auction. They didn’t have to be cheap, but the auction needed them.
What I told her, to her understandable disbelief, is that tickets for the United States’ largest sporting event basically don’t exist. As we sit today, months before the first game across the state line in Missouri, essentially no one knows what games they will attend, where they will sit or who will be playing.
The details about the tournament are delayed for many reasons, some perfectly understandable.
For instance, the national teams that participate in this year’s version of the World Cup need to qualify first. Even Argentina, the 2022 champion, needed to earn a spot. Through last-ditch play-in tournaments, national teams that have slumped in their first qualification matches still have one last shot.
Today, with 250 days until the first game, only 18 of the 48 teams who will play have qualified. Please join me in shedding a tear for 86 nations that have been knocked out. Although I am not sure Mauritania or Mauritius had a chance.
For the 2022 World Cup, some national teams qualified as late as mid-June 2022 for the tournament that started 159 days later.
That will seem early as compared with the 2026 tournament: teams will qualify for the 2026 World Cup through March 31. That is 72 days before the first match, cutting in half the time before the first game that we will know who is actually in the World Cup.
That delay is just one variable that makes the ticketing difficult. Another basic scheduling component — the draw — must happen to know who is playing whom. That ceremony, slotting teams into pools that dictate their first three opponents, takes place Dec. 5. Until then, even the United States (which qualified as one of the three hosts) won’t know its opponents.
With all that waiting, ticket sales are an opaque labyrinth requiring quite a bit of studying and even more waiting. FIFA, the imperial worldwide soccer governing body, concocted a ticketing scheme that looks like an ATM wired into a Rube Goldberg contraption.
My family registered, along with millions of others, for the earliest ticket lottery that FIFA provided. To enter, you registered your VISA credit or debit card with a presale website. The lucky folks selected will be notified this week so they can purchase tickets later this month.
Early reporting yesterday from the Athletic suggests that tickets through the lottery in Kansas City will range from $60 to $410 for group stage games. For the quarterfinal hosted in Kansas City, tickets purchased directly from FIFA range from $275 to $1,125.
That VISA presale mini-maze is just the first option.
Soon, FIFA will open a second lottery that will not require a VISA card. Millions more will register for that chance. Roll your eyes with me as you notice this: there are still two more phases of sales after these first two. 
To further obscure what is happening, FIFA emailed everyone in my family Wednesday about something they call Right To Buy. Thinking we had earned a spot through that VISA-sponsored lottery, I gasped.
“We won,” I said. 
Not so fast. These Right To Buy packages essentially dangle the chance to cut the line in these lotteries and secure — well, not tickets, but the right to tickets. The timing seems especially cruel, if not predatory. During the week we hope to hear from FIFA about winning the ticket lottery, we receive an email from FIFA about a right to buy. Of course, we think we have “won.”
The FIFA website also markets these as collectibles, mimicking the baseball cards of my youth and the video game add-ons of my son’s generation. 
The “Road to Semifinal Glory – Double Edition” is “an exclusive drop” the website says: “This special bundle gives you the opportunity to secure 2 Right-To-Buy (RTBs) for some of the tournament’s most coveted knockout matches, from the Round of 16 up to the Semi-Finals! Each pack contains an opportunity to be there for a decisive match on the journey to the Final.”
Cost for that “collectible”? $1,399 each.
The number “claimed,” according to the FIFA website? A whopping 150 RTBs sold just for one of the Kansas City packages.
That’s more than $200,000 in FIFA revenue just for the right to buy one narrow kind of ticket. The website lists dozens of similar RTB packages, scraping millions more into FIFA’s already bursting pockets.
My RTB email arrived at my inbox at 12:32 p.m. Within three minutes, I was shopping, only to find out that all Right To Buy opportunities associated with Kansas City were sold out.
How to avoid the wait? Purchase tickets that include hospitality. These premium tickets include access to lounges near the playing surface and other VIP access. Some include tickets for luxury suites.
If you wanted to take a family of four to a single game, the lowest hospitality price you could expect? More than $5,000. However, you can get them now, using “buy now” button on the FIFA website.
That hospitality price tag comes with an unfortunate guarantee: You won’t be watching any of the host nations, including the USA, play. Those coveted tickets will cost even more.
FIFA’s tangled ticket-buying process will tempt many Kansas soccer fans to their default place to buy tickets: second-hand markets like the SeatGeek and StubHub or the Overland Park-based Tickets for Less. We know how to buy tickets through these sites for concerts, Chiefs games and more.
Beware though. Because the lotteries have just begun, because the teams have yet to qualify, because the RTB emails have just arrived, there are few actual tickets that second-hand sellers can precisely promise.
If you buy a ticket here, you should think about it as a stock-market future, similar to contracting with someone to snag you a ticket somehow — likely through another second-hand seller, rather than directly from FIFA. The person or company selling you that ticket will need to secure the ticket themselves before selling it to you.
Add to this confusion: President Donald Trump has threatened to move World Cup games from cities that are, in his judgement, too violent.
“If I think it’s not safe, we’re going to move it out,” Trump said.
FIFA’s reassurances this week that the host cities will indeed host matches should calm our fears a bit, but Trump’s words make World Cup tickets seem not just elusive but a bit tentative.
Soccer fans like me dread the patience that all of this demands. Knowing that our region’s metro area is hosting the World Cup fuels our jitters to have confirmed tickets in hand — whether for a charity auction or for our soccer-obsessed son.
Unfortunately, even though we live so close, FIFA asks that we wait and eventually spend lavishly.

NASA, CC BYFor 24 hours a day, seven days a week since November 2000, NASA and its international partners have sustained a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, including at least one American – a streak that will soon reach 25 years.

When viewed in the history of spaceflight, the International Space Station is perhaps one of humanity’s most amazing accomplishments, a shining example of cooperation in space among the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and Russia. But all good things must come to an end.
In 2030, the International Space Station will be deorbited: driven into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.
I’m an aerospace engineer who has helped build a range of hardware and experiments for the ISS. As a member of the spaceflight community for over 30 years and a 17-year member of the NASA community, it will be hard for me to see the ISS come to an end.
Since the first pieces of the International Space Station were launched in 1998, the station has been home to significant research accomplishments across domains that include materials science, biotechnology, astronomy and astrophysics, Earth science, combustion and more.
Astronauts performing research inside the space station and payload experiments attached to the station’s exterior have generated many publications in peer-reviewed science journals. Some of them have advanced our understanding of thunderstorms, led to improvements in the crystallization processes of key cancer-fighting drugs, detailed how to grow artificial retinas in space, explored the processing of ultrapure optical fibers and explained how to sequence DNA in orbit.
In total, more than 4,000 experiments have been conducted aboard the ISS, resulting in more than 4,400 research publications dedicated to advancing and improving life on Earth and helping forge a path for future space exploration activities.
The ISS has proven the value of conducting research in the unique environment of spaceflight – which has very low gravity, a vacuum, extreme temperature cycles and radiation – to advance scientists’ understanding of a wide range of important physical, chemical and biological processes.
 Keeping a presence in orbit

But in the wake of the station’s retirement, NASA and its international partners are not abandoning their outpost in low-Earth orbit. Instead, they are looking for alternatives to continue to take advantage of low Earth orbit’s promise as a unique research laboratory and to extend the continuous, 25-year human presence some 250 miles (402 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface.
In December 2021, NASA announced three awards to help develop privately owned, commercially operated space stations in low-Earth orbit.
For years, NASA has successfully sent supplies to the International Space Station using commercial partners, and the agency recently began similar business arrangements with SpaceX and Boeing for transporting crew aboard the Dragon and Starliner spacecraft, respectively.
Based on the success of these programs, NASA invested more than US$400 million to stimulate the development of commercial space stations and hopefully launch and activate them before the ISS is decommissioned.
 Dawn of commercial space stations

In September 2025, NASA issued a draft announcement for Phase 2 partnership proposals for commercial space stations. Companies that are selected will receive funding to support critical design reviews and demonstrate stations with four people in orbit for at least 30 days.
NASA will then move forward with formal design acceptance and certification to ensure that these stations meet NASA’s stringent safety requirements. The outcome will allow NASA to purchase missions and other services aboard these stations on a commercial basis – similar to how NASA gets cargo and crew to the ISS today.
Which of these teams will be successful, and on what timescale, remains to be seen.
While these stations are being built, Chinese astronauts will continue to live and work aboard their Tiangong space station, a three-person, permanently crewed facility orbiting approximately 250 miles (402 km) above the Earth’s surface. Consequently, if the ISS’s occupied streak comes to an end, China and Tiangong will take over as the longest continually inhabited space station in operation: It’s been occupied for approximately four years and counting.
 In the meantime, enjoy the view

It will be several years before any of these new commercial space stations circle the Earth at around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour) and several years before the ISS is deorbited in 2030.
So while you have a chance, take a look up and enjoy the view. On most nights when the ISS flies over, it is simply magnificent: a brilliant blue-white point of light, usually the brightest object in the sky, silently executing a graceful arc across the sky.
Our ancestors could hardly have imagined that one day, one of the brightest objects in the night sky would have been conceived by the human mind and built by human hands.

DemasThe state Legislature delivered on promises to preserve free school meals and increased per pupil funding, after months of tough negotiations ended in lawmakers passing an eight-day budget extension to iron out the final details.
“Nothing is perfect, obviously, in a world where we have split government, but this is a good education budget that protects the vital programs Senate Democrats and the governor fought for and won in the last two years,” said Senate PreK-12 appropriations Subcommittee Chair Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), “the school breakfast and lunch program for all kids, the mental health and school safety dollars, especially to the the new increase that we got in this new budget, record per-pupil.”
Lawmakers worked into early Friday to finalize the $21.3 billion dollar budget deal, which passed the Senate by a vote of 31-5, with all of the votes against coming from Republicans, and passed the House by a vote of 104-5, with a mix of Democrats and Republicans voting against it. 
In the Senate, Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) and Sens. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe), Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) and Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) made up the nays.
In the House, from the GOP, state Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, James DeSana of Carleton and Brad Paquette of Niles voted against SB 166. Democratic state Reps. Dylan Wegela of Garden City and Regina Weiss also voted no.

While both chambers held education funding as one of their top priorities, the Republican-led House and the Democratic-led Senate presented vastly different proposals on how to support K-12 schools, community colleges and universities, with Democrats and education advocates criticizing Republicans’ initial plan to collapse funding for several programs – including free school lunches – into one bucket.  
Education funding broadly increased from last year by around $600 million, with K-12 school aid increasing the most by over $500 million. The budget increased per-pupil funding to $10,050, a record funding level per student. 
That state aid to schools is now contingent, per a new line in the budget on compliance with programs including school meals and curriculum requirements. 
State school lunch and breakfast programs remained funded at the same levels as last year, while the federal share for school lunch programs increased by $7 million. 
There’s also an additional $1.6 million for universal school meals for nonpublic schools that participate in the federal school lunch program to join the state’s school meals program. 
New one-time funding included $65 million allocated for small class sizes, specifically for grades K to 3, as well as an infrastructure grant of $100 million and community violence intervention grants of $10 million. 
An additional $258 million for “at-risk” pupil support, as well as new reporting and accountability requirements for at-risk supports. That grant may also be used, up to 30%, to reduce class sizes. 
At-risk funding, as well as funding for English language learner support, each increased by 25% — a change which Senate Democrats had pushed for but House Republicans had sought to eliminate from the budget. 
The budget eliminated $100 million in district reimbursements for the Michigan Public School Employees’ Retirement System. Camilleri noted that this money was rolled into the foundation allowance, which provides for the per-pupil funding. 
It also moved several programs, including mental health and school safety grants and career and technical education incentives from ongoing to one-time funding.
“That’s through deliberation and discussion to see where they better fit, and kind of trying to project out what’s going to happen in the future,” House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) told reporters after the Education Budget was approved in conference committee. 
“You want to have programs that one, they’re producing results, and two, that you’re investing in areas that they have potential to help, right,” Bollin said. “And you need to kind of cut them sometimes, when they aren’t producing.”

Camilleri noted that mental health and school safety grants were previously funded through one-time funding, and that lawmakers have to fight for these programs every year.
“A lot of these items are going to be up for discussion and consideration again in the future budgets that we have,” Camilleri said. “I’m confident, though, that we now have set a bipartisan framework where we believe that these are the priorities that we all have come to an agreement on.”
The Fiscal Year 2026 Budget adds over $169 million in funding for per-pupil mental health and school safety grants. It also provides $70 million in one time funding to improve career and technical education in areas with limited programming. 
While Bollin noted the education budget’s continued funding for literacy support, the allocations for this year’s budget is $17 million lower than in Fiscal Year 2025. The budget also zeroes out funding for early literacy district grants.
For higher education — university operations budgets increased by 2.8%, almost $48 million. Grants and financial aid for higher education, however, were cut by 4.2%, or nearly $23 million. 
Community college operations budgets increased by 2.1%, and their total appropriations increased by 6.7%, totalling nearly $500 million. 
Education advocates weigh in
Shortly after the education budget cleared the House, the K-12 Alliance of Michigan released a statement excoriating the Legislature for their monthslong delay in passing the budget. 
“No lawmaker should be celebrating or expecting gratitude for a budget passed more than three months beyond their legal obligation to get it done and with zero transparency to allow it to be reviewed until shortly before it was passed,” said Robert McCann, the alliance’s executive director. “To be clear, Michigan’s schools have been harmed throughout every step of this unnecessary, Lansing-made crisis and the lack of accountability as lawmakers continued to obstruct a budget from moving forward will not be forgotten.” 
While the alliance will be reviewing the budget and offering further comment in the coming days, McCann made one thing clear. 
“Lansing owes our parents and schools an apology for this broken process.”

One good step would be overriding Gov. Wes Moore's RENEW Act veto.","A young woman cools down with cold water during the summer heat. (Photo by SimpleImages/Getty Stock Images)With this summer’s relentless extreme heat, flash flooding and smoke from Canadian wildfires still lingering, Marylanders are gasping for air, battling rising water, with devastating consequences for their health, homes, and neighborhoods. At the same time, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s responses have been slow and unreliable, as we have seen with the denied federal disaster aid to Western Maryland.
With heat-related deaths and illnesses and catastrophic flash floods disrupting lives across the state, it’s clear the climate crisis has arrived at our front door, demanding urgent, systemic solutions. Against this backdrop, Gov. Wes Moore’s decision in May to veto the Responding to Emergency Needs from Extreme Weather (RENEW) Act of 2025 was a profound setback for the health of Maryland’s citizens, and for the financial health of our state, as more and more of our taxes are being spent addressing the growing climate crisis.
Each time FEMA fails to deliver timely assistance, it becomes more obvious that we need homegrown, reliable funding to meet the demands of a changing climate. The RENEW Act would have offered a new path forward, shifting the cost of climate adaptation off the shoulders of Marylanders and onto the fossil fuel companies whose actions knowingly fueled this crisis.

The legislation would have required the Comptroller’s Office to calculate the true financial burden of greenhouse gas emissions in our state, building on its landmark April 2025 climate cost study. That data would have supported efforts to ensure the corporations raking in billions from fossil fuel sales finally contribute to repairing the harms they caused.
The fossil fuel industry has long known the devastating effects of its products. ExxonMobil and Shell recognized as early as the 1960s that burning fossil fuels would cause climate disasters, and Maryland is currently paying the price.
Annapolis is spending $50 million to combat chronic flooding, Howard County has allocated $228 million for flood mitigation in Ellicott City, and Baltimore City is installing air conditioning in schools to protect students from record-breaking heat. These costs are paid for by Marylanders. The fossil fuel industry doesn’t pay a dime. These expenses are dwarfed by the profits of the largest fossil fuel companies, which exceeded $100 billion in 2023 alone.
Increased lung disease, heart conditions, mental health struggles, and the rise of infectious diseases such as Lyme disease are all linked to climate disruption. This summer’s heat has exacerbated respiratory illnesses, threatened seniors, and forced outdoor workers to risk their health to earn a living. Vulnerable populations — children, seniors, communities of color — face disproportionate consequences.
As a clinical psychologist, I see the mental health toll firsthand. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is linked to increased suicidal ideation. Rising temperatures increase irritability, aggression and cognitive problems like memory and concentration difficulties. As extreme storms put families in financial jeopardy, rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse skyrocket.
The RENEW Act was not a new tax on individuals; it was a demand for fairness and responsibility. Similar measures have already passed in Vermont and New York, and are under consideration in several other states. This legislation would have established a transparent accounting of climate costs and ensured corporate polluters — not Marylanders — bear the burden of recovery and resilience.
If lawmakers override Moore’s veto, they can put Maryland back on a path toward climate fairness and resilience. Delaying further will only increase suffering and costs.
Six years ago, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg famously said, “I don’t want your hope. … I want you to panic … I want you to act as if the house is on fire.” The reality is, our house is on fire.

Wes Moore (D) shakes hands Thursday with Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez. Constellation owns the Conowingo Dam behind them, and the hydroelectric power plant inside the dam. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Maryland officials unveiled a $340 million settlement Thursday and issued a new water quality certification to the Conowingo Dam, clearing the way for dam owner Constellation Energy to seek a new 50-year federal license to operate the hydroelectric facility.
The deal also resolves years of contentious litigation over the nearly century-old dam, which has become an environmental flashpoint in recent years as its overwhelmed reservoir has allowed polluting sediment to overflow into the Susquehanna River.
Particularly during severe storms, water overflowing from the Conowingo reservoir carries nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus downstream, contributing to “dead zones” for underwater life in the Chesapeake Bay and hampering a struggling multistate effort to clean up the bay.
The settlement between Maryland, Constellation and a pair of clean water advocacy groups — Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper — includes $87.6 million for pollution reduction measures, including planting of trees and underwater grasses. It also includes more than $60 million to improve fish passage over the dam, control invasive species and create a hatchery for freshwater mussels to be planted in the river; and another $77.8 million to clean up trash and debris rushing down the Susquehanna.
Constellation will also pay $18.7 million to explore, and possibly begin, dredging at the dam’s reservoir. But any dredging is still a long way off. All parties are waiting for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study that will use computer modeling to assess the impacts of dredging on the reservoir and river downstream. Once that study is complete, likely in late 2026 or 2027, the Maryland Department of the Environment will decide how to use dredging payments that Constellation must make annually for 25 years.

Even then, the agency could move toward getting a dredging permit, could call for more studies — including evaluating the potentially lucrative reuse of silt dredged from behind the dam — or could designate Constellation’s dredging payments to other environmental projects if the Corps study indicates dredging is inadvisable.
Robin Broder, executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake, said Thursday that she feels confident dredging will happen eventually.
Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Ted Evgeniadis said his team believes dredging is an economic and viable option. Prior estimates, which found that dredging would cost Constellation “hundreds of millions of dollars every year for 50 years,” are no longer accurate, he said.
“Dredging is much different today than it was 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. There are new technologies today, whether it’s a hydraulic dredge or an ejection dredge,” Evgeniadis said. “All of these new things that have come up over the years are going to be looked at.”
A news conference Thursday at the foot of the dam — near where fishermen cast their lines and below scores of circling vultures and waterbirds — featured what one Constellation official said would usuallyt be considered “strange bedfellows”: Maryland state officials, leaders of environmental nonprofits and Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez.
Dominguez jokingly turned his pocket inside out Thursday, telling the crowd: “Yeah, this is costly for us. And yeah, I don’t have anything but lint left in my pockets on this one.”
“But I’m glad it’s resolved. I’m glad we can get up here and proudly say we’re doing all of this work,” said Dominguez, praising Gov. Wes Moore’s “steady hand” in the negotiations over the dam, which has 11 turbines, and can produce up to 572 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 165,000 homes.
Baltimore County residents fight landfill’s request to double runoff into watershed

The story goes back to 2018, when Maryland issued a water quality certification to the dam’s previous owner, Exelon. Constellation and its energy generation portfolio split from Exelon in 2022 to became a standalone business.
That certification would have required the company to mitigate the nutrient and sediment overflows, or make compensatory payments to the state that Exelon said could have totaled $172 million a year. That’s because the dam contributes an estimated 6 million pounds of nitrogen and 260,000 pounds of phosphorus to the bay each year, according to the Maryland Department of the Environment.
Exelon challenged Maryland’s certification in court, and eventually the two parties reached a closed-door deal in which Exelon accepted a number of environmental conditions and agreed to pay about $200 million over 5o years toward restoring the Susquehanna and easing fish passage over the dam. In turn, Maryland waived its authority to issue the water quality certification, to the ire of environmental groups.
That’s where a federal court said Maryland went wrong. In December 2022, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the 50-year hydropower  license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  because it said Maryland could not waive its authority to issue the certification.
That sent Maryland back to the negotiating table — now with Constellation and the two environmental groups, who had also challenged the original water quality certification as not going far enough to protect the ecosystem. This was happening just as Moore was taking office.
“We inherited a project that was mired in lawsuits, had frustrations on all sides, where the future of the largest source of renewable energy in our state was in question, while environmental impacts were being unchecked,” Moore said. “I had people who said to me — they had a lot of words — but it all could get summed up in basically a few simple sentences: Stay away from the Conowingo Dam, because that problem is just too difficult to solve.”
Moore’s new environment secretary at the time, Serena McIlwain, having just arrived from California’s Department of the Environment, had to quickly get up to speed on the Conowingo Dam, along with the state’s other environmental challenges.

“I was told that, well, everything kind of went wrong with the negotiations before we started. One was, we didn’t have the right people at the table,” McIlwain said. “And I said to my team, make sure the right people — the waterkeepers — are at the table.”
Maryland learned “hard lessons” from the court’s rejection of the previous settlement, said Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown. This time, the state issued a revised version of the 2018 water quality certification, along with the settlement.
“The Department of the Environment will retain full power to enforce compliance with water quality standards — and that matters,” said Brown, who called the settlement a “historic victory” for Marylanders and the Chesapeake Bay.
Getting to the finish line was challenging. Brown said it took more than 30 mediation sessions. McIlwain said there were times when some of the parties were “ready to walk out the door.” Among the biggest sticking points was the dredging issue, said Adam Ortiz, a deputy secretary at the Maryland Department of the Environment.
“We could have given up months ago. We really could have,” McIlwain said. “But I knew I needed my job, and I said: ‘You guys are going to get back at that table, and I’ll bring more food. I don’t care. We’re going to get it done.’”
Constellation’s Dominguez bemoaned the long road the dam operator had to walk in order to get its critical new license from FERC.
“It shouldn’t have taken us 10 years to sort through all of the issues here, and that’s a bit disappointing,” he said. “But … the resolution to those permitting issues often requires people coming together that have different interests, that sometimes have conflicting interests, and bringing those folks together and making something good happen.”

Baltimore City Councilmember Mark Conway filed papers Thursday with the Federal Election Commission to create a campaign committee for a potential Democratic primary challenge to 7th District U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume next June.
Conway’s possible run comes as senior Democrats across the country are facing pressure from younger leaders to step aside. Some veteran members of Congress have opted to retire in 2026, and three older Democratic House members died earlier this year. Others are facing generation-based challenges in their primaries.
Mfume, who turns 77 later this month, has already filed papers with the Maryland State Board of Elections to seek another term. He represented the Baltimore-based 7th District in the U.S. House from 1987 to 1996 and returned to Congress in 2020 after winning a special election to replace his successor, the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D).
Conway was not immediately available to comment Thursday, but in a statement, a campaign spokesperson, Luca Amayo, said the second-term councilmember is pondering his political future.

“The mounting cost of politics as usual, especially in the face of growing threats to Baltimore’s future, has weighed heavily on Councilman Conway,” Amayo said. “He is consulting with residents and community leaders as he carefully considers all paths forward to best serve the people of Baltimore.”
Conway has not filed papers with the state to become a candidate. But by creating a federal campaign committee, he is able to begin raising money for a possible congressional campaign.
Mfume reported just shy of $667,000 in his campaign account to the FEC as of June 30, the most recent filing period. He is required to disclose third quarter fundraising totals by Oct. 15.
Conway, 36, was elected to represent the North Baltimore 4th District on the council in 2020, winning the open-seat Democratic primary by 220 votes. He is currently the chair of the council’s Public Safety Committee and the vice chair of the Public Health and Environment Committee.
Conway grew up in the Bronx and is the son of law enforcement officers. He came to Maryland to attend the University of Maryland and has been here ever since, working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, serving as deputy director of the Baltimore mayor’s CitiStat program, and taking high-ranking positions in local environmental groups, the Baltimore Tree Trust and the Chesapeake Conservancy.
Mfume will be no pushover – he’s one of the best-known and most durable political leaders in Maryland. He was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1979, at age 31, then was elected to Congress in 1986, where he served for a decade.
Mfume left Capitol Hill in 1996 to become president of the NAACP, a position he held until running unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2006. He later served as executive director of the National Medical Association, the oldest Black medical organization in the U.S.

When Cummings died in late 2019, Mfume jumped into the special election to replace him, and cruised to a fairly easy Democratic primary victory. He. won 43% of the in a 24-candidate primary field that included Cummings’ widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who finished second with 17%, and four state legislators.
Mfume has said he feels invigorated since his return to Congress, and he remains a powerful orator and energetic legislator.
A campaign spokesperson for Mfume could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday evening.
Conway would not have to sacrifice his council seat to challenge Mfume next year – he’s next up for reelection in 2028. Although city voters have approved two-term limits for their councilmembers and citywide officeholders, Conway is eligible to serve through 2032.
It’s possible that Conway, if he runs in 2026, would see his bid as part of a long-term effort to replace Mfume, with a run next year an attempt to boost his public profile as the congressman’s career winds down. Or he could use the 2026 election as a springboard for another race.
A long line of Baltimore-area Democrats, including Mayor Brandon Scott, could run for the congressional seat whenever Mfume decides to retire.
The only declared challenger to Mfume for 2026 is Republican Scott Collier, who took just 17% of the vote against the congressman as the GOP nominee last year.
An even more veteran House member from Maryland, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), has not said whether he plans to run for reelection next year. Hoyer, who is 86, was elected to Congress in a 1981 special election.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Energy broke the law last month when officials there attempted to cap the amount of federal funding states could receive to cover staff and administrative costs of sustainable energy and energy efficiency projects, a federal judge found.
U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 19 other Democrat-led jurisdictions in their August suit against the Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright, over attempts to cut funding for such projects.
Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal Energy Department. Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench — no written order had yet been filed with the court.
States argued that a new department rule limiting “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — to 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown welcomed Kasubhai’s ruling. Maryland was one of the states on the suit.

“This ruling stops an unlawful policy by President Trump’s Energy Department that would have undermined Maryland’s efforts to meet climate goals and deliver a cleaner, healthier environment for our children and grandchildren,” Brown said Thursday in a prepared statement.
Officials with the departments of Energy and Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.
The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.
Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.
“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”
Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.
Besides Maryland and Oregon, others signed on to the suit were the District of Columbia and the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine,  Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
This week’s ruling coincides with the Trump administration yanking $7.5 billion in funding for energy projects in Democratic states, including the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub in Oregon and Washington. Democratic leaders vowed to challenge that action.

(Photo courtesy Florida National Guard)In an intended show of good faith exalting their newly repaired relationship following the 2024 GOP presidential primaries, President Donald Trump in July publicly approved Gov. Ron DeSantis’ request to turn members of the Florida National Guard into immigration judges. 
“He didn’t even have to ask me,” Trump said at the time, jovially noting that although he and DeSantis had a particularly vicious fallout just months earlier, their “matching blood” keeps them together.
“He has my approval.”
But three months later, the Florida National Guard still hasn’t received instructions to train its nine attorneys within the Judge Advocate Generals Corps (JAGs) as temporary immigration judges, a spokesperson told the Florida Phoenix. This came even after the White House in August watered down the requirements to temporarily preside over the deportation hearings. 
Previously a quiet position, immigration judges — the only authorities who can revoke green cards and issue final orders of removal to certain noncitizens being deported — have dominated headlines after 125 of them have either been fired or resigned this year alone, down from about 700 judges at the beginning of the year, NPR reported. 
Although the eliminations align with the Trump administration’s promise to cut waste and streamline governmental efficiency, the judge shortfall is rapidly being backfilled by about 600 regular military lawyers newly authorized to work as temporary immigration judges. NPR reports that their training will last roughly two weeks.
But even as deportations ramp up, and DeSantis continues to suggest the Florida National Guard’s JAG officers be trained to facilitate deportations at Florida’s so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot” camps, the Trump administration has fallen quiet about why Florida’s JAGs haven’t been brought in.
A White House spokesperson referred the Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment to the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which declined to comment other than pointing out the Aug. 28 rule allowing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to select any attorney as a temporary immigration judge. 
This overhauled past requirements mandating a temporary immigration judge had previously served as either a DOJ attorney with 10 years of immigration law experience or a judge within the executive branch.
Immigration judges are unique because, unlike Article III judges, they aren’t independent of the president. Instead, they’re housed within the Department of Justice and selected by the U.S. attorney general. Temporary immigration judges serve for just six months.
So, even though both Trump and DeSantis have endorsed the move, and as other military lawyers begin to file in, why haven’t Florida National Guard JAGs been tapped to serve?
What are some of the reasons JAGs aren’t immigration judges yet?
Elizabeth Blandon, a Broward-area immigration attorney who served as chair of the Immigration and Nationality Law Certification Committee, speculated that mounting legal obstacles could be in the way.
These could include the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal statute banning the military from directing commands at civilians. The post-Reconstruction statute ended the U.S. Army’s role in protecting formerly enslaved people immediately following the Civil War.
The Florida National Guard — a part-time volunteer force trained to respond to disasters and go to war when called upon — is made up of an Army branch and an Air Force branch. 
“The [temporary immigration judge] plan violates the PCA because — without express authority from either the Constitution or a statute — members of the Army and the Air force are prohibited from carrying out enforcement laws against civilians,” Blandon said in a written statement.
This isn’t the first time the Posse Comitatus Act has come to the national forefront. In 1986, then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Samuel Alito, now a Supreme Court Justice appointed by George W. Bush, wrote a memo recommending against having a military lawyer work part-time on civilian law enforcement duties while still serving in a military role.
“Military lawyers who are not functioning in an entirely civilian environment should not be used to perform any prosecutorial function that involves direct contact with civilians in a law enforcement context,” Alito wrote. Of note, he was not specifically referring to immigration judges.
Margaret Stock, an immigration lawyer, retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel in the Military Police, and former West Point professor, acknowledged that although the Posse Comitatus Act could be a problem, the larger impediment is likely practical.
Because the National Guard is part-time for many, including the JAGs, asking them to participate would require them to clear their schedules, volunteer, and begin training — all of which require money Stock says Congress would have to approve.
“I’m not too surprised that no [JAG] has actually been assigned to be an immigration judge yet, because it takes a while to mobilize people, get volunteers, pick people, then train them, and finally get them in place,” Stock said. 
“Congress has the power of the purse, and you can’t spend money on things Congress hasn’t authorized.”
Immigration law is uniquely complicated, entailing a range of highly specific subspecialties. Many of the attorneys the Florida Phoenix contacted decline comment or deferred to lawyers specializing in deportations.
Where did the JAG idea come from?
DeSantis in May submitted an “Immigration Enforcement Operations Plan” to the Trump administration in which he proposed Florida’s nine National Guard JAGs become immigration judges.
JAG officers are attorneys who help fellow National Guard members with a wide range of legal problems, including courts-martial and military-civil matters. Trump appeared enthusiastic about the idea in early July, when he met with DeSantis to laud the opening of  the Everglades detention center.
After the conservative politicos faced off in their primary race in 2023, Trump offered high praise for the Florida governor, insisting the two would always be friends. Extending an olive branch, Trump praised DeSantis and his officials, even calling former DeSantis staffer and appointed Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier “handsome.”
DeSantis had pushed hard for Florida to take the lead on immigration crackdown efforts, muscling through the Legislature a sweeping immigration crackdown package that mandated all counties partner with ICE to enforce federal immigration laws, removing in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and creating state-level crimes for illegally entering Florida.
Earlier this week, a reporter asked DeSantis during a Gainesville press conference whether the National Guard JAGs were any closer to working as temporary immigration judges. DeSantis, who revealed that he pitched the idea to Trump over the summer, skirted the question by decrying “bureaucracy” and stressing the need to speed along immigration proceedings.
“I know there were some in DOJ that just wanted [immigration judges] to be drawn from purely civilian rather than the uniformed services but, whatever, we want to be supportive and we want to be able to help,” DeSantis said Monday.
“If you have a right to be here, then you have a right to be here, right? But if you don’t, are we going to do like an O.J. Simpson trial just to deport somebody who’s here illegally?” he added, implying that the due process of a lengthy trial would be improper for a non-citizen.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-03 04:01:44+00:00,CT Mirror,Opinion: CT needs to rethink certificate of need laws,Shayan Smani,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/03/ct-needs-to-rethink-certificate-of-need-laws/,"Rather than streamlining outdated restrictions, Connecticut needs new strategies that actively build health care infrastructure where its needed.","In 2023, three hospitals in Connecticut nearly closed their doors while state regulators debated whether a larger health system could acquire them. The sale eventually went through, but only after 16 months of regulatory standstill. 
For patients in those communities, that wait was not a minor bureaucratic hiccup. It was a period of instability that threatened to strip already vulnerable communities of essential care.

Shayan Smani
Connecticut’s Certificate of Need (CON) law played a large role in the regulatory freeze experienced by those community hospitals. Originally designed in the 1970s, CON laws rapidly gained popularity throughout the United States. In response to rising spending on healthcare in the United States, these laws were designed to act as a pre-approval system for significant health care projects.  By the early 1980s, CON laws had reached the height of their popularity, bolstered by a federal mandate. However, federal policy reversed in 1987, after which some states decided to drop their own CON programs.
Today, Connecticut is one of 35 states that still require hospitals and clinics to obtain state permission before opening new facilities, buying advanced equipment like MRI machines, or even closing or transferring services. In 2023, Connecticut’s CON program was reformed to include, among other changes, expanded transparency and notice requirements around applications, exemptions for replacement of equipment, and more significant oversight authority by the Office of Health Strategy. 
Supporters claim CON laws protect patients by reducing rapidly rising healthcare expenditures and advocating for the allocation of resources in an equitable fashion.
This experiment has gone on for decades, yet the evidence shows no measurable impact on health care costs or access attributable to CON laws. Instead, by artificially constraining resources, patients are often denied standard-of-care. 
Take prostate cancer: recent evidence suggests that, in the United States, including here in New England, only about one-third of patients receive the recommended imaging before biopsy. By contrast, the United Kingdom has adopted near-universal pre-biopsy MRI. It’s not hard to see why. In Connecticut, patients can wait four to six weeks just to be scheduled for an MRI, a delay that undermines timely diagnosis and treatment. Beyond the considerable financial expense, adding new MRI machines to address these wait times also entails a time cost, with Connecticut’s CON applications requiring a median of 211 days for approval.
To be sure, no one wants an unchecked “medical arms race” where hospitals buy expensive gadgets they don’t use. But the healthcare market has changed since the 1970s. Insurers, including CMS, negotiate prices much more aggressively, quality reporting is widespread, and health systems face significant financial hardship. In this context, CON is less a safeguard and more a barrier to entry: one that delays expansions into underserved areas, by discouraging smaller, more nimble firms from becoming viable competitors.
What would Connecticut look like without CON laws?
We don’t have to guess. States like Florida, Texas, and California have already rolled theirs back. The results are striking, including faster access to services, more competition, and no evidence of declining quality.
That doesn’t mean policymakers should step aside entirely. But rather than streamlining outdated restrictions, Connecticut needs new strategies that actively build health care infrastructure where its needed. The goal should be to encourage innovation and expand access, not slow it down.
Ezra Klein, the New York Times journalist, in his book Abundance, argues for a new kind of legislation, one no longer held down by scarcity. Rather than restrictive CON laws, we can imagine policies that actively subsidize the placement of infrastructure like MRI machines in low-resource areas. That’s the kind of future Connecticut citizens deserve: one built not on rationing and delay, but on abundance and access.

It seems time again to urge leaders to focus on policies and not people as they seek solutions.
Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chairwoman Marissa Gillett is a brilliant leader, engineer, and attorney. She has led with principle and courage in the face of years of relentless attacks from utility companies. When those companies repeatedly lost on the merits of their arguments, they turned to personal attacks instead. No one can be expected to withstand that level of pressure forever.

State Rep. Jaime Foster
Gillett is not only an exceptional regulator – she is also a devoted mother, wife, and friend. Too often, people forget the humanity of our public leaders, especially when smear campaigns fueled by corporate money take hold.
In conversations about Gillett, people often liken her fight to David and Goliath. That story inspires us to believe in the underdog – but when the Goliath is a powerful, well-funded corporation, David and everyday people falter under the constant weight of profit-driven pressure. Make no mistake: utilities are accountable first to their shareholders, not to the ratepayers they serve.
Her departure is a sad moment for Connecticut’s fight to improve fairness in utility rates. Her expertise, intellect, and resolve are unparalleled, and her absence will leave a void not easily filled. More than that, her colleagues and the public alike have watched in dismay at the treatment she has endured.
That is why Connecticut needs a PURA Commission grounded in real expertise — regulatory attorneys, engineers, forensic accountants, finance specialists, and policy experts — so that decisions are shaped by evidence and the public interest, not by lobbying strength. But it is hard to imagine anyone standing as long and as strong as Gillett did after watching what she has endured.
I wish her nothing but the best in a bright and brilliant future. May she find relief from the constant onslaught she has endured in this disgustingly politicized environment.
I also hope her stepping down does not mark a victory for the utilities over the regulators – here in Connecticut or across the nation. If we are to make lasting progress, we need to focus on policies and structures, not tearing down the people who serve within them.

With school aid and higher education added in, a vote that will take place later, the total budget will likely be around $80 billion. That will still come under last year’s spending plan of $82 billion.
The budget also eliminates around 2,000 unfilled positions, also referred to as FTEs, a win for House Republicans and their “phantom jobs” concept.
The bill now moves to the Senate, but is unclear if the upper chamber is ready to vote.
State Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) said on the House floor that the two chambers came together to create a budget that shows big things can still be done when Democrats and Republicans work together.
Farhat said he was proud that the budget protects health care and SNAP funding, as well as a 20% raise for Department of State Police troopers.
“Albeit, this budget is not perfect … but it is what we were sent here to do, to be deliberative,” Farhat said. “We were sent here to work together. I do not see a Democrat or Republican budget. I see a budget that works for Michigan.”

GOP claims wins on transparency and spending resets
State Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said House Republicans obviously did things differently than in recent years, which included a deep dive into alleged fraud and waste, and that took considerable time. She also said the budget now clearly details how departments are spending their money, adding transparency that was lacking, and would bring back workers to Lansing after the pandemic era when many of them were working remotely.
“The budget finally addresses that problem in a serious way,” Bollin said. “We reset our priorities to meet needs across Michigan. … From the beginning, I’ve said we don’t have to gut it, we just need to cut it.”
She said sometimes the budget process can be difficult, and although there was much bomb throwing throughout the process, Bollin said the respective parties were able to set their differences aside to deliver a budget that was fiscally responsible, but also sustainable.
The budget passed the House on a 101-8 vote, with most of the defections occurring on the Republican side. At least one Democrat, state Rep. Dylan Wegela of Garden City, voted no.
House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said it appeared that the Republicans needed their help getting across the finish line after all — a call back to House Speaker Matt Hall’s commentary early in the cycle when he said he didn’t need House Democrats to get the budget done.
Puri noted that more Democrats voted in favor of the budget than Republicans: State Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, James DeSana of Carleton, Jaime Greene of Richmond, Phil Green of Watertown, Gregory Alexander of Carsonville, Timmy Beson of Bay City and Brad Paquette of Niles voted against the bill.
Democratic Rep. Karen Whitsett of Detroit was not present for the vote.
Hall hailed the “ghost jobs” that were eliminated, saying he was mocked on that concept throughout the budget cycle, but that he ended up being right and did so without having to lay off any state workers.
He also said that his push for transparency on earmarks eventually won the day, as the Senate was compelled to release all its earmark spending in a hearing before the omnibus budget moved on Thursday. He said that would not have happened if it wasn’t for him and Bollin holding the Senate’s feet to the fire.
“This budget is really about value for the dollars, whether it passed before or after [the statutory deadline or the constitutional deadline],” Hall said to reporters after the vote. “If I would have surrendered to the Democrats and allowed all that pork in this budget, the voters would have not preferred that budget. … I don’t think any of you believed I was really going to get that done, be we did. Now we’ve got to improve on it next year.”

The spending plan contains some steep cuts, reducing all ongoing General Fund dollars for departmental budgets by $360 million. That was countered by an additional $425 million in one-time General Fund dollars.
There is a particularly large hit to the Department of Health and Human Services compared to the previous fiscal year with a $7.6 billion cut, coming in at about $30 billion, but much of that came from hospital and provider tax rate revisions.
DHHS budget shift draws scrutiny but maintains core services
Despite that cut, DHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel said she was pleased that the Legislature reached an agreement to pass “a balanced, bipartisan state budget that will allow the dedicated staff of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to continue its vital work of protecting the health, safety and prosperity of Michigan families.”
“The passage of the FY 26 budget will enable us to sustain essential services for communities across Michigan including substance use disorder services, access to behavioral health services as well as vital Medicaid services and food assistance programs like SNAP that our friends, families and neighbors rely on every day,” Hertel said. “We appreciate the work of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Legislature and look forward to seeing the finalized budget.”
For DHHS, the budget would move $9 billion from provider tax revenue from federal match dollars, opting to place that in boilerplate. GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss drugs would be limited from use through Medicaid, which amounts to a $240 million gross reduction.
The line item for total general government, which is a separate line item from the individual departments, is also being cut by more than $150 million compared to the last fiscal year, coming in at $5.19 billion.
There is a $690.7 million cut to the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, setting the department’s budget at $1.73 billion.
Steep cuts, by tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, were also seen to other departments, including Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; Technology, Management and Budget; Treasury; and Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
The Department of Civil Rights would see a slight decrease, but the Attorney General’s office would see a more substantial $3.4 million cut, setting that budget at $126 million. There’s also a $12 million cut from the department’s General Fund dollars, a 21% decrease.
Roads, infrastructure see major boosts, other departments see cuts
Other departments saw increases over the last fiscal year, the largest being the $1.08 billion bump to the Department of Transportation, a 15.8% increase, setting the department at $7.88 billion. The state trunkline road and bridge capital program would get $233 million above what was initially proposed by the governor, while cities and villages would get $255 million additional dollars for road funding. Counties would get an additional $474 million for road repairs than what was initially proposed.
The Department of State Police would see an $11 million increase, which was a major change after House Republicans opted to cut the department’s funding. That drew criticism that the GOP was now in the camp that wanted to “defund the police.” The statewide law enforcement agency is now set at $964.1 million in the new fiscal year.
Natural Resources would see an $8.6 million increase, Military and Veterans Affairs would get a $14.2 million increase, and Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential would see an $18.2 million increase over the previous fiscal year.
Spending for the judiciary would be increased by $10.1 million and the Department of Corrections would see $16.6 million more than last year. That said, some of the reductions there are coming from programmatic cuts from individual facility line items.
The Department of Insurance and Financial Services and the legislative auditor general would get small increases of just a few hundred thousand dollars, whereas the Department of State would be increased by $3.14 million.
Both the Legislature and the executive office would see slight increases in their budgets.
Although EGLE saw a cut, there is an additional $50 million in one-time General Fund dollars allocated for local water infrastructure, an area where Republicans originally wanted to make $10 million in cuts.
Constitutional revenue sharing would be reduced in the final budget by $63 million.
Approximately $40 million from the General Fund would be removed from business attraction efforts, and $23 million would be removed from the Going PRO Talent Fund which helps employers train and retain newly hired and current employees.
Arts and culture grants, however, will be a part of the final budget plan, despite the House Republicans’ initial zeal to see those grants removed.
It was still unclear if one of the main revenue pieces – a 24% tax on marijuana products – would move in the Senate. Hall said earlier in the day that he was confident it would move or a government shutdown would be the fault of Senate Democrats. He reiterated that position after the House passed the general government bill.
Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) told reporters earlier that she couldn’t speak to the Senate’s lingering concerns over the tax, and that it was not her job to whip those votes. She said the governor has been clear about road funding moving along with the rest of the budget, and she hoped those pieces would move together tonight.
When asked if she would vote for it, Anthony said it was a part of the larger deal, and that it was important to look at. That wasn’t a definitive answer. When asked if she was still unsure over the measure, Anthony said: “I said what I said.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Former Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson said Thursday in Fairbanks that he intends to run for governor in 2026, becoming the 13th candidate and 12th Republican in next year’s race.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and unable to run again, which has caused an unusually large number of early entries into the governor’s race.
Only one Democratic candidate, former Anchorage state Sen. Tom Begich, has entered the race. Other Democrats say they are awaiting the possible run by former Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, who had the highest favorability rating among top candidates, according to one poll this summer.
Republicans face no such obstacle. In addition to Bronson, the Republican field of candidates includes former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Anchorage businesswoman Bernadette Wilson; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; former teacher James William Parkin IV of Angoon; current state Sen. Shelley Hughes of Palmer; Bruce Walden of Palmer; former Alaska Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum; and former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor.
All of those candidates have filed letters of intent or statements of candidacy with the Alaska Public Offices Commission, which allows them to fundraise and spend money on a campaign.
They have not yet registered with the Alaska Division of Elections, which officially places a candidate on the August primary ballot. 
Republican Henry Kroll of Soldotna, who has not registered with the Public Offices Commission, is the lone candidate to have registered with the Division of Elections.
The deadline to file with the Alaska Division of Elections is June 1, 2026.
In Alaska, the top four vote-getters for a state office, regardless of political party, advance from the August general election to the November general election.
Wilson has vowed to withdraw from the election if she finishes in the top four but isn’t the top Republican. She has encouraged other Republicans to take similar vows in an attempt to consolidate support for the top Republican front-runner in the general election.
Bronson, who delivered brief remarks in Fairbanks before participating in a panel discussion with six other Republican candidates, said he supports increased spending on infrastructure and the Permanent Fund dividend, saying he would like to see a constitutional amendment that would mandate a dividend paid according to a formula that was used from 1982 through 2016. 
That would require spending an additional $2 billion per year for dividend payments above what lawmakers and Dunleavy approved this year. As a whole, the state’s operating budget is currently $5.9 billion. Bronson did not explain how he intends to pay for the increase.
An experienced pilot, Bronson was elected mayor of Anchorage in 2021, months after the incumbent Democratic mayor resigned during a sex scandal and amid a conservative backlash against COVID-19 mitigation efforts imposed by the Anchorage assembly. 
He served a single term and was endorsed for re-election by Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan but lost in 2024 to current Mayor Suzanne LaFrance.
Bronson’s time in office was marked by major conflicts with city employees, public health officials and the assembly. In 2023, the city manager Bronson appointed and fired, sued him and the city, alleging illegal and unethical acts. The assembly settled that case in 2024 for $250,000 after Bronson left office.
In January, Dunleavy appointed Bronson to manage Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. After less than eight months, he announced his resignation from that job in August.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC01873-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 21:56:28.553491

The $4 billion investment through 2027, located on 1,100 acres just 15 minutes from the Arkansas-Tennessee state line, w[...]","Deer are seen outside a Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. (Courtesy photo from Google Data Centers) WEST MEMPHIS — Internet giant Google officially announced the first phase of its West Memphis cloud and artificial intelligence data center project Thursday in what officials called one of the largest economic investments ever in Arkansas.
The $4 billion investment through 2027, located on 1,100 acres just 15 minutes from the Arkansas-Tennessee state line, was lauded by West Memphis Mayor Marco McLendon as being transformative for his city. The Thursday announcement was “the biggest day” in “Best” Memphis history, he declared, while calling it the start of a “Digital Delta West.”
“This project is more than just jobs, buildings and technology,” McLendon said. “It’s about the future of our city, opportunity, investment and education.”
Ruth Porat, the president and chief innovation officer of Google’s parent company Alphabet as well as the search giant itself, said the project would support “thousands” of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent roles once construction is complete.
Entergy Arkansas — not West Memphis’ electric utility — will provide power to the facility via a solar array and existing power generation, and each speaker addressed electricity use and the effect on ratepayers in their remarks.
Porat emphasized the efforts taken by Google to “keep rates down for ratepayers,” while Entergy stressed in a written statement that “large customers” helped drive prices down for everyone. However, some experts have worried data centers built as a result of the AI race could contribute to already-ballooning power bills thanks to how utilities spread costs across their entire customer base. Rising energy costs currently outpace the rate of inflation.
Andrew Marsh, president of Entergy Arkansas’ parent company, Entergy Corp., said there would be “$1.1 billion in benefits for existing Entergy Arkansas customers over the life of its contract with Google. Google said in a press release distributed afterward that its agreement with Entergy was “designed to put downward pressure on electricity rates for Entergy Arkansas customers.”

During media interviews after the announcement, Entergy Arkansas CEO Laura Landreaux would not specify the term of the contract, only saying that it was “decades.”
Porat also said Google would invest $25 million in an “Energy Impact Fund” to implement local energy efficiency initiatives in West Memphis “while protecting affordability.” That is in addition to implementing “load flexibility” — or throttling back the amount of power used by the facility during times where the power grid is being strained, similar to agreements Entergy has reportedly struck with many cryptocurrency mining operations in the state, which are also large electricity consumers.
“The goal there is to best support access for citizens and businesses when power needs surge,” Porat said.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted the passage of the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act during the 2025 session, saying it would cut down on permitting timelines for new power generation and provided tax credits to lure Google to the state. Critics of the bill have said it reduces oversight over utility companies and allows them to recoup costs from customers on utility projects that haven’t been built yet.
“This will help Arkansans continue to enjoy some of the lowest electric bills in the nation, and one of the things that helped push this project forward,” Sanders said.
Google’s investment includes the costs of a solar panel facility that both Entergy and Google say will be funded entirely by the Silicon Valley behemoth — although Entergy has filed for a strategic investment rider before Arkansas’ Public Service Commission for the project. Entergy said in a written statement that Google would cover the “full energy costs” of powering the data center.
A rider is a charge separate from a utility company’s baseline rate it charges its customers to recoup the costs of projects like new power generation facilities.
When asked, Entergy Arkansas spokesperson Matt Ramsey said the reason for this was the complex regulatory framework utilities operate under, but he did not provide further details about whether the costs of the facility would trickle down to regular customers. When asked for clarification, Entergy said savings from its contract agreement with Google would go to customers.
“Entergy and Google entered into a contract through which Google will pay for the costs necessary to serve them, including Cypress Solar, and those payments are recovered through their contract charges.  Those payments will offset EAL’s costs in its other rider recovery mechanisms,” Ramsey wrote in an email.
McLendon also alluded to another data center project located just on the other side of the Mississippi River in Memphis — the Elon Musk-owned xAI supercomputer facility, which powers Grok and has earned the ire of locals and the NAACP for its use of natural gas turbines to generate power, which they say are harming their health.
“We also accomplished this goal of this project without using any gas turbines, so our air quality out here is going to be complete. No worry,” McLendon said.
Google applied for a Clean Air Act major emissions permit in West Memphis on Sept. 25 from the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality. A Google spokesperson said in an email the permit was for backup generators, and were only for use in “the rare and unlikely event that the grid goes down.”

On Jan. 1, 2026, the monopoly utility will control 55% of the coal-fired electricity generation plant at Colstrip following a couple of recent acquisitions from Avista Corp and Puget Sound Energy.
In a motion pending with the Montana Public Service Commission, NorthWestern argues the newly acquired 222 megawatts from Avista will ensure reliable power for customers, but the acquisition comes with $18 million in operations and maintenance costs.
“These costs are not currently reflected in customer rates and represent a significant financial obligation for NorthWestern,” the utility argued in the August 29 motion first reported by the Montana Free Press.
When NorthWestern Energy has extra energy, it can sell the generation.
Revenue from those contracts typically are counted as credits to customers, but NorthWestern said it makes sense to use the income from three new contracts to pay for new operations and fuel costs, since the Colstrip acquisition benefits customers too.
It said this “limited carveout” also would reduce “interim financial impacts to NorthWestern.”
The Public Service Commission will take action on the motion after Oct. 15, the deadline for any parties to intervene in the case, and following any subsequent responses to the motion and rebuttal from NorthWestern, said PSC Executive Director Alana Lake.
NorthWestern Energy announced the acquisition of the Avista shares in January 2023 and of 370 megawatts from Puget Sound in July 2024.
Both companies operate in the state of Washington, which banned the use of coal-generated electricity for its customers by the end of this year. But Avista said it wanted to exit the plant anyway because continuing to operate it wasn’t economically feasible, according to the Spokesman Review.
NorthWestern did not have a breakdown of the $18 million, but said it includes fuel costs.
In the motion for a waiver, NorthWestern Energy requested approval to use revenue from three new sales contracts it said are associated with the Avista shares to offset the new $18 million in operations and maintenance costs for 2026.
Those three contracts are with Big Horn County Electric Cooperative and Energy Keepers (it has two deals with Energy Keepers).
NorthWestern said those contracts, to sell electricity when it has extra, were possible, “in part,” by the addition of the new megawatts at Colstrip, and customers benefit from the additional generation capacity.
As proposed in the motion, customers would get any revenue that exceeds operations and maintenance and fuel, but NorthWestern would not seek to recover a shortfall if the revenue is less than those costs.
NorthWestern said it will begin serving customers on Jan. 1, 2026, but without the waiver, operations and maintenance costs won’t be included in customer rates “until a future rate review.”
“Without (the waiver), NorthWestern will bear the entirety of the approximately $18 million in annual New Colstrip (Avista) O&M while customers receive the full benefit of the Designated Revenues made possible, in part, by the Colstrip addition,” NorthWestern argued.
Usually, fuel costs to the utility and credits from sales contracts are accounted for in a quarterly adjustment, a Power Costs and Credits Adjustment Mechanism, or PCCAM.
In the motion, NorthWestern also proposed to exclude its fuel costs associated with the contracts from the adjustment.
If the Public Service Commission denies the request for an exception, Lake said those revenues and fuel costs would continue to be accounted for in that adjustment.
“The O&M costs not tracked through the PCCAM would remain NorthWestern’s responsibility until the company obtains Commission approval to adjust base rates in a future rate case,” Lake said.
In January 2023, NorthWestern Vice President John Hines said the purchase from Avista cost zero dollars, and customers would likely see a $30 million to $40 million cost reduction.
NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black said this week the utility could not immediately address whether those estimates remain current.
However, she said customers will see a benefit because if the utility hadn’t acquired Avista’s share of Colstrip, it would need to buy additional capacity on the open market “to meet reliability requirements,” and operating costs at Colstrip are lower.
In January 2024, the plant broke down during a cold snap, and NorthWestern bought power on the market. In a memo to the PSC, the utility reported the cost to customers to be $39 million.
In an email this week, Black said the Colstrip Plant is “a dependable bridge to Montana’s cleaner energy future.”
“Unlike other states that are moving away from coal, this acquisition gives us the flexibility to transition to cleaner energy at a pace that works for Montanans — without compromising reliability or affordability,” Black said.
Last month, Gov. Greg Gianforte convened an energy task force to work on energy solutions for Montana, citing a projected increase in demand of 20% in the next decade, and the need businesses and families have for affordable and reliable energy.
The task force, which includes a NorthWestern vice president and a former member of the PSC  among its 20 members, is charged with “fuel neutrality” in its approach to designing solutions, due in September 2026.
Gianforte, however, is credited with putting the wheels in motion for NorthWestern to acquire the Avista share of Colstrip, and in January 2023, he said it was part of ensuring a stable grid for Montana.
His office did not respond to a request for comment this week on whether the $18 million in operations costs raise concerns about the acquisition, but NorthWestern said customers are expected to save overall.
Black also said NorthWestern does not intend to make a similar request for operations and maintenance costs in 2026 for its acquisition from Puget Sound Energy.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9897-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-02 20:58:05.583279

Barnico,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/a-tale-of-two-bakers-charlie-dont-forget-hobey/,"Hobey Baker remains the beau-idéal of the amateur sportsman, a species endangered by the NCAA’s budding plans for play for pay. What does Hobey Baker have to say to Charlie Baker in these days of change?","THE NEW COLLEGE FOOTBALL season is in full swing. Under new NCAA rules allowing payments to players in college sports, that means some newly minted millionaires have taken the field in games across the country.   
Most of New England’s small college athletes will miss the new bounty, however, and their colleges will struggle to preserve their amateur missions and cultures. Where should they turn for support?        
How about our former two-term governor? Lifelong sports enthusiast Charlie Baker is now president of the NCAA. 
Baker was a back-up basketball forward at Harvard, which, like all Ivy League schools, shuns athletic scholarships and promotes the amateur ideal. He became president of the NCAA in 2023, and has managed the rapid movement of big-time college athletics from amateur to professional sport.   
As the face of this seismic change in college sport, the person charged with overseeing this transition might seem an unlikely champion of amateurism. But Baker’s background as an amateur athlete and identification with that role may yet drive him to work to preserve the model supported by scores of New England schools.   
And as he looks for inspiration in that quest, Charlie Baker should recall another Baker: Hobart Amory Hare (“Hobey”) Baker, Princeton class of 1914, and the only man elected to both the college football and hockey halls of fame.  
Hobey Baker plunged to earth and died in a stalled fighter plane in France at the end of World War I. He was 26.  
In “A Flame That Burned Too Brightly,” Ron Fimrite of Sports Illustrated wrote that Baker was “in his day and perhaps forever the most romantic figure in all of sport, an athlete who surpassed even his most daring feats with the sheer magic of his person.”  
More than a century later, Hobey remains the beau-idéal of the amateur sportsman, a species endangered by the NCAA’s budding plans for play for pay. What does Hobey Baker have to say to Charlie Baker in these days of change?   
Hobey starred in football and hockey at Princeton from 1910 to 1914. Football games at that time were defensive struggles, filled with punts and daring returns that Hobey raised to an art form. He was known as well for his manners off the field as for his brilliance on the field and ice.   
Fimrite wrote that Hobey “imposed a code of behavior on athletes, particularly college athletes, that was accepted, if not faithfully observed, for the better part of four decades.”  
Be modest in victory. Be generous in defeat. Give all credit to your teammates. Play by the rules. Never boast. Be cool and implacable, always.   
One author called him the ideal “gentleman-sportsman, the gifted amateur in the English tradition he so admired.” Fimrite quoted long-time Boston Herald and Boston Globe columnist George Frazier, who wrote in 1962 of Hobey and Princeton: “He haunts a whole school, and from generation unto generation. You say ‘Hobey Baker’ and all of a sudden you see the gallantry of a world long since gone.”  
F. Scott Fitzgerald fictionalized Baker as the Princeton football captain “Allenby” in his debut novel, This Side of Paradise.  
Hobey Baker and his like were amateur athletes according to the standards of the early 20th century. Their brilliant blend of amateur status, athletic excellence, and national acclaim appeared again in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, where Jesse Owens of Ohio State won four gold medals and by his example loudly refuted Nazi propaganda about a “master race.”   
Fifty years later, David Halberstam captured the essence of the same spirit in The Amateurs, a story of collegiate rowers bound for the Olympics in 1984.  
Halberstam wrote that legendary Harvard and Olympic crew coach Harry Parker “sensed why it was that [his oarsmen] were amateurs, why they gave so much in a society that gave back so little reward. For his men, rowing was as much theology as sport; it was built entirely on faith. The oarsman’s self-esteem and membership in this elite circle depended completely on what he did; if he worked hard enough, he would be rewarded.” 
Charlie Baker knows the lore of amateur sports. His college classmates rowed for Harry Parker. He played hoops for Harvard in Princeton’s gym, steps away from Hobey Baker Rink.  
If Charlie Baker channels Hobey Baker, he may find the inspiration to preserve a sphere of amateurism — let’s call it the Hobey Baker Division — where sports remain subordinate to the academic mission, and where wealth and consumerism are not part of the curriculum for athlete or spectator.  
Early signs of Charlie Baker’s impulses are encouraging. Appearing last fall on the podcast “Hot Topics,” hosted by the Division III Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, Baker recalled how much he enjoyed watching his two sons play Division III football at Union and Denison. He spoke about the special intimacy and camaraderie of sports and academics at that level. 
“Chances are that you know most of your classmates and they know you,” he said. “And there are no bad seats at a D3 game,” he joked.   
Charlie Baker has opposed the classification of student-athletes as “employees,” citing the burdens such a classification would impose on Division II and III schools, and the “active opposition of their leadership at all levels opposing this.”   
He could also draw inspiration from another high-profile sports executive: A. Bartlett Giamatti, president and professor of English at Yale University and later commissioner of Major League Baseball. In his book Take Time for Paradise, Giamatti meditated on the meaning of sports in our country and the virtues of such recreation for spectator and athlete alike. He wrote: 
“Much of what we love later in a sport is what it recalls to us about ourselves at our earliest. And those memories, now smoothed and bending away from us in the interior of ourselves, are not simply of childhood or a childhood game. They are memories of our best hopes. They are memories of a time when all that would be better was before us, as a hope, and the hope was fastened to a game.” 
Thirty-five years after Giamatti wrote, sports retain a powerful grip on the young. Giamatti’s belief that the wellspring of such love — hope fastened to a game — seems to hold true today, even as the tide of amateurism ebbs.  
In these times of change, the question Hobey Baker might ask Charlie Baker is: Can hope be fastened to college games for play and pay?

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)It took about six hours, but the New Mexico House of Representatives wrapped the special session on Thursday evening after passing laws to address criminal competency, rural health care and vaccine policy.
After the session adjourned, House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) celebrated the work over the two-day session, which resulted in the passage of five bills aimed at blunting federal funding cuts and uncertainty. 
“We took critical steps to safeguard New Mexicans from the greatest threats facing them, but the work here is not done,” he said during a news conference on the House floor. “While we may only be in session a small part of the year, our work on federal cuts and other priority issues like public safety and child well-being will continue in the next legislative session.”
House Speaker Javier Martínez said he was proud of the work lawmakers did over a two-day special session ending on Oct. 2, 2025, to offset impacts from upcoming federal cuts but said future sessions would mean tackling the ‘insurmountable holes’ for state programs. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)
A three-hour portion of the session for announcements and a miscellaneous discussion after lawmakers returned to the floor just after 11 a.m. created a three-hour delay before the body got down to business.
Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), the House minority leader, said at a news conference Thursday afternoon that her Republican colleagues took all that time for “airing their grievances” before the bill deliberations began due to frustration at being shut out by the Democratic majority. “That’s the only time we got to do it,” she said. 
After the session, Martínez said he had conversations with Armstrong about the bills before the session, adding that he has an “open door policy.”
“The notion that folks are not included, I don’t know where it comes from,” he said. “They never asked, and when they did, I followed through.” 
Criminal competency 
The House had a near-unanimous passage of Senate Bill 2, which will allow the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court to determine competency, fixing a change made in amendment to House Bill 8 during the 60-day session.
Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos), the sponsor, said the amendment shifted cases from metropolitan court into the district court, increasing caseloads unnecessarily. 
“It’s ironic we were delegating upward instead of delegating downward,” Chandler said. 
Only three Republicans voted against the bill: Reps. Stefani Lord from Sandia Park, John Block from Alamogordo and Randall Pettigrew of Lovington. 
Rural health care
The House also passed Senate Bill 1, which will establish a $50 million grant program and expand the use for the funds for hospitals and allow counties with more than 100,000 residents to apply. 
Despite three hours of debate, HB1 passed along a 64-3 vote, with Republican Reps. Block, Pettigrew and Rod Montoya from Farmington voted against.
A last-ditch effort to approve New Mexico’s entry into interstate compacts for physicians also ensued. During debate, Rep. Jenifer Jones (R-Deming) introduced a substitute bill, which included the same language as the original Senate Bill 1, but also appended Senate Bill 9 to include compact entry and lower barriers to licensing doctors from other states. 
Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) objected, noting that the Senate had already adjourned and would not return to address any changes to the bill and the changes would render the bill unconstitutional, and fall outside the scope of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s proclamation.
“If we do pass this substitute under our rules, not only is it counter to our Constitution, it would be unfortunately dead on arrival to the Senate, since they are no longer in session,” Romero said.
Martínez, the House speaker, ruled that the substitute bill would not be allowed under the rules, noting the narrow allowance in the proclamation. 
Montoya and Jones challenged Martínez’s ruling, which failed on a 42-22 vote. 
Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) said she was “incredibly disappointed” the interstate compacts were deemed not germane and said lawmakers would “need to absolutely tackle” them in the 30-day session. 
Additional concerns raised by Republicans included the concern that hospitals in Albuquerque or Santa Fe would receive the funds rather than rural areas in other portions of the state. 
“Sandoval County has over 100,000 people but also has communities like Jemez,” Rep. Liz Thomson said on the floor. “So it would allow medical facilities in Jemez to apply for grants.”

Vaccine policy
The house passed Senate Bill 3, which will expand the New Mexico Department of Health’s authority to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for children, as well as allow the department to use additional sources than a sole federal advisory committee to create guidelines for school and daycare vaccination policy amid federal upheaval. 
The bill drew hours of Republican opposition throughout the session and, finally, in the House, with sponsor Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque) defending the process through which the bill was introduced and debated. Republican lawmakers previously complained they only had four minutes to ask questions during a committee debate earlier, and they said the bill had changed repeatedly. 
Hochman-Vigil closed more than two hours of debate acknowledging that vaccines are a “highly politicized issue” but seeking to reassure her Republican colleagues that the bill is about “allowing New Mexicans the ability to live their lives in the way that they want to.”
The bill passed 43-26, along party lines. 
Rep. Catherine Cullen (R-Rio Rancho) voted “no.” After the vote, she repeated her criticism that she and colleagues only had a few minutes to read and vet the bill. “We need to do better for each other,” she said. 
Despite the bill’s passage, the House did not meet the two-thirds threshold needed to enact the bill immediately under an emergency clause, which may render it moot. 
Without an emergency clause, the bill will not become law until 90 days from the end of the session — or Dec. 31, 2025.

The list of requests came in at just over $357.3 million. The largest request came from Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) who requested $100 million for a statewide expansion of the Rx Kids program, which provides cash assistance to parents during pregnancy and for the first six or 12 months of their child’s life. 
The next largest requests came from Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) who requested $10 million for Wayne County Department of Public Services and Rep. Bill G. Schuette (R-Midland) who requested $10 million for flooding mitigation prevention for the City of Midland. Schuette also requested $9.8 million in support of the Four Lakes task force, which is working to restore four man-made lakes which were lost during the 2020 failure of the Edenville and Sanford Dams. 
The following are the total amount of earmarks presented by the chair of each appropriations subcommittee for the Departments under their purview

Department of Health and Human Services – $5.1 million
PreK-12 – $24.3 million
Department of Michigan Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential- $2 million
Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity – $259.7 million
Department of Natural Resources – $1.75 million
Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy – $2.7 million in continued funding
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development – $5 million
Department of Technology Management and Budget – $1 million
Universities and Community Colleges – $5.7 million
Licensing and Regulatory Affairs – $4 million

During the hearing Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) told the committee that the two items under consideration by the Department of Transportation were merely corrections to boilerplate language, though she later told reporters that the department requested some items which may need to be considered grants.

Winooski, Vermont – It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Randy Allen Trayah after a long and courageous battle with cancer. Randy passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family, on September 30, 2025.
Born on July 12, 1963, in Burlington, Vermont, Randy was the son of Francis Trayah and June (Ring) Trayah. He was a beloved family member, father, brother, uncle, friend, and husband. Randy touched the lives of many with his profound sense of humor, warmth, creativity, and outgoing nature. Generous and kind, he had an uncanny ability to connect with just about anyone.
Randy graduated from Burlington High School in 1981. Shortly after, he met the love of his life, Candy (Bushway), they married in September 1982. He was predeceased in death by his beloved wife Candy (April 2024). Together they shared over 43 years of marriage and raised two children, Bobbie and Shane.
Randy’s work ethic was unmatched. He was loved and respected for his honesty, kindness, and his genuine concern for others. He worked for many years for the Burlington School District, where he became a beloved bus driver. Randy also gave to his community as a volunteer firefighter for the City of Winooski.
He was a favorite among the children he drove to school and the teachers he supported. Randy loved sports, cheering for the New York Yankees and the Dallas Cowboys. He enjoyed watching baseball and football games with family and friends. He especially cherished outings with his children getting ice cream, evenings at Lake Monsters games, and joy rides around town.
Randy also had a deep love for music, with favorite bands including Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Rush, and Led Zeppelin. An animal lover, he and his family shared their home with many rescue cats over the years.

Most federal funding for K-12 education is provided in advance, so schools still have access to it during the shutdown, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction confirmed this week. 
Existing grants and contracts that don’t require involvement from federal staff will also continue as normal. 
Programs and services that do require involvement from the U.S. Department of Education, like internet connectivity programs, technical assistance, reviews of civil rights complaints and implementing new grants, however, will likely experience interruptions. The department has furloughed about 95% of its staff. 
Child nutrition programs, including school lunch, breakfast and snack programs, will also continue as normal until further notice. 
The food programs are probably fully funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the next three months, state officials say, but the Department of Agriculture has not released information about its current shutdown plan. 
“Programs are entitled to reimbursement for meals served during a shutdown, but there is a potential for payments to be delayed until a funding bill is passed,” the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction’s child nutrition team said in an email to school nutrition directors this week. 
Head Start, a federally funded program for kids ages 3 to 5, is also operating as usual for the time being. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to make decisions about Head Start programs during a government shutdown, but the department has yet to release guidance on how Head Start will function during the shutdown.  
A spokesperson for the Washington State Association of Head Start and ECEAP, a nonprofit composed of representatives from Head Start and the state Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, confirmed Thursday that all Head Start locations in Washington were open. 
The association is concerned about negative impacts the shutdown could have on seven Head Start grantees in Washington whose current annual contracts expire at the end of the month. 
Head Start operates on a federal grant system, with organizations like schools and nonprofits receiving grants from the U.S. Department of Education to run the program. 
Washington has a total of 50 Head Start grantees, serving about 20,000 kids. 
Contracts would typically be worked out long before they expire, but due to delays caused by federal layoffs at the Head Start Office this spring, the batch of contracts set to renew Nov. 1 wasn’t approved before the shutdown — meaning those grantees have no guarantee that they’ll be funded past Oct. 31. 
“I think what will happen is they will try and continue to operate,” said Washington State Association of Head Start and ECEAP Deputy Director Katy Warren. “The question is, how long can they do that for, if they don’t have any money coming in?”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/school-lunch-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-02 20:58:05.583279

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the appointment of Whitfield, 33, on Thursday to fill the unexpired term of former mayor Christopher Franklin, who was removed from office by court order on July 7. The Arkansas Supreme Court denied Franklin’s request for a stay on Sept. 25.
Whitfield will be eligible to run for a full term as mayor in 2026, the governor said in a press release.
Whitfield is executive director of the Phillips County Chamber and Delta Magic, a nonprofit that “highlights the ‘magic’ of the Delta by spearheading collaborative initiatives and connecting resources that build local capacity, challenge negative narratives, and foster community pride,” according to its website.
“This city is my home, and I am committed to working every day to strengthen our neighborhoods, support our businesses, and create new opportunities for development,” Whitfield said in the press release. “We have something special to offer on this side of the state, and this present moment deserves the best from us, collectively.”
Sanders said Helena-West Helena “needs big ideas and bold solutions to correct some of the issues that have arisen in recent years, and I believe that a new face like Joseph Whitfield is what this city needs.”
Whitfield becomes mayor after a turbulent year for the Delta city. The Helena-West Helena City Council asked Franklin to step down in May 2024 after a profanity-filled video of an argument between him, his adult daughter and adult niece went viral on social media. Franklin refused.

In June this year, Franklin, 44, was arrested by state police on a charge of failing to file state tax returns, a felony. That charge led to his removal from office in a case filed by the local prosecuting attorney, who had asked Arkansas State Police to investigate the mayor a year earlier. In an appeal of the removal, Franklin alleged the investigation and arrest were racially motivated.
The city has been plagued by water service issues and financial irregularities. In July 2024, the state Board of Health ordered the municipality of 8,000 to come up with a plan to upgrade its water systems or face a fine of about $685,000. City officials admitted violating a number of rules for public water systems, including failing to hire a qualified system operator for several months. The water system is old, and the city endured two significant water outages in summer 2023 and January 2024.

This July, city officials were grilled by legislators for nearly two hours about a legislative audit that found financial concerns, including unauthorized withdrawals from the city’s bank account, failure to make timely payments on its bills and a lack of supporting documentation for credit card transactions.
The city was $604,000 over budget in 2023, the year the audit covered. City Treasurer Derrick Turner told lawmakers the city was $2 million in debt.
Acting Mayor Donald Etherly told legislators he thought Helena-West Helena had “sufficient revenue to operate, but there’s some spending that, as I describe, [has] just been reckless,” attributing the spending to Franklin. 
 About Whitfield

A native of Helena, Whitfield graduated as part of KIPP Delta Collegiate’s second graduating class in 2011. He earned a bachelor’s degree in English at Colby College in Maine and a master’s in education from Relay Graduate School of Education in New York, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He returned to the Delta, where he served as an educator for eight years, as a teacher and an assistant principal. He was briefly an assistant principal at KIPP Delta Collegiate High School.
Through his work at the Phillips County Chamber of Commerce, Whitfield has helped lead an initiative to build a coalition across multiple businesses and organizations in Phillips County, the governor’s press release said. 
As mayor, he intends to focus on improving the quality of life for city residents and building a strong foundation for future generations, the release said.
“In my conversations with Joseph, he’s laid out a commonsense vision to get his community back on track and truly tap into Helena-West Helena’s potential,” Sanders said in the press release. 
She thanked him for stepping up to take on the task and expressed thanks for Etherly, “who has helped move the city in the right direction since taking over earlier this summer.”

Eva Sigsworth doesn’t have a problem with the search warrants authorities had when they knocked on her door at 5:30 a.m. on Sept. 17.
She just wishes they would have given a copy to her.
She doesn’t have a problem with the guns they found in some of her grandson’s belongings on her property — if they were used as part of criminal act, she wants them gone.
She just wishes that they wouldn’t have caused thousands of dollars of damage to her property, including tearing up a mobile home she rents to a tenant so badly as to make it uninhabitable.
And she’s gotten over the embarrassment that people with badges and guns stormed her house, refusing to even let her get dressed as she stood in her underwear and a nightgown.
But in a recent interview with the Daily Montanan, the 89-and-a-half-year old said she was insulted and wants answers as to why there were more than 40 officers ransacking her property when she needs a walker just to get around. And she can’t help but wonder why Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were interrogating her about whether she was illegal and connected with Mexican drug cartels.
Though her family was from Texas, she’s been in Billings since 1963, is an American citizen, a former VISTA coordinator, a volunteer at the local senior center, and the former owner of a popular Billings restaurant, Mamacita’s, known for its chili verde and hot sauce.
So far, a GoFundMe account has raised more than $11,000 to help put her home and two other structures on the property back together. A few days after the raid, nearly 100 Billings residents, many of whom remember Eva from her days feeding them, showed up to help repair the damage that had been done. Three contractors also arrived to rehang doors, put up a trailer skirt and do other things, like put a barn full of property back in place because Eva could not.

She knows her grandson, identified in court documents as John Paul Schmieding, faces serious drug charges, including possessing stolen guns. Eva said she’s always supported law enforcement, but questions why it is legal for authorities to do thousands of dollars in damage to property when Schmieding has never lived there. Moreover, she wants to know if she was profiled because of her brown skin color, and because an ICE agent wanted to know if she spoke Spanish. To her, that didn’t seem like a drug raid or a search for stolen guns. It seemed like an excuse.
Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said his office has taken some heat from public outrage sparked by the raid. He points out that some guns that had been reported stolen were recovered on her property. However, he also said his office wasn’t the lead agency responsible, instead that the U.S. Department of Justice and its multi-jurisdictional task force, which includes uniformed deputies from his department, is responsible. He explained that while the Sheriff’s Office contributes officers to the efforts, they operate under a federal command. Officers from other area law enforcement also make up part of the force.
Calls and questions to U.S. Department of Justice went unreturned on Wednesday and Thursday. While the website urges members of the media to fill out an information request, that form was not available, likely due to the federal government shutdown.
“Democrats have shut down the government. Department of Justice websites are not currently regularly updated. Please refer to the Department of Justice’s contingency plan for more information,” the website said.
Eva said she was rattled awake by what sounded to her like a cannon or explosion. Then she and her son, Arthur Alvarado, who lives with her, heard the loudspeaker: “Come out with your hands up.”
“I asked if they had a warrant. They said they did. I asked to see it, and they told me they couldn’t show it to me,” Eva said. “I said, ‘I’m 90 years old, what do you want me for?’”
She said she was left in a nightgown, without clothes and unable to use the bathroom. When she was finally interviewed, she was asked by an ICE officer about her nationality. She told them American, and so was everyone else on the property. She later learned it was a warrant for property her grandson, who occasionally visits and has personal items there, had. But originally, she thought it was an immigration raid because of their questions and the color of her skin.
“They asked me if I speak Spanish,” she said. “I told them I did, and then they tried to get me to sign forms that spelled out my Miranda rights. I said: Why would I need to do that?”
Eva said agents then accused of her of being part of a Mexican drug cartel.
“I said, ‘Yeah, I am a 90-year-old grandma kingpin,” she said, pointing to her walker that has foam balls on the legs of it for traction. “I told them, ‘I am not going to sign anything because you guys know how to turn it around. I will talk with legal counsel.’”
They also asked her son, Arthur Alvarado, if he was in gang.
“He told them that he had been in a gang for four years a long time ago,” Eva said. “When they asked which one, he said, ‘The U.S. Marine Corps.’”
The officers, which she said numbered 40, told her to leave. She went to a friend’s house, stunned and confused. She was told when the raid and search were finished, someone would call to tell them they could come back. She said she waited for hours, then went back home. The property was torn apart, the doors were open and no one was there. Her tenant who rents a mobile home was shaken and doors were off the hinges and property was strewn around. A search warrant had been left on the table.

She went to the back, near her sunflowers where she watches birds and takes her dogs, two well-fed Chihuahua-Weiner dog mixes. Property was everywhere — a lifetime of collecting items.
“The more I looked around, the more devastated I felt. They didn’t have to dump things like that. They didn’t have to wreck antiques,” Eva said.
But as devastated as she was, her spirits turned around a few days later as neighbors, family and friends arrived — an estimated 100 people — to help clean, repair and put things back. And Eva did what she knows best: She fired up the barbecue and made hamburgers for the community.
“I thought that people had forgotten about my existence,” she said. “Then all of a sudden, there were all these people caring about me and coming to help me. I’m so grateful that they took care of me and that we take care of each other.”
For now, the tears come and go as she begins to wonder about a community she regards as home. She loves Billings because it has always pushed back hard against racial stereotyping.
“I’m a strong person and I have gone through a lot — and survived,” she said. “I feel like I won’t let this break me. I feel frustrated because I can’t get this out of my mind, the way they treated me and they traumatized my tenant. I felt like I wasn’t doing anything. It’s changed the way I view law enforcement, I guess. To think that they believed I was involved with the cartels. It hurts.”

She says it was the community support that has given her hope when she gets to thinking too much about the raid. Still, no matter what agency was in charge of the operation, she believes things could have been different — and should have been different.
“I watch what is happening all over the country and what Trump is doing. The man is always going on about this and that — and he lies and even his lies are proven wrong,” she said. “Granted there are a lot of illegal immigrants to round up, and there are a lot of people who support what he’s doing — even if they’re guilty or not. There are a lot of my friends who tell me they’re so glad that hasn’t come to Montana. Well, I am here to tell you: It is here.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eva-Sigsworth--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-02 20:58:05.583279

The average approved rate increase of 26% is significantly higher than the 17.5% average proposed increase announced by the Nevada Division of Insurance in [[...]","(Nevada Health link video screengrab)Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, are facing premium rate hikes of 26%, the state Division of Insurance confirmed to the Nevada Current.
The average approved rate increase of 26% is significantly higher than the 17.5% average proposed increase announced by the Nevada Division of Insurance in late July.
The July estimate was based on preliminary filings, according to the division, and has been adjusted upward by carriers because of “rising medical costs and prescription drug spending, increased medical utilization and a less healthy risk pool, Medicaid unwinding and the expiration of enhanced federal premium subsidies.”
Regulatory changes related to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule are also driving up premium costs, according to the division. Among several revisions in the rule is one addressing how premiums are adjusted, which is expected to raise the costs of not only premiums but also out-of-pocket costs. 
“These factors are not unique to Nevada,” a spokesperson for the division noted, “similar increases are being reported nationwide.”
For most ACA enrollees, the overall premium rate hike will be compounded by the loss of enhanced federal subsidies that brought down their out-of-pocket premium costs. These subsidies, according to health policy analysts at KFF, increased the amount of assistance received by enrollees already receiving subsidies and qualified middle-income people for tax credits.
The enhanced federal subsidies expire at the end this year and are a key sticking point in a political showdown between Republicans and Democrats that has resulted in a federal government shutdown.
KFF estimates the vast majority of ACA enrollees nationwide receive the advanced premium tax credit.
Nevada Health Link has said that 9 out of 10 enrollees receive a federal subsidy that brings down the cost of their premium. Approximately 110,000 Nevadans get their health insurance through Health Link.
Nationally, 24 million people get health insurance through the ACA.
Keep Americans Covered, a coalition of health care providers, insurers, and customers, has estimated 85,000 Nevadans will lose the enhanced subsidy. KFF estimates the number higher at 94,500.
Nevada Health Link, through its public relations firm, did not respond to emailed questions by publication time.
The marketplace includes eight health insurance carriers and 140 qualified health plans, according to a news release from the organization. Thirteen qualified dental plans through four insurance carriers are also offered.
The average approved premium increase by carrier was not available on the Nevada Division of Insurance’s website as of Thursday afternoon. A spokesperson said the division was experiencing a “technical malfunction” but expected to post the information on Friday.
Nevadans shopping for health insurance can now preview their available plans and rates at NevadaHeathLink.com. Heath Link will hold 20 community events across the state in October where Nevadans can discuss their options.
Open enrollment will begin Nov. 1 for coverage beginning Jan. 1. The open enrollment period ends Jan. 15, according to Health Link’s website.
Political battle
The federal government shutdown, which began early Wednesday, appears to be a result of a deep divide between Republicans and Democrats on health care policy.
Democrats have said Republicans refuse to negotiate on health care, which they have indicated is their priority issue. They have focused on the expiration of ACA premium subsidies.
On Tuesday, Republicans introduced a stopgap funding bill that did not include an extension of the premium credits. All but two Democrats (and one Independent who typically votes with Democrats) voted against the bill.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was one of the Democrats to support the bill. (U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the other.) In a statement defending her vote, Cortez Masto said she did not want to hurt federal government employees.
“We need a bipartisan solution to address this impending health care crisis, but we should not be swapping the pain of one group of Americans for another,” she said.
U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, on the Senate floor hours before the federal government shutdown began, took a markedly different stance from her colleague.
“Nevadans sent me here to fight for them, not to cave and let Washington Republicans take away their ability to go to the doctor and get your medication,” she said. “Everyone should have access to affordable, quality care.”
Rosen defended the ACA premium credits.
“This is not a handout, it isn’t welfare,” she said. “It’s just a tax cut that helps lower the cost for nearly 95,000 Nevadans so they can afford to buy an insurance policy. So they can go to the doctor when they’re sick and go to the pharmacy to get their medication for a copay. So they can just afford their insurance…”
U.S. Rep. Susie Lee in press conferences and statements has expressed similar sentiments and emphasized the importance of addressing the issue immediately because of the open enrollment timeline.
Meanwhile, the National Republican Congressional Committee is running ads accusing Democrats of  shutting down the federal government “in order to give illegal immigrants free health care.”
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for ACA marketplace plans, whether subsidized or not. Similarly, they are not eligible to enroll in Medicaid.
Medicaid does reimburse hospitals for some emergency care provided to undocumented immigrants, but that spending is less than 1% of overall Medicaid spending, according to KFF. Emergency services entail care that prevents death, serious harm or disability.
Nearly half of states provide prenatal and pregnancy-related care to undocumented immigrants through the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP.

In this case, three projects at three separate locations are sharing the $5.8 million, though the lion’s share, $4.3 million, goes to the global market. That market venture aims to transform a second-hand store, once a car dealership, vacated years ago along the South 24th Street main commercial corridor, just north of Q Street. 
The 16,500-square-foot building and parking area will provide space for a commercial kitchen, more than a dozen indoor vendors and three outdoor food trucks, as well as flexible event space for workshops and community functions.
Another $1 million of the multi-pronged grant will help build a six-townhouse project near 29th and Jackson Streets, and $500,000 will go toward expansion of the International Bakery, said Marta Sonia Londoño Mejía of Midwest Business & Projects LLC, which led the application process and is coordinating the award.
While several in attendance said commercial activity is still down in the Latino merchant-heavy area following a June 10 high-profile immigration raid at an Omaha food processing plant, Londoño Mejía expects the global market to flourish and draw customers that will help other area businesses. 
“It will be a destination place,” she said of the market, which is expected to see its first phase done in the fall of 2026. “We expect people from different communities will come here for food, a place to visit, to study. We want people to come, stay and have fun.”
Buoyed also by $827,591 in tax-increment financing approved by the Omaha City Council, the global market carries an overall anticipated price tag of about $9.4 million. Gloria Patricia Avalos of GPA Properties, owns the property and is the market’s CEO.
 Arts and culture

Organizations behind the other two components expect to host their own formal groundbreakings in coming weeks.
The project trio is among about 130 groups and businesses to share the $235 million earmarked for the North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program intended to spur economic growth in areas hardest hit by COVID-19.  Awards were announced in early 2024, but the competitive application process harkens back to 2022.

Among vendors that will be cooking up ethnic specialities is a restaurateur who had to close her 24th Street Mexican diner during the pandemic, said Londoño Mejía, a native of Colombia. She said the lineup is expected to represent countries from Africa, Europe, Latin America and more.
The grant fell into the category of  arts and culture. Londoño Mejía said the global market and future phases will host events and programming that promote diverse cultures.
Among guest speakers Thursday was Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., who likened the project to a town square that will draw people and create jobs.

Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes said he was proud of the contributions Latinos are making to Nebraska and elsewhere. The consul general of Guatemala, Flor de María Sánchez Fuentes also spoke, as did Luis Marcos, Maya ambassador and executive director of Pixan Ixim, and Javier Saldaña of the Nebraska DED.
Roger Garcia, chair of the Douglas County Board, told the group in both English and Spanish that the global market is a continuation of the South Omaha story — one that features various waves of immigrants who landed in the area to work in meatpacking plants, on railroads, in restaurants and more. He said the groups included Germans, Italians, Poles, Czechs, Irish, Greeks and newcomers from Mexico, Central and South America and Africa.
“So many groups have come through South Omaha to pursue their dream,” he said, adding that the district he represents is now about half Latino with ancestors from multiple Spanish-speaking countries. 
 ‘Hope and opportunity’

Itzel Lopez of the Latino Economic Development Council was among supporters who said business in South Omaha is slower following the June 10 raid led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But she said merchants are taking steps to make shoppers feel safer, such as posting educational signage on constitutional rights. She expects activity to continue to gradually pick up with community support.

Avalos said she wants to promote a welcoming environment for people to socialize, as well as a place for entrepreneurs to nurture their craft. She expects the physical site to grow in future phases, with a rooftop space and a greenhouse.
Thursday’s groundbreaking, she said, signaled not just a groundbreaking but “hope and opportunity for generations to come.”

Mike Kehoe should not have deployed the National Guard to assist ICE while the federal government is shut down. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Gov. Mike Kehoe’s decision to deploy Missouri National Guard soldiers to support immigration enforcement “makes no sense” because they will not get paid until the federal government shutdown is resolved, the state Senate’s Democratic leader said Thursday.
On Tuesday, Kehoe announced that soldiers from the Guard would, on a volunteer basis, be assigned to provide administrative, clerical and logistical support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facilities in the state.
The shutdown started a few hours after Kehoe announced the deployment.
“Everybody knew that was coming, and to me that makes no sense,” Beck said.
Spokeswoman Gabby Picard said that there will be up to 15 soldiers on duty at any particular time until authorization ends on Sept. 30, 2026. 
ICE continues to work while most of the government is shut down because the budget bill approved in July funded the agency with $29.9 billion for enforcement and $5 billion for detention through September 2029.
When on federal deployment, members of the Guard are paid on the same schedule as active-duty personnel, with the next pay date being Oct. 15. No active duty military will receive pay until the shutdown is resolved.
The Tuesday news release said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved assigning Guard personnel to ICE facilities on July 25, allowing them to be paid from the federal treasury. 
“The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts,” Kehoe said in a news release.
While all the soldiers taking on the duty are doing so as volunteers, they expected to get paid, Beck said.
“I’m sure, when they did this, they didn’t know that they’d be doing it possibly for free for a while,” Beck said. “I’m assuming they’ll be made whole at some point, but I’m sure they got bills just like everybody else.”
In response to Beck’s criticism, Picard said the decision to assist ICE wasn’t made hastily.
“Planning for this activation has been ongoing for weeks, and has nothing to do with the unfortunate political games of the Democrats in Washington that have caused a government shutdown,” Picard said.
The deployment has also drawn criticism from labor unions and the ACLU..
Lenny Jones, vice president and state director at the Service Employees International Union-Healthcare, said in a news release that the deployment is part of an increasingly authoritarian government.
“This is just another power grab used to silence and intimidate people who disagree with the administration’s anti-American policies,” Jones said.
The ACLU said the deployment diverts resources from disaster recovery and other needs.
“National Guard troops should be reserved for genuine emergencies, not deployed to suit the president’s political whims,” Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division, said in a news release.
The deployment should be unneeded because ICE has been hiring large numbers of new employees, Beck said.
“You tell me they can’t keep up with the paperwork?” Beck asked.
The standoff in Washington is over the health care subsidies for marketplace health plans that are ending under the budget reconciliation bill passed in July. Democrats are demanding they be restored, while Republicans insist the government must be reopened before they will negotiate.
Beck said he wants Democrats in Congress to hold their position.
“At the end of the day, the Republicans control everything, all three branches of the government,” Beck said. “So the question you have to ask yourself is, why did they let it get to this point?”

After the president sent a letter offering “substantial” federal grants if USC complies with conservative demands, Newsom threatened to withdraw lucrative state funding


Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday threatened to cut billions in state funding from the University of Southern California if it complies with a Trump administration request to impose the president’s political priorities on campus. 
USC was one of nine public and private universities across the country that received offers of preferential access to federal funds from the White House Thursday in exchange for agreeing to a wide variety of policy directives, many of which align with conservative demands of higher education.
Newsom responded with his own ultimatum: sign the White House request, and “instantly” lose state funding, including CalGrants, the $2.4 billion in annual state-funded scholarships for California students. 
The threat — which puts California universities in the position of choosing between losing state or federal funding — is the latest escalation in the state’s dealings with the Trump administration. It comes as an increasingly combative Newsom seeks both to push back on the Trump administration’s stretching of democratic norms, and to burnish his own standing as leader of the national Democratic resistance. 
The state has sued the administration over its withholding of federal grants or attempts to tie unrelated federal funding to policy demands around diversity and inclusion initiatives or immigration. Now Newsom is threatening to punish California institutions that comply with Trump’s threats or assist with his agenda.
“California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom,” he said in a press release, using all-caps quotes mimicking the president’s social media posts, which have become frequent fodder for the governor’s own communications. 
It was not immediately clear how much state funding USC receives, including in CalGrants scholarships. 
In the 2024 fiscal year USC got $1.35 billion in federal funding — $650 million in student financial aid and $569 million for research. The university cut budgets and froze hiring in March in part over a persistent deficit and uncertainty surrounding federal funding. In July, interim president Beong-Soo Kim announced the university would likely conduct layoffs.
The White House letters come as universities across the country face increasing pressure from the administration over allowing transgender athletes to compete, their handling of pro-Palestinian protests last year and general accusations of liberal bias. 
A federal judge recently allowed UCLA to reclaim many of its federal grants, but the university is contending with a more than $1 billion fine from the federal government over allegations of allowing antisemitism on campus; in settlement negotiations the Trump administration has made a litany of demands of the university, including that it not admit international students who have “anti-Western” views. Newsom has called it “extortion” and said in August he hoped to “stop folks from selling out.”
With Thursday’s letter, the Trump administration is seeking to incentivize compliance with other universities. 
The letter sent to USC and other universities, according to The Associated Press, states that in exchange for complying with the White House directives, institutions would get benefits such as “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” The directives in the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” include freezing tuition, capping the number of international students, banning the use of race and gender in admissions, limiting accommodations for transgender students and fostering a campus environment that is more welcoming to conservative ideas. 
The universities that received the offer were selected because officials believed they could be a “good actor,” and had “a president who is a reformer or a board that has really indicated they are committed to a higher-quality education,” White House senior adviser May Mailman told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the letter. 
USC officials did not say whether they would agree to the offer, stating only that they “are reviewing the administration’s letter.” 
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded to Newsom’s threat in an emailed statement saying the governor should “worry about the disaster he’s created in his own state,” referencing state policies allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports. 
“By opposing the compact, Newscum is opposing efforts to cap wild tuition hikes and to protect free speech,” Jackson said, using Trump’s preferred derogatory moniker for the governor.

“Some of it is riffs on classics. It’s just figuring out unique Italian ingredients and how I can utilize them. It’s meant to be playful,” the head chef said.

Madelyn Nonni is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
After something of a drought of Italian restaurants in downtown Rutland, recently opened Treviso Vermont is aiming to showcase its hospitality and family values through modern, unique dishes.
In July, Treviso opened its doors to customers after remodeling the old Table 24 location at 24 Wales St.
For owner Michelle Erickson, it was all about the space feeling right. After looking at a variety of placements between Rutland and Killington, she knew she always loved the location when Table 24 was in business.
“I had a lease in my hand for another place that was on Killington. I drove down Wales Street, and I said to my partner, ‘Let’s just go look at it.’ We walked through, and we just knew that this was where we wanted to be,” she said.
Set out to create a restaurant close to home, the name Treviso is a nod to Erickson’s grandmother — her Nonna — from Treviso, Italy.
Erickson, a first-generation Italian American, spent the majority of her childhood with her grandmother — specifically cooking and learning from her.
“Her food was just amazing. She always made really nutritious, delicious Italian food. That’s what I grew up eating. There’s this whole perception of what Italian food is. It’s a giant plate of pasta, and it’s not traditionally how Italians eat. It’s very vegetable-dense, a little pasta and protein. That’s how I grew up eating,” Erickson said.
Erickson’s business partner and head chef at the restaurant, Mike Ronzino, is a second-generation Italian American and is closely tied to his heritage by food. He said that with Treviso, he is making dishes that are different but still have some traditional charm.
“Some of it is riffs on classics. It’s just figuring out unique Italian ingredients and how I can utilize them. It’s meant to be playful. I did a mortadella sandwich, but as an Uncrustable. There’s a classic dish, vitello tonnato, which is veal and tuna sauce, that’s with the arancini we have on. I’m trying to reimagine and approach it a little different,” Ronzino said.

He also mentioned exciting menu options featuring their linguini dish with an artichoke and chopped clam sauce, and experimenting with desserts, specifically their panna cotta.
Treviso said it isn’t just about food — it’s also about their sense of family within the walls of the restaurant.
“We’re in the hospitality business. It extends to being hospitable to each other. The way that our staff treats each other, the way that we treat our staff, even the way we treat our guests, it’s all part of that,” Erickson said.
Erickson and Ronzino discussed how easily burnout happens, as well as turmoil between front and back of house, but they said they are aiming to create a welcoming environment for their employees without the high-stress culture often defined in the industry.
Consultant chef Nevin Perry has been on the project since the spring with Erickson and Ronzino, helping it come to life. He said kitchens usually have a lot of anger in them, but Treviso has the complete opposite.
“Everybody works so well together. It’s a huge team effort here. I’ve worked in tons of restaurants, and this is one of the best ones I’ve ever worked at. We’re like such a close-knit group,” Perry said.
Chef Octavio Cueva feels the same and said communication and energy can only elevate the work experience for the staff.
“Good energy definitely travels forward for sure. Also, negative energy, that’s why we’re always trying to stay positive. We’re always happy and singing, and dancing. But when it’s time to get to work, it’s time to get to work. Besides that, good energy, good flow,” Cueva said.

After closing on the downtown location in November, Erickson said she never had any expectations for Treviso, but Rutland has shown up for them since opening. She encourages everyone to give the eatery a try.
“I really wanted to focus on the food and an environment where anybody could come. So if you just got out of work and you’ve got jeans and your boots on, I want you to come sit at the bar, come sit at a table. It’s your anniversary? Come sit at the bar, come sit at a table,” she said.
Looking toward the future, Erickson said creating a hospitality group is a goal Ronzino and Erickson have, including finding the right executive chef to take over the kitchen, allowing Ronzino to take a step back and focus on being a creative vision for the restaurant.
“We have goals in the future to do something, but right now, we’re just really focused on this project because if this doesn’t pan out or isn’t successful, there is no future project. So far, so good,” Erickson said.

Her family fears no one will face accountability.","Tormel Pittman of New Brunswick leads a rally outside the New Jersey Attorney General's Office in Trenton on Oct. 2, 2025, to protest the police killing of his aunt Deborah Terrell, 68. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Activists and relatives of an elderly woman gunned down by New Brunswick police in August rallied outside the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office Thursday to urge authorities to release all footage from the deadly encounter.
They also demanded that the officers be fired and prosecuted for failing to call in mental health professionals and instead shooting Deborah Terrell, 68, with a gun, pepper spray, and a Taser after a seven-minute standoff at her apartment in a high-rise for senior citizens. Authorities are required to contact mental health specialists when dealing with barricaded people in mental crisis.
Tormel Pittman, Terrell’s nephew, said witnesses gave the family video of the officers handcuffing his bloodied, dying aunt and dragging her down the hallway — moments not included in the video the Attorney General’s Office shared publicly from officers’ body-worn cameras.
“You show footage of them getting on the elevator, having a discourse with other staff members, but you choose to edit out the part of being handcuffed and drug down the hallway. What do you think type of investigation they’re going to do as far as holding the cops accountable? What type of justice is the family going to get?” Pittman said. “The community no longer trust the Attorney General’s Office or this process.”

Officers were called to the high-rise on Neilson Street around 4 a.m. on Aug. 8 in response to reports that Terrell was disturbing other tenants, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Terrell refused to open her door or respond to officers, so the cops left and returned at 7:38 a.m. after a staffer called 911 to report that Terrell had threatened neighbors with a knife, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Officers’ body camera footage shows that she refused to come out of the apartment, shouting at the officers intermittently from inside and poking a knife out of the bottom of the door. She opened and closed the door several times with a knife in hand, the footage shows.
The third time she opened the door, the officers shot her with pepper spray and a stun gun, causing her to retreat briefly back inside and then out again, still armed with the knife. As she staggered into the hallway toward the officers, one fired his gun at her twice, the footage shows. She died shortly after at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
Pittman said his aunt had schizophrenia and required mental health care, not a violent police response.
It’s unclear why New Brunswick officers did not partner with mental health professionals when they responded to Terrell’s apartment. The officers did call emergency medical technicians to stand by outside the building “for a potential evaluation,” according to the Attorney General’s Office.
Under a directive Attorney General Matt Platkin issued just over a year ago, law enforcement officers are required to “slow and stabilize” encounters in barricade situations.
The directive requires police to bring a mental health professional when they respond to barricaded people, wait instead of forcing their way inside, bring less lethal weapons like Tasers to such calls, and immediately involve a supervisor. It came a few weeks after Fort Lee police shot Victoria Lee, 25, to death after she had barricaded herself in her apartment during a mental crisis.
The state also has a program, called Arrive Together, that pairs police with mental health professionals.
Platkin spokesman Michael Symons said the program now operates in all 21 counties and averages more than 700 interactions a month.
“(It) has established a proven record of responding to 911 calls for behavioral health crises and preventing them from escalating into violence, injury, or arrest,” Symons said. “However, not all calls with a potential mental health component involve ARRIVE — in part because of limitations on available resources, and in part because, at the behest of the program’s partners, licensed social workers and mental health providers are not put in danger.”
Symons said he couldn’t comment further because the case remains under investigation.
Thursday’s rally was just the latest of several since Terrell’s death. Advocates also shut down Route 18 and have taken their cause to New Brunswick City Council meetings.
The Attorney General’s Office typically identifies officers involved in fatalities but didn’t this time and also blurred their faces in the body camera footage, citing “threats being made against them.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Homeless Services Board took an initial step this week toward answering top Republican state leaders’ calls to act in response to President Donald Trump’s controversial executive order issued in July, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 
That July 29 letter from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said they’re not supportive of “‘Housing First’ policies that lack accountability” and urged the Utah Homeless Services Board to act in a series of ways to “fulfill” the president’s order. 
That included, according to the letter, calls to: 

“Accelerate progress on a transformative, services-based” homeless campus that state officials recently announced will include about 1,300 beds and will be put on a 15.8-acre parcel in northwest Salt Lake City, near the North Salt Lake city boundary. Cox, Schultz and Adams’ letter said the campus should prioritize “recovery, treatment, and long-term outcomes, not just emergency shelter.” 
“Develop policy recommendations” for the Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session that begins in January, “alongside legislative and executive branch partners.” 
“Ensure any funding requests are accompanied by a clear strategy that aligns with” Trump’s executive order, “with a focus on reprioritizing existing resources.”
“Streamline reporting requirements to reduce bureaucratic burden and maximize the time providers spend directly assessing, treating, and supporting clients.” 

The governor, House speaker and Senate president gave the board a deadline of Sept. 30 to respond.

This week, on the day of its deadline, the Utah Homeless Services Board — which is a powerful decision-making body that oversees the state’s homeless system and distributes state funding — sent its reply in the form of a letter sent on the day of the deadline, Tuesday. 
The board letter — drafted after hours of discussion during the board’s meeting last week — proposed an “initial framework” while also saying the board and the Utah Office of Homeless Services will “further evaluate and refine proposals” in coming months, “with further recommendations to be considered” at its Nov. 25 meeting in preparation of the 2026 legislative session. 
In response to state leaders’ calls to speed up progress on the homeless campus, the board’s letter emphasized a need for more money. Wayne Niederhauser, state homeless coordinator, has estimated that it will take about $75 million to build the campus, plus at least $30 million a year to operate it. 
“Funding for both construction and operation of the campus will be the single biggest accelerant to campus creation,” the letter says, adding that the board “believes that the state of Utah should identify a consistent, predictable statewide funding source to this end.” 
If that funding source can be identified, the board wrote “we expect to find savings in the existing system to support these expanded services — and we also believe that additional funding is needed in the near-term for it to be successful, with an expectation that these kinds of transformational investments will lead to significant cost savings over time.”
The letter has similar themes as a draft proposal that the board’s chair, Randy Shumway, wrote and presented to a legislative committee last month — but it leaves the door open for continued discussion. Shumway’s proposal had a more specific vision to respond to Trump’s executive order, calling for a “certified community behavioral health clinic” on the campus with 300 to 400 beds reserved for people who are civilly committed —  or court ordered into mental health treatment. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

Shumway’s proposal drew criticism and concern from some homeless advocates, who worried it would be wildly expensive and could create a chilling effect by building a civil commitment facility in direct proximity to homeless shelter beds. 
“A 300-400 bed mental and behavioral health facility that people are not allowed to leave is not a shelter but an incarceration option,” Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, a low-income advocacy nonprofit based in Utah, told Utah News Dispatch at the time. “Having such a facility colocated with a shelter would probably lead to a sense that if you do not follow the rules in one facility you could be moved into the other.” 
Shumway also proposed including on the campus what he called an “accountability center,” or a “secure residential placement facility that provides substance use disorder treatment as an alternative to jail,” where people would “receive care in a supervised environment where entry and exit are not voluntary.” 
The Utah Housing Coalition also issued a statement this week saying it and other “homelessness community partners statewide” had “urgent concerns” regarding Shumway’s plan. The coalition included a list of “key concerns,” including the need to prioritize deeply affordable housing and eviction prevention. 
The coalition called on state leaders to “add capacity — don’t cannibalize it” by ensuring the new campus adds capacity and isn’t “a reallocation” from other existing homeless shelter and housing services. 
Members of the Utah Homeless Services Board did not vote on Shumway’s proposal last week – but instead worked together to craft a response they could agree on while leaving the door open to continued conversations with homeless providers and others within Utah’s vast homeless system as they drill down on specific actions to take.

But due to shutdown-induced travel restrictions, the commanders of just four of those installations were able to attend an annual meeting in Columbia held to brief the governor about any issues each base may be experiencing.
Bases represented were Fort Jackson, a U.S. Army training base in Columbia; Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter; Joint Base Charleston, which includes units from the Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard; and U.S. Coast Guard Base Charleston.
Commanders didn’t travel from Parris Island, a U.S. Marine Corps training base; Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort; Naval Hospital Beaufort; and McEntire Joint National Guard Base in rural Richland County.
“They’re not traveling, but they’re still on duty,” McMaster was quick to say.
“Most importantly, young soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and guardians are working today, not receiving a paycheck,” added state Veterans’ Affairs Secretary Todd McCaffrey. “They continue to stand on the watch, and that’s important to recognize.”
The Congressional Budget Office estimates about 750,000 federal employees are furloughed nationwide since the shutdown began Wednesday.
Both those who continue to work and those who are furloughed will receive back pay when the shutdown ends.
McCaffrey, a retired Army major general, said he went through several shutdowns while in uniform and each one is unique.
When a base’s civilian workforce is not coming to work, there are things those employees do — to include cutting the grass and maintaining facilities — that fall by the wayside.
Despite all this, the shutdown was not a topic of conversation during the briefing.
Instead, military leaders told the governor about struggles their members face finding affordable off-base housing and childcare.
The commanders of Joint Base Charleston talked about the ongoing need for road improvements leading into the base and issues they’ve been having with civilian drones entering the base’s airspace.
The Coast Guard asked state political leaders to advocate for long-term funding to maintain weather buoys off the coast that help predict and track hurricanes.
McMaster laid the blame for the shutdown on U.S. Senate Democrats.
Democrats have refused to vote with Republicans to extend government funding unless the GOP majority agrees to fund expanded health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans argue health care and other issues should be negotiated separately.
Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, the stopgap funding measure is subject to a 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.
More than 100,000 people in SC could lose health insurance if federal help expires

When it comes to other federally-funded benefits, such as food benefits for poor families, women and children, McMaster said there is still money in the system to keep paying those out for now.
“But the longer the shutdown continues, at the insistence of the Democratic leadership, then the more danger there is that those funds will not be available,” McMaster said. “That’s why they got to get back to work, do their job. Just go on in and vote.”
The last federal shutdown, which began in December 2018 during the first Trump presidency, was led by Senate Republicans. The stalemate began after President Donald Trump threatened to veto any funding bill that did not include money for construction of a wall at the nation’s southern border with Mexico.
That shutdown, the longest in history, lasted 35 days.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/military-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 18:58:03.291989

State records indicate Erica Hulsing worked for the Waverly Health Center as a registered nurse from September 2016 through May 11, 2025, when she was fired for allegedly violating patient privacy regulations and rules concerning professional conduct.
The Waverly Health Center alleged that on April 17, 2025, Hulsing received a phone call from a relative of a patient, inquiring about the patient’s stay at the hospital. The patient was 17 years old and had not given the hospital permission to discuss her personal health care information with her family.

The hospital alleged Hulsing informed the family member the girl had been pregnant. The patient did not want her family to know of her condition, and the hospital subsequently fielded complaints from both the patient and her family.
After an investigation, the hospital fired Hulsing, concluding she had communicated highly sensitive private patient information to a person who did not have permission to receive that information. Hulsing allegedly told her employer she had not realized the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 prohibited sharing patient information with unauthorized family members.
Hulsing then filed for unemployment benefits and collected $4,214 before a hearing on her unemployment claim was held. Administrative Law Judge Duane Golden ruled recently that Hulsing was ineligible for benefits due to job-related misconduct and ruled that the $4,214 already paid out must be paid back.

Now, Utah Democratic Party chair Brian King is calling them to drop that way of thinking and to “come home.”
The practice isn’t effective “in the face of extremism and one-party control,” and having Democratic input in Republican spaces isn’t making a substantial difference, King argued in a news release Thursday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We all know many Democrats who register as Republicans to try to mitigate the harshness and extremity of the majority party. I understand the temptation,” King said in a statement. “But I grow more convinced that if that was ever effective, it no longer is. Even relatively moderate and principled Republicans, with few exceptions, end up enabling and facilitating Trump and his allies’ authoritarian efforts.”
What do numbers show?
Republicans hold closed primaries while Democrats allow any voters, regardless of party affiliation, to weigh in their primaries. However, at least during the 2024 statewide primary elections, statistics don’t show widespread “party raiding.”
Most Utahns who changed party affiliation switched to unaffiliated, 2024 election data shows

A total of 26,715 Utah voters changed party affiliations between Jan. 9 and Aug. 8. Of those, 13,234 changed to unaffiliated, about 5,300 switched to Republican and 3,456 to Democrat, according to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson.
The state’s Elections Office indicates that out of 1.7 million active voters, 921,750 are registered Republicans, a 0.9% increase from the registration this time last year, when the office counted 913,176.
The number of active Republican voters in the state went up to 953,373 in November, close to the general election and reached a peak of 958,668 in early December before going back to current levels. 
The number of active registered Democrats in the state went slightly down from 239,584 in September of 2024 to 238,498 this year. But, like in the Republican party, Democrats saw increases in registration numbers around November, reaching a peak of 257,153 people before returning to the latest number.
Republicans welcome the call
King argued that augmenting Republican membership numbers “weakens the (Democratic) party’s legitimacy and strength,” while providing cover to the GOP.
“Republicans point to registration numbers as justification to ignore Utahns who disagree with them,” King said in the release. “It’s time to take that excuse away.”
Strategizing before election, Utah Democrats plead ‘come back home’

In the past, The Utah Democratic Party has also urged those who align with their political views to make their Democratic affiliation official, since bigger numbers could drive larger donations supporting blue candidates in the state.
After King’s call was made public, Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson said he “wholeheartedly” agrees with the push. 
“I think it’s wise for people to lean into the parties that they actually support and want to see successful,” Axson said. “So anybody who cares about the Republican Party and wants to affiliate with us and grow the party, we’d love to have them. We want them there. But, if your only purpose is to undermine a political party, then I’d encourage you to go and build in the party you actually care about.”
Especially, Axson said, since he doesn’t believe Democrats in the state have sufficient numbers to prevent the voices of “real Republicans” from being heard.
“Our party principles and platform are well-represented by our elected officials,” he said.“And so these folks that have come in to try to undermine our process, I think Brian was exactly correct when he says that it has not been effective.” 

Those interested in changing their party affiliation can do it on the Utah Elections Office’s website.

Among Democrats, 87% said they were opposed to partisan gerrymandering while 78% of Republicans said the same. Asked whether the practice should remain legal, 76% said it should not, including 79% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans.

Conducted by Opinion Diagnostics, a Republican-leaning polling firm, and commissioned by voting rights group Common Cause North Carolina, the poll surveyed 671 North Carolina voters from Sept. 15 to Sept. 17. The poll included an even split of Democrats and Republicans, with 210 and 214, respectively, while 247 were unaffiliated or belonged to a third party.
The share of Republicans in North Carolina opposed to gerrymandering is higher than that seen in some national polls — such as an August Reuters/Ipsos poll in which only 46% of Republican respondents agreed redrawing districts to win seats is “bad for democracy,” as opposed to 71% of Democrats.
Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause NC, attributes this to North Carolina’s long history of partisan gerrymandering, which hindered Republican representation for decades before being used to their advantage after the General Assembly flipped in 2010.
“It wasn’t that long ago that Senator Phil Berger, the leader of the Senate, was a champion of reform and put his name on six different meaningful, comprehensive redistricting reform bills,” Phillips said.
Berger did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.
Where voters from the two parties split is whether the current maps in North Carolina are fair. While 72% of Democrats and 65% of unaffiliated or third party voters said they are not confident their current voting maps “were drawn in a fair and transparent way,” only about 45% of Republican voters said they weren’t confident, while 40% said the current maps were fair.
North Carolina’s current congressional map produced a 10-4 Republican majority in 2024, even though Republican candidates won about 53% of the overall congressional vote in the state last year while Democrats received around 43%.
The current map replaced one drawn by court order that yielded a 7-7 split in 2022. A subsequent state Supreme Court decision overturned the ruling that led to the evenly split map.
The new poll comes amid a mid-decade redistricting fight spurred by President Donald Trump, who has urged Republican lawmakers to draw new maps ahead of schedule to help the GOP keep control of Congress in 2026.
“Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing,” Trump wrote in an August Truth Social post calling for 100 more Republican seats. “More seats equals less Crime, a great Economy, and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT.”
In response, Democratic governors have made their own redistricting push in states like Illinois and California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is backing a referendum to overturn the state citizens’ commission’s map in favor a Democratic-leaning one.

That battle could come to North Carolina, where Berger (R-Rockingham) has left the door open to a fourth new map in five years. “If we have to draw one more map this year, we will,” he wrote on X in late September.
Conservative advocacy groups have used the California campaign to help push a new map for North Carolina. A Club for Growth campaign in the state cites “cheating Democrats rigging maps in California” as reason to redraw the state’s congressional districts for maximum advantage.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Gov. Josh Stein called the prospect of another redistricting fight “ridiculous.”
“So every two years is the theory that we’re gonna redistrict, so we can maximize the political advantage to stick it to one party and enhance another party?” Stein said. “We cannot get into this maximalist political power worldview because it will destroy this country.”
He said Newsom’s response is the right one, however. “You can’t have one side that’s willing to abuse the rules to gain power and then the other side say, ‘Oh, we will do the honest, true, and right thing.’”
Voters in the survey said they support a citizens’ redistricting commission by a large majority, taking the map drawing process out of the hands of lawmakers. That proposal received support from 64% of surveyed North Carolinians, while 12% said they oppose it.
Phillips said he hopes the results will cause the General Assembly to reflect before wading into another round of redistricting, particularly given that the poll is from a firm that Republicans often work with.
“This is just something for you to be thinking about, particularly in a moment when you might be trying to rig a new congressional map when, overwhelmingly, people in your party are opposed to such,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2023-congressional-district-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-10-02 18:58:03.291989

(Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Community Colleges for Iowa has released a report arguing that with certain changes and “careful” planning, bringing bachelor’s degree programs to community colleges could help bolster the state workforce and bring more educational access to place-bound Iowans.
However, the state’s private colleges are raising questions about the need for expansion and community colleges themselves have concerns about their capacity and maintaining their mission.
Emily Shields, executive director of Community Colleges for Iowa, said community colleges would need increased state support and local control over what programs within colleges incorporate bachelor’s degrees in order to get the initiative off the ground and make it successful, but it could lead to more Iowans getting an education that they weren’t in the right place or position to pursue before.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“There are many students who are looking for that public university experience and the things that our great regents institutions offer, and we fully anticipate that will continue to happen,” Shields said, “but there are people who aren’t getting a bachelor’s degree now at all because it isn’t accessible to them, either geographically or from an affordability perspective, or just in terms of the delivery and a place where they feel comfortable and can be successful.
“That would be who we’re really trying to serve,” she said.
Studying the potential addition of bachelor’s degrees to community college offerings was prompted by Iowa lawmakers during the last legislative session, with Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, telling community college leaders and the Higher Education Committee he wished to see a feasibility study into the subject.
Building off an interim report released in May, the feasibility study stated more than 200 community colleges in nearly half of U.S. states are offering baccalaureate degrees — 736 degrees in total. States like Florida, Washington and California have shown that there is demand for upper degrees at community colleges, as well as high graduation and employment rates.
Funding, faculty needed for feasibility
In order for community college bachelor’s degree programs to work in Iowa, the report recommended allowing colleges to charge higher tuition for “upper-division courses designated as bachelor’s level courses,” up to 150% of existing tuition rates. It also recommended a $20 million one-time allocation from the state, disbursed over five years as “seed grants” to colleges for launching programs and getting resources ready for facility, faculty and student support needs.
Each program would take around $500,000 to launch, Shields said, so $20 million would go toward the creation of 40 degrees.
Shields said one of the biggest concerns brought forward by community college officials stem from already being stretched thin and already present difficulties in finding faculty, “especially in the most high-demand workforce fields.”
When looking at the feasibility of bringing such an idea to Iowa, Shields said the team working on the report sought to address concerns of having the capacity to expand and keeping with the mission of the community college system to provide “open-access, affordable associate and certificate education,” the study stated.
Bachelor’s degrees offered by community colleges should be “focused on areas of workforce need in our state,” Shields said, in order to keep community colleges on-mission and to help local economies. Included in the recommendations is an ask to allow “locally elected boards of trustees” to decide upon specific programs and their implementation timeline.
“I think how colleges will respond will depend a lot on their local context, and it was really important in our recommendations that maximum decision making is left up to the locally elected boards of trustees, because they really have the best sense of what’s needed in their local region, and that’s what this is about,” Shields said.
If authorized, the study stated success will be measured through graduate employment outcomes and how the bachelor’s degree programs impact state educational, workforce participation and graduate retention goals. If approved in the upcoming legislative session, the report stated new programs would start no earlier than fall 2028.
Gary Steinke, president of the Iowa Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, questioned the need for community colleges to offer four-year degrees, saying there are private universities placed throughout the state that have the capacity for more students, and will educate them “at no cost to the taxpayers.”
“It makes no sense, either from a dollars and cents perspective or from a higher education perspective,” Steinke said.
Keeping competition and collaboration in mind
College officials have expressed both excitement and caution about the potential new degrees, Shields said. Adapting to changes is something the system is used to, such as expanding noncredit and certificate opportunities for students, but concerns linger about both capacity and competition.
Many of Iowa’s community colleges have partnerships with both public and private universities for their students, whether it’s through transfer programs, online learning or other educational opportunities, and Shields said she does not want to see the “ecosystem” of Iowa higher education be disrupted.
“We want to continue working well with our partners in higher education, on transfers and other things, and want to be clear that there’s no desire to start new programs unless there’s a need in a region that isn’t currently being met,” Shields said.
Iowa Board of Regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said the board, which governs Iowa’s public four-year universities, “is currently reviewing the report.”
If community college baccalaureate degree programs are approved by the Legislature and the colleges are able to find the resources and faculty needed to offer them, Steinke said Iowa’s private colleges will “want to have some discussion” about agreements made between them and community colleges, such as the Iowa Private Transfer Collaborative.
Indian Hills Community College President Matt Thompson said during the January committee meeting every community college sees students who wished to remain with the college to finish their education, but there’s no way of knowing if they would actually follow through on that if given the choice.
Shields echoed Thompson’s belief after the report was released, saying many of the students who start their educational career at a community college and thrive there would continue to do so if they could complete their education in the same place.
Iowans are place-bound across the state for a variety of reasons, Shields said, due to their finances, family, career, health and comfort needs or love for their community — and these are the people community colleges are already serving. Many people are also located in “educational deserts,” the report stated, where there are no affordable, public four-year universities nearby, meaning they would have to move to further their education in addition to paying more in tuition.
According to the interim report, 11 community colleges in Iowa operate with no public university within a 30-mile drive, and five colleges have no public or private institutions within that distance.
While bachelor’s degrees at these institutions won’t replace transfer agreements or other programs designed to take a student somewhere else to further their education, Shields said they could offer new opportunities to those who can’t, or don’t want to, end their community college career.
“Every year we have students that … fall in love with their community college that gave them a chance, and I can say that about all 15 of our community colleges in the state,” Thompson said during the meeting.
Shields said she expects to see interest in the report and the possibilities it shows in the upcoming legislative session, as “it demonstrates a compelling case for at least considering” new community college degree programs.
Interest might not lead to passage of legislation on the matter, however.
“It’s certainly going to be a difficult year fiscally, it seems, and lawmakers always have competing priorities that they’re considering, but we do look forward to the conversation and to seeing if this is something that lawmakers agree would benefit Iowa’s … economy,” Shields said.

Three Republican leaders in the House stepped away from ongoing debate to join their Senate colleagues at a news conference, during which they reiterated their complaints about Democratic majority leaders shutting them out of the legislative process and refusing to hear their bills. The Senate adjourned earlier Thursday.

“If we had been invited to the table, this special session might have dealt with emergency situations that are faced in our communities every day by everyday New Mexicans,” said Rep. Alan Martinez (R-Rio Rancho), the House minority whip. 
The Republicans said, in some cases, they only saw bills five minutes in advance of their introduction, and they complained of being left out of pre-session deliberations between Democrats and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham about what would be on the special session agenda. The bills they did introduce did not receive hearings due to the narrow definition of bills germane for the session. 
“We came with solutions. We asked for debate. We were shut down at every turn,” said Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), the minority floor leader.
New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez, asked Wednesday about Republican complaints, said that Republicans “never asked to be involved.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)Pennsylvanians would be required to disclose whether a property they’re selling is in a flood zone and requires flood insurance, under legislation passed unanimously Wednesday in the state House.
Rep. Perry Warren (R-Bucks) introduced House Bill 1704 days after the July 4 flash flood in Kerr County, Texas, that killed at least 135 people, including more than two dozen staff and young campers at a summer camp for girls.
Warren’s Bucks County district was the scene of a 2023 flash flood that inundated a creek valley, sweeping cars from a road and claiming the lives of seven people.
He told the Capital-Star in July that he hopes the legislation will help would-be property owners recognize the risks of property located in flood-prone areas. Flood insurance requires a separate policy from homeowners insurance. Warren noted property owners often realize the policies are separate only after their home is flooded.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the 2023 flood in Upper Makefield Township, Warren and Sen. Steven Santarsiero (D-Bucks) launched the Flood Insurance Premium Assistance Task Force. Gov. Josh Shapiro signed enabling legislation in 2023 to make recommendations about laws and policy to strengthen flood insurance. 
The task force recommended lawmakers introduce bills allowing flood insurance premium deductions from state income taxes, as well as tax credits for homeowner spending on flood mitigation, according to a July 2024 final report. Members also backed requiring earlier disclosures from homesellers about property flood risks and requiring insurance providers include flood risk in their continuing education curricula.
Warren’s flood risk and insurance disclosure legislation now goes to the Senate for consideration. 
On Monday, the House also passed legislation to establish a landslide and sinkhole insurance program within the state Department of Community and Economic Development to provide coverage for properties that may be affected by ground movement.
The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Emily Kinkead (D-Allegheny) said in a memo seeking cosponsors, that changing weather patterns including heavier rainfall and more frequent flooding put property at greater risk from geologic hazards such as landslides. The western part of the state is particularly at-risk because of its numerous steep slopes and valleys.
House Bill 589 would provide insurance for damage caused by such hazards, which may not be covered by standard homeowners insurance policies. Kinkead’s bill will also be considered in the  Senate.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-02 22:09:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal funding for CT energy projects nixed amid shutdown fight,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/02/ct-energy-funding-shutdown/,"The Trump administration is cutting $8 billion that supports climate-related projects across 16 states, including Connecticut.","A dozen federal grants that support energy projects in Connecticut are on the chopping block as the Trump administration cuts more funding in the early days of a government shutdown.
President Donald Trump has warned that his administration could wield executive power to make a shutdown painful for Democrats and “[cut] things that they like.” And he’s appearing to quickly follow through on that threat in mostly blue states — and Connecticut is among the targets.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Thursday it’s terminating nearly $8 billion that supports hundreds of clean energy and other climate-related projects across 16 states, including Connecticut. After reviewing all financial awards, the agency decided they “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.”
The Department of Energy has yet to publicly provide a state breakdown of each affected project, and it didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the specific funding cuts in Connecticut. 
The Energy Department did provide information to U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s office on Thursday, but the Connecticut Democrat is still trying to track down the exact projects and funding amounts that will now dry up.
“I am demanding more information and specifics into this threatened cut for climate change projects, which are essential for Connecticut,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “We will not be bullied by this destructive and illegal withholding of critical support.”
The funding awarded to Connecticut came from two offices at DOE: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Fossil Energy. Between the eight recipients, they were expected to receive nearly $53 million for various projects, according to House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro.
RTX Corporation, Mott Corporation, Proton Energy Systems Inc., Linde Inc., Calcify Inc., Karpman Consulting LLC, the University of Connecticut and FuelCell Energy were awarded contracts. But the exact amount each will lose is unclear because some projects have been in the works for years and already received parts of the funding.
Some of the projects include funding for a Carbon Capture Machine, the development of a hydrogen refueling station for heavy-duty trucks, and the design of “coated titanium porous transport layers (PTLs) used for water electrolysis.”
At least one recipient doesn’t expect the termination to have much of an effect.
FuelCell Energy, which is headquartered in Danbury, has been working on performance improvements for fuel cell systems for several years. And because that effort has wrapped up, the company anticipates receiving the rest of the money from DOE, which it has worked with since the 1970s on various research projects.
“This particular project has been underway for nearly five years and is now at its conclusion. We have already received the majority of the contract compensation and expect the small remaining balance to be honored, as the work has been fully completed,” FuelCell Energy spokesperson Kathleen Blomquist said in a statement.
The initial news of cuts a day earlier sparked a wave of confusion since there was little information. The state’s congressional delegation was frustrated that the White House would try to “bully” them during the ongoing funding standoff.
About a quarter of the projects under fire were awarded during the final months of the Biden administration, following the November elections, according to DOE. Others date back from years earlier. The Energy Department said the award recipients have 30 days to file an appeal.
Hours into the shutdown, White House Budget Director Russ Vought started posting on social media the various projects and funding that would go away. He first posted that New York City would lose about $18 billion in infrastructure projects, specifically naming the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue subway.
A few hours later, he announced the $8 billion in climate funding cuts. Every state target by those cuts voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, and almost all are led by Democratic governors. They are also represented by Democratic U.S. senators who opposed the GOP funding bill.
“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Today’s cancellation’s delivers on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”
Connecticut officials and lawmakers have received little, if any, information from federal agencies.
James Fowler, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said earlier Thursday that the agency has not received any notice from federal authorities about which projects will be affected by the decision.
“We’re working with what resources we have to figure [it] out,” he said.
Funding awarded to utilities in Connecticut appear unscathed. A spokesperson for Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, confirmed that none of its projects have been affected by the cuts.
While the loss of funding will have real-life consequences in Connecticut, the underlying motives feel political to Democrats. Connecticut’s congressional delegation argues the administration is holding up Democratic priorities like clean energy as “partisan extortion.”
“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment and eliminate jobs,” DeLauro said. “It is reckless and betrays both common sense and public trust.”
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, also raised concerns about the potential for layoffs and higher energy costs.
“Connecticut residents are already dealing with the rising cost of living and cannot afford increasing energy bills,” Hayes said in a statement.
Since taking office, Trump has made federal funding cuts a centerpiece of his second administration, saying he wants to cut waste, fraud and abuse. But some of the initial cuts led to confusion and chaos earlier this year when he temporarily paused all federal grants. The administration has lifted freezes on certain funds.
But the issue has again gripped Washington, and the finger-pointing over the shutdown has only intensified in recent days.
The parties couldn’t agree to a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, that would keep government agencies running at current levels.
“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said Tuesday. “And you know all you all know Russell Vought. He’s become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn’t do any other way. So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.”
But the latest maneuver could have the opposite effect as Democrats dig in further over the energy funding cuts.
“Just naked and brazen corruption,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Time to stiffen our spines and demand that we only fund a government that obeys the law.”

Kelda Roys (D-Madison) is proposing that Wisconsin exile practices in the ticket selling industry that disadvantage fans trying to attend shows and events.
The bill “Stop Wildly Inflated Fees and Ticketing Industry Exploitation” — yes, that really is SWIFTIE for short — would require sellers to disclose the total cost of ticket prices to potential buyers, put a cap on how much resellers can charge for tickets and prohibit ticket-buying bots that resellers use. Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) and Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse) are also coauthors on the bill.
The bill comes ahead of Swift releasing her 12th studio album — titled “The Life of a Showgirl” — on Friday.
Many states and lawmakers, including some of Wisconsin’s neighbors, started taking an interest in new laws to help regulate the live event ticket marketplace after Ticketmaster crashed during the initial sale of tickets to Swift’s The Eras Tour. Many of the mega pop star’s huge and dedicated fan base were down bad as secondary ticket prices for her tour soared, with some individual ticket prices rising to even more than $4,000.
The Michigan House passed a proposal in June that would curb bots for hoarding concert and event tickets. The Minnesota state government enacted legislation to help protect online ticket buyers in 2024.
“My daughters and I are Swifties. I would’ve loved to have taken them to see Taylor Swift live on the Eras Tour, but instead we saw the movie,” Roys said in a video with Style (Taylor’s Version) playing in the background and clips from the tour flashing on screen. “I didn’t even try to get tickets because I had heard the horror stories from so many friends of mine. This is not how it’s supposed to be. Live events should be for fans, not for profiteers.”
Roys is also seeking the Democratic nomination in the 2026 election for Wisconsin governor.
Several provisions in the bill seek to prevent fans from encountering a ticket hoax by barring resellers from listing tickets for resale before tickets have been put on sale, from putting tickets on sale if they don’t already own them and by capping secondary ticket sales, prohibiting a fee from exceeding 10% of the ticket’s initial price.
The bill also includes a provision to ensure ticket buyers can feel fearless when they make a purchase on the secondary market. Under it, resellers would be required to issue a full refund within 10 days of a request to a purchaser if a ticket is counterfeit, the event is canceled, the ticket doesn’t fit the description provided or the date or time of the event is moved. 
Bots — devices or software that get around security measures or access control systems on a ticket selling platform to bypass purchasing limits — would also be prohibited under the bill from purchasing more than eight tickets for one event and circumventing the ticket queue, presale codes or waiting periods when a sale is going on. 
“If you’re a fan, you deserve the chance to go see your favorite artist without being exploited by unscrupulous scalpers, by third-party bot farms that drive up prices and other practices that exploit fans and venues and artists,” Roys said. “All of us deserve to come together and share these wonderful live events without these kinds of consumer protection violations.” 
Under the bill, violators would be subject to civil forfeitures of at least $15,000 for each day the violation occurs; $1,000 per ticket listed, advertised, sold or resold in violation of the provisions;  and an amount equal to five times the total price of each ticket. 
A person could also be subject to a civil forfeiture of at least $10,000 per ticket listed, advertised, sold or resold in violation of the provisions.

(Photo by Brandon O'Connor/NRCS)A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in a commercial turkey flock in Calhoun County according to a Thursday news release from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.
This is the first detection of the H5N1 bird flu in Iowa since April, but the eighth detection in Iowa flocks in 2025.
The detection was confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, which despite the government shutdown is permitted to continue work pertaining to HPAI.

According to IDALS, there were about 42,000 birds in the affected commercial turkey flock. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for the county, extending through Nov. 1. The proclamation makes state resources available to IDALS and other agencies as they monitor, contain, detect and dispose of birds exposed to the virus. 
Nearby states, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported outbreaks of HPAI in September, according to the APHIS database. 
HPAI continues to be a threat to poultry farmers, and since the current outbreak began in February 2022, more than 178 million birds have been impacted. 
IDALS urged poultry producers to bolster biosecurity efforts at their commercial and backyard operations. Producers should also contact their veterinarians immediately if they suspect birds are infected with the virus. Common symptoms include lethargy, decreased egg production, thin or soft shelled eggs, swelling of the head, comb or wattle, difficulty breathing, coughing and diarrhea. 
Egg and poultry products remain safe to eat, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The CDC also recommends avoiding contact with sick or dead birds if possible. Some cases of HPAI in humans have been reported over the span of the outbreak, though the affected individuals had come into direct contact with sick birds. The current public health risk of the H5N1 bird flu is low, according to the CDC.

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)The Iowa Dental Board has recently sanctioned several Iowa dentists who have previously been accused of professional incompetence, fraud and sexual misconduct involving a patient.
One of the cases involves Justin Hillock, a former Iowa dentist who in 2018 was acquitted of criminal charges of sexual abuse, and who was previously sanctioned for having sex with a patient. Hillock is seeking to have his Iowa dentist’s license reinstated.
Board records show that in 2009, while practicing dentistry in Coon Rapids, Hillock was charged by the board with making advances or suggestive, lewd, lascivious or improper remarks to several patients and co-workers, and with having sexual contact with a patient.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board agreed to let Hillock continue practicing while the disciplinary charges were pending on the condition that a chaperone be present when Hillock is treating female patients. One month later, the board placed Hillock’s license on probation.
In 2013, with Hillock’s license still on probation, the licensing board agreed to modify the terms of the probation to remove the requirement that he have his female patients complete a board-approved patient satisfaction survey.
In 2017, with his license on probation, Hillock was, according to the board, working at Guthrie Center Family Dentistry when he was criminally charged with third-degree sexual abuse and indecent contact with a child. At the time, Hillock agreed to halt his practice of dentistry, with his license being placed on “suspended” status.
While there is no longer any public court record of the criminal case at Iowa Courts Online, news reports from the time indicate Hillock was eventually acquitted of the charges. Police had alleged he sexually assaulted a 13-year-old child between September 2015 and February 2016.
In March of this year, Hillock applied for reinstatement of his suspended dentist’s license. At the same time, his attorneys in the criminal case sued Hillock for nonpayment of attorney fees, eventually winning summary judgment.
In July, the Iowa Dental Board issued a preliminary notice indicating its intent to deny Hillock’s application for reinstatement of his license.
In August, Hillock appealed that decision, and last month the board agreed to schedule a hearing on the matter on Nov. 6, 2025.
Other dentists recently sanctioned by the Iowa Dental Board include:
— Paymum Bayati, who last December applied for reinstatement of his suspended license. In July, the Iowa Dental Board issued a preliminary notice indicating its intent to deny Bayati’s application. Bayati appealed that decision and last month, the board agreed to hold a hearing on the matter on Nov. 6, 2025.
In 2022, the Iowa Dental Board entered into a settlement agreement with Bayati, who agreed to have his license restricted in a manner that prohibited him from providing dental implants for patients. The board had charged Bayati with failing to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency with regard to implants while practicing dentistry in Waterloo.
In 2023, the board charged Bayati with practicing dentistry in a manner that was harmful or detrimental to the public and with violating regulations related to the practice of dentistry. The board alleged Bayati posed an “imminent threat” the public and suspended his license on an emergency basis.
In April 2024, Bayati surrendered his license and was tried and convicted of the misdemeanor offense of public intoxication for his actions in connection with the 2024 disciplinary case.
Police records show that on Dec. 7, 2023, an Anamosa police officer was dispatched to the Anamosa State Penitentiary in reference to an impaired person who was trying to drive away from the prison. The officer reported arriving at the prison and meeting with the warden, the deputy warden and Bayati, who was the prison dentist at that time.
The police officer reported Bayati appeared intoxicated and “smelled heavily” of alcohol. Bayati then submitted to a test that allegedly indicated a blood-alcohol level of 0.158 – almost twice the legal limit for driving.
Bayati told the Iowa Capital Dispatch last year that he doesn’t drink and believed someone, probably his dental assistant, tampered with his cup of coffee by pouring isopropyl alcohol into it after he arrived at the prison that morning.
— Tyler Villiard of Carlisle, who was charged with failing to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry. The board alleged Villiard failed to properly detect, diagnose and treat tooth decay lesions shown on multiple patients’ radiographs, and that he failed to meet the standard of care and competency for the detection and diagnosis of tooth decay. To resolve the matter, Villiard has agreed to complete a comprehensive remedial education program and submit to one year of board monitoring.
— Alison Dawn Shields of Harlan, who has been charged by the board with failing to protect patients by assigning to qualified personnel only those duties that can be legally delegated; fraud in representation as to skill or ability; knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of dentistry; practicing beyond the level of training, and delegating any acts to a licensee that are beyond that individual’s training or education. The board has not disclosed how or when the alleged violations occurred. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Nov. 21, 2025.
— Jocelyn Riley, a registered dental hygienist from Harlan. In what may be a case related to that of Alison Dawn Shields based on the date it was filed, location and other details, the board has charged Riley with fraud in representation as to skill or ability; knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of dentistry; and practicing beyond her training. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 30, 2025.
— Masih Safabakhsh of Gentle Dental in Cedar Rapids has agreed to surrender his license after being charged with failing to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry and with indiscriminately or promiscuously prescribing or administering drugs. The board had alleged Safabakhsh performed a root canal and crown services for teeth that did not need care, while performing no treatment for teeth that needed care. The board also alleged he “routinely prescribed antibiotics unnecessarily.”
In December 2011, the board charged Safabakhsh with gross malpractice and issued an emergency restricting his practice, alleging that he had used a cutting or grinding device on multiple patients to “excessively” separate patients’ teeth to facilitate his placement of orthodontic bands in the patients’ mouths. “Due to this, these teeth were severely and irreversibly damaged,” the board alleged.
The emergency order barred Safabakhsh from continuing to engage in orthodontics for new patients, citing an “immediate danger to the public.” In January 2012, Safabakhsh consented to an order permanently restricting him from using a cutting or grinding device to separate patients’ teeth for placement of orthodontic bands. He also agreed to a $7,500 fine.
Six months later, in July 2012, Safabakhsh was subjected to another emergency order from the board. This time, the board’s order immediately suspended his license to practice dentistry of any kind.
At that time, the board alleged it had received a complaint from multiple employees at Safabakhsh’s dental office regarding a patient who had a medical emergency after being administered 16 cartridges of a local anesthetic and had to be transported to a hospital by ambulance. A board consultant alleged that 16 cartridges of Carbocaine anesthetic was three times the manufacturer-specified maximum dosage — although Safabakhsh’s staff allegedly said patients were regularly administered between 10 to 16 cartridges.
The board alleged that after the incident, Safabakhsh’s staff was told in writing that an ambulance was not to be called by anyone unless requested by a doctor or patient. Safabakhsh was also accused of performing substandard work related to a root canal on one patient and a tooth restoration on another patient.
A board consultant also concluded that on multiple occasions, Safabakhsh billed for services that were not performed or not documented in patient records.
The board eventually fined Safabakhsh $10,000. In August 2014, after Safabakhsh underwent remedial training, the board reinstated his license subject to several conditions and an indefinite period of probation. In April 2022, the board reinstated Safabakhsh’s license free and clear of any restrictions and terminated his probation.

(Photo via Google Earth)A group of Iowa historians, professors, archivists and donors are challenging the State Historical Society of Iowa in court for its decision to close its library and archives in Iowa City.
The lawsuit, filed in late September in Johnson County District Court, is in response to the June announcement that the state would close the State Historical Society of Iowa Research Center June 30, 2026, beginning with changes in operations and hours July 9. The petition for judicial review argues the move is in violation of state law, which explicitly requires the Iowa state government to maintain research centers in both Des Moines and Iowa City.
“Yet, without public input or a clear plan, state officials have begun dismantling the Iowa City archive, laying off staff, and removing collections—many of which were donated under the condition that they remain accessible in Iowa City,” the lawsuit states.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Following the June announcement of the SHSI Iowa City facility closure, there has been significant pushback among historians and advocates who have said the decision was made without public input, including from the SHSI Board of Trustees. When former Department of Administrative Services director Adam Steen was asked by a trustee about why the board was not given the chance to provide feedback on the action in a June meeting, Steen replied, “this may sound cold, but nothing technically requires that,” according to Iowa Public Radio.
A petition opposing the closure, led by Mary Bennett, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit who worked at the Iowa City research center for 49 years, has gathered more than 7,000 signatures.
But public officials have said the research facility’s closure is a necessary step as the state historical society faces a $800,000 budget shortfall.
The defendants in the case include the state historical society, the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, Steen, State Historical Society of Iowa Administrator Valerie Van Kooten and State Archivist Tony Jahn. Control of SHSI was moved under the Department of Administrative Services in 2023 through the agency restructuring package led by Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 17 litigants, including historian Linda Kerber, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama to serve on a committee documenting the history of the U.S. Supreme Court; University of Iowa Archivist David McCartney, and author R. Tripp Evans. The group called for the court to immediately issue a temporary injunction preventing documents and artifacts from being removed from the Iowa City facility, and for any of these historical objects that have been removed in preparation for the closure to be returned.
While state officials have said the historical artifacts and documents will be moved to the Des Moines SHSI facility, the lawsuit said the move should not be allowed as the State Historical Building in Des Moines has $72 million in deferred maintenance projects, and “lacks sufficient climate-controlled space to house the Iowa City collections.” At a June board meeting, Jahn, the state archivist, said only 40% of the Iowa City collection would be moved to Des Moines, and the remaining 60% would be privatized, divided up or discarded.
The hearing for a temporary injunction is scheduled for Oct. 14. The petitioners are also seeking to permanently block the closure of the research center.

,DC,2025-10-02 21:50:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,How the federal shutdown is playing out across the government,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/how-federal-shutdown-playing-out-across-government,,"WASHINGTON — The first federal government shutdown in seven years has left hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed and members of the public struggling to understand what’s open, what’s closed and what might be delayed.States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau scoured agency plans published by the Trump administration and the courts, and produced this guide to help you understand what’s going on:Agriculture Department The USDA plans to furlough about half, 42,300, of its nearly 86,000 employees, though workers at several programs for farm communities and rural areas will keep working without pay.Operations will continue on some farm loans, certain natural resource and conservation programs, essential food safety operations related to public health and wildland firefighting activities. Agriculture Department employees working on animal and plant health emergency programs — including African swine fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, exotic fruit flies, new world screwworm and rabies — are exempt from furloughs.  But dozens of USDA programs addressing everything from disaster assistance processing to trade negotiations to long-term research on animal diseases will cease until Congress reaches a funding deal. Employees working on those programs will be furloughed until the government is once again funded, but both working and non-working federal employees in all agencies are required to receive back pay under the law. Agencies housed within the USDA have varying levels of furloughs. The Food and Nutrition Service, Office of the Inspector General and Natural Resources Conservation Service are among those with higher numbers of furloughed workers.Commerce DepartmentThe Department of Commerce will retain just over 19% of its nearly 43,000 employees during the shutdown, and most will have to stay on without pay, as outlined in its government funding lapse plan. The department oversees a wide range of federal government activities — weather forecasting, issuing patents and trademarks, regulating fisheries, enforcing export laws, managing government-owned and -controlled spectrum frequencies, and collecting demographics and other population data.Notably, the department houses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and will continue providing “weather, water and climate observations, prediction, forecasting, warning and related support.” But research activities will largely stop.The U.S. Census Bureau, also part of the department, will cease most operations, including providing monthly economic indicators and updated data about disaster-impacted areas. Certain preparations for the 2030 Census will stop, as will any data collection for the American Community Survey.Funding outside of annual appropriations may keep some U.S. Patent and Trademark Office units open, but the timelines will be variable, according to the department. When funding runs out, the office will continue “a bare minimum set of activities necessary to protect against the actual loss of intellectual property (IP) rights.”Defense Department The Defense Department’s contingency plan calls for the nearly 2.1 million military personnel to keep working as normal and says 406,500 of its roughly 741,000 civilian employees will work without pay, while the others will be furloughed.  The plan says the Defense Department believes operations to secure the U.S. southern border, Middle East operations, Golden Dome for America defense system, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions are the “highest priorities” in the event of a shutdown. Medical and dental services, including private sector care under the TRICARE health care program, would largely continue at the Defense Department, though “(e)lective surgery and other routine/elective procedures in DoW medical and dental facilities are generally not excepted activities, unless the deferral or delay of such procedures would impact personnel readiness or deployability.”Education Department The Department of Education said it would furlough roughly 95% of employees outside its federal student aid unit. The agency will continue disbursing Federal Direct Loans as well as Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college. Borrowers still have to make payments toward their student loan debt during the shutdown. Title I and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, grant funding would continue to be available as usual, according to the department. Title I provides funding for low-income school districts, while IDEA guarantees a free public education for students with disabilities. But the agency is ceasing several operations, including any new grantmaking activities. Still, the department said the majority of its grant programs “typically make awards over the summer and therefore there would be limited impact on the Department’s grantmaking.”The agency’s Office for Civil Rights also has to pause investigations of any civil rights complaints. Energy Department The Energy Department will furlough a little over 8,100 of its 13,800 federal workers – nearly 60% of its workforce, according to its contingency plan. The National Nuclear Security Administration would continue maintenance and safeguarding of nuclear weapons. Some programs, like the medical isotope program, will require DOE to “produce additional isotopes in order to protect human life.” “The need to do this will depend on the length of the lapse and the stockpile of individual isotopes,” according to DOE. Certain programs are self-funded, such as the Bonneville Power Administration, which provides hydropower in the Columbia River Basin of the Pacific Northwest.Environmental Protection Agency EPA, according to its contingency plan, will have the biggest percentage of federal employees furloughed. Nearly 90% of its workforce, or 13,400 out of 15,000, will be furloughed. Only agency activities that revolve around protecting human life, such as monitoring some Superfund sites and responding to emergency environmental disasters, will continue. Some EPA functions that will halt include issuing of new grants, publishing new research, pausing of cleanup of Superfund sites that don’t pose an imminent threat to human life, enforcement inspections and issuing of permits.Health and Human Services Department The department, one of the larger ones within the executive branch that houses many of the country’s best-known public health agencies, has furloughed about 32,500 of its nearly 80,000 employees, according to its contingency plan.Many of HHS’ activities fall under the life and property or even the national security exceptions during a funding lapse, though dozens of programs will still be affected.HHS officials plan to ensure “minimal readiness” at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response for “all hazards, including pandemic flu and hurricane responses.”Certain employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will keep working, albeit without pay, to monitor for any disease outbreaks. But the contingency plan says the CDC’s “communication to the American public about health-related information will be hampered.”The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to keep 3,300, or about 53%, of its employees during the shutdown in order to keep running core programs.Since many of the country’s major health care programs are funded outside of the annual government funding process, they shouldn't be affected by the shutdown, even though the employees who run the programs often rely on full-year or stopgap spending bills for their salaries.CMS’ contingency plan says “the Medicare Program will continue during a lapse in appropriations” and that it has “sufficient funding for Medicaid to fund the first quarter of FY 2026,” which includes October, November and December.  Additionally, it “will maintain the staff necessary to make payments to eligible states for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).”Department of Housing and Urban Development The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s website opens with a message that reads: “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.”The department says the majority of its annual grant programs, including those that provide for emergency housing for people experiencing homelessness and people living with HIV/AIDS, “continue to operate in States and local communities across the country when such grant funding has already been obligated.” The agency also said many of its programs “addressing imminent threats to the health and welfare of HUD tenants and children will continue where such grant funding has already been obligated before the lapse occurs.”  For as long as the funding remains available, “monthly subsidy programs such as the public housing operating subsidies, housing choice voucher subsidies, and multifamily assistance contracts will continue to operate,” according to the department.  However, the agency said nearly all of its “fair housing activities” will halt during the shutdown. Internal Revenue Service The Internal Revenue Service will continue normal operations using supplemental funding enacted under the Democrats’ 2022 budget reconciliation law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act.The IRS will retain its 74,299 employees, according to the latest available shutdown contingency plan. The Trump administration has shrunk the IRS significantly this year, down from its roughly 95,000 employees, and has turned over the agency’s top leadership six times.The agency processes about 180 million income tax returns each year.The body that independently oversees the IRS will not operate at full capacity during the shutdown. Only 40% of employees in the department’s Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will remain on, with a small fraction required to stay without pay if necessary, according to the agency’s plan.As of Thursday afternoon Eastern time, the home page for that agency, tigta.gov, was blank except for the message “Due to a lack of apportionment of funds, this website is currently unavailable.”Interior DepartmentA little more than half of the federal workforce for the Interior Department will be furloughed – 31,000 out of 58,600 employees – according to its contingency plan.Some services within the agency will continue, such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ wildland fire management, but programs that provide social services to foster children and residential adults will pause.As for national parks, the trails, open memorials and overlooks will generally remain open. The National Park Service will retain minimal staff to allow for visitors. But general maintenance, trash pick-up and educational programs, will cease during the shutdown. Hunters or people seeking access to public lands will not be able to have their permits processed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services. Justice DepartmentThe Justice Department will keep a majority of its federal workers during the shutdown, according to its contingency plan. Out of roughly 110,000 employees, nearly 13,000 will be furloughed. Because the judicial branch will continue to function, the Justice Department will retain most of its attorneys for criminal and civil litigation. Federal law enforcement agencies and their agents will continue to work, such as the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A shutdown typically means that immigration cases would be rescheduled and courts not located in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center will be shut down. But the Trump administration has prioritized the Executive Office for Immigration Review, housed within the Department of Justice, as essential. The contingency plan points to the president’s national emergency, “citing the threat to the national security and economy of the United States caused by illegal migration.”Labor Department More than 75% of the Department of Labor’s employees will be furloughed, according to the agency’s contingency plan. Several units will come to a halt, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Veterans’ Employment and Training Service, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Office of Disability Employment Policy, Women’s Bureau, Office of Administrative Law Judges, Administrative Review Board, and Benefits Review Board, as well as the Employees’ Compensation Appeals Board.The agency said it will continue to support states and other agencies when it comes to administering and paying unemployment insurance benefits. The department notes that “unless excepted or exempt, agencies’ technical assistance, compliance assistance, regulatory, policy, research, advisories, responding to inquiries, most oversight, hearing preparation, and cooperative activities will cease.”Job Corps centers that house students “will remain in operation while funds remain available,” and “federal oversight of those centers related to safety and property will continue,” per the department. Homeland Security Department Homeland Security will retain most of its workforce without pay. About 14,000 employees will be furloughed among its nearly 272,000 workforce, according to its contingency plan. That means ports of entry will remain open for inspections from Customs and Border Protection, but there could be delays in paperwork at U.S. borders. Most federal workers responsible for security at airports across the country – more than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration employees – would be required to work without pay. Another agency within DHS that will remain most of its workforce is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. About 21,000 employees out of 24,000 will continue to work. The office involved in departmental oversight, the Office of Inspector General, will pause its work on reports and investigations. And the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown will continue, with nearly all employees from Immigration and Customs Enforcement considered non-exempt, about 19,600 out of 21,000.Several agencies within the Department of Homeland Security will remain running because they are fee-based, such as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Some visa programs within USCIS are tied to appropriations funding, so those programs will be suspended. That includes E-Verify, which verifies immigration status; visas for foreign doctors; and visas for non-minister religious workers. State Department A little more than half the employees in the State Department will be furloughed, about 16,600 out of its nearly 27,000-employee workforce, according to its contingency plan.Because visa and passport services are fee-funded, they will likely not be impacted. Consular operations will be affected and diplomatic visas will only be issued in “life or death” emergencies.Social Security Administration The program for America’s seniors and some people with disabilities is largely funded outside of the annual government spending process, which makes it mostly exempt from shutdowns. One big caveat is that the federal workers who administer the program are paid through one of the 12 congressional appropriations bills, which can cause issues during a funding lapse. SSA’s contingency plan says it will furlough about 6,200 of its nearly 52,000 employees until the government is fully operational again. The agency plans to continue “accurate and timely payment of benefits” as well as taking applications, requests for appeal, issuing and replacing Social Security cards and fraud prevention activities, among others. The SSA during the lapse will not conduct certain activities, including benefits verification, replacement of Medicare cards, or addressing overpayments processing during the funding lapse. Transportation DepartmentSlightly more than 11,000 of the department’s nearly 45,000 employees will be furloughed for the remainder of the government shutdown, but its leaders plan to keep several activities essential for the traveling public going during a shutdown, according to its contingency plan.Air traffic control services and hiring, hazardous materials safety inspections, airport inspections and much more will continue, though many activities will cease. Some agencies within the Transportation Department will see little impact on their staffing, even though workers will not be paid until the shutdown ends. For example, no one at the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, or the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation will be furloughed. Treasury Department The department has individual contingency plans for its various components, including departmental offices, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of the Inspector General and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.Treasury officials expect to keep about 1,850 of its more than 2,700 employees working in the departmental offices without pay during the shutdown, in part to ""support the president"" with ""market and economic updates, economic policy options and recommendations, including those related to national security incidents.""The Office of Inspector General, which oversees officials’ actions for waste, fraud and abuse, will keep about 30 of its roughly 150 employees working throughout the shutdown and furlough the rest. Department of Veterans AffairsLarge parts of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the processing and payout of benefits, are funded outside of the annual appropriations process and will continue through the shutdown.The department projects 97% of its staff will continue to work, and most will be paid, according to its latest publicly available shutdown contingency plan. Health care will continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics, and vets will still receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing.Veterans suicide prevention and homelessness programs will remain in operation, and the Veterans Crisis Line will continue to answer calls. The crisis line can be reached by dialing 988 followed by pressing 1, or by texting 838255.The MyVA411 and PACT Act call centers will operate “as necessary to prevent disruption to mandatory VA benefit programs,” according to the department’s guide.The National Cemetery Administration will continue to inter veterans and eligible family members, as well as schedule burials, determine eligibility and process headstone applications. However, headstone and marker installation and groundskeeping will cease, and the application assistance unit call center will be closed.All Transition Assistance Programs, including career and financial counseling, are suspended, and the GI Bill hotline is not taking calls. The department’s whistleblower program is also not accepting or investigating complaints. Executive Office of the PresidentThe first Trump administration posted a contingency plan in March 2018, though it doesn’t appear there is a current one and the White House did not respond to a request from States Newsroom about how it's implementing the shutdown. The earlier three-page plan said the president planned to place “1068 of the 1759 EOP staff in furlough status (""Non-Excepted Staff'), while an estimated 691 EOP staff would continue to report to duty.”President Donald Trump continues to be paid during a shutdown, as are members of Congress, under the law.Judicial branch The Supreme Court will remain functioning during the shutdown, as well as the federal courts. By using court fees, the judiciary branch can continue with paid operations until Oct. 17, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Most proceedings and deadlines set in cases will continue, but if Department of Justice attorneys representing the executive branch are furloughed, then those cases will be rescheduled. Supreme Court judges and federal judges will continue to be paid due to Article III of the U.S. Constitution that specifies judge’s compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.",,,,2025-10-02 17:58:37.057036

The percentage of students with disabilities in Vermont’s education system is on the rise, while many school districts lack the capacity to meet their needs, according to a new report released this week by the state Agency of Education.
While overall student enrollment in Vermont’s schools has decreased, the number of students on individualized education programs, or IEPs, has increased at a rate outpacing the nation since the 2019-20 school year, the report said. 
The analysis presented in the report paints “a complex picture of special education in Vermont,” the report reads. Students with IEPs in Vermont are spending more of their time in regular classroom settings — a positive finding in the report, experts said.
But at the same time, school districts in Vermont are sending more students with IEPs to out-of-district schools at a rate more than double the national average. Meanwhile, the gap in four-year high school graduation rates between students with and without IEPs increased to 19 percentage points in 2024.
The rise in students with disabilities is, in part, due to increases in the number of students diagnosed with autism since 2019, according to the report. Students who are labeled as having emotional disturbances are also a “key driver” in the increase “due to its higher-than-average prevalence in Vermont.”
The report noted that more students are also now qualifying for the state’s extraordinary cost reimbursement, a program that provides financial assistance to districts and supervisory unions who serve students with disabilities that are more expensive to address.
This, the report said, indicates “not only that more students are being identified, but that the intensity and complexity of their needs could be increasing.”
Many school districts, the report said, “lack the in-house capacity, staffing, and specialized resources to respond effectively.” This is adding financial pressures on to the state’s education system, particularly in tuition to speciality schools and transportation to those institutions.
This week’s report was issued in response to a requirement in Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill signed into law in July. It is the first step toward creating a three-year special education strategic plan as part of the state’s education overhaul, which includes new school district maps and a new education finance formula. 
Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders said the strategic plan will include advice from national experts on how to build state-level capacity to support schools and give them the tools and guidance to support their students.
“Analyzing the data alongside the lived experience of local communities and schools sharpened our understanding of existing gaps and helped illuminate a path forward,” Saunders said in a press release.

While the cause of the increase in students with IEPs is not entirely clear, the report suggested the Covid-19 pandemic has likely contributed to the rise in emotional and behavioral challenges among students and influenced special education classification numbers both in Vermont and nationwide.
Another contributing factor to the rise in students with disabilities could be the state’s “comprehensive and proactive approach to mental health and special education,” the report said.
Vermont’s policies may be more apt to identify students with emotional and behavioral challenges earlier than other states, “potentially leading to a higher classification rate,” according to the report.
“The state’s relatively small school and district sizes and a high number of staff per student may also play a role,” the report read. “These conditions can allow for closer observation and more frequent identification of emotional needs, which might go unnoticed in larger, more populous school systems.”

Cassie Santo, the director of special education with the Agency of Education, said in the agency’s press release that the report “underscores Vermont’s deep commitment to inclusive learning environments for students with disabilities while also revealing an urgent need to strengthen the system of support for all learners.”
“The data and feedback from the field confirms that inclusion alone is not enough,” Santo said. “To create belonging for all learners, we must improve the quality of instruction and build a stronger, more connected system that better supports all students.”
There are some positives to take away from the report, experts said. Vermont has a higher rate, compared to the national average, of students with IEPs who spend most of their school day in a regular classroom —  81.97% of students with IEPs in Vermont spend 80% or more of their day in a regular classroom, compared to 67.08% of students with IEPs nationally.
That shows Vermont is leading the nation in inclusive practices, Chelsea Myers and Mary Lundeen, the leaders of the Vermont Superintendents Association and the Vermont Council of Special Education Administrators, said in a press release from those organizations.

However, they noted, when students cannot be included at the classroom level, “they are disproportionately placed in separate schools, at more than double the national rate.” According to the report, 5.27% of students with IEPs in Vermont are in separate schools, compared to 2.36% of students with IEPs nationally.
“This ‘all-or-nothing’ approach reflects gaps in the continuum of supports within public schools,” they said in a press release.
Outcomes for students with IEPs, meanwhile, are lagging. 
The percentage of Vermont students with IEPs who graduated high school in four years had remained steady since 2019 — hovering around 70% — but declined in 2024 to 67%, according to the report. The graduation rate in 2024 for students without IEPs was 86%.
Lundeen and Myers, in their press release, pointed to staffing shortages and the reduction of designated mental health services as fueling the pressures on the special education system. Out-of-district placement tuition rates, meanwhile, continue to rise with little oversight.
“These dynamics — strained local capacity and rising out-of-district tuition costs — paint a fuller picture of Vermont’s cost pressures,” the associations said. “It is a mistake to view special education as the problem, rather than looking systemically at the conditions that drive these expenditures.”
A forthcoming special education report queued up for December will make recommendations around changes to how special education services are funded, the Agency of Education said in a release.

D’Angelo receives services in his home under a Medicaid program for disabled adults. That program is receiving 8% less money as of Oct. 1. 
“They were kind of shocked,” said D’Angelo, who is chairman of the NC Council on Developmental Disabilities. “With most jobs the pay goes the other way, not down.”
The state Department of Health and Human Services instituted cuts to Medicaid insurance rates this month, meaning that health care providers will receive less money for caring for the 3.1 million North Carolinians who depend on the program to pay for doctors, dentists, hospitalizations, community care, and nursing home stays. 
The rate cuts range from 3% to 10%. 
The legislature did not allocate enough money to keep Medicaid rates stable, Gov. Josh Stein has said. The state Department of Health and Human Services announced in August that the cuts were coming unless the legislature approved an increase. The stopgap budget the legislature approved in July was $319 million short of what Medicaid needed to cover its costs, Stein’s administration said. 
Republicans in the state House and Senate were not able to agree last week on a measure that would provide more money. Their dispute is over the unrelated issue of a children’s hospital planned for Apex. 
Workers learning of pay cuts may be the earliest jolt to a health insurance program that, in fiscal year 2024, spent about $28 billion. 
The federal government picks up most Medicaid costs. In 2024, the federal government paid nearly $19 billion, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services annual report. About $5.5 billion came from the state, and about $3.4 billion from other sources, mostly hospital assessments. It’s money that works its way through the economy to reach individuals’ paychecks. 
The rate cuts “could be devastating” to primary care practices, particularly those in rural and underserved areas, the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians said in an email. 
Survey results
The Academy of Family Physicians and the North Carolina Pediatric Society received 429 responses to a late August survey of their members assessing rate cut impacts. 
Dr. Mark McNeill, president of the Academy of Family Physicians, says 44% of survey the respondents indicated they would have to limit the number of Medicaid patients they see in their practice, and nearly 10% said they would have to stop seeing allny Medicaid patients.
More than a quarter said they would have to lay off administrative staff, and just over 20% said they would have to lay off medical staff. Nearly 23% said the cuts might result in one or more physicians in their practices retiring early. 
Cuts adding fuel to health care worker shortages?
North Carolina has a shortage of direct care workers employed to work with people in their home and in facilities such as nursing homes.
The rate cut was widely discussed at the NC Coalition on Aging annual meeting last week, said Board of Directors Chair Mary Bethel. It will mean lower rates for personal care services and reduced payments to nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

Kay Castillo, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Residents in Long Term Care, said the cuts will be “devastating to aging as a whole.”
Reductions to nursing home rates are a worry. “Ten percent is a pretty hefty cut,” said Bethel. “We’re also really concerned about reimbursement for home care services.” 
Lower reimbursement rates could hit staffing and staff training in parts of the health care industry already struggling to find enough workers. 
“Recruitment and retention of staff is a major issue,” Bethel said. “We have a shortage of health care workers in many fields.”
Low salaries are seen as contributing to the direct care worker shortage. The state legislature has made a few attempts over the last five years to increase wages for direct care workers paid with Medicaid money but employed by private agencies. 
“There’s been so much work to get them up to a level that they’re able to live on,” D’Angelo said of direct care wages. “This is a massive step backwards.”  
Most people who use Medicaid are enrolled in managed care plans. Administrators for government managed care plans for people with mental illnesses, developmental disabilities, or substance use disorders, also known as LMEs/MCOs, announced they would not cut rates until Nov. 1. 
But other programs, like the one that helps D’Angelo, are not part of managed care. 
A blow to expanding dental care
Dentists have been pushing for increased Medicaid payments for years. 
While expenses have increased, Medicaid rates for most dental procedures haven’t changed much since 2008, according to a report last year by a task force at the N.C. Institute of Medicine. Payment rates even declined for some of the most common dental procedures, the report said. 
A bill filed this year to increase dental rates said Medicaid pays dentists about 35% of what care actually costs. 
The Oct. 1 rate cut puts dentists in an even deeper hole when they care for Medicaid beneficiaries, said Dr. Roslyn Crisp, president of the N.C. Dental Society. Dentists are already deciding not to take on Medicaid beneficiaries as patients because of low reimbursement rates, she said.
“We are approaching a crisis situation,” Crisp said. “I think that, unfortunately, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.”
Untreated dental problems can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening infections. People without insurance who seek care for mouth pain in emergency rooms may receive antibiotics or pain medication, but not treatment for the underlying cause, Crisp said. 
Crisp has a pediatric dental practice in Burlington, where she said about half her patients are Medicaid beneficiaries. She worries, with the rate cut, how to keep all of her staff. 
“If you ask me what keeps me up at night,” she said, “[it’s] how can I hang in here to make sure they have viable employment? It’s hard.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4457-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-02 17:58:37.057036

That’s the ninth highest annual cost of car ownership in the U.S., the report shows, and $297 (10%) more than the national average. 
The ranking is based on the average costs of insurance, repairs, and gas.  
Delaware is the most expensive state to own a car, with an annual cost of $4,319, while car ownership in Montana costs an average of $2,166, the lowest in the nation.
“Over the past decade, gas prices have gone up about 20%, and the cost of car repairs has increased by 63%, according to federal statistics. And in the same period, car insurance premiums have soared by 94% — that’s nearly double the cost, wildly outpacing the cumulative inflation rate (approximately 36%),” ConsumerAffairs reports. 

Nevada drivers pay, on average, $118 per month for auto insurance, the 10th highest rate in the nation. 
A state report from the Division of Insurance says Nevada’s higher insurance cost “appears to be the result of a higher incidence of theft, higher frequency of accidents, and higher severity of injuries sustained in accidents.” 
The ten most expensive states “have more dangerous roads — or dangerous drivers,” according to ConsumerAffairs. “Higher-than-average rates of traffic violations, collisions and crash-related deaths landed several of these states high rankings in ConsumerAffairs’ recent analyses of places with the worst roads, worst drivers and worst road rage.”
“Every state has its own risk profile, regulatory environment and driving culture,” Steve Cegelka of Ignition Dealer Services told ConsumerAffairs. “A state with more young drivers, looser insurance rules or higher accident rates will naturally have higher costs.”
Some insurance sources cite the concentration of Nevada motorists in two urban areas, rather than on less-congested urban roads. 
Additionally, the state charges insurance companies an insurance premium tax of 3.5% on all policies purchased in Nevada, which is among the highest rates in the nation. 
The average annual cost of repairing a vehicle in Nevada is $398 a year, the 12th highest in the nation. 
Colorado has the highest annual repair costs in the U.S. ($417), followed by California ($416).
“Factors such as mechanic wages, cost of living, household income, type of vehicle, road conditions and weather can influence the cost of car repairs,” according to MarketWatch Guides.  
The annual cost of filling up will cost Nevada drivers an average of $3.87 per gallon of fuel, with an average annual cost of $1,479, which is the eleventh highest in the nation. 
The national average price for a gallon of gas on Thursday was $3.15, according to AAA. 
Nevada, which has no in-state refineries, is heavily reliant on gas supplied by California, where strict environmental regulations and taxes combine for the second highest-priced gas in the nation, behind Washington. 
A bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September permits the governor to suspend California’s summer gasoline blend, which is formulated to reduce air pollution but causes spikes in prices at the pumps. 
Nevada imposes a $0.23 tax on a gallon of gas, while Clark County motorists pay the Regional Transportation Commission’s Fuel Revenue Indexing tax, which adds another $0.70 per gallon to price at the pump.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/traffic-ronda-1024x689.jpeg,,,2025-10-02 17:58:37.057036

A substitute teacher in Barre Town was cited for cocaine possession and reckless endangerment after a student reported she was under the influence in the classroom. 
Melissa Martin, 47, was a permanent substitute teacher at Barre Town Elementary and Middle School, Chief William Dodge said in a Thursday press release. 
According to the release, a student reported her “unusual behavior” to staff on Wednesday morning. Martin also allegedly admitted to the school’s administration that she had cocaine in her jacket pocket, Barre Town police said. 
School staff “cleared the halls” to allow emergency personnel and town police to respond to “a medical emergency,” Superintendent JoAn Canning, Principals Erica Pearson and Shannon Miller said in a message posted to the district’s website. The incident involved only one adult and no students were injured, the statement said. 
Barre Town police searched the jacket, located in the classroom she had been teaching in, and found a white powdery substance, the release said. 
Tests of the substance yielded a “presumptive positive” result for cocaine, the release said. Dodge said via email that the police department did not test Martin herself to determine whether she had drugs in her system. 
Emergency medical services transported Martin from the building, but she had not overdosed, Dodge wrote. He said that the department was not aware of her having any prior arrests or citations. 
The school district said in its statement that Martin was “no longer in the building” but did not specify her employment status. The Barre Unified Union School District did not return an immediate request for comment.

Kevin Stitt appointed a retired CareerTech administrator to lead the agency along with a “turnaround team” of officials from across the state.
Lindel Fields is Stitt’s choice to lead that turnaround as state superintendent, replacing Ryan Walters who resigned from the position on Tuesday. Fields, of Tulsa, said he will step into the role with the aim of “steadying the ship” at the Education Department, which had a tumultuous 33 months with Walters in charge.
“We’ll lead with honesty and respect,” Fields said at a news conference at Eisenhower International School in Tulsa on Thursday. “I believe in the principle ‘Do what you say. Say what you mean. Don’t say it mean.’ That’s how we’ll operate as a state agency, and that’s how we’ll treat one another.”
His remarks signal a shift away from the culture-war politics and combative tone that Walters prioritized while leading the agency. Walters ultimately left office to lead an anti-teacher-union nonprofit, prompting the governor to appoint a candidate to finish the final 15 months of his vacated term.
Fields said he isn’t interested in running in 2026 to keep the office for another four years. He said he is “laser-focused on what needs to be done at the state agency,” listing student reading proficiency, teacher recruitment and retention, and expanding students’ future career options as his priorities.
Stitt said that’s exactly the response he hoped for.
“That was a question I asked in the interview process because I wanted somebody not focused on the next election,” Stitt said. “Let’s focus on the kids.”

During the news conference, Stitt complained “there has always been misalignment between the governor and the superintendent” because they’re separately elected positions. He said the office of state superintendent should be permanently changed into a gubernatorial appointment.
The governor urged the Oklahoma Legislature to put a question on statewide voting ballots to make that change.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said they support the idea. Both were in attendance at the Tulsa event.
Paxton said he has legislation pending that would make a similar change to the state insurance commissioner and labor commissioner.
“Adding the superintendent to that, to me, makes sense,” Paxton said. “I think we elect probably too many people for the voters to keep track of.”
While fighting back tears during his address, Fields said accepting the governor’s appointment is “deeply personal.” 
He then mentioned his daughter, a fifth grader at Eisenhower, who was among the students in attendance at the event in the school library.

“As a father, I share the same hopes and worries as every parent,” he said. “We all want our kids to be safe, to be known and to be prepared for the future. That’s why steadying the ship matters so much right now.”
Fields’ started working in education in 1991 as an educator at Dick Conner Correctional Center. He spent the bulk of his career at CareerTech centers, which focus on vocational training. He led Tri County Technology Center in Bartlesville from 2009 until his retirement in 2021.
Gov. Stitt reveals members of ‘turnaround team’
Stitt said he’s been calling education professionals and state officials for the past few weeks, asking them to join Fields at the Education Department.
The governor’s own chief of staff, Tom Newell, and his education secretary, Nellie Tayloe Sanders, will be part of the team. Fields’ new administration also will include Tulsa Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Kristen Stephens, Broken Arrow Public Schools Chief Communications Officer Tara Thompson and Romel Muex-Pullen, an associate superintendent of Metro Technology Centers in Oklahoma City.
Office of Educational Quality and Accountability executive director Megan Oftedal also will join Fields at the Education Department. She will be replaced at OEQA by Okemah Chamber of Commerce President Connie Reilly, a former educator who sits on the Regional University System of Oklahoma Board of Regents.
Stitt said he will appoint University of Oklahoma professor Dan Hamlin as his new education secretary to replace Sanders. Former Stitt administration official Donelle Harder will become his chief of staff in Newell’s place.
Stitt’s changes also extend to the Oklahoma State Board of Education. He will replace board members Sarah Lepak and Zach Archer with Brian Bobek, a former member of the board, and Wes Nofire, the governor’s former Native American liaison. Fields will lead the board as state superintendent.

“Zach and Sarah have been tireless advocates for the students of Oklahoma,” Stitt said in a news release issued after the Tulsa event. “They remained professional and courteous as they navigated a tense political environment. I thank them for their service to the state and wish them the best as they return to private life.”
Bringing in a new team to lead the Education Department means there likely will be turnover among agency staff, Stitt said, but neither he nor Fields got into details of who might be affected. They also didn’t specify which roles members of the “turnaround team” would fulfill. 
Stitt said the team plans to “get politics out of that agency” and focus on directing state funds toward improving education. 
“We’ve had no transparency,” Stitt said. “We don’t know exactly what’s happening inside the agency. That’s why we have a team. We’ve got all these smart people around us that are going to go in there and look at everything, look at every contract, look at every vendor, look and see what’s happening.”
State audit to investigate Education Department finances
Among the first matters Fields will face is a state audit that Attorney General Gentner Drummond ordered.
Drummond requested the Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector’s Office investigate the Education Department’s finances over the entirety of Walters’ tenure in charge, beginning Jan. 9, 2023, through Tuesday.
Drummond contended Walters had a “well-established history of mishandling tax dollars.”
State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd confirmed through a spokesperson that she received the audit request. 
Certain state officials, including the attorney general and the governor, have the authority to request an investigative audit, which checks for compliance with state and federal law as well as adherence with proper financial procedures.
Stitt in 2021 similarly requested an investigative audit of the Education Department while Hofmeister was still in office. Four years later, Byrd still hasn’t released the completed audit.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A public hearing on whether the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) should sign a new 10-year lease for its Providence headquarters has finally been scheduled, nearly three months after the decision was delayed by state officials over union concerns about the building’s condition.
The meeting will be at 5 p.m. Oct. 23, inside a Department of Administration conference room. 
The State Properties Committee was set to consider and vote on a renewal of the office building’s lease on July 22, but the union’s pushback led the panel to pause the process while it awaited the results of an air quality test. The committee postponed another vote on July 29 in order to hold a public hearing.
At the July 29 meeting, State Properties Committee members suggested that in the interim, DCYF officials could negotiate new terms with its landlord, New York-based Provident Property. 
Workers organized under SEIU Local 580 have claimed the converted factory building at 101 Friendship St. in the Jewelry District has poor ventilation, leaks, heating issues, and infestations by insects, mice and other rodents populating the building’s five floors — along with recent bat sightings.
The union represents about 300 of the 460 workers who regularly occupy the building. Union president Matthew Gunnip did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday about the upcoming public hearing.
Terms of the most recent 10-year agreement required the state to sign a new lease by July 31 in order to extend it for another decade. Barb Francella, a DCYF spokesperson, previously told Rhode Island Current that officials are in close contact with Provident Property but are unable to discuss a potential lease or its terms until a deal is approved by the State Properties Committee. 
Francella said in an email Thursday that department officials are hopeful that all matters will be resolved at the Oct. 23 hearing.
“We still believe 101 Friendship St. is best suited for our needs,” she said.
Comment will be allowed following a presentation by DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado and Adam Boudreaux, the state’s chief property manager. Public documents submitted by DCYF are expected to be posted to the committee’s website by Thursday, Oct. 9. 
The State Properties Committee will accept written testimony through Oct. 13. Comments will be posted to the panel’s website by Oct. 16, according to the agenda for the hearing.

Gov. Phil Scott has named a former federal prosecutor to serve as a Vermont Superior Court judge.
The governor announced in a press release this week the judicial appointment of Colin Owyang, who has most recently worked in executive roles with Vermont Electric Power Company and Vermont Gas System.
“Colin is a strong leader with diverse experience working in both the public and private sectors,” Scott said in the release. “I believe this will help him to excel in this new role and serve Vermonters well as they navigate the judicial system.”
Owyang also worked as a federal prosecutor in Vermont and Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, Owyang prosecuted Richard Reid, an Al Qaeda terrorist who was convicted of trying to blow up an airplane with explosives hidden in his shoes. Reid was later sentenced to life in prison.
“I am deeply grateful to Governor Scott for this chance to serve Vermont,” Owyang said in a statement accompanying the governor’s announcement. “The Superior Court touches the lives of so many people in our community, often at very trying times.” 
Owyang earned his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School, Scott’s release stated. 
If his appointment is approved by the Vermont Senate, Owyang will fill a vacancy that comes from the retirement of Judge Samuel Hoar. He will be assigned to serve in Chittenden County, Chief Superior Judge Thomas Zonay stated in an email Thursday.
State judges in Vermont serve six-year terms, with the Legislature deciding whether they can serve additional terms.
The governor selects appointees for a judge’s post from a list sent to him by the Judicial Nominating Board. That body is made up of legislators, representatives of the governor, and Vermont Bar Association members.
The panel had 12 applicants to fill the vacancy created by Hoar’s retirement and sent the names of six “well-qualified” candidates to the governor, attorney Jessica Burke, the board’s chair, said Thursday.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The ACLU of Virginia has filed a class action lawsuit accusing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of unlawfully detaining young people in the commonwealth who already have, or are in the process of obtaining, legal protections that Congress created to shield them from deportation.
The case, Sarmiento et al. v. Crawford et al., was submitted Thursday in the Alexandria division of the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. The lawsuit names four plaintiffs — all minors who have applied for or been granted Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) — and seeks relief for others in the same situation. 
The ACLU argues ICE has flouted federal law by treating these youth as ordinary noncitizens subject to mandatory detention, locking them in facilities such as the ones in Farmville or Caroline, and denying them bond hearings.
“How could ICE possibly justify picking up orphaned children and then warehousing them in a detention center?” ACLU-VA Legal Director Eden Heilman said in a statement. “A court ruled they cannot safely return to their home countries, that they have nowhere else to go, and that they have every legal right to be in the United States.”
Sophia Gregg, ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney, added: “Our clients are following the rules they’ve been given to obtain citizenship. Unfortunately, ICE is not.”
Congress created SIJS almost four decades ago to protect children who entered the U.S. after abuse, abandonment, or neglect. 
The process is lengthy — minors are placed with vetted sponsors, state judges rule they cannot return to their home countries and then they must wait years for visas to adjust their status before eventually applying for citizenship.
Traditionally, minors with SIJS were not subject to prolonged detention. The ACLU’s complaint contends that ICE, under current White House policy, is unlawfully reversing that practice by classifying SIJS youth as “arriving” noncitizens subject to mandatory detention — despite protections under anti-trafficking laws, the Immigration and Nationality Act and constitutional due process rights.
The lawsuit lands amid intensifying scrutiny of ICE operations in Virginia. In August, protesters in Richmond demanded an end to local cooperation with the agency after a wave of “masked, plainclothes” detentions, with data showing that 80% of those held in Virginia facilities were classified as posing “no threat,” meaning no criminal record.
In Chesterfield County, ICE sweeps at the courthouse drew fierce backlash in June, with at least 14 arrests in one day, including people arriving for traffic fines. Critics described the raids as cruel and economically harmful, ensnaring routine court visitors rather than dangerous offenders. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin has touted a state-federal task force for arresting more than 2,500 immigrants, claiming they were violent criminals. But after visiting Chesterfield, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, challenged those assertions, saying many had never been convicted of violent crimes. 
Attorney General Jason Miyares also failed to produce proof that all detainees were violent offenders, The Mercury reported in July.
The lawsuit by the ACLU of Virginia mirrors national legal battles over how ICE handles immigrant minors. 
In California, attorneys have challenged conditions in facilities where children are held under Border Patrol control, calling them “prison-like” and unfit for youth. Federal courts have also reaffirmed the Flores Settlement, which bars indefinite detention of minors and mandates minimum care standards.
More recently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rescinded its policy of granting deferred action to SIJS recipients stuck in visa backlogs, leaving tens of thousands vulnerable to detention or deportation despite earlier protections. A related class-action lawsuit in New York could affect as many as 150,000 SIJS recipients nationwide.
The ACLU of Virginia, joined by Cruz Law and attorney Patrice Kopistanky, is seeking injunctive relief that would grant bond hearings and secure the release of minors with SIJS. If the court agrees, it could force ICE to alter how it handles youth across the state — and potentially nationwide.
The lawsuit underscores a growing conflict between federal enforcement and state-level protections for children, raising the question of whether the U.S. can continue detaining youth who Congress specifically sought to protect from deportation.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican legislative leaders are urging lawmakers to support their push for a special session where they can both ban Kansans from altering gender markers on their driver’s licenses and redraw congressional maps.
Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins have been trying to garner enough signatures to force a special session in early November, with the goal of gerrymandering U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, the lone Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, out of office. But some Republican lawmakers have resisted the call to action initiated by President Donald Trump.
This week, Republican leaders shifted gears.
The Kansas Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider Attorney General Kris Kobach’s appeal in a legal fight over a 2023 law that attempted to define gender by conflating it with sex. Gender is a a social and personal identity or expression, while sex refers to reproductive systems. Kobach used the law to argue that Kansans shouldn’t be allowed to change the gender markers on their driver’s licenses.
But the Kansas Court of Appeals determined the state suffered no harm from changed gender markers. Kansans have been allowed to modify their driver’s licenses since at least 2002, according to court records. There were just 380 changes from 2011 to 2022, and nobody raised concerns about the practice before Kobach filed his lawsuit.
Because the high court refused to hear Kobach’s appeal, Kansans can resume changing their gender markers as of Monday.
Masterson and Hawkins seized the opportunity to pressure Republicans into supporting their push for a special session.
Masterson, an Andover Republican, sent a letter Wednesday to Senate Republicans that said Kobach has urgently requested they call a special session to address an issue that Kobach considers “even more important than redistricting.” By adding a few words to Senate Bill 180, the letter said, the Legislature could “prevent a flood of individuals seeking to change their driver’s licenses.”

In a statement, Masterson said the Legislature could tackle both gender markers and redistricting in a special session.
“We can’t allow a narrow radical ideology the ability to alter basic concrete facts on documents with vital statistics,” Masterson said. “Should a special session be called, we can certainly handle both issues.”
Rep. Mark Schreiber, an Emporia Republican, said Hawkins sent a similar letter to House Republicans.
Schreiber is the rare Republican who votes against anti-trans legislation. He also opposes partisan redistricting.
“I was kind of surprised to have another reason to go into special session,” he said in an interview.
“To me, I don’t know that it’s worthy of a special session,” he added. “The thing with special sessions is once we get in there, they can bring up anything. It’s not limited to a topic. So we’ll see how it goes.”
He said he wouldn’t sign the petition to call a special session.
“I don’t think the purpose of redistricting is to try to ensure a majority in the U.S. House. It’s to make adjustments based on population changes,” Schreiber said. “You know, I could see this going on and on — every two or three years, four years, whatever, somebody comes up and says, ‘Well, we got to save the majority.’ And it could be either Rs or Ds. It doesn’t matter to me. Redistricting is not, in opinion, to be used for that purpose.”
Masterson and Hawkins hope to appease the president by drawing four congressional districts that each favor Republicans. In 2022, they attempted to drive Davids out of office by drawing maps that split the Kansas City metro and placed Lawrence into the largely rural 1st District that stretches all the way to the Colorado border. Another attempt would have to carve up Johnson County and place more rural terrain in Davids’ district.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes said in a statement that the timing of Kobach’s “urgent request” to change a law that has been on the books for more than two years “is highly suspicious.”
“It’s as though the idea of mid-decade redistricting isn’t generating enough momentum amongst the people of Kansas — because Kansans aren’t asking for a new map — so Republicans needed to return to a divisive social issue that they know will drum up outrage,” Sykes said.
Masterson’s response: “I’m grateful that Democrats at least acknowledge it’s outrageous, which in itself addresses the question of timing.”
Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said “none of this is about supporting Kansans and their real, immediate concerns about health care, property taxes, and putting increasingly more expensive food on the table.”
House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, also a Lenexa Democrat, said “the unbalanced Republican supermajority is abusing their power to call another special session that will cost hundreds of thousands of Kansas tax dollars because the attorney general lost in court on a fabricated issue.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P5051432-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

An employee who was terminated Wednesday spoke to Mississippi Today on condition of anonymity because of concerns about repercussions in future job searches. The former employee said they were one of about 10 people laid off from jobs dealing with preventive health and elimination of health disparities. 
The Health Department downsized what it had called the “Offices of Preventive Health and Health Equity” partially in response to issues outlined in a Sept. 22 report published by the Office of State Auditor Shad White, according to a person outside the department who was briefed on the firings and spoke to Mississippi Today under condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency decisions. The report alleged the Health Department failed to properly monitor taxpayer funds directed to the “Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity.”
Greg Flynn, spokesperson for the state Health Department, confirmed the department made staffing “adjustments” but would not say how many employees were laid off or in which offices. He declined to comment on the auditor’s report but said programs and outreach around preventive health and health disparities continue to exist.
“With uncertainty around federal funding, we’ve made personnel adjustments to protect essential direct services and keep the focus on the health of Mississippi families,” Flynn said. “Our priority is ensuring stability and continuity for the communities we serve.”
The former Health Department employee who spoke to Mississippi Today said they did not receive a direct response when they asked whether the layoffs were caused by the federal government shutdown that began on Wednesday, hours before the employee was terminated. Rather, the person was told that as a state employee without civil service protection, they could be dismissed without cause. 
The “Offices of Preventive Health and Health Equity” worked on programs dealing with chronic disease prevention and healthy living, according to an April 2024 social media post published by the Health Department. 
“Our Health Equity Office ensures fair healthcare access for all,” the post said. “Together, we’re building a healthier, more equitable MS!” 
There is no mention of what had been called the Offices of Preventive Health and Health Equity on the Health Department’s Preventive Health page or Health Disparities Office page.  
The auditor’s report said the Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity failed to properly monitor some taxpayer funds awarded to nonprofits through subgrants. Thousands of dollars were spent on gift cards, grocery cards and gym memberships with “little documentation about who benefited,” the report said.

A Ridgeland-based nonprofit was awarded over $250,000 by the Office of Preventive Health and Health Equity through a two-year grant to be used for disease prevention for “underserved Mississippians.” The Health Department often reimbursed the nonprofit without proper documentation to prove the expenditures were appropriate, the report said. 
In a statement to Mississippi Today, Auditor Shad White said his office found state agencies have been giving tax dollars to groups with little accountability for how the money is spent. 
“So it’s no surprise to us that agencies are starting to make some changes now that our reports have been made public and taxpayers are starting to ask more questions about how their money is spent,” White said. 
This isn’t the first time the Health Department has come under fire by the Auditor’s Office for work it outsourced to nonprofits. 
In May, the Auditor’s Office said the Health Department failed to adequately oversee how nonprofits were using federal funds to address HIV prevention. The Auditor’s Office found that only 35 HIV tests were administered between 2021 and 2024, while the nonprofits received reimbursements for alcohol, late-night rideshares, purchases from a smoke shop and rental of a nightclub owned by one group’s executive director. 
The Health Department said the lapses were “unacceptable” and did not “reflect the value of many nonprofit partners we continue to work with across Mississippi.”

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The New Mexico Senate adjourned early Thursday afternoon, ending its part of a two-day special legislative session seeking to protect New Mexicans from federal cuts to hospitals, Medicaid, food stamps and other services. 
While Senate Republicans largely voted along with Democrats on their final bill of the day — protecting expiring health care premium tax credits for about 6,300 New Mexicans — they used their last minutes on the floor to call for deeper changes to the state’s health care problems, namely a doctor shortage and high medical malpractice premiums.
Sen. Nicole Tobiassen (R-Albuquerque) spoke through tears when calling on her colleagues to approve medical compacts, saying New Mexico’s unwillingness to join them is affecting health care access across the state. Her husband recently was diagnosed with West Nile Virus and meningitis.
“By staying out of these compacts, we’re actively making it harder for New Mexicans to access healthcare,” she said. “I know firsthand, because of what my husband has gone through and what he’s going through today, there are 2.1 million New Mexicans demanding access, demanding that this body do something.”
Such compacts would allow health care workers licensed in other states to work in New Mexico, which advocates say would address the state’s shortage of medical professionals. 
New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House, but all stalled in the state Senate.
Think NM: Address medical malpractice, licensing to lessen health care worker shortage

In response to Tobiassen, Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe), the Senate majority leader, offered his sympathies but defended the Senate’s reluctance to approve the compacts earlier this year as the first step in a process. He also said he would support the compacts in January during the 30-day session, and invited Tobiassen to join a legislative work group finalizing the legislation in the meantime. 
“I am fully committed to work on this issue, to get consensus,” he told Tobiassen. “And again, I think with you on this team working on it, we can get there.”
After the exchange, the vast majority of the Senate agreed to give the New Mexico Health Care Authority flexibility to ensure New Mexicans who buy insurance from the state’s health care marketplace won’t have to pay huge premium increases if federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credits expire. 
NM GOP convenes new legislative health care task force ahead of special session

While all but three Republican senators voted in favor of the legislation, House Bill 2, several of them echoed Tobiassen’s call for bigger changes, including medical malpractice reform and reducing the state’s reliance on Medicaid.
Senate Minority leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) was one of the three who voted against the bill, saying the Legislature should have taken a bigger swing than the two-day session allowed for. 
“We have a health care crisis today, big time,” he said. “This doesn’t really address the health care crisis today at all.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/02/ned-lamont-office-vehicle-use-audit/,"The governor’s office did not maintain proper oversight of state vehicles and kept three computers for every staff member, auditors found.","Gov. Ned Lamont’s office failed for years to maintain proper controls over the use of state vehicles, state auditors reported Thursday, echoing a private investigator’s findings that Lamont’s former chief of staff chronically violated vehicle rules.
Auditors John Geragosian and Craig Miner, who examined the governor’s and lieutenant governor’s offices for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscal years, also found that Lamont’s office approved staff time sheets without direct knowledge of time worked and kept more than 90 laptops and personal computers on its inventory, which represented, at times, an average of more than three devices per employee.
“Lack of adequate records and management review increases the likelihood of misconduct and noncompliance,” Geragosian and Miner wrote in their analysis of the governor’s office’s handling of three state vehicles assigned to it.
One of those vehicles is for the governor, while the other two were considered “pool vehicles” for staff use. State policy requires vehicles to maintain mileage logs, “which include daily operator assignments,” the auditors wrote. Staff operating vehicles must certify the logs are correct while agency heads must indicate why that travel was essential for agency business.
But Geragosian and Miner found Lamont’s office failed to maintain logs daily, and the vehicle utilization reports that were filed lacked details like who was driving.
They also noted that, on 37 of the 84 days during which pool vehicles were used, the operator did not park overnight at a state facility or an approved alternative location, as required by state policy.
Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said Thursday that “This issue has already been addressed by the governor, who immediately had staff adopt internal controls and policies around acceptable use of state vehicles, instituted greater accountability, and returned all pooled vehicles” to the Department of Administrative Services.
An investigation commissioned by Lamont concluded in early June that his former chief of staff, Jonathan Dach, chronically violated state rules by using a state vehicle as his personal car for nearly two years and driving at speeds constituting reckless driving under Connecticut law.
A referral to the Office of State Ethics for disciplinary action was mandatory.
The inquiry was prompted by a story posted on Nov. 24 by Inside Investigator, a news site affiliated with the Yankee Institute for Public Policy, about the apparent misuse of two cars assigned to the office of the governor: a 2020 Ford Escape used by Dach, and a 2019 Ford Fusion used by communications staff.
When the car used by Dach eventually was returned to the state motor pool after sitting unused for a time in the Legislative Office Building garage, it had damage on the passenger’s side that cost $3,509 to repair, according to the June report prepared for Lamont by two lawyers at Shipman & Goodwin.
Also Thursday, state auditors found that inventory records for the governor’s office didn’t properly record the location of nearly $25,000 worth of items.
They also noted that as of April 2025, inventory records showed 92 laptops and personal computers assigned to the governor’s office, which has 34 employees in the 2022-23 fiscal year and 25 in 2023-24.
Lamont’s office wrote in its formal response to the auditors that laptops are replaced at the end of their warranty period but some are retained to be used by interns, fellows or other staff. The administration also indicated that 18 laptops have been transferred to the Office of Workforce Strategy, but that move still needs to be recorded on the inventory.
There also was no evidence that the Department of Administrative Services, which provides fiscal services to the governor’s office, properly entered 72 assets collectively worth almost $128,400 into the inventory system, auditors wrote. The department responded in writing to the auditors that it will work more closely with the governor’s office on inventory records.
Geragosian and Miner also noted that Lamont’s office and DAS approved timesheets for the governor’s staff “without direct knowledge of their work hours or locations” and lacked formal written procedures for doing so.
Lamont’s office responded it has resumed the practice of having supervisors approve all timesheets and is developing written procedures.

North Carolina education officials want to change the way public schools are graded, moving away from a heavy focus on test scores and toward new metrics that capture a broader picture of student success.
At its Wednesday meeting, the State Board of Education heard a proposal from Department of Public Instruction officials to create a new task force that would change school performance measures. The current A–F grading model, in place since 2015, has faced criticism for its heavy reliance on standardized test scores, which some argue does not adequately measure the full scope of a school’s success.
Currently, the grading system focuses primarily on test scores in a few core subjects, which means the contributions of many teachers are not fully represented. The proposed task force would develop a multi-measure model assessing not just test proficiency but also student growth, access to advanced coursework and career training, and progress toward graduation.
“Our current system doesn’t necessarily reflect what folks see in the daily work in their schools,” said Dr. Michael Maher, DPI’s chief accountability officer.
“It is a limited reflection of readiness for college career and life. Because it’s heavily weighted on an individual test score on an individual day, it doesn’t give us the full picture of what’s happening in schools,”Maher told the board on Wednesday.
The effort falls under Pillar 6 of the board’s new five-year strategic plan, which calls for “transformative change” in public education.
Board member Olivia Oxendine questioned DPI officials on how this task force would differ from past attempts to change the state’s school accountability system.
Maher said that this task force will be established directly by the State Board of Education, unlike previous efforts. He also noted the department now has several years of research and prior work to draw on.
“They will receive homework, an orientation packet, which will include the prior work done so that that work is not lost. That was important work,” added Rupen Fofaria, director of board operations and policy.
Despite those assurances, Oxendine said she worries that focusing too much on changing measures could distract from the core goal of improving student achievement in reading and math. While she acknowledged the frustration many feel with the current grading system, she warned against creating a model that “just puts lipstick on a pig.”
“I want an accountability model that is also about increasing the reading achievement of kids, the math achievement,” Oxendine said. “I don’t hear that in this discussion.”
This isn’t the first push to change how schools are graded. Last year, former State Superintendent Catherine Truitt told lawmakers that the current grading system is “broken” and fails to provide parents and communities with useful information.
The task force will include representatives from the state board, lawmakers, educators, researchers, and community leaders.
“This is about giving families and educators information they can actually use,” Maher said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Green9032025c.jpg,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

Young I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/sen-edward-kennedy-of-lowell-dies-at-74/,"""A longtime member of the Lowell City Council before he was elected in 2018 to the Massachusetts Senate, Kennedy had been serving this session as Senate chairman of the Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets.""","SEN. EDWARD KENNEDY, a fourth-term Democrat from Lowell, has died, Senate President Karen Spilka informed senators early Thursday afternoon. He was 74.
A longtime member of the Lowell City Council before he was elected in 2018 to the Massachusetts Senate, Kennedy had been serving this session as Senate chairman of the Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets and Senate vice chair of the Joint Committee on Higher Education.
“He was a valued member of the Senate and passionate advocate for the people of the First Middlesex district. Ed was a champion for education, environmental sustainability, cultural development and, of course, his beloved hometown of Lowell. He will be deeply missed by all those fortunate enough to know him,” Spilka said in an email to senators and staff. 
Spilka told senators her office will share details of services for Kennedy as soon as they are available. Spilka’s notice did not mention a cause or date of death. The Lowell Sun reported that Kennedy died Wednesday night at Lowell General Hospital.
Kennedy was a Lowell city councilor from 1978 to 1985 and then again from 2011 to 2019, and he held the title of mayor during the 2016-2017 term. He was also a Middlesex County commissioner from 1992 to 1996, according to his profile in the Massachusetts Political Almanac. He worked as public information officer and legislative liaison for the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services from 1981 to 1987, and then as a commercial real estate appraiser for Madison Copp Appraisals until 2019.
Kennedy’s First Middlesex District along the New Hampshire border includes Lowell, Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell and Tyngsborough.
Spilka’s office did not mention its responsibility for selecting the date for a special election to fill Kennedy’s seat. Senate rules say the president has 20 days from the time the vacancy occurs to schedule a date for a special election and that “the proposed date of the special election shall then be put before the members of the Senate for a vote.”
Gov. Maura Healey on Thursday ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at all state buildings until sunset on the day of Kennedy’s interment, in honor of his life and legacy.
“I’m heartbroken to hear about the passing of State Senator Ed Kennedy. For nearly 50 years, he has been a fixture of the Lowell government, dedicating his life to service and delivering for his community,” she said. “It’s been an honor to partner with him on everything from housing to education.”
University of Massachusetts President Marty Meehan said he was “extremely sad” to learn to Kennedy’s death, and that for 50 years he and Kennedy “were friends and colleagues, sharing a love of politics and a passion for public service.”
“I was fortunate to see Ed’s commitment firsthand over the years. We got our start in politics together in 1977 when I managed his first campaign for Lowell City Council and later attended the 1980 Democratic Convention together as delegates for Ted Kennedy. He served with distinction as a state senator, mayor of Lowell, city councilor and county commissioner,” Meehan said. “Ed was an honest man who always did the right thing even if it was difficult politically. I will miss talking to my friend Ed about politics and government.”
U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan, who represents Lowell in Congress, reflected Thursday on Kennedy as a “son of Lowell.”
“Ed’s legacy is written into the very fabric of our community – in the neighborhoods he worked tirelessly to strengthen, the cultural and educational investments he championed, and the countless people he touched with his steady commitment to public service,” she said. “He carried Lowell with him in every role he held, never losing sight of the city that shaped him and that he, in turn, helped to shape for the better.”
U.S. Sen. Ed Markey said, “Ed Kennedy devoted his life to Lowell. As City Councilor, Mayor, and State Senator, he was a champion for his hometown and an architect of the city we know today.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Massachusetts_State_House_interior_02-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

Feb 25, 2025. (Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday announced the cancellation of $7.5 billion in awards for 223 projects across the country. In a news release, the department said the canceled projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
In a post on social media, Russell Vought, director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, listed 16 states in which grants had been canceled, including New Mexico, and wrote: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” An Associated Press story identified the states as ones that had all voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.
The grants were through DOE’s Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Grid Deployment; Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains; Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy; and Fossil Energy.
In a news release, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, described “Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states” as “nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful. And now those cancelled energy projects have become the latest casualty of Trump’s vengeful attack on the American people.”
The projects, Heinrich’s statement noted, were already approved and funded by Congress and are ones that “create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward. Instead of working to help our families and communities.”
The projects in New Mexico include $42.7 million to New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology for the third phase of a project to a project to develop a storage hub at a commercial scale within San Juan basin; $35.6 million for PNM for a “virtual power plant enablement that improves grid stability and reduces customers’ electricity bills”; and $15.4 million for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative for a distributed battery energy storage system.
Heinrich said in his statement he had lunch with DOE Secretary Chris Wright shortly before news of the cancelled projects broke. “He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included ten projects in my state,” Heinrich noted, “projects that affect real jobs and real families. That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions. The American people deserve a government that works for them, not one that plays politics with their lives. This Administration is choosing to punish ordinary families just to settle scores — and that is as dangerous as it is un-American.”
The DOE says award recipients have 30 days to appeal the canceled funding.

Guy Federal Building had several vacant spots the afternoon of Oct. 2, 2025, due to federal workers being furloughed. (Photo by Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)No state employees who are federally funded will be furloughed or lose pay due to the federal government shutdown, according to the North Dakota Office of Management and Budget.
“We expect that interruptions in federal funds will be short term, and that they won’t significantly affect state cash flow,” Joe Morrissette, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
Less than 10% of the state’s payroll is funded by federal dollars, Morrissette said. The two state agencies with the most federally-funded employees are the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Environmental Quality.
Morrissette was in charge of the Office of Management and Budget during the 35-day federal government shutdown that started in December 2018. It was the longest in U.S. history.
“That one, too, even though it was longer, was really just viewed as an interruption in the flow of federal funds,” Morrissette said. “In the end, the state was made whole for everything.”
He said North Dakota is operating under the assumption that the same will be true for this year’s shutdown.
If the shutdown lasts longer than 35 days, the state may have to revisit its options, Morrissette said. This could mean reducing federally-funded services, or deciding to tap into more state money to sustain federal programs until the shutdown ends, he said.
Morrissette said OMB could draw funds from the Bank of North Dakota in the form of a short-term loan, though that’s never been done before. The Legislature could also consider calling a special session to access funding, he added.
Federal employees
North Dakota has more than 5,700 federal workers, according to federal workforce statistics. 
Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said Thursday it’s her understanding that federal workers who are furloughed will receive back pay.
Fedorchak said she hopes the shutdown ends the next time the Senate votes on the issue, which could be Friday or Saturday. She added the House of Representatives is expected back in session on Monday.
SNAP, WIC and other health programs
Federal health care and social services provided through the state of North Dakota have not been interrupted by the federal government shutdown, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
“We’d like to let North Dakotans know that the federal government shutdown does not close state government,” Pat Traynor, Health and Human Services commissioner, said in a statement. “We will provide updates as more information becomes available, and we remain committed to our mission of helping North Dakotans live safe and healthy lives.”
Traynor said the state will continue administering programs including Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Child Care Development Fund and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said it was too early to speculate how long it could sustain the programs without further funding from Congress.
Department of Environmental Quality
David Glatt, Department of Environmental Quality director, said the agency operates a number of federal programs, including those mandated by the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act.
He said the Department of Environmental Quality’s federal programs use state general fund dollars to operate, which are then reimbursed by federal funding once it’s available.
“Congress has not passed a budget in a timely manner for many, many years,” Glatt said. “Once they pass a budget, it usually takes them a couple months to get the money to flow to the states.”
He said the agency has enough money to continue operating those programs for at least 60 days.
“Like everything else, we’ll just stay tuned,” he said. “Things change pretty quickly in D.C., but right now we’re sitting OK.”

Tribal services 
All essential services provided to tribal communities by the federal government, including those provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Education, will continue without interruption, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.
The Spirit Lake Nation Tribal Council in a Wednesday statement noted that federal funding could be delayed, and that the inability to communicate with furloughed federal employees could impact some services.
“While we have not yet received coordination from our federal partners, the tribe has been proactive in planning for this moment,” Spirit Lake Chairperson Lonna Jackson Street said in the statement.
On Thursday, the Spirit Lake Nation announced it would be restricting assistance provided through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program due to limited funding. The program, funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, helps keep low-income homes warm during the winter.
“We are implementing a strict priority list to ensure that our most vulnerable community members receive assistance during this critical time,” the tribe said. The priority list includes households with elderly and people with disabilities, children under 5 and those facing crisis situations, like homes that have had their utilities disconnected.
National parks
Recreational and historic sites in North Dakota operated by the National Park Services — including Theodore Roosevelt National Park and Knife River Indian Villages — will generally remain open during the shutdown. However, visitor centers will be closed, according to the agency’s September 2025 contingency plan.
Law enforcement, emergency response services and fire suppression services will continue, the plan states. It indicates roughly two-thirds of the agency’s employees are on furlough during the shutdown.
Federal courts
North Dakota federal court is staying open during the shutdown, said Kari Knudson, clerk of court for the district.
“The federal courts have both constitutional and statutory obligations that don’t go away just because there is no funding,” she said.
Judges will continue to be paid, she said. Staff could potentially see delays to their paychecks, though Knudson said she doesn’t anticipate that happening.
The court must delay or defer all non-salary related, non-essential expenses, Knudson said — which could include things like buying office supplies or entering into new contracts for services.
North Dakota attorneys withdraw from federal public defender work due to funding gap

North Dakota U.S. Attorney’s Office spokesperson Terry Van Horn said the agency’s work “will continue as usual.” He said the office could not comment as to whether any of its attorneys have been furloughed. Knudson said some of her emails to federal attorneys have bounced back with out-of-office messages.
The federal judiciary in July ran out of money to hire private defense attorneys to represent defendants who can’t afford their own representation. Most of the time, these federal defendants are represented by public defenders, but sometimes the judiciary must appoint an outside lawyer.
Since early July, private attorneys who accept these appointments have worked without pay.
The hope was that they would get reimbursed in October once the fiscal year turned over, but since Congress has not adopted a budget, this is not yet possible, Knudson said.
Since July, private defense attorneys in North Dakota seem to be passing up new appointments more frequently, Knudson said, but the court has so far found someone who’s willing.

Such a scenario would also lead to a full Michigan government shut down, as House Speaker Matt Hall reiterated that there will not be another continuation budget to keep the lights on if the deal brokered between him, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer falls apart.
“This was a revenue source that Winnie Brinks offered in private,” Hall said while speaking to reporters on Thursday. “We took them up on their suggestion of marijuana, and we all made a deal on the budget. Brinks would never make that deal if she can’t perform.”
It was now on the Senate to keep up their end of the road funding deal, Hall added. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A message seeking comment on the state of the marijuana tax from Brinks’ office was not returned at the time of publication
The tax has opposition from some members of the House and Senate, although Hall has said throughout the week that the plan was put forward by Brinks. The tax outlined in House Bill 4951 was initiated in the lower chamber, however, sponsored by Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills).
That remains to be seen, given that at least one Democrat – Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor – said that he would not vote for the measure as is.
Michigan cannabis industry stakeholders spent Tuesday in Lansing, lobbying lawmakers and rallying in hopes that the Legislature would either walk away from its proposed tax to fund roads or amend the bill to rescue the tax but at a much more palatable rate.

On Tuesday, lawmakers worked late into the evening to move implementation bills that would set up passage of a final budget in the coming days. It was during that late-night session that an amendment to the proposed tax emerged in the Senate’s session database that would reduce the proposed tax to just 20%.
The amendment to House Bill 4951, put forward by state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) would also tie-bar the bill to Chang’s proposed tax on several tobacco products and levying a tax on e-cigarettes – Senate Bill 582.
If it were to gain traction, it could give some comfort to cannabis industry leaders who said the tax in its current proposed form would lead to a shrinking of the industry and job losses, but some opponents to the tax say that the number is still too high and wouldn’t get their votes.
Senate Bill 582 is in line with a bill she offered during the previous legislative session which levied an additional 75 mills on top of the tax levied on cigarettes, increasing the wholesale tax on cigars, noncigarette smoking tobacco, smokeless tobacco, and any tobacco product to 57% while levying a 57% wholesale tax on e-cigarettes.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Chang said the amendment amounted to a concept of a plan, so to speak, and that she was just throwing it out there to see what the appetite was. She was not confident that it would be taken up, or pass even if it did.
Two House lawmakers said during an anti-marijuana tax rally held Tuesday that they were working behind the scenes to get that rate reduced. Chang was asked if she’s talked to her colleagues about the amendment, particularly on the House side, but she said she had not.
Irwin, who has been a strong critic of the House Republican’s proposed marijuana tax, said the reduction in the rate was an improvement, but not enough to bring him on board.
“I think it would still drive a lot of people out of the legal market, still discourage a lot of people from other states who are currently coming here because our prices are advantaged,” Irwin said. “And so if our prices are no longer attractive to customers in Michigan or from other states, we’re going to lose a lot of those customers.”

Now is not the time to be levying additional taxes on cannabis, Irwin argued, noting that a black market for the product still exists, and driving people toward that market will lead to a decrease in revenue. That was the sentiment shared by industry advocates at the rally on Tuesday.
Irwin also argued that lawmakers should respect the distribution model for cannabis taxes that voters approved when they voted to legalize the drug in 2018.
“If we’re going to change that, we certainly should have a three quarters majority to change it as demanded by the Michigan Constitution,” Irwin said.
Still, Hall thought that the deal on 24% would hold. He was adamant that he thought the initially proposed 32% tax on marijuana was too high, and that the House was able to bring that number down. Hall also wondered if the tax would change consumption habits, ultimately affecting the revenue the state could get from it. Chang would not discuss her reasoning behind the amendment other than that it was another option.
When asked if the House would concur with the amendment if it somehow passed, Hall was noncommittal and said again that they had a deal.
“If they try to change the terms of that deal, we would strip it out and we’d send it back the other way, because there are hundreds of things we could renegotiate in this deal, but then the government would shut down,” Hall said.

Glenn Youngkin in September 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)Virginia officials are assessing state agencies to see if their reliance on federal funding will lead to program or employee schedule disruptions due to the federal government shutdown.
In a letter from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Chief of Staff John Littel to executive branch employees on Oct. 1 obtained by the Mercury, Littel said that state programs that heavily rely on federal funding could be impacted until a new stream of funding is approved in Washington. The statement also predicted minimal effect on state employees.
“For most of our state workforce, the federal government shutdown will have no impact on your responsibilities or work schedule. While we believe that no positions are immediately impacted, we are assessing agencies who have positions funded in part or in whole with federal funds to determine the impact and options available,” the letter read.
The Virginia executive branch includes the Department of Elections, Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Labor, and many other agencies. Governor’s office spokesman Peter Finocchio said offices are working to avoid furloughs if the shutdown persists.
“As we continue to work through impacts from the federal shutdown, there is no immediate interruption to services such as SNAP, WIC, or Medicaid within the next couple of weeks,” Finocchio said.
The letter said any employee or department that would potentially be impacted by the shutdown would be contacted “shortly” with guidance.
The shutdown fallout for Virginia’s thousands of federal employees is still unfolding, and the state’s Democratic U.S. senators are pushing for a solution. 
About 147,358 federal civilian employees live in Virginia, according to congressional reports. The White House announced an unprecedented move to fire federal workers during the shutdown, which is already being challenged in court. Federal employees will not get paid during the shutdown, and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, told reporters Oct. 2 lawmakers hope to work out a deal that would protect more federal workers from getting fired. Congress made a similar deal during the 2019 shutdown to ensure that once the shutdown was lifted, furloughed workers received back pay for the days they missed work. 
The White House has warned of “imminent” federal employee layoffs, States Newsroom reported.

“The president has no enhanced powers during the shutdown so his ability to randomly and arbitrarily fire is not enhanced,” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, told States Newsroom.
The commonwealth’s 22 national parks are expected to remain open during the shutdown with potential staffing reductions, according to a National Parks service contingency plan.
The next congressional vote on extending funding is expected on Friday, but it is likely to be blocked in the Senate.

(Getty Images)Kentucky optometry officials are free under state law to substitute a Canadian test for part of a U.S. licensure exam, Attorney General Russell Coleman has decided in an  Oct. 1 opinion.
Critics have warned the Canadian exam is less rigorous than Kentucky’s previous standard.
But the state Board of Optometric Examiners erred in waiving a different portion of the three-part national exam during the pandemic without enacting a proper regulation — raising  questions of whether any optometrist granted a license in those circumstances is properly licensed, the opinion said.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, who sought the opinion, said it appears to resolve the controversial question of whether the optometric board may offer the Canadian exam in lieu of Part 1 of the national exam, which focuses on science and medicine and is currently used in all 50 states.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield. (LRC Public Information)
“It certainly is some clarification to that issue,” he said.
The proposed change prompted protests from officials with the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, who testified at legislative hearings earlier this year that substituting the Canadian version would lower licensure standards in Kentucky — one of only a few states that have expanded the role of optometrists to include eye surgery and other advanced procedures.
Meanwhile, Meredith, chairman of the Senate Health Services Committee, said he was disturbed to find the board may have improperly waived Part 3 of the three-part optometry exam during Kentucky’s COVID-19 emergency from September 2020 through November 2023. That part requires candidates to travel out of state for simulated patient encounters.
“I don’t know how many of those people they gave licenses to,” he said. “I think we need to have some clarification on that.”
The state optometry board did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The board oversees about 850 licensed optometrists, a politically influential group which in 2011 launched a successful lobbying blitz to persuade the Kentucky General Assembly to significantly expand the scope of their practice to include eye surgery and other procedures generally reserved for medical doctors.
The attorney general’s office said that the board, responding to a request for further information, reported it had “instituted alternative testing measures” for that period but provided no further details. Nor did the board appear to follow proper procedures to enact any such waiver through a change in regulations, the opinion said.
“As such, the waiver and allowance for alternative testing were without the force and effect of law,” the opinion said. “It is further the opinion of this office that any person who applied for a license to practice optometry using the waiver and alternative testing did not comply with the relevant regulations.”
‘Illegal license?’
Meredith said further investigation is warranted on whether some optometrists who gained licensure through the waiver of Part 3 of the national tests may hold “an illegal license.”
“It’s very concerning if it has not been properly rectified,” he said.
If the optometry board doesn’t provide him with some answers, Meredith said he’s willing to hold a legislative hearing to get some.
Attorney General Russell Coleman
The attorney general’s opinion said its office received scant information from the board on the subject.
“It is unclear what the alternative testing measures were, as they are not available on the board’s website, nor were they included in the board’s response to the office’s request for information,” it said.
To properly enact a waiver, the board should have adopted and submitted for legislative review a change in its regulations, the opinion said.
“There is no evidence of the board promulgating a regulation — emergency or otherwise — to effectuate the waiver or to allow the alternative testing,” it said.
The board reported to the attorney general’s office it made the changes through “resolutions” adopted at board meetings, the opinion said.  It said that means of attempting to change a regulation is “expressly prohibited” by state law and further, cannot be documented.
“Meeting minutes for those meetings are not available on the board’s website and this information comes only from statements made by the board in response to the office’s request for information,” the opinion said.
Canadian exam OK
However, it appears the board did take the proper steps and acted within its authority to promulgate the regulation allowing optometry candidates for licensure the option of taking the Canadian test instead of Part 1 of the national exam, the opinion said.
That includes filing the proposed regulatory change and putting it before the General Assembly for review.
“The General Assembly has granted the board ‘the sole authority to determine what constitutes the practice of optometry’ in the commonwealth,” the opinion said. If the board decided substituting the Canadian test is acceptable, “it is not for this office to question the board’s conclusion.”
Still, the change prompted plenty of questions when it came before the legislature’s Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee and the joint Health Services Committee earlier this year.

Critics, largely affiliated with the national testing board, said Part 1, a multiple choice exam based on scientific and medical principals of optometry, is unique for the profession in the United States.
“There is no Canadian version of Part 1 of the national board,” said Dr. Jill Bryant, executive director of the national board, speaking at a July 30 legislative hearing,
But Dr. Joe Ellis, a Benton optometrist and president of Kentucky’s optometry board, said the state board believes the Canadian version is sufficient.
“This is mainly an issue of philosophy,” he said.
The legislature, when it is not in session, does not have the power to block the regulatory change though a committee can signal disapproval by finding it deficient. To block it, lawmakers would have to enact legislation, doing so when they next meet in January.
Meredith said he thinks the attorney general’s opinion likely settles the matter regarding the board’s power to substitute the Canadian exam and doubts the General Assembly will take further action.
While such opinions are advisory, they “are persuasive and public officials are expected to follow them,” according to the attorney general’s office.
Meredith said he defers to Rep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green and an optometrist who serves on the House Health Services Committee, who had expressed support for the board’s change.
“If he’s OK with it, I’m OK with it,” Meredith said. “I’ll yield to the people in the profession.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1178747552-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 16:58:26.798614

(Rendering courtesy of Atlas Agro)The Trump administration on Wednesday nixed funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and several hundred other federally-subsidized clean energy projects in Democratic-led states. 
Democratic politicians from Oregon and Washington state immediately cried foul and vowed to challenge what they called an “illegal” clawback of Congressionally-directed spending.
The tri-state Northwest hydrogen hub launched last year to funnel up to $1 billion in federal taxpayer funding to the region to kickstart production and use of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel. Private industry, truckmakers, transit and seaport partners were to bring large sums to the table in matching funds over the next eight to ten years.
But Trump administration officials voiced deep skepticism about climate and green energy initiatives championed by the previous Biden administration. 
In a social media post Wednesday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought celebrated the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in what he called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”
A follow-up news release that went out under Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s name said that his agency determined the cancelled projects did “not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub attracted bipartisan support locally as a means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray blasted the Trump administration in a statement for playing “some sort of sick political game” on the first day of the partial government shutdown.
“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Murray said.
In total, the Trump administration pulled funding for 223 clean energy projects in 16 states. Political observers quickly noted that nearly all of the cancelled projects were in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.
“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats – it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” Murray said. “I will be standing firm against this corrupt abuse of power – and every Republican should think carefully about what precedent they want to set by allowing this weaponization of taxpayer dollars.”
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a prepared statement Thursday that his office was working with state Attorney General Nick Brown to “fight this illegal action.”
Ironically, the majority of the hydrogen production infrastructure for the Northwest hub project was to be built in counties that voted for Trump, such as Benton and Lewis counties in Washington, Baker and Morrow counties in Oregon, and the St. Regis, Montana area.

The Trump administration Wednesday also cancelled the California clean hydrogen hub known as ARCHES, but left in place the funding for five other nascent hubs selected in a highly competitive national contest overseen by Biden’s Energy Department in 2023. 
Most of the surviving hubs align more closely with the current administration’s energy priorities by producing hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture or by using nuclear power.
Smaller, but not really small, clean energy grants pulled too 
A $250 million project to upgrade power transmission lines on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon was also reportedly on the list of federal grant terminations. The project was meant to increase capacity to transmit renewable electricity generated in central Oregon to customers in the Willamette Valley. A spokesperson for Portland General Electric, the transmission line’s owner, was unsure Thursday whether the utility had received a formal grant termination notice.

Aggrieved Democratic Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, shared a list of other project cancellations, which included four Department of Energy grants to Washington State University for solar energy and vehicle technology development, totalling nearly $10 million. 
The termination list also noted a bigger – nearly $68 million – hit to Bellevue, Washington-based truck maker PACCAR, which was to receive assistance for developing and manufacturing cleaner semi trucks.
Further down the casualty list was a $10 million award to CleanFiber to help that company build a new factory in Chehalis, Washington, to turn recycled cardboard into home insulation.
The Department of Energy said the sponsors of terminated projects have 30 days to appeal their canceled funding. Some recipients have already started the appeal process, according to the department. 
Big investments near Bellingham and Richland now in doubt
The biggest single component within the Northwest hydrogen hub was a planned $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, which was to produce hydrogen on site as a key ingredient. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro has already started permit applications for the big plant and lined up customers.
Close behind in terms of investment and scale, Calgary-based AltaGas had a plan to redevelop the closed Intalco aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.
It’s unclear what happens now. Both corporate boards had postponed making final investment decisions because of the uncertainty about federal subsidies and tax credits.
“Our investment in the Intalco lands remains a priority. We will continue to explore development opportunities that align with our values and deliver lasting benefits to the region,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.
Other smaller participants in the PNWH2 Hub had plans to build green hydrogen fueling and distribution infrastructure. Those outfits joined the hub to receive subsidies for design, construction and startup costs. 
Plans included hydrogen refueling stations for big trucks along Interstate 84 in Eastern Oregon and on I-90 in far western Montana as well as hydrogen fuel cell transit bus expansion in southwest Washington.
There were signs of trouble for the hub prior to this week – consequences of the slower-than-expected emergence of demand for hydrogen fuel and the high cost of production. A half dozen energy developers exited from various projects that were originally included in the Northwest hydrogen hub’s federal funding proposal. Notable names to get cold feet over the past year included Fortescue, Portland General Electric, Mitsubishi Power, First Mode and Puget Sound Energy. 
Prospective large-scale clean hydrogen producers Fortescue, Atlas Agro and AltaGas were also having a hard time locating affordable sources of renewable electricity in the quantities needed to split water molecules to make pure hydrogen.
In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.
“Whether or not this grant funding remains, I’m encouraged that the trail is now blazed for more development and projects to be delivered in this market and that there will be a bright future for H2 as a highly successful and lucrative energy product in the future in our region,” Green wrote.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state lawmaker is formally challenging regulations from the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that he says “override the clearly expressed will of Nebraska voters.”
A Thursday complaint led by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, a lawyer, narrows in on a handful of issues Cavanaugh cites in emergency regulations passed by the commission this summer. Commissioners hope to make the regulations final and have scheduled a 1 p.m. public hearing at the Nebraska State Office Building in Lincoln on Oct. 15 to receive feedback.
Among Cavanaugh’s complaints are that the regulations would:

Restrict the availability of medical cannabis products that could be sold at licensed dispensaries to a narrow list, while the law has no restrictions.
Only allow in-state health care practitioners to recommend medical cannabis, while voters approved allowing any physician to do so.
Prohibit smoking or vaping of medical cannabis, while the law expressly allows any device used for vaporization or inhalation.

“All without the benefit of a public hearing or public scrutiny, the commission and the governor have chosen to override the clearly expressed will of Nebraska voters,” Cavanaugh wrote to State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board.

Since December, Nebraskans have been able to legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, so long as they have a health care practitioner’s recommendation. But without licensed establishments, medical cannabis can’t yet be legally purchased in the state.
Voters gave the commission until July 1 to issue regulations and Oct. 1 to begin issuing licenses, a deadline that will be missed by at least a week following two commissioner resignations.
Complaint is first step
A state senator can formally challenge a state agency’s regulations and begin a process to receive a written response on how the targeted rules conform to legislative intent and why they’re needed. In November, 71% of Nebraska voters voted to legalize medical cannabis and 67% of voters voted to create the new regulatory commission.

Hansen will refer Cavanuagh’s complaint to State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the General Affairs Committee, who will consider requesting the Medical Cannabis Commission to engage. The commission would have 60 days to respond if requested.
Holdcroft said Thursday he had not yet seen Cavanaugh’s complaint but would review it. Cavanaugh is vice chair of the General Affairs Committee.
Hansen, who noted he serves as only an “intermediary” in the complaint process, says he does feel Cavanaugh’s complaint is “legitimate,” partly because of the missed licensing deadline.
“Not only because that’s what the people voted on, specifically the dates, but I think it could potentially open up the state to a lawsuit by the delay,” Hansen said. “I think it’s a legitimate complaint to look at and maybe have us as a Legislature look into things if we need to.”
Cavanaugh suggested pairing his complaint with an Oct. 31 hearing on Legislative Resolution 226, an interim study introduced by Cavanaugh with support from Holdcroft and Hansen to see how the voter-approved medical cannabis laws are being implemented.
Holdcroft says he intends to invite commissioners and Nebraskans who led the 2024 ballot measure to that hearing and see what might need to be done in the 2026 legislative session to get the program “the way we want it to be run in Nebraska, whatever that is.”

Nebraska judges have legal discretion to strike down any regulation “if it violates constitutional provisions, exceeds statutory authority of the agency or was adopted without compliance with the statutory procedures.”
Lawmakers upheld that judicial power this spring and, beginning in May, permitted any such lawsuit to be filed in any district court, no longer just Lancaster County District Court.
Commission regulations
Included in the proposed regulations is a requirement that only in-state physicians could be part of a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory.” Only those Nebraska practitioners could refer patients to licensed Nebraska dispensaries. Participating physicians would also need to complete annual education related to medical cannabis.
Cavanaugh said while such education might make sense, that is a policy choice for the Legislature. He noted the Legislature had the choice to create a more restrictive medical cannabis program this spring but ultimately did not.
Lawmakers this spring also failed to pass legal protections for physicians who recommend medical cannabis, which Cavanaugh urged as the executive branch intensifies legal pressure.
“The commission is not free to adopt its own definition of cannabis that is more restrictive than the definition contained in statute,” Cavanaugh wrote.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The regulations would similarly restrict Nebraskans from accessing certain types of cannabis, including raw flower, vapes and delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the part of the plant most associated with a “high.” Patients would also be limited to up to 5 grams of delta-9 THC every 90 days. Five ounces is the equivalent of 141 grams.
Cavanaugh wrote it would take seven years for a patient to obtain 5 ounces of delta-9 THC, yet voters set no THC restriction.
Under the regulations, up to four cultivators could each possess up to 1,250 flowering plants at one time as they work with up to four product manufacturers and 12 dispensaries statewide.
In addition to the regulatory public hearing on Oct. 15, written comments can be submitted up to 11:59 p.m. Oct. 15 by mail to the Nebraska Medical Commission, PO Box 95046, Lincoln, NE 68509-5046; by fax at 402-471-2814 or by email to mcc.contact@nebraska.gov.
Medicinal vs. recreational
Gov. Jim Pillen, who approved the emergency regulations, including with his stipulation of a plant cap, will eventually decide whether to finalize a future set of regulations. He has said his appointees will ensure Nebraska’s cannabis program stays medicinal.


Upcoming medical cannabis dates
Oct. 7, 2 p.m. — Meeting to approve first cultivator licenses (Nebraska State Office Building, 1st floor hearing room).
Oct. 15, 1 p.m. — Public hearing on proposed regulations and final day to submit written comments (Nebraska State Office Building, Meadowlark Room).
Oct. 17, 5 p.m. — Deadline to apply for 1st and 3rd Congressional District vacancies on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, members of which also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission (Apply online or by mailing an application to the Governor’s Office).
Oct. 31, 9 a.m. — Legislative hearing on the implementation of medical cannabis in Nebraska, pushed by State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Ben Hansen and Rick Holdcroft (Nebraska State Capitol, Room 1023).


Hansen led Legislative Bill 677 this spring with the support of longtime medical cannabis advocates. It was meant to help the commission by putting many regulations already in law. At multiple public forums that Hansen, Cavanaugh and Holdcroft led, voters said they would support recreational marijuana if state leaders stood in the way of medical cannabis.
“If the commission, the governor and some state senators fear recreational marijuana is the next step, I can only say that the surest way to guarantee the voters take that next step is by frustrating their clearly expressed will in favor of medical cannabis,” Cavanaugh said Tuesday.
The two resignations on the Liquor Control Commission this Monday, sought and received by Pillen, followed federal public corruption charges unsealed last week against the former executive director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission. He has pleaded not guilty.
The three liquor commissioners also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission. No commissioner was implicated in the federal indictment.
Holdcroft said he was “completely surprised” by the alleged behavior of the former director. However, he said the Liquor Control Commission’s mid-September hiring of Micah Chaffee, who worked for Holdcroft and the General Affairs Committee as a research assistant, is an “excellent choice” with Chaffee’s familiarity with liquor and cannabis issues.
“He’s a family man. He has high moral standards. I have great respect for him and his ability,” Holdcroft said of Chaffee. “I think with his leadership and the governor’s appointment of some quality commissioners to replace the two that have resigned, I think we should be OK.”
‘The Legislature must act’
The Medical Cannabis Commission will return next Tuesday when it is expected to vote on the first cultivator licenses. Still, getting from seed to sale likely won’t occur until at least mid-2026.
Some lawmakers voted against Hansen’s LB 677 in May because they wanted to wait for legal challenges to play out against the laws, challenges that continue to this date and remain threatened. Among those threatening legal action is the Nebraska Attorney General’s office. Cavanaugh said the regulatory process has also increased legal risk.
Other senators wanted to give the commission time to act, which Cavanaugh said is now a “moot argument.”
Said Cavanaugh: “The Legislature must act to ensure that the will of the voters is observed.”

The number of job openings and the number of hires in Mississippi didn’t change much in July. There were 10,000 less separations — employees who left voluntarily, were laid off or fired — month to month. 
Gov. Tate Reeves celebrated the state’s record high for total non-farm employment at 1,205,500. This was up by 16,200 compared with August 2024. In the announcement, Reeves called it “another great day for our state.” 
Mississippi’s labor force participation rate dropped slightly in August to 55.9%. It reached over 56% in February 2025, the first time it has reached that peak since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Mississippi’s labor force participation rate has historically been at or near the lowest in the nation, and is lower than the national rate, which was 62.3% in August.
Mississippi was one of two states where real GDP decreased in the second quarter of 2025. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP declined by 0.9%. Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting were the largest contributors to this change.

Earlier this year it announced production delays for two electric SUVs. The hybrid-powered Xterra had been discontinued in the U.S. a decade ago. Nissan and other auto makers are shifting away from fully electric autos. This follows a slowdown in electric vehicle demand and the end of federal EV tax credits.
Nissan was the first car manufacturer in Mississippi. The Canton plant opened in 2003. The Nissan plant has been described as “the cornerstone of Mississippi’s automotive industry” and is credited with attracting other car manufacturers and suppliers to the state.

Independent Living Systems Vice President for Government Affairs Carol Gormley told the Florida Phoenix that 323 people had enrolled in the organization’s Medicaid managed-care plan, Florida Community Care, since Oct. 1. That’s when the expansion of the Medicaid program from a pilot for people with intellectual and developmentally disabilities in seven counties and became available in all 67 counties.
The 323 new members live in 44 counties, Gormley told the Florida Phoenix.
The Agency for Health Care Administration “has been working to distribute information and facilitate the enrollment process,” Gormley said in a written statement when asked about the enrollment growth.

The agency staged three regional town hall meetings about the new Medicaid managed care programs for self-advocates, parents, and providers. Arc Broward and The Arc Tampa Bay hosted two of the meetings, with the latter drawing more than 100 people, Summer Pfeiffer, CEO of the Arc of Florida, told the Florida Phoenix. Arc is a nonprofit that serves people with these disabilities.
AHCA staff and Gormley attended all three meetings and Agency for Persons with Disabilities (ADP)  Director Bob Asztalos spoke at one of the meetings.

“I kept thinking to myself,  these are two-hour meetings, do we really need two hours? But the questions that were generated from families that were in attendance and providers that were there ….  I mean, it was a lot of questions. I think everybody felt heard,” Pfeiffer said, recalling the Tampa Bay-area meeting.
Turns out the two hours wasn’t enough, at least for the Tampa Bay meeting, Pfeiffer continued, recalling that people lingered afterward to get the answers to additional questions.
“There were quite a few parents that, you know, you could tell they needed more,” Pfeiffer said.
The new statewide Medicaid managed care program for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities was championed by House Speaker Daniel Perez.
The program was first approved in 2023 as a pilot program designed to care for up to 600 individuals on the Medicaid iBudget wait list. That program provides clients with money for services to help with activities of daily living such as grooming, eating, and bathing. Those services allow clients to live in their communities and outside of institutions. APD serves 35,790 individuals through iBudget Florida.
But the Legislature hasn’t provided the funds needed to enroll everyone who qualifies for iBudget and there’s a lengthy wait list for services — exceeding 21,000 people when the Legislature passed HB 1103 this spring. Despite a slow start-up for the pilot (there were just 358 enrollees in May),  HB 1103 grew the program from its original footprint in Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties and expanded it statewide.
Now there are 700 enrollees in Florida Community Care, with 323 new members enrolling since Oct. 1.
Citing AHCA estimates, Gormley says there’s enough funding to enroll 2,000 people who are on the Medicaid iBudget wait list into the new managed care program.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SALEM — Spending 12 hours a day in his combine this week, harvesting amber rows of soybeans he planted in the spring, Andrew Streff has time to think — and it’s hard not to think about the ongoing trade dispute with China.
The country is boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
“China hasn’t purchased any soybeans from the United States this year, thanks to the president,” said Streff, who farms near Salem. “Our beans are the cheapest in the world, by about $2 a bushel, but this trade war is keeping them out of China — our biggest customer.”

Robert Lee is harvesting 300 acres of soybeans on his land near De Smet. He said many farmers are hesitant to blame Trump for bad bean prices.
“But the fact is, China imported 120 million metric tons of soybeans this year and not one bushel came from the U.S.,” Lee said. “That’s a direct result of this trade war.”
Farmers were similarly affected by trade disputes during Trump’s first term. Congress responded with $24.5 billion of aid for farmers in 2018 and 2019, according to the Congressional Research Service. The relief paid for farmers’ lost income by providing direct payments in its place.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said during a Sept. 26 public event in Rapid City that the federal government will probably have to help farmers again.
“I have talked to the president about this, because some of this is a result of tariff policies, trade relationships, etc. — China’s not buying soybeans today,” Thune said. “And so I think, inevitably, what’s going to happen is they’ll probably end up doing what we did a few years ago, because of loss of markets.”
Thune said that’s something “none of us want.”
“But I think some of that tariff revenue that’s coming in probably will end up heading in that direction,” he said.
Trump’s tariffs will increase federal tax revenues by an estimated $171 billion this year, according to a Sept. 26 report from the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, tax policy research nonprofit.
On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration is considering aid to farmers. He said in an interview with CNBC that farmers “should expect some news on Tuesday” about “substantial support for our farmers, especially the soybean farmers.”
Jerry Schmitz is the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association. He said U.S. soybean prices are down more than a dollar per bushel from last year, from over $11 down to $10, with South Dakota prices another 80 cents to $1.35 lower. Local grain elevators are struggling because exports through the Pacific Northwest into Asian countries have slowed to a trickle.
Based on the number of soybean acres planted this year, Schmitz said a $1 drop in price equates to about $250 million of lost income for South Dakota farmers.
$500 million soybean processing plant opens in Mitchell

A tariff is a tax paid by importers, with the cost often passed along in prices charged to customers. Schmitz said the impact of tariffs on farmers goes beyond the obvious. An example is a rise in fertilizer prices, “partly due to inflation, but exacerbated by the tariffs.”
Streff, the Salem-area farmer, also works as a commodities broker in Mitchell. He said farmers like him who locked in a price with a grain buyer months before harvest are doing better, but “you were gambling on the future.”
“A lot of farmers were hoping the president learned from the last time around,” he said. “But it didn’t surprise me — he campaigned on doing these tariffs. The U.S. elected someone who likes to pick fights with other countries, and now we’re in the middle of it.”
He said others waited to see how the crop would turn out and if trade relations with China would improve. They haven’t.
Farm leaders and state officials are creating new domestic soybean uses, including a $500 million soybean processing plant in Mitchell that will mostly use soybeans to make renewable diesel and livestock feed.
Streff said that’s encouraging, but it won’t replace the demand of a country with 1.4 billion people who like soybean-fed pork.
“It’s not going to solve all our problems,” he said.
It’s a point Thune echoed while in Rapid City.
“We need to get the Chinese market back at some point because we sell a ton,” Thune said. “Sixty percent of our soybeans are exported, mostly to China. And so we’ve got to have those export markets.”

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)A South Korean battery component maker has backed out of plans to build a $152.5 million electrolyte manufacturing facility that would have brought 190 jobs to Haywood County.
Enchem America announced its plan to build on the “shovel ready” I-40 Advantage Industrial Park in Brownsville in 2023. 
The site is roughly 16 miles from BlueOval City, a massive electric vehicle manufacturing campus slated to produce Ford Motor Company’s new all-electric pickup truck and electric vehicle batteries in partnership with SK On. The BlueOval City campus is expected to serve as manufacturing space for BlueOval SK, Ford and electric vehicle component suppliers, injecting jobs and residents into the surrounding rural West Tennessee communities.
The Enchem facility would have produced electrolytes used for electric vehicle batteries, and was expected to magnify the company’s ability to supply and support its electric vehicle partners in the United States.
Enchem decided to withdraw from the project in mid-September “after careful consideration and an extensive review of (their) North American business strategy,” Brownsville-Haywood County Economic Development Corporation Executive Director Aaron Stewart wrote in an email to the corporation’s board members and West Tennessee mayors on Sept. 26.
The decision was “primarily driven by a recent shift in demand from (their) key North American customers,” the company stated, according to Stewart. 
Enchem America did not respond to a request for comment.
The project cancellation comes amid continuing shifts in the electric vehicle market. Ford Motor Company announced it will delay mass production of the next-generation pickup truck at BlueOval City until 2028, though Ford still plans to start producing prototypes of the truck there in 2027.

Stewart told Tennessee Lookout that his agency is working to terminate the state incentives Enchem was set to receive for the project. The company received a $2 million recruitment grant in 2023, according to a state database. 
Stewart added that he will work with the state and the Tennessee Valley Authority — which has contributed grant funds to prepare the industrial park for future development — to put the site back on the market. 
Enchem completed preliminary site grading but had not yet begun construction. 
“It’s not like they’re abandoning a facility,” Stewart said.
Though it will take time to get the site back on the market, Stewart said it “always generated interest because of its proximity to Memphis and Jackson,” and all of the site preparation that has already been completed as part of the state’s Select Tennessee Certified Sites program.
“With BlueOval City just down the road, and production beginning in 2027 and mass production in 2028, whether (a new tenant is) automotive or anything else, I suspect it’ll begin to draw interest just like it did before, and we’ll work closely again with the state and TVA partners to market that site,” he said.
More details about the site’s future will be discussed at the Brownsville-Haywood Economic Development Corporation board meeting on Oct. 8.
Stewart said he is not concerned by uncertainty in the electric vehicle market, which is still evolving.
“It’s almost like the automotive industry is trying to look into a crystal ball,” he said. “And when you’re trying to navigate policies coming out of Washington, when you’re trying to navigate international supply chains from rare earth metals all the way to aluminum production, tariffs, trade agreements — I mean, I don’t envy the automakers trying to figure out how to chart a course for the next 12 months, let alone the next five to 10 years.”
He highlights the $5.6 billion investment in the BlueOval City campus.
“There’s nearly 11 million square feet under a roof, machinery and equipment is still being installed and calibrated, albeit at a slower pace,” Stewart said.

This story was originally reported by Jasmine Mithani of The 19th.  Meet Jasmine and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Roughly 19 women are killed with a firearm in domestic violence homicide-suicides each month, according to a new report released Thursday from Everytown for Gun Safety shared exclusively with The 19th.
“When we look at the public discourse on gun violence or on gun violence prevention, it tends to surround very public mass shootings,” said Sonali Rajan, senior director of research at the gun violence prevention nonprofit that advocates for gun control. The type of violence covered in the new report is a “conflation of two public health and public safety crises” — intimate partner violence and suicide.
Ninety-nine percent of incidents in the report, which looks at data from 2014 to 2020, involved a man shooting a woman. Men make up 87 percent of suicides by firearm in the United States.
“Firearms make it five times more likely that an abuser will kill their female partner,” Rajan said. Access to a gun also increases the likelihood of death by suicide because of impulsivity and the lethality of firearms.
Nearly 5,500 women were killed by an intimate partner across seven years of data, according to Everytown. In a third of those instances, the abuser then killed themselves and 85 percent of those dual tragedies involved a firearm. The figure is likely underrepresented due to uneven state-by-state data collection. It also doesn’t include women who were injured by their partner’s firearm, or threatened with one.
Crucially, this type of lethal violence is preventable. Policy analysis showed that states with strong gun control laws had three times fewer incidents of domestic violence homicide-suicide versus states with the weakest legal codes.
“The lethality and accessibility of firearms give abusers in suicidal crisis the ability to overpower and harm multiple people with little chance for intervention or survival,” according to the report.
When an abuser shoots their partner, then kills themself, the trauma ripples through a community. Everytown gathered a focus group of 43 survivors of this type of violence last year, and participants reported that children were witnesses in 43 percent of domestic-violence homicide suicides.
One tool Everytown points to that can help prevent such crimes is an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO), which confiscates firearms from someone deemed to be an immediate threat to themselves or others.
A study of Oregon’s ERPO law found such orders were most frequently issued against someone at risk of suicide — important because 1 in 4 members of Everytown’s focus group said perpetrators of intimate partner homicide-suicide had a history of suicidal behaviors.
“Research very clearly shows that laws that are intended to disarm abusers work and they’re really, really critical to the safety of survivors,” Rajan said. A paper from 2018 found states that prevent subjects of domestic violence restraining orders from owning a gun had a permanent reduction in intimate partner homicides. Extreme risk orders have been shown to result in fewer suicides.

Doreen Dodgen-Magee was among the people who testified in support of creating Oregon’s law. Thirty years ago, she held a party on the eve of her niece’s first day of kindergarten. Family and loved ones filled Sarah’s backpack with love notes and well wishes. The next day, Dodgen-Magee got a phone call saying Sarah’s father had shot and killed Sarah, her younger siblings, Rachel and April, and their mother, Laura, in a fit of jealous rage. He also shot Dodgen-Magee’s mother-in-law, Margaret, who survived but needed a caretaker for the rest of her life.
Dodgen-Magee believes an ERPO could have helped save Laura and her children.
“It’s not just having those laws in place, but then doing the really hard work of making sure that everyone in the community knows about them,” she said.
ERPOs didn’t yet exist in Oregon in 1995. Dodgen-Magee and her husband had helped Laura recognize the signs of an abusive relationship and supported her when she filed for divorce. Laura’s ex had a history of violence; after she moved out to live with her mom, he broke into their house and raped her. Laura filed for a restraining order, but it didn’t prevent her death.
After the shooting, Dodgen-Magee found journals where Laura wrote down her fears of her ex killing her. She wrote that if anything happened to her, Dodgen-Magee and her husband should get custody of her children. But Laura’s ex was able to get a gun and kill them all.
Today, Dodgen-Magee is a psychologist and teaches continuing education units for other practitioners. In every training, she has participants look up ERPO laws in their state and save the appropriate hotline to their phone. The laws don’t do any good if the people equipped to help aren’t aware of them, or the women who are in danger don’t know about their existence.
There isn’t a day that goes by without Dodgen-Magee reflecting on her lost family members and how the tragedy has shaped her life.
“I feel more compelled than I do called to this work. I feel like I must,” she said. “I must make the world understand that these were four beautiful, beautiful, important people in the world who should still be here, and could still be here if we could come together around making sure that people who shouldn’t own firearms or have access to them don’t.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sig-Sauer.jpg,,,2025-10-02 15:57:33.625133

(Daily Montanan photo)Missoula County District Court Judge Shane Vannatta recused himself from hearing a lawsuit over a bill that says there are only two sexes, but he noted the “facts” in a move to disqualify him are “exceedingly thin.”
In a Sept. 25 court filing, Vannatta said he would withdraw from jurisdiction of the case “in the interest of preserving the public’s confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary.”
The case from which he withdrew is Perkins vs. State of Montana, over House Bill 121.
HB 121 restricts access to public restrooms and other facilities based on an individual’s sex assigned at birth.
The plaintiffs, including transgender and intersex Montanans, argue the restrictions violate their rights to equal protection, privacy and ability to pursue life’s basic necessities.
Supporters argue the bill adds protection and safety for women.
In Montana, either party can move to substitute a judge for “no cause” within 30 days of the first summons being served, but the State of Montana did not do so in the Perkins case.
Attorney General spokespeople Chase Scheuer and Amy Braynack did not respond Thursday to a question about why the state did not move to substitute the judge; the Attorney General’s Office also did not answer the question in September.
In August, Attorney General Austin Knudsen and the Department of Justice filed a motion to “disqualify for cause” and alleged bias.
The state pointed to a news article Vannatta posted on social media before he was a judge and a couple of groups he follows on Instagram as evidence he should not oversee the lawsuit.
Vannatta took office in 2019 as the youngest judge in the district and first openly gay judge to serve in Montana, the Missoulian reported.
But the judge said the average person would likely not “reasonably question” his lack of bias after deconstructing the state’s allegations.
Vannatta already had ruled against the state in Perkins by granting a preliminary injunction, but citing an earlier order, the judge said “previous adverse rulings against a party” aren’t enough to show bias or prejudice either.
In his response, the judge outlined the standards for disqualification and the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct.
A disqualifying circumstance includes statements made “while a judge,” the response said. It also pointed to court guidance that said “schemes to drive a judge out of a case should not be allowed.”
The judge said the only “extrajudicial statement” the state cited is his characterization on social media of a 2017 TIME Magazine article as “fascinating” — a comment he said is “neutral on its face” and was posted two years before he became a judge and six years before the current case.
The TIME story was called “Gender Laws Are at Odds with Science.” In its motion, the state alleged Vannatta showed bias because he posted content that noted “the legal recognition of only two biological sexes is ‘incongruous with science.’”
The state also pointed to two Facebook “likes” on comments with the post, but Vannatta said he “liked” comments where others said “transpeople should be treated as people.”
He said he, and all judicial officers, have a duty to treat “transpeople as people in his professional and personal conduct.”
“Although made before he assumed the bench, the remarks align with the ethical duties of judicial officers,” Vannatta wrote.
“A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, or engage in harassment, including but not limited to bias, prejudice, or harassment based upon” a number of factors, including sex, gender, and sexual orientation, as emphasized by Vannatta in this case.
The judge also said the state pointed to two liberal channels he follows on Instagram, but it “conveniently neglected to identify” conservative channels he follows, nor did it indicate whether he agreed with any content.
“Following channels on Instagram is akin to watching programming on television,” the judge said.
He said the state’s tactic was like snapping a photo of a judge watching TV in Walmart’s electronics department and attributing all the content — from Fox News or CNN or another channel — to the judge.
“Not only is the attribution preposterous, but it is patently unfair and misleading,” the judge wrote.
The judge said a “learned individual” needs to be able to canvass all news and commentary, not just material that’s politically correct.
“The State appears to want a judge who has never thought about the issue of transgenderism in society and who watches no news or commentary,” the judge wrote.
“That is unrealistic, especially in the present media environment where the issue of transgendered individuals is seemingly discussed on a daily basis.”
Knudsen and his team also said Vannatta’s work for the American Bar Association’s Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity starting in 2012 raised questions of bias.
In an affidavit, Michael Noonan with the Department of Justice said Vannatta’s social media “presence” and affiliation with the Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity were “unknown to me or any other defense counsel in this matter until very recently.”
Vannatta, though, said his professional history is “well-known” and was disclosed through two separate judicial appointment applications, one in February 2015 and one in October 2018.
“Both applications were public and available for comment,” the judge said.
Although the judge said he brings a wealth of experience to the bench, and it may be different than what heterosexual judges bring, his experience “does not presume bias or prejudice absent some statement or conduct.”
Nonetheless, Vannatta said he would step aside to protect the judiciary.
“With great reluctance and concern for the future misuse of the disqualification statute, the better approach is to recuse and allow another district judge to assume jurisdiction,” the judge wrote.
Given the recusal, Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Cory Swanson ruled the disqualification motion from the state as moot.
The chief justice will appoint a different judge to hear the case, according to the Clerk of Court; a timeframe was not immediately available.

,California,2025-10-02 19:23:51+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom vetoes bill for sober homeless housing,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/10/newsom-ab-255-veto/,The bill by a San Francisco Democrat would have allowed some state-funded homeless housing projects to require sobriety.,"In summary
The bill by a San Francisco Democrat would have allowed some state-funded homeless housing projects to require sobriety.


Lawmakers’ efforts to free up state money for sober homeless housing have been thwarted for a second year in a row, after Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that had sailed to his desk with few “no” votes.
Assembly Bill 255 would have allowed cities and counties to spend up to 10% of their state funding on “recovery housing,” where people live in a sober environment and work on overcoming an addiction. The move would have tweaked California’s “housing first” strategy, which generally frowns on programs that put up barriers to housing — such as requiring people to stay clean or participate in treatment. 
“It’s disappointing that the Governor vetoed AB 255,” the bill’s author, Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat, said in a statement. “This bill was about giving people in recovery a real choice to have safe, sober housing when they need it. Californians who are working hard to stay sober are often forced into housing where drug use is allowed, and that puts their recovery and their lives at risk.”
The governor said the bill was unnecessary and would have created a “duplicative and costly new statutory category” for recovery housing. “Recent guidance” already allows cities and counties to spend state homelessness funds on sober housing, Newsom said in his veto message. 
That was news to Haney.
“Unfortunately that is not the understanding shared by housing providers themselves, the legislature, the cities, counties and their attorneys, or people seeking recovery housing,” he said in a text to CalMatters. “I hope that the Governor can urgently issue clear guidance that drug-free recovery housing is fully allowed under current law and authorize the use of state funds for these facilities.”
Without that guidance, housing providers will be unable to move forward on sober living projects, local governments will remain confused and the state will continue its pattern of not investing in sober housing, Haney said. 
Newsom’s office did not respond to an email asking for more detail on the state’s policies for funding sober housing. 
“California remains committed to advancing recovery housing within Housing First,” Newsom said in his veto message. “I encourage the author and stakeholders to continue working with my Administration to strengthen these options in ways that complement, rather than complicate, the state’s approach.” 
The bill would have set up a new system for the state’s housing department to regulate recovery housing, which would have cost an estimated $4.12 million in the first year, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee’s analysis. Recovery programs would have paid a fee for state certification. But those fees, likely amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, would not entirely offset the state’s costs, according to the analysis. 
“I was a little surprised,” Sharon Rapport, California state policy director for the Corporation for Supportive Housing, said of the governor’s veto. “But when I thought about it, I thought it probably did make sense, because part of the bill does require a certification program to be created, and there wasn’t funding for that.”

Rapport’s organization worked with Haney’s office on some amendments to the bill, including reducing the percentage of state funding that can go to sober housing from 25% down to 10%. 
Newsom’s veto message referenced the original 25% version of the bill. His office did not respond to an email asking why he used the old number. 
In an effort to adhere to housing first principles, Haney’s bill specified that recovery housing residents wouldn’t be evicted just for relapsing. If they no longer wanted to participate in recovery, they could have continued living onsite until the program operator found them a new place to live. 
This was Haney’s second attempt to funnel state money into recovery housing. His first, Assembly Bill 2479, died last year amid worries that it would siphon too much money away from low-barrier housing, and that people might lose their placement if they relapsed.
Since 2016, California has required housing providers to adopt a “housing first” model, which emphasizes getting people into housing even if they are addicted to drugs or alcohol, or struggling with a mental illness. Instead of requiring people to participate in treatment programs as a condition of getting housing, providers offer voluntary services. The idea is to get people housed as quickly and easily as possible, because it’s much easier to tackle someone’s other problems – such as their drug addiction – once the person has a roof over their head.

 Matt Haney
 Democrat, State Assembly, District 17 (San Francisco)



While both Haney and the governor are attempting to work sober housing into California’s existing housing first strategy, the federal administration, meanwhile, is attempting to blow up the entire policy. 
President Donald Trump this summer issued an executive order directing federal agencies to end support for ‘housing first’ policies that “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency.” It directs those agencies to require people participating in federally-funded housing programs to participate in addiction and mental health treatment.
Haney said he remains a firm believer in housing first.
“I  don’t think it is at all intended to help us be more responsive and effective,” he said of the federal policy change. “It’s intended to undermine responses to homelessness and affordable housing.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/013125_Father-Joes-Villages_AH_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 15:57:33.625133

Patrick Morrisey announced that West Virginia State Police have arrested 37 undocumented immigrants during a news conference Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025 at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo courtesy of West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)West Virginia State Police, in coordination with federal immigration officials, has arrested 37 undocumented immigrants in the past 11 days.
“If you are here in West Virginia illegally, you’re not welcome here,” said Col. Jim Mitchell, WVSP superintendent, at the state Capitol on Thursday. “We value the dignity of every human being, but we want you here legally.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey is vigorously supporting President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, partnering with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for its 287(g) program that gives specially-trained police officers and National Guard members the authority to make certain immigration arrests.
At a press conference, Morrisey announced the additional arrest of undocumented immigrants at traffic stops along the West Virginia Turnpike and DUI checkpoints.
“These arrests happened in just 11 days,” Morrisey said. “This is proof that the problem is far more widespread than some want to admit.”
“I do expect more will be coming,” he added. “We’re going to take any legal action necessary to protect the residents of our state from illegal aliens and the drug trade.”
Morrisey said some of the individuals apprehended were previously charged with crimes. Newly-released ICE data showed immigrants with no criminal record were now the largest group in the country’s immigration detention centers.
The state’s Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation has also been involved in Morrisey’s partnership with ICE, and since the beginning of this year, more than 1,000 immigrant detainees have been booked through the state’s correctional system. They’re usually held in the state’s jails for up to 12 weeks.
Three of the state’s jails are renting beds to ICE for $90 a day for immigrant detainees from around the country. From June 2024 to July of this year, the state billed ICE for a total of $339,615.
Earlier this year, Morrisey issued an executive order directing the West Virginia Department of Home Security, state police and  the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation to fully cooperate with ICE.
The governor also announced that state police on Sept. 10 conducted one of the largest fentanyl seizures in state history in Mercer County. It included 54 pounds of suspected fentanyl and 70 pounds of suspected crystal meth. The estimated street value of the fentanyl alone is $825,000, according to Morrisey. 
The arrests followed a month-long investigation. The governor clarified that the people arrested in this case were not undocumented immigrants.
“We’re going to keep the drugs off our streets. We want to protect people as much as we can,” Morrisey said. “This is a higher priority for this administration than the state’s ever seen.”

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Escambia County did not violate students’ First Amendment rights in keeping from them a book about two male penguins raising a chick together, a federal judge found this week. 
In a suit between the authors of the book and the Escambia County School Board, Chief U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor sided with the county. 
The suit focuses on Escambia County’s removal from its school libraries of “And Tango Makes Three,” a book about two male penguins, Roy and Silo, raising a penguin chick, Tango, in a zoo.
The plaintiffs, authors Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson, as well as an unnamed student, alleged the book was removed “based solely on disagreement with the book’s viewpoint,” which they said “illustrates that same-sex parents exist, that they can adopt and raise offspring, and have healthy and happy families.”
Escambia County argued that curation in a school library does not implicate student or author First Amendment rights. 
“I agree, and that is enough to resolve this case,” Winsor wrote. 
In a summary judgement, Winsor found that students and the authors were not discriminated against  based on content or viewpoint, nor were students’ rights to receive information impaired. 
“In sum, the board did not violate the First Amendment when it decided to remove Tango from its school libraries. This does not, of course, keep the book (or any viewpoint in it) from [student] B.G. or any other student,” Winsor wrote. 
“The Escambia County School Board has simply decided students wanting this particular book will have to get it elsewhere.”

Curation and government speech
In an 18-page order, Winsor, an appointee of President Donald Trump, spent much of it discussing curation and government speech. 
“There are fair arguments that a library’s selecting books is not expressive at all,” Winsor wrote. “School officials decide what books to have in the library, just as they decide what furniture to have in the classroom and what food to provide for school lunch. At some level, any decision could be considered expressive: one could argue that a school district’s decision to have peas and carrots for lunch constitutes its saying it thinks peas and carrots are worth eating.”
“And of course books themselves are expressive, unlike most school lunches. All of this is to say that it is unclear whether making library books available in school libraries constitutes expression.”
In August, a federal judge in Orlando ruled the state law banning school library books to be “overbroad and unconstitutional.”
The Escambia County case was filed in September 2023.
“The good news is I need not decide the difficult government-speech issue to resolve the case. If book curation is government speech, the board wins on the merits because the First Amendment would not reach its speech. And even if book curation is not government speech, the board still wins on the merits: when the government decides which books to choose, it is not creating a forum for others to speak, and it is not otherwise implicating Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. Either way, the First Amendment offers Plaintiffs no protection, and the board is entitled to summary judgment.”
The case was originally filed in the Middle District with complaints against Lake County officials and state education officials, although it was transferred to the Northern District and defendants including the superintendent of Escambia County were dropped, except for the Escambia County’s school board.
“The Author Plaintiffs have no First Amendment right to speak through the library, and [student] B.G. has no First Amendment right to receive the Author Plaintiffs’ message through the library,” Winsor wrote.

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected a motion from Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen to stay the case. The order comes after Gov. Kay Ivey announced Friday that she would not call a special session for the Legislature to redraw the map.
Allen requested the pause in the case because he believes that a similar redistricting case in the U.S. Supreme Court would change the precedent in which Manasco ruled the Senate districts violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Manasco wrote that the stay would not solve the district issue before the 2026 midterm elections, one of two elections that would be impacted by a new map. 
“The legal test this court applied in that injunction has been the controlling test for forty years … and the Supreme Court reiterated it as recently as two years ago in an Alabama case involving substantial evidentiary overlap with this case,” Manasco wrote. 
Manasco appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023: Richard Allen as the special master, David Ely as his cartographer, and Michael Scodro and his law firm, Mayer Brown LLP, as the special master’s legal counsel. 
Manasco also said that the redrawing of the districts is currently in the public’s best interest.
“Alabamians have the right to vote under lawful electoral plans, and the Court has enjoined the current map as unlawful,” she wrote.

Tim Walz’s closest advisor, who helped the second-term Democrat manage an array of crises and shepherd through progressive wins during the 2023 legislative session, will leave his government role to work for Walz’s reelection for an unprecedented third, four-year term.
Chris Schmitter, who has served as Walz’s chief of staff since he took office in 2019, will leave the governor’s office at the end of this month and become a senior advisor to Walz and his reelection campaign.
“When I first became governor, I set a goal of making Minnesota the best state for kids, and I tasked Chris with making that vision a reality,” Walz said in a statement Thursday. “Nobody had a bigger hand in driving Minnesota’s nation-leading child tax credit than Chris.”
Schmitter, a Rochester native, is Minnesota’s longest serving chief of staff to a governor in state history, the governor’s office said. He’s guided Walz through the pandemic, the police murder of George Floyd and its aftermath, a spike in crime, a national political run and the assassination of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and the manhunt that followed.
Prior to working for Walz, Schmitter was an attorney with Greene Espel, though he’s been working for and otherwise in Walz’s orbit since the governor’s days representing southern Minnesota in Congress.
As chief of staff, Schmitter regularly meets with Minnesota corporate executives, labor and legislative leaders on the governor’s behalf and is responsible for managing Walz’s policy agenda and the day-to-day of the governor’s office.
Patrick Tanis, currently a deputy chief of staff, will become Walz’s next chief of staff. Tanis has worked with Walz since 2005 when Walz first ran for Congress in the 1st Congressional District.

Work has temporarily resumed under a federal judge's order in D.C., but a separate lawsuit filed by attorneys general in Rhode Island remains under consideration. (Photo courtesy of Ørsted)The newest strategy employed by the Trump administration to drag out potential legal consequences: a federal shutdown.
That’s the logic presented by the U.S. Department of Justice asking for more time to respond to a federal lawsuit filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general over the Revolution Wind project.
“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the attorneys wrote in a two-page filing submitted in federal court in Rhode Island Wednesday. 
Wednesday marked the first full day of the federal government shutdown after Congress failed to pass a spending plan for the new fiscal year. It was also the deadline for Justice Department attorneys to submit a written response in Rhode Island federal court on whether the judge should temporarily bar the Trump administration from interfering in the offshore wind project being built south of Rhode Island’s coastline.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong filed the lawsuit on Sept. 4, 13 days after federal regulators ordered work to stop on the 65-turbine wind project, which was already 80% complete. Orsted and Skyborn Renewables, the companies co-developing the project, filed their own lawsuit on the same day in federal court in D.C. 
A D.C. judge already granted the developers’ request for temporary relief, with a bench ruling on Sept. 22 that allows work to resume on the project while the court case plays out.
In Rhode Island, the AGs’ request for a preliminary injunction, keeping the administration from interfering with the wind project, remains pending.
The AGs pushed back against the Justice Department’s shutdown reasoning as rationale for an extension. Federal law specifies that only voluntary services “exceeding those authorized by law,” are banned during the shutdown. The case, and its implications for the two states whose economies, electric grids and decarbonization mandates depend upon the project’s completion, is not voluntary, the AGs wrote in a two-page response Wednesday. 
Even before the shutdown, Justice Department lawyers sought more time to submit their required response to the court, or to suspend the pending motion entirely because of the D.C. judge’s order.
“It makes little sense to proceed right now with Plaintiffs’ motion, and there is certainly no need to proceed on the schedule set forth in the local rules,” Adam Gustafson, acting assistant general for the Justice Department’s Environmental and Natural Resources Division, wrote in a Sept. 26 filing in federal court in Rhode Island. “The stop work order has been enjoined. There is currently no harm to Plaintiffs or anyone else emanating from the stop work order.”
The AGs countered that the situation remained “tenuous, at best,” noting the likelihood of an appeal of the D.C. judge’s ruling, in turn jeopardizing progress on the offshore wind project with “potentially disastrous consequences.”
The Trump administration has not appealed the D.C. judge’s ruling as of Thursday, though challenges to higher courts have been a common strategy of the administration in many of the lawsuits against it.
In an order Wednesday, McElroy acknowledged the overlap with the D.C. case, but said that was no reason for the Rhode Island federal court to “pass on exercising its duty to determine whether litigants are entitled to relief,” according to the public court docket. McElroy did agree, however, to give the Trump administration more time – setting a new deadline of Oct. 22 to respond to the AGs motion for a preliminary injunction.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Thursday, though its website notes that its inbox for media requests will not be monitored on a regular basis due to the federal shutdown.
The earliest Congress could pass a short-term spending plan is Friday.
Neronha praised McElroy’s order in a statement Thursday.
“I am grateful that Judge McElroy recognized that this litigation should not have to await the outcome of the D.C. case, as the states have their own unique claims and reliance interests at stake,” Neronha said. 
He was unsympathetic to the Justice Department’s plea for more time because of the federal shutdown.  
“We are here because the Trump Administration unlawfully halted a wind energy project that was already approved and 80% complete,” Neronha said. “If they want to stop working, they can agree to a consent judgment granting the states the entirety of the relief we seek, which is plainly warranted.”
The $5 billion project created jobs for 1,200 union workers, and is critical to helping both states — already under power purchase agreements for the 704-megawatts of nameplate capacity — meet environmental mandates and reduce ratepayers’ energy costs.

The Vermont-based outdoor gear and apparel company Orvis will close 31 stores and five outlet locations by early 2026. 
Orvis President Simon Perkins confirmed the looming closures in a statement Thursday.
“We will be concentrating on a more focused retail store portfolio, as well as brick-and-mortar opportunities through our valued dealer network,” he said. “We know this impacts people who are significant members of the Orvis family.”
The closures are the latest in a tough year for Orvis, a hallmark of Vermont’s outdoor economy and the fly fishing and bird hunting communities in general. Last October, the company announced it would lay off 8% of its workforce, 112 people, and discontinue its catalog. Then in June, citing tariffs, Orvis announced another 50 layoffs, representing 4% of its staff.  
Founded in 1856 in Manchester, Orvis claims to have been the oldest mail-order retailer in the United States and sells fishing equipment, bird hunting gear and outdoor apparel.
In his statement Thursday, Perkins said the retail downsizing represented an attempt to focus on the business’s core strengths: fly fishing and bird hunting. The shift will also bring a “tightening” of the products the company offers, he indicated. 
“We are investing in the areas where Orvis makes its greatest impact — world-class gear and apparel, unforgettable experiences, and a deep commitment to conservation,” he said. As the company reduces its offerings, he suggested there will be sales at the closing stores and on discontinued products. 
The company declined to provide details on which stores will close or on Orvis’s existing retail footprint. A store locator on the company’s website appeared to show at least 64 retail locations and five outlets.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island students’ standardized test scores moved up this year, outpacing pre-pandemic proficiency in math.
Of the more than 58,000 students in grades 3-8 who took the annual Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS), 31.4% were proficient in math, according to the 2025 results released Thursday. That’s up from last year’s 30.1% as well as the 29.8% observed in the 2018-2019 school year.
English Language Arts proficiency, however, remains harder to budge, with 33.7% of students meeting the state benchmark, compared to 38.5% in the 2018-2019 school year, the year used as a baseline comparison. It is still an improvement over last year, when 30.8% of students were proficient.
The results, released Thursday morning by the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE), show modest improvement and continuing reversal of pandemic-era learning declines on the RICAS. Speaking to reporters Wednesday ahead of the scores’ public release, state education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green emphasized the “good news” hiding in the numbers. 
“I want to be clear, we’re nowhere close to where we want to be, but we are heading in the right direction,” Infante-Green said. “The reality is that no one is nationwide, but Rhode Island’s momentum is real and measurable.”
The assessments involve multiple choice questions, short written answers, and a few multi-step problems. The test is cloned from Massachusetts’ Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS), giving RIDE a way to compare the neighboring and often rivalrous states.
This year, the gap between the Ocean and Bay states has narrowed to about 9.3 percentage points in math and 8 percentage points in English Language Arts. If the entire state of Rhode Island were treated as a Massachusetts district, it would fall around the 30th percentile — up from the bottom decile in 2018.
“I think Massachusetts needs to watch out,” Infante-Green told reporters.
This year’s MCAS results showed about 42% of Massachusetts students in grades 3-8 were proficient in English Language Arts  and 41% were proficient in math. The shrinking gap, however, also owes partly to Massachusetts’ own declines since 2019.
Meeting or exceeding Massachusetts’ assessment numbers by 2030 is part of Gov. Dan McKee’s plan for the decade’s remaining years, a goal RIDE reiterated this year. When asked by reporters if the benchmark is the Bay State’s current, lower numbers, or the higher, pre-pandemic numbers, Infante-Green parried.
“They’re still one of the top states in the nation. … Even though they’re dropping, what we’re doing is moving up,” she said. 
The gap has shrunk by more than half since the 2018 RICAS, when Massachusetts and Rhode Island were separated by gaps of 17 percentage points in English and 20 percentage points in Math. 
As for high school assessments, they were mixed: 51.6% of juniors met the SAT benchmark in reading and writing, up from 47.8% last year and slightly above 2019’s 50.5%. 
In Math, 23.3% of juniors met the standard, up from 21.7% in 2024 but still below 2019’s 31.2%. 
The SAT’s benchmark scores, which are formulated by College Board and used to determine college readiness, are 480 on reading and writing and 530 on math.
Reducing absenteeism has been a cornerstone of McKee and Infante-Green’s educational policy. Across RICAS, PSAT and SAT scores, students who are not chronically absent score between 18 and nearly 24 percentage points higher on tests than their chronically absent peers. 
“If parents are hearing me, this is why it matters,” Infante-Green said to the TV news’ cameras.
The commissioner also stressed that multilingual learners are excelling, which she attributes to spillover benefits of the training received by teachers specializing in multilingual teaching. This year’s RICAS data shows multilingual learners’ proficiency has risen since 2019 in English Language Arts by 5.7 percentage points and in math by 8.8 percentage points. Students who recently completed programs designed for multilingual learners are above the state average, with 42.4% proficiency in English Language Arts and around 39% proficiency in math on this year’s RICAS.

Mississippi or Massachusetts?
Infante-Green assumed her post at the education department in April 2019, roughly 11 months before the COVID-19 global pandemic, an unenviable time to be freshly charged with responsibility for Rhode Island’s more than 135,000 public school students. The pandemic’s consequences, especially its outsized influence on absenteeism rates, linger on in the state’s classrooms, Infante-Green said.
“I met with elementary school principals yesterday who said that they have kids coming into kindergarten wearing pull ups,” Infante-Green said. “It’s a different world right now.”
Infante-Green is not alone in her uphill climb. While the Rhode Island and Massachusetts tests are duplicates, most state-level assessments differ, making direct comparisons shaky. The National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, is a more apples-to-apples approach from the federal government which looks at proficiency in math and English for fourth- and eighth-graders. 
Across the nation, proficiency levels are routinely below 50% in both language and math, even in Massachusetts’s top-performing scores on the 2024 national assessment: 40% in fourth- and eighth-grade reading, and 51% and 37% in fourth and eighth grade math, respectively. 
Rhode Island sat near national averages on the 2024 national assessment, with eighth grade reading at 30% and eighth grade math at 26% proficiency. For fourth graders, those numbers were 33% on reading and 38% on math.
Infante-Green mentioned the Mississippi Miracle — the nickname given to a series of educational reforms in Mississippi over the last decade. On Mississippi’s own state tests for 2025, 47.4% of students were proficient or above in English and 54.5% in math. (On the national test, these gains were strongest in fourth grade, with eighth graders performing nearer the middle of the national pack.)
“Mississippi didn’t go to the top, but they moved from the bottom nationally to the middle, and they kept moving up,” Infante-Green said. “It took 10 years for them to do that after they got everybody trained.”
Kelsey Piper writes in a recent analysis for The Argument, a policy-focused media outlet, that these reforms have benefitted students despite underlying wealth disparity: “Black students are as likely to be basic-or-above readers in Mississippi (where the median Black household income was $37,900 in 2023) as in national top performer Massachusetts (where the median Black household income was $67,000 in 2022.)”
The Mississippi model owes much to a rejection of a literacy approach known as whole language. The now discredited model eschewed phonics instruction in favor of an assumption that kids learned languages naturally. Even as recently as 2022, reading curricula at least partly based in whole language approaches — like Lucy Calkin’s “Units of Study,” which the author has since revised to incorporate more phonics — were in use by about 16% of kindergarten to grade two teachers nationwide.
Infante-Green balked when asked if whole language instruction was anywhere near Rhode Island’s reading curriculum. Since 2019, the state’s Right to Read Act has required that educators be trained in teaching methods based in the science of reading, which restores phonics to a place of high importance.

“We decided to do this during the pandemic, while other states were shut down,” Infante-Green said of the state’s efforts to ground its literacy curriculum in the science of reading.” “This is the year where most of the teachers will be trained.”
She told reporters that even Massachusetts has asked about its neighbor’s approach to teaching literacy.
“They’re actually looking at what we did with the science of reading,” Infante-Green said, adding that she expects to continue the conversation with the commonwealth’s new education commissioner, who began working in July.
In 2019, RIDE received a federal Comprehensive Literacy State Development grant worth $20 million to fund its literacy curriculum, coaching, and training in the state’s schools. RIDE received a similar grant worth $40 million in 2024.
By November 2024, RIDE data showed about 80% of educators met the proficiency standard for training in science of reading-based methods, which prioritize “decodable texts” and “phonics patterns,” according to a RIDE presentation.  
The commissioner gave the ambiguity of the letter “y” as an argument for precise training. “Y” is a vowel, but usually only at the end of a syllable or word. Still, kids were often taught it’s “sometimes” a vowel, which Infante-Green said can be unclear and leads to confusion for students. 
Infante-Green added that English is not known as a language of simplicity, noting that the letter “e” can be pronounced more than a dozen ways.
“Only English is that complicated,” Infante-Green said.

If lawmakers fail to reach a bipartisan compromise on the funding bill, the federal government shutdown will begin at midnight. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Most Minnesota programs that rely on federal funding have enough money to mitigate the impact of a federal shutdown in the short-term, according to the state budget director. 
But a prolonged shutdown — one lasting several weeks — would have serious consequences for programs like SNAP and WIC, which use mostly federal dollars to provide food assistance to families in need, said Ahna Minge in a press conference Thursday. 
The federal shutdown began Wednesday, and there’s no end in sight: Senate Republicans need Democratic votes to pass a stopgap funding bill, and Democrats are demanding an extension of health care subsidies and a reversal of Republicans’ Medicaid cuts. Republicans haven’t budged.
Federal employees are facing furloughs, job reassignments, work without pay and the threat of being fired: President Donald Trump Thursday renewed threats to fire federal workers en masse during the shutdown, targeting “Democrat Agencies,” he wrote in a post on TruthSocial. 
Russ Vought, the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget and a co-author of Project 2025, the roadmap for Trump’s second term, said the Trump administration is canceling funding for Green New Deal projects in blue states including Minnesota. 
In Minnesota, most of the funding went to private entities, but “it looks like there may be a grant that impacts the state Department of Commerce that was affected as well,” Minge said. 
Food benefits through SNAP and WIC look to be funded through the month of October, but money could run out if the shutdown extends into November, Minge said. 
The federal government is expected to continue sending Social Security checks and making Medicaid and Medicare payments during the shutdown. 
Dozens, or even hundreds, of state workers across agencies have spent weeks preparing for the potential impact of a shutdown. The budget agency’s analysis of the shutdown impact relies on historical trends from previous shutdowns. 
“However, the most recent federal shutdown was a partial federal shutdown. Also, the current federal administration may not follow the historic playbook,” Minge warned. 
Gov. Tim Walz criticized federal Republicans’ obstinacy on health care, contrasting Congress’s stalemate with the Minnesota Legislature’s work passing a bipartisan budget earlier this year. 
“It’s difficult, on budgeting. It’s especially difficult when you have divided government — but they have one-party rule — but you still need to make sure you have to compromise,” Walz said. “You’re not going to get everything you want.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uscapitolstop2025-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-10-02 14:57:59.402255

Read this story in English.
Las primarias Demócratas de Connecticut de 2026 podrían volverse inusualmente competitivas, con varios titulares reconocidos atrayendo posibles rivales para sus escaños.
El Gobernador Ned Lamont, quien se espera que inicie su campaña para un tercer mandato como director ejecutivo de Connecticut, observó este verano cómo Josh Elliott, un legislador Demócrata progresista, anunció sus planes de participar en las primarias.
Mientras tanto, más de cuatro Demócratas, incluyendo al exalcalde de Hartford, Luke Bronin, y a la Representante Estatal Jillian Gilchrest, han anunciado planes para intentar desbancar al Representante Estadounidense John Larson, quien ha representado al 1er. Distrito Congresional de Connecticut durante casi tres décadas.
Muchos de los posibles rivales ya están perfeccionando sus mensajes y recaudando fondos para prepararse para lo que podrían convertirse en cruentas batallas políticas.
Pero el hecho de que alguien anuncie una campaña en redes sociales no significa que vaya a ser candidato en las primarias del próximo agosto.
En Connecticut, los candidatos políticos, especialmente aquellos que compiten con los titulares en ejercicio, deben superar varios obstáculos para que su nombre aparezca en la boleta.
A continuación, se presenta un análisis de cómo los partidos eligen a sus candidatos y los pasos que deben seguir los aspirantes para calificar para las primarias.
¿Cómo llegan los candidatos a la boleta de las primarias en Connecticut?
Existen varias maneras para que los candidatos estatales o al Congreso de un partido mayoritario lleguen a la boleta de las primarias en Connecticut.
Las dos vías más sencillas pasan por las convenciones de los partidos políticos, que son reuniones de altos funcionarios Demócratas o Republicanos.
Cualquier candidato a un cargo estatal o a un escaño en el Congreso verá su nombre añadido a la boleta de las primarias si recibe suficiente apoyo de los delegados de la convención, quienes votan sobre los candidatos que el partido debe respaldar.
La persona que obtiene el respaldo del partido entra automáticamente en la boleta.
Sin embargo, las leyes electorales de Connecticut especifican que cualquier candidato que también reciba al menos el 15% de los votos durante una ronda de votación en la convención, calificará automáticamente para las primarias. Esto significa que los aspirantes pueden aparecer en la boleta electoral incluso si no reciben la aprobación del partido.
Para quienes no consiguen un lugar en la boleta electoral en las convenciones, la tercera forma de entrar en la contienda es solicitar su ingreso a la contienda reuniendo suficientes firmas de votantes elegibles para calificar para una primaria.
¿Cuándo son las convenciones y quiénes son los delegados?
Las convenciones estatales de los partidos en Connecticut, donde los delegados votan para respaldar a los candidatos a gobernador y otros cargos estatales, se celebran en primavera, antes de las primarias del partido en agosto.
Lo mismo ocurre con las convenciones del Congreso, que son eventos separados donde los delegados de cada uno de los cinco distritos congresionales de Connecticut, eligen a los candidatos respaldados por el partido en las primarias para la Cámara de Representantes de los Estados Unidos.
Los delegados en esas convenciones están compuestos por miembros de los partidos Demócrata y Republicano de cada uno de los 169 pueblos y ciudades de Connecticut, y la determinación de quiénes son esos delegados recae principalmente en los comités locales de ambos partidos y en los presidentes locales de los mismos.
El proceso de selección de delegados es una de las razones por las que, según los críticos, el sistema está diseñado para beneficiar a los miembros del partido y reprimir a los nuevos aspirantes políticos.
Si se triunfa en la convención, se puede empezar a hacer campaña en lugar de gastar dinero y tiempo en recolectar firmas.
¿Qué sucede si los candidatos no alcanzan los objetivos en la convención?
Si un candidato político no consigue el apoyo suficiente de los miembros del partido en la convención, existe otra manera de mantener viva su campaña. Pero el camino hacia las primarias se vuelve mucho más difícil para ellos.
Esto se debe a que los candidatos que son ignorados en la convención necesitan reunir miles de firmas de votantes registrados en su partido político.
La ley de Connecticut exige que los candidatos a gobernador y al congreso obtengan las firmas de al menos el 2% de los miembros registrados del partido en el estado o en sus distritos congresionales para ser elegibles para la boleta.
En una primaria Demócrata para el 1er. Distrito Congresional, por ejemplo, ese umbral requeriría actualmente que los candidatos recolectaran aproximadamente 3,700 firmas. Y en una contienda Demócrata a gobernador, obligaría a un candidato solicitante a obtener aproximadamente 15,800 firmas de votantes registrados, según el número actual de votantes registrados.
Sin embargo, el mayor obstáculo es el momento de realizar esas campañas de firmas. La ley especifica que los candidatos solicitantes tienen solo 42 días para recorrer las calles y recolectar todas las firmas necesarias.
¿Qué debe hacer un candidato solicitante?
Muchos candidatos han demostrado que es posible llevar a cabo una campaña primaria exitosa sin el apoyo de los delegados de su partido.
Bob Stefanowski, por ejemplo, recopiló más de 9,000 firmas de Republicanos de Connecticut en 2018 para calificar para unas primarias a gobernador muy concurridas ese año.
Hoy, el plazo de 42 días requeriría que un posible aspirante Demócrata a la gobernación recolectara más de 370 firmas diarias de Demócratas registrados, según el número actual de votantes registrados.
La ley estatal exige que esas firmas sean recolectadas en persona por otras registradas en Connecticut en el partido político correcto.
Y una vez finalizadas las campañas de recolección de firmas, las peticiones deben ser notarizadas y entregadas a los registradores de votantes de varias ciudades para que cada firma sea verificada.
Esto significa que algunas firmas pueden ser descartadas si quienes las firmaron no están debidamente registrados en el partido o si hay firmas duplicadas.
Todo esto genera una frenética carrera de un mes y medio para que los candidatos que presenten solicitudes obtengan su lugar en la papeleta de las primarias.
¿Cuáles son los argumentos a favor y en contra de las leyes de acceso a la papeleta?
Quienes apoyan las leyes de acceso a la papeleta de Connecticut argumentan que las normas actuales permiten a los dos principales partidos políticos evaluar a los candidatos que se presentarán a las elecciones bajo su bandera. Las normas también garantizan que cualquiera que aparezca en la papeleta tenga al menos un nivel mínimo de apoyo de los miembros del partido.
Sin embargo, quienes critican el sistema argumentan que las leyes estatales solo sirven para empoderar a los miembros del partido y proteger a los políticos en el cargo de posibles rivales.
Cada estado tiene sus propios requisitos que especifican cómo los candidatos pueden incluir sus nombres en las papeletas de las primarias. Muchos estados, por ejemplo, permiten que las personas aparezcan en la papeleta de las primarias simplemente pagando una tasa de solicitud.
Quienes se oponen al sistema en Connecticut han argumentado repetidamente que las normas estatales para el acceso a la papeleta se encuentran entre las más restrictivas del país.
Muad Hrezi, quien intentó desafiar a Larson en las primarias de 2022 por el 1er. Distrito Congresional, presentó ese mismo argumento ante un tribunal estatal tras no reunir suficientes firmas para impulsar su campaña ese año.
Sin embargo, un juez de la Corte Superior Estatal que supervisaba ese caso rechazó el argumento de que las leyes estatales eran excesivamente onerosas e inconstitucionales. El juez señaló que un candidato Republicano por el 4to. Distrito Congresional del estado ese año, logró reunir suficientes firmas para solicitar su inclusión en la boleta electoral.
Sin duda, las leyes estatales sobre acceso a la boleta electoral se han vuelto ligeramente más fáciles de cumplir para los aspirantes debido a cambios legislativos y fallos judiciales de las últimas décadas.
Aun así, nadie ha logrado calificar para una primaria en Connecticut contra un miembro en ejercicio de la Cámara de Representantes de los Estados Unidos.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra has been incarcerated for more than six months. She is not accused of a crime. She is not alleged to be a danger to the community.
There is strong evidence that authorities targeted her because of her outspoken criticism of the government, even though she is entitled to the right of free speech, and her prolonged detention is a violation of her due process rights. This is retaliation, and the federal court that’s overseeing her detention case should order her release.
A citizen of Mexico, Vizguerra has lived in Denver without authorization, which gave federal immigration authorities a pretext to detain her. Several legal proceedings related to her case are pending, and while they play out, the government has kept her locked up.
Vizguerra, 53, fled with her family to the United States in 1997 after criminal organizations persecuted her husband, as she has described in court documents. The documents indicate she “has a long record of public criticism of systemic corruption and violence in Mexico,” where she is a “visible and outspoken political dissident.” She fears she would be tortured in her home country.

In 2012, after she had committed to voluntarily leave the country, she visited her ailing mother in Mexico, and upon return to the U.S. she was taken into custody. Federal authorities claimed they had reinstated a removal order that Vizguerra argues didn’t exist. She also argues the reinstatement order isn’t valid on procedural grounds.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents granted Vizguerra relief from deportation in 2013, and this “stay of removal” was extended in subsequent years. During President Donald Trump’s first term, however, Vizguerra took refuge in a Denver-area church to escape the president’s immigration crackdown. Her activism earned her a national profile, and in 2017 Time Magazine named her one of the most influential people in the country. She counted Gov. Jared Polis, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado and U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette as supporters.


Whatever justification ICE might cite for Vizguerra’s detention, none could possibly warrant six months of internment.


On March 17, ICE arrested Vizguerra while she was at work at Target and sent her to the ICE detention center in Aurora. Her arrest came amid Trump’s mass deportation efforts, in which ICE has rounded up thousands of people. But Vizguerra’s arrest stood out, because there were unmistakable signs that ICE targeted her for her politics. The most telling evidence of this is that ICE publicly celebrated her arrest.
“Despite her being featured in national media for years, we arrested her in public March 17. A high-profile status does not exempt a person from immigration law,” the agency boasted in an X post.
At the moment of her arrest, an ICE officer said, “We finally got you.” Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post on X, “We will find, arrest, and deport illegal aliens regardless of if they were a featured ‘Time Person of the Year.'”
There could only be one explanation for all this unseemly crowing. It was a warning to Vizguerra and anyone else who might speak out against Trump: Oppose us and we’ll punish you.
The problem is that the decision by federal authorities to target Vizguerra for detention “substantially on account of her protected speech, strikes at the heart of the First Amendment,” her lawyer, Laura Lichter, wrote in a court filing Monday. Lichter also said, “The length of such detention has become unreasonable and is in violation of her Fifth Amendment due process rights.”
Vizguerra has long sought a path to legal status. She has four children, three of whom are U.S. citizens. Her courageous advocacy has inspired countless people in Colorado and beyond, a laudable expression of American values that stands in stark contrast to the shameful treatment she has experienced at the hands of American officials.
Whatever justification ICE might cite for Vizguerra’s detention, none could possibly warrant six months of internment. And there’s no telling how long ICE plans to keep her locked up. It could take many months or years to conclude her legal cases, and it would be a grotesque offense to the Constitution if the Trump administration kept her confined that whole time.
There’s no reason to believe she’s a flight risk — in fact, everything about her past suggests otherwise. There’s no reason to believe she’s a danger to the community — in fact, she’s famous as a pillar of the community. Her detention serves no judicial imperative — in fact, it undermines the moral foundation of American justice.
Lichter’s filing came in a habeas corpus case Vizguerra brought in the U.S. District Court in Denver. She urges the court to set Vizguerra free, or at least let her have a bond hearing.
If the court wants to preserve core principles of liberty, the request will be granted.

(Photo by Joclyn Kuboushek/Iowa Soybean Association) Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam urged the Trump administration, in a statement Thursday, to prioritize a trade deal with China and to support soybean farmers who are without their biggest market. 
China typically buys 60% of global soybean exports, and the U.S. used to be China’s preferred supplier until it turned to Brazil during the trade wars of the first Trump administration. 
Now, China appears to have turned to Argentina for its soybeans, and U.S. farmers worry they’ll be stuck with a bountiful harvest and nowhere to sell it. 
China placed an order with Argentina shortly after the U.S. agreed to a $20 billion bailout deal with the South American country. According to the American Soybean Association, China typically purchases soybeans from the U.S. before harvest begins. A couple weeks into the harvest season in Iowa, and China has not placed an order, presumably in protest of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. 
“Agriculture thrives when America leads on trade,” Adam said in the statement. “We can’t afford to let uncertainty and political maneuvering erode the markets farmers have spent decades cultivating.”
Adam said the mood in rural Iowa is one of “anxiousness and frustration” because of “trade policy that’s severely straining relationships” with key trade partners. 
Adam, who also farms near Harper, said President Donald Trump’s current trade policies are a “bitter pill” for farmers, despite the fact that many farmers voted to elect Trump. 
“With strong yields and a nearly ideal harvest season underway across Iowa and large sections of rural America, grain bins will soon be filled with quality U.S. soy that needs to find a home,” Adam wrote. 
An Iowa State University report from July estimated that reciprocal tariffs – where the country places the same tariff amount on U.S. goods as the U.S. has placed on their goods — could cause losses between $191 million and $1.49 billion to the Iowa soybean industry. 
While soybeans stand to lose the most, according to the report, the corn, ethanol and hog industries in Iowa were also projected to lose hundreds of millions because of the reciprocal tariffs. 
ISA urged the administration to broker a trade agreement with China that “immediately expedites soybean purchases.” 
President Trump has expressed plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a trade summit at the end of October, but Adam said every day without a Chinese trade deal “closes the window tighter” on the “critical” sales period for soybeans between October through February. 
The release from Iowa Soybean Association said this year, Iowa farmers are set to harvest about 550 million bushels of soybeans across 9.3 million acres. 
With no soybean sales to China currently on the books, farmers are worried they’ll have to find a place to store their crops, or find a different market. 
Adam also urged Congress to “provide immediate trade mitigation funding” to farmers to tide them over until a deal can be reached. 
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that farmers would rather have a market to sell into than rely on a government payout. He also said the administration might find a solution using tariff money instead of congressionally allocated funds. 
Adam said a federal farm payment was “not ideal” but that it would “enable many farmers to survive another year.” 
Finally, the Iowa Soybean Association president asked the administration to finalize Renewable Volume Obligations – something EPA proposed earlier this year – to boost the biofuels industry. A boost in this industry would give farmers another soybean market to sell into. 
“The crop is here,” Adam said. “The quality is proven. The demand exists. What’s missing is the resolve to reconnect America’s farmers with a world of buyers who want to purchase our soybeans.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Both chambers of the New Mexico Legislature are preparing to enter their final floor sessions of the special session Thursday afternoon. 
The bills now heading for final approval enable more than $100 million in new spending to offset impacts from federal cuts on food assistance and public media, along with other priorities Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham set. 
The House of Representatives will consider three bills that advanced through committees, but will likely spark debate Thursday afternoon.
The Senate has only one bill remaining on the agenda: Allowing the Health Care Authority to cover the cost of health care premium tax credits set to expire later this year. 
Democratic leadership said Thursday they planned to wrap up the legislative process by the end of day Thursday — in time for the Balloon Fiesta beginning in Albuquerque this weekend. 
Here’s a look at the bills that are on their way to the floors Thursday.
Criminal competency

Senate Bill 2, which would allow the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court to determine competency, advanced unanimously through the House Judiciary Committee Thursday morning.
House Judiciary Chair Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos), who is a co-sponsor of the bill, said the language undoes a change the Senate previously introduced into an amendment to House Bill 8 during the 60-day session.
David Thomson, the chief justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court, said the amendment in House Bill 8 disrupted the work flow for more than 400 cases in the Albuquerque courts, the state’s busiest district. 
“This would go back to what I call status quo,” Thomson said. “This is how we used to do it, it’s not a change.” 
Rural health care delivery
Senate Bill 1, which transfers $50 million from the state general fund to the rural health care delivery fund to expand “stabilization” for hospitals, passed unanimously through the House Health and Human Services Committee. 
Various cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” mean that between six and eight rural hospitals in New Mexico could be on the brink of closure, according to warnings from New Mexico’s congressional delegation. 
Several Democrats raised objections that the bill did not have safeguards ensuring that private-equity firms owning hospitals in New Mexico would not be able to access the funds. 
Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) said the state needs to prioritize smaller operations and primary care, not just hospitals, but committed her support for the current bill. 
“I will 1,000% support this bill because I believe it’s needed right now. And I do hope that this is also a warning and a guiding light for us as we allocate money into the future,” Anaya said. 

Vaccines

Senate Bill 3, which would expand the New Mexico Department of Health’s authority to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for children, and ensure that vaccination guidelines for school and daycares remain the same, passed on party lines through the House Health and Human Services over the objection of three Republicans, who raised concerns about additional vaccination requirements or rollbacks of medical or religious exemptions for vaccines allowed for school children. 
New Mexico Department of Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie said current laws rely on the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which limits the department’s ability to advance its own recommendations based on scientific standards set by professional organizations. 
She also said the current law prevents the purchasing of COVID-19 vaccines for insured children — which is the responsibility of the health department — because the acting director of the CDC has still not signed off on approval of the vaccine. 
She reiterated that the department will not require a COVID-19 vaccine for children to attend school.
Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque) told Source NM that any changes the bill makes will be unwound in seven months without further legislative action. 
“This is absolutely a stopgap,” Hochman-Vigil said. “But we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do.”
DeBlassie told Source NM after the committee vote said the department may seek to revisit the issue in the 30-day session.
Rep. Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque) said she did not feel that four minutes sufficed for questions during the committee on the bill.
“I’m hoping that I can research, ask a lot more questions before this gets to the floor,” she said.

Expiring health care tax credits

A Senate committee Thursday morning agreed on a bipartisan vote to advance HB2, intended to protect about 6,300 New Mexicans from huge health care premium increases if federal tax credits expire as scheduled later this year. 
The Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee voted 7-1 to give the New Mexico Health Care Authority flexibility it needs to ensure New Mexicans who acquire their health insurance from the state’s marketplace will still receive highly subsidized insurance, even if the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit expires at the end of this year. 
Six things to know about Enhanced Premium Tax Credits heading into New Mexico’s special session

The expiring tax credits are a major sticking point in Congress, which Thursday entered its second day of a shutdown. If the tax credits are extended, which Congressional Democrats are calling for, funding the Legislature approves to supplant them will revert to the state’s general fund. 
Accompanying the legislation the committee approved Thursday is a $17.3 million appropriation into the Health Care Affordability Fund, which the HCA oversees, to cover the premiums for policyholders whose income is 400% of more of the federal poverty line. The Legislature earlier this year approved funding to cover the tax credits for those who make under that threshold.
The lone “no” vote came from Sen. David Gallegos (R-Eunice), who said he was concerned some language in the bill would cut out the Legislature from approving future HCA spending on premium subsidies. 
He and Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho) suggested they might have additional questions for debate on the Senate floor later Thursday, though the bill will still likely pass. It passed the House floor around 11 p.m. Thursday with a 49-13 margin, a vote that included several Republicans.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gina-DeBlassie-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-02 14:57:59.402255

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Almost a year after Hurricane Helene, Claudette Childs worried that help was never coming.
Her family store in Burnsville, passed down through four generations, was completely destroyed in the storm. And her FEMA application for repairs on her home in Pensacola, N.C., had been pending for months.
Last month, she finally got word that assistance was coming – but not from FEMA. Samaritan’s Purse, the Christian humanitarian nonprofit based in Boone, sent a contractor to restore part of her property that washed away under her deck and left the stairs hanging in midair. It would have cost her around $7,000.
“They have helped so many here, including our church,” Childs said. “I have nothing but good to say about them.”
Recently, Childs said she finally heard back from FEMA — one day after she appeared in a WRAL documentary feature, calling the government response to Helene survivors “not acceptable.”
“I don’t think it was an accident,” she said. “It had been months since I’d heard from them.”
After exchanging more paperwork, Childs said she’s now expecting assistance from FEMA in the coming week.
Helene was one of the last major hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S. before a new administration entered office, promising sweeping changes to how the government responds to disasters, regulates spending and distributes aid.
Recovery from the storm has reflected that broad new mandate: a slower trickle of federal money, accounting for about 10% of the storm’s total damage after one year. Key aid and grant programs now require new layers of bureaucratic approval, enforced by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency.
Frustrated Western North Carolinians like Childs have instead leaned on the private sector — a vast network of churches, nonprofits and community aid groups that unfurled a safety net free from the constraints of the government.
Samaritan’s Purse and Baptists on Mission, both Christian nonprofits based in North Carolina, have each repaired hundreds of homes; the state’s federally-funded program has repaired two. The state has tapped NGOs — Golden Leaf Foundation and Mountain BizWork — to send money to struggling small businesses and local governments.
And on Thursday, Gov. Josh Stein announced that 14 nonprofit groups helping build homes would receive $9 million in grants. An additional $6 million was awarded to Baptists on Mission and Habitat for Humanity in January.
“Thank goodness for all these nonprofits who have just done a Herculean job,” said Nathan Ramsey, executive director of the Land of Sky Regional Council. “They filled a gap where, unfortunately, public dollars are slow.”
The mountains’ recovery has forced officials to reckon with a disaster recovery process that could look radically different in years to come.
City and county officials have banded together to create hyper-local hubs of support and resources. And lawmakers have introduced a bill that would overhaul North Carolina’s emergency management agency, while the White House considers shifting the burden of response to the states.
The state, meanwhile, continues the marathon to repair, rebuild and better prepare for the next storm.
Massive debris removal efforts and repairs have reopened 95% of state-maintained roads. Local governments are starting to receive $55 million in state dollars to rebuild infrastructure around small businesses. And more than 3,200 applicants are seeking help through the state’s single-family housing program, which relies on federal funding.
“It’s going to take a long time to build thousands of houses,” said Lee Lilley, North Carolina’s secretary of commerce, in an interview. “It’s going to take a long time to build multi-family housing projects … to rebuild some of the critical infrastructure. A long time means, in some cases, months, in some cases, years. But we’re committed to it the whole time.”
Nonprofits, an ‘essential part’, remain on the ground
Samaritan’s Purse isn’t packing up their recovery efforts in western North Carolina anytime soon.
The Boone-based nonprofit founded by Franklin Graham plans to continue working in the region for up to five years, according to Luther Harrison, the vice president for North American ministries. They want to see “hundreds of homes rebuilt” in that time.
Aid began with a flurry of helicopter missions dropping food, water and equipment in the weeks after the storm. In the year since, volunteers with the group have thus far finished 55 house repairs and more than 500 repairs on driveways, bridges and culverts, Harrison said. That’s in addition to more than 150 mobile homes delivered to families needing shelter.
“We’re not here to compete against the builders in the state,” Harrison said. “But I always tell the contractors … ‘Can you afford to do this work for free?’ And they say no, I can’t do that.”
Baptists on Mission, with five “rebuild centers” throughout the region, has completed repairs on more than 500 homes as of late September, according to the group’s website.
Their role remains distinct from the state’s, but no less important, Lilley said. While repairs paid for by tax dollars undergo rigorous vetting, volunteer groups have been free to move swiftly to build and repair. They’re also able to aid families who don’t fall within the eligibility requirements of state and federal programs.
“They’re really an essential part of the process,” Lilley said. “And they remain partners throughout.”
Lawmakers have been envious of that speed — consistently frustrated with the state’s homebuilding process by comparison, even as administration officials stress that it is one of the most swift in history.
“I wish (the state) would hire you, or at least work with you,” House Majority Leader Brenden Jones (R-Columbus) remarked to Harrison when he testified before a committee last month. Harrison responded that the group doesn’t take government money, in part so it can continue working at its current pace.
“As long as we have opportunities and there’s need, all we do is put out an appeal to our volunteers to come out,” Harrison said. “They’ve never let us down.”
What a slower flow of FEMA aid means for recovery
FEMA public assistance for North Carolina families and households has totaled $515 million since Helene, according to the agency. That’s in addition to $2 billion allocated for debris removal.
A different category of public aid — that for local and state governments — faces new barriers to delivery. Every project must be signed off on by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and are now also put on hold as the state submits itemized breakdowns for the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The state has sent in more than 1,000 such requests.
“I think the current process for FEMA is kind of a disaster with public assistance,” Lilley said. “It’s a real stressor for local governments, and it delays other things.”
It’s difficult to know how to send money for broader infrastructure projects before that public assistance is doled out, Lilley added. As it stands now, most municipalities and counties don’t know how much aid they’ll receive.
“Are they going to get 100%? Are they going to get 60 cents on the dollar? What’s left on their workbook?” Lilley said. “These things have to go faster. And we all bear responsibility for that, but it starts with the federal response. And the federal response needs to be so much more streamlined.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3595-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 14:57:59.402255

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Four days after announcing his bid to be Rhode Island’s next attorney general, House Judiciary Chairman Robert Craven is out of the race.
Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, announced late Thursday morning he was dropping out amid renewed scrutiny of domestic assault charges from over two decades ago.
“I did not anticipate the impact the last few days would have on the most important people in my life, my family,” Craven said in a statement. “Although I have been sober for nearly 22 years, the behaviors from that period in my life will always be part of my story. 
Craven formally kicked off his campaign Monday, but quickly stumbled after the Boston Globe published a column Tuesday morning regarding two domestic violence charges Craven faced in the early 2000s — both of which were expunged from his record.
Craven attributed the incidents to an alcohol addiction he faced at the time.
“I must continue to have hope in redemption, not for myself, but for those of us who have made mistakes and who have to have hope in tomorrow,” he said in Thursday’s campaign statement.
In announcing his candidacy, Craven’s campaign website touted an endorsement from the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence. But the organization said no such endorsement ever happened.
“We do not make political endorsements,” spokesperson Brianna Henries said in an emailed statement. “Nor do we engage in any electioneering or political campaign matters involving any candidates for public office.”
The endorsement was since updated to one from the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, but the campaign website has since been taken down.
Craven reported a campaign balance of $320,617 as of Oct. 2.
The 69-year-old lawmaker was set to take on Keith Hoffmann, a former aide to current Attorney General Peter Neronha, in the September 2026 Democratic primary. Hoffmann’s campaign, which immediately obtained Neronha’s endorsement upon its launch Tuesday, did not directly address Craven’s departure from the race Thursday.
Anticipated field of AG candidates includes two Democrats so far with another in the wings

“He has not been and will not be deterred by anyone else who enters the race,” campaign spokesperson Kaylah Paras said in a statement. “He looks forward to continuing to visit every city and town in our state to speak with Rhode Islanders about how we can make our state stronger, safer, and fairer.”
Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat who served as a special assistant attorney general from 2006 to 2010, is also said to be weighing a run for AG. He told Rhode Island Current Monday he has a campaign event scheduled in Warren on Monday, Oct. 6.
Knight did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Craven is an attorney at Robert E. Craven & Associates in North Kingstown. He was an assistant attorney general from 1983 to 1992, including a stint as chief of the office’s public corruption unit. 
In addition to his private practice, Craven serves as the solicitor for the town of Charlestown and the Exeter-West Greenwich Regional School District.
Craven was first elected to represent House District 32 in 2012. He said in his statement that he intends to continue serving through the remainder of his term which ends in 2026.

“The high cost and limited availability of child care — driven by provider shortages, low wages, and high turnover — are major hurdles for Idaho parents, limiting their participation in the local economy,” the press release said. “At the same time, recent data shows a drop in southeast Idaho’s labor force numbers from 2024 to 2025, meaning more people are leaving the workforce entirely. The high cost of child care is a key reason why.”
According to a 2025 Idaho Department of Labor child care and workforce participation report, the lack of affordable child care in the state had tangible effects on working parents and the state’s economy. The report found:

22,000 parents in Idaho cut work hours to care for a child
19,000 parents took unpaid leave to care for a child
14,000 parents used vacation or sick leave to care for a child
25,000 parents left or lost a job (compared to 5,000 in 2023) to care for a child
36,000 women and 20,000 men altered work arrangements in some way to care for a child

The coalition says it will split the cost of child care three ways using the “tri-share model,” which calls on employers, employees and local governments to fund the program.
Bannock County and the city of McCammon have provided one-time funding from their fiscal year 2025 budgets to help pilot the program, the press release said. The United Way, Pocatello’s Biggie and Smalls Learning Center, and Southeast Idaho Council of Governments are the first employers that will participate in the program.
“Access to child care is a primary issue for building a sustainable workforce,” said Bannock County Commissioner Jeff Hough in the release. “We’re making a smart investment in our economic future. When parents can reliably work, our businesses thrive, and our community grows stronger.”
The coalition will offer onboarding and administrative assistance to employers that want to participate in the voluntary program. The KIDS First Coalition is looking for more employers, child care providers, and community partners to join Tri-Share Pilot Program.
“Quality child care is the infrastructure that supports everything else: families, businesses, and communities. The KIDS First Coalition and the Tri-Share Pilot Program is a locally led response to the challenges our community is currently facing,” said Tennille Call, director of education at United Way of Southeastern Idaho. “The Tri-Share model represents the kind of innovative partnership our region needs, and we are proud to help lead this effort toward stronger families, a stronger workforce, and a stronger Idaho.”

In June 2024, the party told the Maine Department of the Secretary of State that it would no longer like to be a qualified party in the state, according to a news release from the agency Thursday afternoon. However, Maine law didn’t have a way for a political party to withdraw its status. 
Earlier this year, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows introduced legislation that would allow a qualified party to voluntarily dissolve through a written request signed by the party’s chair. The proposal passed the Maine Legislature and became law last month.
Therefore, the No Labels Party was disqualified as of that new law’s effective date. 
The party had only been qualified in the state since January 2024. At the time, the aspiring party was ​​trying to get on the ballot in all 50 states to form a “unity ticket,” offering an alternative candidate to former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump. The group formed in the wake of the Tea Party Movement and described itself as a bipartisan alternative.
The party had some support from Sen. Susan Collins, who was named an honorary co-chair. No Labels also helped start the bicameral Problem Solvers Caucus, of which both Collins and Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden are members.
Maine voters who were enrolled in the party have been updated to unenrolled, the department said. Voters can use the online portal to update their party enrollment, if they would like.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)ROSELAND — Large amounts of petrochemicals still blanket nearby bodies of water six weeks after an industrial facility explosion in Tangipahoa Parish, where some affected residents believe the federal and state government have failed in its response and aren’t telling the truth about the health and environmental risks. 
Candy Cardwell, who lives a few hundred yards from the Smitty’s Supply Inc. plant, walked around her property Tuesday and pointed to black oily residue embedded into virtually everything from the roof of her home to the ground. 
On the side of her roof facing the Smitty’s plant, shingles are stained with black oily residue, noticeably discolored compared to the other side’s reddish brown shingles. Cardwell’s gutters, surface concrete, fence, patio furniture, grass and vegetation all bear the same dark stains. She said she had to dig up her fruit and vegetable garden and dispose of the entire harvest because the plants were covered in oil and soot.    



She has tried scrubbing and cleaning her furniture and concrete, but she said the stains won’t come out. 
“It fell literally on everything,” Cardwell said. “This was my little piece of heaven … Now, it’s a sad state.”
Additionally, Cardwell’s dog became ill soon after the incident and still hasn’t recovered, she said. 
Residents across Tangipahoa Parish have reported similar property damage after the Aug. 22 chemical fire at Smitty’s Supply. The explosion sent smoke, soot and oily residue into the air and onto nearby homes, businesses and an elementary school. Petroleum products from the plant also spilled into area waterways, including several adjacent ponds and the Tangipahoa River. Oily materials have traveled nearly 40 miles down the waterway that leads to Lake Pontchartrain. 
About 3 miles away in Amite, the home of Mike and Kathleen Bassemier bears many of the same markings. Black residue is stuck to everything, from leaves in the trees to recently painted concrete around their pool.
Even pressure washing the concrete didn’t get rid of the residue, they said.
“You could walk out in the backyard barefoot, and your feet would be black,” Mike Bassemier said.
As of Sept. 30, 2025, petrochemicals were still visible on the Tangipahoa River in Amite, several miles downriver from the destroyed Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland nearly six weeks after it exploded. (Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)
Like Cardwell, the Bassemiers also have a dog that’s been sick for the past few weeks. In the first couple of weeks after the explosion, the white fur covering the dog’s paws was stained black after the dog trotted around in the grass. Mike Bassemier said he fears the dog may have eaten some tainted grass.
The couple’s biggest concern is their home’s roof, which they said was just replaced in 2021. Just like at Cardwell’s house, the shingles are covered with oily residue, and all three wonder if the chemicals could deteriorate the roofing materials or make them flammable.
Even those without property have had their lives impacted. 
Stephen Williams, a Bogalusa native who said he’s lived along the Tangipahoa River in Amite for the past few months, said he had to get rid of his tent after it was soaked with soot and oily residue. He and his dog, Tick Tock, live under the Louisiana Highway 16 bridge, though Williams said they had to relocate temporarily when cleanup crews returned Tuesday. 
Williams said he and Tick Tock have struggled to find enough to eat since the Smitty’s Supply explosion. Before, the river was their primary food source. 
“Being homeless when something like this oil happens can be tough,” the 61-year-old said as rainbow sheens of petrochemicals floated down the river behind him. “Sometimes fishing’s the only way we eat at night.”

Cardwell and the Bassemiers said they want straight answers about what hazards the chemical residue poses. Immediately after the incident and again this week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has insisted the soot poses no imminent health risk. However, soot in general is known to contain a number of carcinogens and heavy metals, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
Within days of the explosion, the EPA received an inventory list of the chemicals at the Smitty’s plant at the time of the incident, but the agency withheld the information from the public for five weeks. The EPA finally disclosed it to the Illuminator last week only after the agency got permission from Smitty’s Supply executives to release it.
Detailed on a 305-page spreadsheet, the inventory list included a variety of flammable and otherwise hazardous products. Rough estimates indicate Smitty’s Supply stored several million gallons of motor oils, lubricants and various automotive fluids. Hydraulic fluids, gas mixtures, methanol, drilling oils, solvents, acids, bases and other petrochemical products were also part of its inventory on hand. 
LaCrisha McAllister, an environmental justice attorney representing a Roseland farmer who is suing Smitty’s Supply, said she’s not surprised to hear of other sick animals because her client’s cow gave birth to a stillborn calf and believes it was due to the chemical exposure. She said officials should be more forthright about what chemicals were on site at the Smitty’s plant at the time of the fire and which specific ones were actually burned or exploded.
“That speaks to a bigger, more dangerous issue … What really is this?” McAllister said in a phone interview. “We don’t know what this will look like down the line.”
She recommended that affected residents prioritize their health and well-being, take any sick pets to a veterinarian and document any damages or changes that have occurred since the fire in case they need it for insurance or legal purposes.

After nearly six weeks of being surrounded by chemical contaminants and polluted ponds and rivers, Cardwell and the other residents said they hope things return to normal soon — to the way they were before the explosion. 
It’s a promise they say they’ve heard Gov. Jeff Landry repeat in the weeks since the explosion.
The governor addressed recovery efforts again Wednesday at a news conference in Tangipahoa Parish, simultaneously praising the Trump administration’s response and acknowledging that it could’ve been better. 
“No plan is 100% perfect,” Landry told reporters at the parish government offices in Amite. “There’s been no hiding of the ball. We’ve been completely transparent.”
The governor’s comments came just days after drone video revealed the extent of the pollution still present near the Smitty’s facility. The footage, which went viral on social media Sunday, prompted Landry to issue a video message from the Governor’s Mansion, saying the EPA was working too slowly in its recovery efforts. 
After connecting with several state officials and EPA regional coordinator Scott Mason, the governor promised in his video that cleanup efforts would intensify soon.
“You know it’s been over a month now that the Smitty’s facility caught…and over those 30 days, contractors contracted by the EPA were supposed to be cleaning that up,” Landry said Sunday. “And they’re not going fast enough.”
The governor walked back some of those comments Wednesday, saying he doesn’t believe any of the government agencies have failed and that he has full confidence in Mason, an appointee from President Donald Trump’s first term.

At Wednesday’s news conference, Mason said the drone footage shows only what’s on the surface of the water and isn’t a good indicator of how much oily material has already been removed. He estimated his agency has completed about 75% of the restoration of the Tangipahoa River.
“We know that we can always increase our pace and our progress to clean up a spill of this magnitude and also protect human health across this community,” Mason said. 
Cardwell said she has lost trust in the government’s integrity and wonders why it has taken so long to get this rapid mobilization of government resources. 
“I was really irritated at the governor who said he would be with us every step of the way and make Roseland whole again,” Cardwell said. “I’m tired of hearing what you’re gonna do … We worked hard for what we have, and I have more years behind me than I have ahead of me. It’s heartbreaking.”

(Photo by Chris Livingston/Getty Images) Led by Florida, 15 state attorneys general have signed a letter asking U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to support execution of child rapists and to challenge a decades-old ruling preventing the death penalty for pedophiles.
The newest signature on Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s September letter came Wednesday from Liz Murrill, Louisiana’s chief legal officer, asking Bondi to co-sign various state efforts to execute child rapists. They hope Bondi takes on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2008 Kennedy v. Louisiana decision holding the death penalty for child rapists unconstitutional.
“We have every confidence that, with President Trump’s strong leadership and with principled, rule-of-law Justices on the Supreme Court, Kennedy’s days are numbered, and child rapists can be appropriately punished for their unspeakable crimes,” Uthmeier wrote in his Sep. 2 letter.

“The U.S. Supreme Court needs to reverse this egregiously wrong ruling,” Murrill echoed in a Wednesday social media post, announcing that her name would be slotted alongside the 14 other sitting and former Republican attorneys general. Andrew Bailey, former Missouri attorney general and now co-deputy director of the FBI, was one of the signatories.
Weeks after Uthmeier emailed his letter to Bondi, she joined President Donald Trump on Sep. 25 to announce planned expansion of the death penalty. Trump signed a presidential memorandum seeking to reinstate the death penalty in Washington, D.C., as Bondi announced the DOJ would pursue capital punishment nationwide, CNN reported.
This followed Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order demanding protection of the death penalty and asking Bondi to seek orverride of Supreme Court precedents that “limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment.”
Her office declined to comment on whether she would try to overturn the Kennedy ruling.
 Florida and the death penalty
Uthmeier’s letter was only the latest step Florida has taken in the death penalty sphere. Under Gov. Ron DeSantis’ leadership, the GOP-dominated Legislature passed a first-in-the-nation law allowing the state to kill pedophiles who rape children younger than 12. It was the first death penalty law passed for non-murders since the Kennedy decision.
That same year, DeSantis signed a law lowering the threshold for death penalty sentencing from a unanimous jury decision to an 8-4 supermajority. That law came after Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland shooter who murdered 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, received life in prison after a jury voted 9-3 for death.
Since then, Florida has expanded the aggravated factors needed to recommend a death sentence, added human trafficking as another non-murder crime that could be subject to the death penalty, and allowed for creation of new death penalty methods. DeSantis has shattered Florida’s long-standing one-year record of eight executions set in 1984: in 2025 so far, he’s already scheduled 15 executions, 13 of which have been carried out.
This aggressive stance has drawn the ire of anti-death penalty groups, including the statewide organization Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, which argue that Florida’s slew of new laws are both unconstitutional and go against judicial precedent.
“While Florida lawmakers have made their intent clear — that they knowingly and purposely passed an unconstitutional law — they still have to wait to be able to even bring it to the U.S. Supreme Court (who also would have to agree to hear it) to try to overturn that long established precedent,” Maria DeLiberato, FADP’s executive director, told the Florida Phoenix in a written statement.
 What is the Kennedy v. Louisiana case?
In 2003, Patrick O’Neal Kennedy was sentenced to death in Louisiana for the 1998 rape of his 8-year-old stepdaughter. This aligned with the state’s 1995 law allowing pedophiles to be executed if they raped a victim younger than 13.
Kennedy appealed, pointing out that the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled the death penalty for rapists with adult victims unconstitutional, but the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld his sentence. That court noted that five other states at the time had death penalty laws for child rape.
Kennedy turned to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that five states was not enough to establish a “national consensus” that executing child rapists should be legal. In a 5-4 decision, SCOTUS took his side. Kennedy has since been sentenced to life in prison.
Now 60, he is being held at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel, La.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s office announced this week the state has joined a coalition of 21 attorneys general suing the Trump administration over new restrictions attached to grants for crime victims, including the Victims of Crime Act and the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants.

The suit challenges a recent notification from the U.S. Department of Justice from barring states, as of Oct. 31, from using both future and already awarded grant money to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants and those who can’t prove their status— a condition the coalition says the is unconstitutional and which the federal government only revealed to states last month.

According to a news release, the suit argues DOJ’s new restrictions violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause “by attaching retroactive and ambiguous conditions to grants that were already awarded, in some cases years ago.” The AGs also contend the U.S. Department of Justice “acted in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to justify its reversal of decades-long policy and by ignoring the harm” survivors and service providers will experience from the new rule.

“It is unconscionable to consider withholding critical care from victims of violent crime based on residency status,” Torrez said in a statement. “The strength of our nation comes from our ability to help those in need, not select who deserves to receive care based on current legal status. My office will do everything in its power to protect and provide aid for those in New Mexico who have been victims of violent crime.”

The lawsuit also notes that the conditions placed by the Trump administration would be burdensome to interpret let alone execute, putting states in a position of shouldering “substantial new costs  and operational burdens to comply” with the rules while also facing the threat of enforcement.

The grants, Torrez’s office says, support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other violent crimes, while also funding services such as legal representation in family court, relocation and housing assistance, compensation for medical bills and funeral costs, and other civil legal services. Byrne JAG grants “provide additional resources to state and local governments for criminal justice initiatives, including – in some states – support for public defenders.”

According to the U.S. Office for Victims of Crime dashboard, in New Mexico in 2024, approximately $10 million in VOCA grants were awarded to 77 sub-grantees for services, 61 of which were nonprofits. Of the nearly 62,000 victimizations reported that year, 28% were domestic or family violence incidents, the largest category, followed by child abuse or neglect at just under 13.5%.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha led the lawsuit, which includes the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

The lead defendant in the case is Jose Daniel Contreras-Cervantes, a father of three who was diagnosed last year with leukemia and given four to six years to live, according to his wife Lupita Contreras, in a press conference hosted by the ACLU. Contreras-Cervantes was detained in August after a traffic stop in Macomb County, where he lives, and is currently being held at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Mich. 
He is not receiving necessary specialized care for his cancer while in detention, his wife said, and has had two periods of time, one of 22 days and one of five days where he did not receive any medication. 
Cases like Contreras-Cervantes’s are resulting in prolonged detentions because of a July policy change by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to eliminate bond hearings in most immigration detention cases, according to Miriam Aukerman, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan. In the past, she said, a case like this would have resulted in a bond hearing and likely his release while the case went through the legal process.

But under the new policy, she added, “Jose and thousands of people like him will be locked up for months or years if they try to stay with their families in America. This new directive is specifically designed to force people to give up their claims for immigration relief and leave their families behind.”
The petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed with the lawsuit, notes that dozens of similar petitions have been filed in recent months, and that “[v]irtually every merits decision in those cases has found for the petitioners, either granting them a bond hearing or ordering their immediate release.” One such case, also filed by the ACLU in August, led to the release of Detroit resident Juan Manuel Lopez-Campos later that month. 
The case was also filed on behalf of seven other individuals, one of whom Aukerman said had already been released since the case was filed. Those defendants include Fredy De Los Angeles-Flores, a 46-year-old father and sole caregiver to his teenaged daughter, as well as a 33-year-old mother of a young disabled daughter and a 23-year-old woman from the Detroit area who came to the U.S. at 11 months old. 
“What I hope is that he will be released from custody, so that we can continue fighting his immigration case as a united family,” Lupita Contreras said during the press conference.

Psychiatric support is only part of the equation at this Vermont based mental health treatment center. Residents live on a working farm and engage in gardening, animal tending, carpentry, and forestry alongside their clinicians. It’s a different way to approach mental illness, and it makes a difference.

This past month on a private lake in southern Vermont, a group launched their handcrafted sailboat to determine its seaworthiness. Adding a twist, the captains of the vessel, like those cheering from the shore, were dressed as pirates for International Talk Like a Pirate Day. Making for an all-around good story, the boat floated.
Although not immediately evident, this event was hosted by a comprehensive mental health program for adults—one that has existed in Shrewsbury, VT for nearly 100 years, Spring Lake Ranch (SLR). Pirate Day only occurs once a year at the treatment center, but it highlights everyday values that distinguish SLR’s model of care.
Residents receive traditional psychiatric support, including medication management, therapy, and recovery groups, but they also spend their days on a farm surrounded by 700 acres of wilderness. As part of treatment, they engage in meaningful work, connection to nature, and positive social interaction. For instance, residents built the pirate operated wooden boat, a years-long pursuit worthy of celebration. The group hiked to a spring-fed lake for its launch, a setting colored by Vermont’s heady autumn. And the pirate costumes? They were a reminder to have fun, to allow silliness even during challenging times.

Spring Lake Ranch residents experience a variety of serious mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and substance use disorders. Some experience “failure to launch,” a phenomenon in which young adults are unable maintain independence often due to lack of self-confidence or other stressors. Regardless of their background, the common thread is that SLR residents hope to eventually graduate into thriving futures despite their challenges.
To achieve this, clinical care is individualized and integrated into SLR’s therapeutic work program. The average stay is eight months, but can be shorter or much longer, depending on each resident’s needs. They choose a focus area—gardening, animal tending, carpentry, or forestry—and work five hours a day, five days a week, with clinicians and other support staff by their sides. Recreational programming provides fun outings, outdoor sports, and annual celebrations (like Talk Like a Pirate Day) to further strengthen the sense of community so important to the model. The routine of getting up and outside, of contributing to something larger than the individual develops hope, connection, self-efficacy, and purpose, the foundations of wellbeing.
Describing Spring Lake Ranch, Executive Director Rachel Stark says “Our program is unique. While we offer traditional clinical supports such as therapy and psychiatry, the heart of our therapeutic model lies in meaningful work and shared community life. We believe that moving your muscles changes your thoughts—that working with your hands and engaging with others can foster healing in ways that talk alone cannot. Here, people have the opportunity to be a part of something, rather than apart from it.”

SLR’s therapeutic approach is built on more than nine decades of experience working with adults who have mental illness, as well as evidence-based treatments including milieu therapy, work therapy, nature therapy, and animal therapy. Insurance does not currently cover this model of care so, as a nonprofit, Spring Lake Ranch relies on donations to ensure treatment is affordable. Additionally, their current Capital Campaign seeks to raise $3 million to reach a goal of $18 million by the end of 2026 to renovate decades-old structures and provide a new layer of improved step-down programming.  
“Our community doesn’t end at the property line,” says Stark. “Everyone who’s lived or worked at the Ranch, who’s donated, who’s come to an event, or who’s helped someone find their way to SLR is part of our community too. And we’re helping residents contribute to their community when they leave the Ranch. They carry their wellness home to families, friends, neighbors, coworkers. The ripple effect is expansive.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska has the country’s most or second most overcrowded prison system, depending on who you ask.
Inspector General of the Nebraska Correctional System Doug Koebernick confirmed the rankings in his 2025 annual report released in September. In it, he wrote that Nebraska ranks first in prison overcrowding when measured by operational capacity, second behind Alabama where the crowding is measured by design capacity.
Nebraska formally entered a prison overcrowding emergency in 2020 when the system surpassed 140% of its design capacity, as determined by the available bed space across all prison system facilities. Though the way the state measures such emergencies has broadened under state law, Koebernick said the system hasn’t officially resolved its existing crisis, so the emergency remains in effect.
Several factors have heightened the problem in the short-term. The system is currently in the process of transitioning its McCook Work Ethic Camp to an ICE detention facility, which will require the relocation of some 140 inmates, and the state is continuing to repair storm damage at the Nebraska State Penitentiary that relocated another 380 inmates.

State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, said she was slightly frustrated that Koebernick’s report seemed to continue the “narrative” that Nebraska’s prisons are overcrowded. She previously told the Nebraska Examiner that she doesn’t believe such a crisis exists, because some bed space is still open across the state’s nine facilities.
When people hear Nebraska’s prisons are overcrowded, Bosn said many people jump to the conclusion that the state is incarcerating people at higher rates than nearby states. But that’s not true, she said. In fact, Bosn claimed that out of all of Nebraska’s neighbors, only Iowa has a lower incarceration rate based on population.
Despite this, Bosn said the OIG’s report offers a good summary of the progress that has been made in Nebraska’s correctional system in recent years and illuminates the work that still needs to be done.
“If we’re going to call it corrections, we actually need to be correcting the behavior that we think needed changing,” Bosn said.
The ongoing overcrowding emergency
Nebraska’s prison population has remained relatively flat since 2020, barring a temporary decline linked to the state’s COVID-19 response. The population is currently over 5,700 people across all nine facilities, Koebernick said.
Part of the reason for that stability is that the number of paroles granted jumped nearly 50% in 2024, from 833 in 2023 to 1,232, according to Koebernick’s report. He estimated that paroles would remain about that high this year as well.
Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, a vocal critic of Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services, described that change as progress, but suspects that the increase only happened because the Board of Parole was called out by him and other lawmakers. McKinney passed Legislative Bill 631 in 2024 that, among other things, decreased the reasons why the board may defer parole and increased the reasons why a board member may be removed from service.

Either way, Nebraska has one of the most overcrowded prison systems nationally, Koebernick said. The data he used to rank Nebraska against other states comes from the U.S. Department of Justice, with research data that extends through the end of 2022. Koebernick said he expects an update later this month to include changes from 2023. However, he said he doesn’t anticipate much change.
The DOJ measures prison overcrowding by both design capacity and operational capacity, Koebernick said. While design capacity is a stricter measurement by bed space, operational capacity is more complex and usually considers a variety of factors including staffing and the availability of services for inmates. Nebraska measures operational capacity as 125% of design capacity.
Earlier this year, lawmakers passed Legislative Bill 150, which, among other things, changed how the state will measure overcrowding emergencies in the future by operational capacity rather than by design capacity. The change to operational capacity gives Nebraska’s prisons a higher threshold for when an emergency starts, because the measurement is broader.
If Nebraska had measured its prison system by operational capacity in 2020, Koebernick said, the state would no longer be in an overcrowding emergency right now. However, there are mixed views as to which measurement is best. Koebernick said he’s typically looked at design capacity because it’s more consistent, where the definition of operational capacity can vary from state to state.
Even Koebernick did not have a clear explanation why Nebraska would rank first in overcrowding going off of operational capacity, but second in terms of design capacity. It could be because Alabama’s prison system found a way to offer more bed space, but he couldn’t be certain.
“I almost dreaded putting it in the report because of this,” Koebernick said. “Because it’s a little unclear.”
Koebernick said officials with the Department of Correctional Services usually don’t like to measure overcrowding by design capacity because it is stricter, but he countered that this also helped justify the $350 million approved for the brand new prison in Lincoln the Legislature signed off on in 2023.
Bosn noted that Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys measures overcrowding not by design or operational capacity, but by bed capacity, which isn’t a federally recognized measurement. Bed capacity refers to the number of beds in facilities across the system that are available to house incarcerated people, according to Koebernick’s report.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Koebernick’s report, he said two of Nebraska’s nine correctional facilities exceed bed capacity. Measured by design or operational capacity, a majority of the state’s prisons are over capacity.
McKinney said he doesn’t have a preference between design and operational capacity as measurements of overcrowding. He said he knows the system is overcrowded by examining the state’s men-only facilities.
McKinney said the Corrections Department and its allies tend to paint Nebraska’s system as less crowded than it is by combining the population of all facilities, including those that house women and minors. The problem is that males make up about 92% of Nebraska’s incarcerated population, according to Koebernick.
In 2016, the OIG determined Nebraska’s prison system to be in a staffing crisis, with 252 vacancies as of June of that year. After peaking at 527 vacancies in 2021, Nebraska’s current vacancies have dropped back to 295 as of June of this year, according to the report.
Koebernick acknowledged several areas of progress in staffing, including a dropping turnover and raising the average salary of corrections workers by $30,000 since 2015. However, he noted that multiple facilities still have staffing emergencies in effect.
Losing one facility, gaining another
Koebernick’s report came out at a unique time for Nebraska’s prison system. Bosn said if it had come out a month or so later, it would likely show the system in much better shape than it is currently.
In August, a severe storm tore roofing off of two housing units in the Nebraska State Penitentiary, displacing more than 380 men who were living there. As of Sept. 15, nearly 200 inmates were still in relocated areas.

A bright side of this, Bosn said, is that the relocation found a vacant housing unit that opened up 100 new beds the department can use once the relocated inmates return. She said she is hopeful some of those beds can be used to house inmates from McCook’s Work Ethic Camp, which is poised to be transitioned into an ICE detention center.
McKinney said Koebernick’s report shows that now is a bad time for Nebraska to pull one of its existing correctional facilities out of service. He argued it would only worsen the state’s overcrowding emergency.
Koebernick said because the Work Ethic Camp only has about 140 people housed there now, it likely won’t have an immediately noticeable impact on Nebraska’s prison overcrowding. In all likelihood, many of the current inmates will be sent to community corrections centers, where they would have graduated anyway, he said.
However, Koebernick said he is concerned about the long-term impacts, given the McCook center offers programming not offered in most other facilities, like specific re-entry and rehabilitative services. The average stay in McCook is only six to nine months, he said, so there will likely be continued need to house inmates over time who would have otherwise gone to the Work Ethic Camp.
The new prison in Lincoln should bring the system below the design capacity threshold as well, he said, but only if the population remains level.
McKinney has maintained that the new prison will be overcrowded by the time it opens. He noted that the current system was built to house 4,500 people, and the new prison is designed for 1,500 beds. With the current population over 5,700 inmates, that doesn’t leave much room for change.

An influential constellation of local business groups is pushing lawmakers to scale back the Senate’s sweeping data-privacy proposal, which one Democrat pitched as the strongest in the nation.","A LEGISLATIVE PUSH to curtail data collection could put Beacon Hill on a collision course with the world’s most powerful tech companies, but in the early days of debate, some of the loudest opposition has come from much closer to home. 
After Senate Democrats last week approved a wide-reaching bill that would allow consumers to opt out of targeted advertising and allow companies to collect only data necessary for the service or product requested, local retailers and smaller Massachusetts firms — and not just Meta, Google, and other power players — are putting pressure on the House to change course. 
The Senate’s approach, they argue, would put Bay State employers at a disadvantage compared to their peers in 18 other states. 
“This is way beyond just a Silicon Valley issue,” said Sam Larson, vice president of government affairs and legal counsel at the Associated Industries of Massachusetts. “It is certainly a Main Street concern.” 
A who’s who of influential local industry groups wrote to Senate Democrats last month to outline their issues with the legislation, which seeks to rein in what Senate President Karen Spilka called the “Wild West of data collection in Massachusetts.” 
The letter argued that the measure would “diverge from a mainly uniform approach that has been adopted by 18 states,” and therefore would make Massachusetts “an outlier in an increasingly competitive economic environment.” 
Leaders of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, AIM, National Federation of Independent Businesses Massachusetts chapter, Retailers Association of Massachusetts, and New England Connectivity and Telecommunications Association signed the letter, according to a copy shared with CommonWealth Beacon. 
“Businesses have been clear to me that they are going to comply with whatever is thrown at them, but there’s a cost associated with having to create a [response to a] Massachusetts-specific statute,” said RAM vice president and general counsel Ryan Kearney. The legislation, which the Senate unanimously approved on September 25, would significantly alter the way companies interact with Bay Staters online. Consumers would gain new power to modify any data collected about them and to opt out of it being sold. Some information such as precise location, sexual orientation, or government-issued identifiers would be deemed “sensitive data” and protected even more strongly. 
Supporters say tighter restrictions are critical to maintain privacy and security, especially with internet-connected devices now in virtually every building, bag, and pocket. 
“I don’t think there’s any doubt in my mind that this [data] is being sold, and there are no rules limiting it now,” Senate Majority Leader Cynthia Creem said when she unveiled the measure. 
However, industry leaders contend that many local companies would be affected, not just large technology platforms. 
AIM recently commissioned a survey of 100 small businesses in Massachusetts and found a large majority rely on digital consumer data. Eighty-six percent of respondents said their marketing makes use of non-sensitive data — more general information about consumers than traits such as sexual identity or government-issued identifiers that senators want to regulate even more strictly — and 75 percent use anonymized customer location data to make decisions about where to advertise or where to open new locations. 
Nearly six in 10 of the companies that responded to the survey said their businesses would be negatively impacted if Massachusetts lawmakers restrict data collection, according to results obtained by CommonWealth Beacon.  
While the larger companies might be working behind the scenes, they are not staking out much of a position publicly. Meta, Google, and Apple did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
The State Privacy and Security Coalition, which represents tech giants as well as companies in other industries such as CapitalOne, Nike, and General Motors, has been closely monitoring the bill, but so far has not issued any public statement on the Senate action. 
Larson said AIM does not oppose the idea of strengthening data privacy, but he criticized the Senate-approved bill as taking too different an approach from other states that have tackled the issue. 
Several opponents pointed to the approach to data minimization, or how the legislation would curtail the universe of information that can be gathered, as a particular pain point. 
Companies could only collect what the bill defines as “sensitive data” when doing so is “strictly necessary” to fulfilling the service or providing the product the customer requested. Other information not deemed sensitive could only be collected when “reasonably necessary” for the product or service. 
That bifurcation appears to create a stricter framework than in most other states, which typically require affirmative consent for collecting or processing sensitive data, according to business leaders and other insiders tracking the bill. 
The Senate proposal also limits collection of both categories of data to a specific product or service, while other states and the EU must inform a consumer of what they will gather and why. 
“The more unique, the more expensive compliance is,” Larson said. 
Other sections of the bill would allow adults to opt out of data sales related to targeted advertising and ban targeted advertising to minors altogether. 
Kearney suggested the practice is not as nefarious as some reform supporters might suggest.  
“Targeted advertising provides consumers an opportunity to learn about new product offerings that might be of interest to them based on their activity. That’s the equivalent, in our minds, to walking around a virtual mall. They get to go see different things,” he said. “On the internet, you don’t necessarily see those other options unless they’re provided to you.” 
So far, opponents have been successful at keeping one provision out of the mix: creating a private right of action, which would allow individual consumers to file lawsuits contending their information has been misused. 
None of the data-privacy laws passed by roughly 20 other states included a private right of action. 
It’s not clear whether or when House Democrats will roll out their own data-privacy measure, and until then, local groups will continue to make their case. 
“[We] support the idea of setting up a framework to regulate the use of consumer data,” Kearney said. “We just want to make sure it’s done in a fashion that does not impact our businesses or does not create on new costs or unnecessary costs when, again, there’s a proven model that’s been starting to emerge across the country.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/68912d9c29c18.hires_-scaled.webp?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 12:57:51.431190

(Photo courtesy of Candace Harmon/Concordia College)MOORHEAD, Minn. — North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said law enforcement and prosecutors need to be prepared to combat crimes committed using artificial intelligence. 
Artificial intelligence “is not emerging, it’s here,” Wrigley said Wednesday while speaking at Concordia College in Moorhead, which is developing a criminal justice program in partnership with Minnesota State Community and Technical College Moorhead.
Wrigley referenced a case his office is investigating involving students at Fargo Davies High School using AI to create images used to sexually harass other students.
Wrigley on Tuesday said the investigation began at a West Fargo middle school earlier this year with a report of a student’s face on a nude photo. The image was being shared by a high school student on Snapchat.
Investigators identified more victims of sexually exploitative material, and on Sept. 22, law enforcement executed search warrants on 24 phones of students with another 30 phones targeted this week. “The investigation is growing,” Wrigley said at the press conference. 
In other instances, Wrigley said Wednesday, AI is being used to create false documents to extort people. 
As Concordia launches a criminal justice undergraduate program, Wrigley told students in the audience to be prepared to fight criminals and societal problems than can come with AI. 
“It’s at your fingertips. You’ve grown up with it,” Wrigley said of technology and AI. “It can be used for good and bad.”
Combating AI crimes is “essential for making the next 30 years look better for the criminal justice system,” Wrigley said. 
Wrigley said a criminal justice program at Concordia in Moorhead, a border city to Fargo, could help address the need for lawyers in North Dakota that are needed to keep the legal system running. 
“There is nothing more important than personnel,” Wrigley said.

(U.S. Drought Monitor screenshot)New Hampshire is sinking deeper into drought as fall sets in, despite the few inches of much-needed rain that fell across much of the state in late September. 
“It wasn’t enough to account for the deficit between the amount of rain we typically expect by this point in the year and what we’ve actually received,” said New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone. “And we need more.”
As of Tuesday, Sept. 30, all of New Hampshire was officially experiencing drought conditions, according to a new report released Thursday, Oct. 2, by the U.S. Drought Monitor.
At the end of September, 32.80% of the state, including much of Carroll, Grafton, and Sullivan counties and portions of Belknap, Coös, and Merrimack counties, was experiencing extreme drought. About half of the state was experiencing severe drought and the remainder was in moderate drought, according to the report. That encompasses the southern 5% of the state that had not yet been considered as officially experiencing drought until this week’s report.
As winter draws nearer, drought conditions across the state raise concerns about water supplies throughout the rest of the year. If frost sets in before the drought is broken, groundwater supplies will remain depleted throughout the winter, Stampone said.
“Once the ground freezes, we aren’t able to recharge the groundwater system until spring. For folks who are on wells or otherwise rely on groundwater systems for water, you know, they run the risk of having water shortages during the winter months,” she said.
In recent years, drought conditions in late summer and early fall have become a trend, Stampone said. Climate change is making droughts during this time of year more severe, even while it is making New Hampshire wetter overall, she said.
“Almost every year for the past 10 years we’ve had a dry patch during a warm summer that leads to at least a severe drought,” Stampone said. 
This year, that trend was exemplified as New Hampshire experienced its driest summer since at least 1895. The summer was also within the top 10 hottest summers on record since then, when data begins, Stampone said.
In the White Mountains and Lakes Region, where New Hampshire’s drought is most severe, some weather stations are reporting a rain deficit of about 5 inches — meaning they have recorded about 5 inches less rain since April 1 than they would have expected in a typical year, according to Stampone. But, she said, there is no magic quantity of rain that will be necessary to remedy the situation. It would likely take more than 5 inches of rain to bring the region out of drought before winter.
“The water needs to soak into the soil and get into the groundwater, you know,” she said. Much of the rain that falls will run off the state’s dry soils, meaning that more water will be necessary to replenish groundwater. And warmer-than-normal temperatures stretching into the fall pose another challenge to rehydrating soils, she said.
Stampone said she continued to recommend residents conserve water. In recognition of the drought and risk of wildfire, Gov. Kelly Ayotte implemented a statewide burn ban prohibiting open fires and smoking in woodland areas. 
However, Stampone said, while the extreme drought conditions have challenged New Hampshire’s environment and farmers, New Hampshire residents can still enjoy autumnal traditions.
“Still go out and enjoy things,” she said. “… Folks are concerned about what the foliage is going to look like, you know, what has this done to the apples? And I’ve heard from some of the agricultural specialists around the state that apple crops are still out there. Our leaves will still change color, and we actually have beautiful weather right now, so it’s still worth getting out and about.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/droughtmap102-1024x583.png,,,2025-10-02 12:57:51.431190
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-02 16:27:50+00:00,CT Mirror,"E-bikes could cut carbon, congestion, and costs — if cities take them seriously",Matt Simon & Sophie Hurwitz | Grist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/02/e-bikes-cities-carbon-congestion-costs/,"E-bike sales are booming, providing a sustainable form of transportation that improves public health. Yet cities remain committed to cars.","Last year, San Francisco voters did something exceedingly rare in car-crazy America: They closed two miles of a coastal highway to vehicles, creating a sprawling park for pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists. Of course, furious residents in the neighborhood bordering the erstwhile highway voted last month to recall their representative at City Hall for championing the transformation and, to their minds, creating a traffic nightmare on side streets — even though commute times in the area have grown by just a few minutes since the closure.
The battle in the City by the Bay is emblematic of the inflection point facing cities nationally. As more electric vehicles hit the road, the temptation is to invest heavily in the infrastructure — roads, highways, parking lots — that will preserve the status quo of prioritizing cars over people. Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing — and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars — providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option. The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?
Cities and states throughout the country are taking steps to make existing infrastructure more accommodating to those who prefer to pedal. They are lowering vehicle speed limits, building designated bike lanes, providing charging, and ensuring underserved neighborhoods don’t get left behind. All of this has been a big change in just the past few years, given that some locales didn’t regulate e-bikes at all until the late 2010s, said Leigh Ann Von Hagen, director of the Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. “All states have seen the writing on the wall,” she said. 
[RELATED: For CT city residents, bicycles are a necessity. The state is on board]
The promise of the e-bike is that it can help people of every age. Parents are carting children around on beefy models with built-in bins. Workers can use them to get to and from their jobs. Shoppers can slap saddle bags over the rear fender to haul groceries. And elderly folks, who may not be confident in their ability to operate a conventional pedaller, can use them in lieu of driving. “I have an uncle in Tennessee who started riding an e-bike when he retired because he just didn’t want to drive to the store anymore,” Von Hagen said. 
In addition to that lowering of carbon emissions — how much exactly will depend on the city and the rate of e-bike adoption, but the drop may be somewhere around 12 percent — there’s also the harder-to-quantify health benefits of people exercising more. Plus, fewer cars spewing pollution improves air quality and public health. EVs, too, release their own form of pollution: Because they’re heavier than combustion cars, their tires produce more microplastics — though their brakes produce much less dust — that sully the air and wash out to sea.
Drivers may experience range anxiety about their electric vehicle not having the juice to reach their destination, but the opposite is true for e-bikers. Older people or those with medical conditions might avoid conventional cycling because they worry about having the energy to make it somewhere, especially if there are hills in their way. With e-bike ranges far exceeding the average distance that riders are traveling (around 6 miles), range anxiety can be higher for those providing their own pedalling power. “When we do interviews with people, they will use the e-bike on eco, or even off, when they’re on flat terrain, and as soon as they get to that hill, they consistently report putting it up to the maximum,” said Jessica Bourne, an active travel researcher at the University of Bristol in the U.K. “As one participant described it: It’s just flattening their journey.”
You can see the potential for e-bikes to replace cars in how their riders compare to those on conventional bikes. Given that e-bike users have the option to let the motor do all the work, you might assume that they’re burning fewer calories. But research has shown that riders tend to travel significantly farther on e-bikes, meaning they’re getting about as much physical activity as those taking shorter trips on conventional bikes. 
Put another way: It’s less exertion, but more time spent exercising and running errands. “Once you account for increased frequency and increased duration and distance traveled, they spend longer on the bike overall, so they’re actually expending more energy on a weekly basis,” Bourne said. “That’s why they have more potential to substitute for motorized vehicles.” 
Indeed, several studies have shown that people are already replacing car trips with e-bike rides on a wide scale. And the more bike-friendly cities make themselves, the more people opt for two wheels: Between 2009 and 2014, commuting by conventional bikes and electric versions doubled in New York City and Washington D.C., thanks in part to better bicycle infrastructure. E-bike sales in North America doubled between 2018 and 2021. (So too have e-bike and e-scooter related injuries increased, due largely to insufficient and unsafe infrastructure for riders.) 
Established cycling havens like the Netherlands — where the average person rides 680 miles a year, despite the chill of winter — show just how much the built environment can influence travel choices. “In the Netherlands, we say there’s no bad weather — there’s only bad clothing,” said Joost de Kruijf, a travel behavior researcher at Dutch Cycling Intelligence. “Once you reach a kind of threshold where you do all your trips by bicycle, then it just becomes a habit.”
The challenge, though, is that e-bikes remain expensive — anywhere from around $1,000 to over ten times that amount — putting them out of reach for the people who could benefit the most. Low-income folks without cars would get access to more employment opportunities if they had e-bikes, Bourne said, because they would be able to travel farther with more ease. Similarly, young people would have greater access to education opportunities at colleges beyond walking distance or transit routes. That’s especially true for people living car-free somewhere with poor public transportation, a problem known to researchers as transport poverty. 
The solution, Bourne said, is to subsidize e-bikes. California, for instance, has provided up to $2,000 for low-income residents to buy them, though the program is no longer accepting applications. Denver has offered similar support. “If it’s going to benefit the planet and it’s going to reduce the cars on the road, then why don’t we provide the subsidies for e-bikes, as we do for electric cars?” Bourne asked. “It just seems bananas to me.” 
In fact, studies have shown that rebates incentivizing EV purchases and rebates that incentivize e-bikes can be equally effective, both costing about a dollar per ton of avoided carbon dioxide emissions, at least in British Columbia. “The big difference is electric bike incentives come with a whole range of other co-benefits,” said Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering and planning at the University of British Columbia. “Whereas electric car incentives actually have some downsides, because we know it incentivizes even more driving, which makes congestion worse, and leads to more sedentary lifestyles, and leads to higher infrastructure costs.” (Some research has shown what’s called a rebound effect: Because electric vehicles are cheaper to operate, there can be a modest increase in total vehicle miles traveled.) 
Indeed, in a report published last week, Bigazzi found that an e-bike rebate program in British Columbia helped recipients increase their cycling by 25 miles per week and reduce their car use by almost 11 miles. That, in turn, reduced emissions from travel by 17 percent per year, and increased physical activity during travel by 13 percent. Denver has said its popular e-bike voucher program has helped eliminate 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.
Experts say cities could also start to think about bike-share programs as an extension of their public transportation systems. “It really is a public benefit to get people from point A to point B without needing to park or drive a car,” said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. “There is an argument that having some sort of public subsidy, like public transit does, could greatly increase the number of folks that are able to use those systems.”
Cities where those programs already exist have seen success. Citi Bike in New York, run by the rideshare company Lyft, can be a model. With over a million riders every year, the program, which provides e-bikes and conventional bikes, is an accessible part of the city’s infrastructure. 
Beyond making the bikes accessible, though, lies the challenge of making cities accessible for bikes. “I think the infrastructure needs to be somehow retrofitted for these faster mobility devices,” said Greg Rybarczyk, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint, who studies e-mobility in the Detroit metro area. Making sure bikers know the rules of the road — and drivers know how to handle bikers — is critical, too. “I think there’s a long way to go in terms of driver education and marketing campaigns,” Rybarczyk said.
Even in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed. But respondents to an e-bike user survey Rybarczyk conducted said that Detroit’s bike lanes aren’t well-maintained, putting them in unsafe situations. “The street sweepers don’t sweep the bike lanes. They don’t sweep the curbs as much. There’s a lot of debris on a lot of the routes in and around Detroit.” Maintaining — and, potentially, widening — bike lanes could do a great deal for e-bike users outside of the coastal megacities. So, too, could providing accessible charging and storage facilities, according to Amelia Neptune, who coordinates the League of American Bicyclist’s infrastructure evaluation program, Bike Friendly America. 
“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said. Some “bike pod” companies are offering a potential solution for those who don’t have garages at home to store their bikes. And some of the colleges and universities that work with Bike Friendly America are beginning to offer e-bike parking options in their dormitories. 
None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes. The gold standard, Bigazzi said, is protected infrastructure for bikes, in which a lane is physically separated from vehicles. Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times. 
Now cities face a choice: Invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists. “Cities can build out almost their whole bike network for the cost of rebuilding one or two freeway interchanges,” Bigazzi said. “So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”
This story has been updated to clarify that EVs produce less brake dust than combustion vehicles.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A Republican leader on education policy in the Oklahoma Legislature is entering the 2026 race for state superintendent.
Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, announced his candidacy Thursday morning at the Oklahoma History Center in Oklahoma City.
“I’m the only person in this race that has kids in school today,” Pugh said. “So every day I’m living this. I see what’s happening inside of a classroom. I talk to my teachers. I like to tease my colleagues, they hear from their schools. I hear from everybody’s schools as the chair of education, so it kind of gives me a unique perspective.”
He said improving literacy rates through early childhood reading programs and increasing principal training are some policies he would focus on if elected. 
Pugh leads the Senate Education Committee and a subcommittee on education funding. The Air Force veteran and aerospace industry entrepreneur was elected to the Legislature in 2016.
He joins an already crowded field running to become Oklahoma’s top education official. The winner of the 2026 General Election will lead the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the Oklahoma State Board of Education.
Pugh joins a Republican primary race against retired Bixby Public Schools Superintendent Rob Miller, current Peggs Public School Superintendent John Cox and Ana Landsaw, of Tahlequah. Retired El Reno Public Schools Superintendent Craig McVay, a Democrat, filed paperwork with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission to register a campaign this week. Former Tulsa Public Schools Board of Education members Jennettie Marshall, a Democrat, and Jerry Griffin, an independent, also are running.
Pugh enters the race with a lengthy policy record as a state lawmaker, particularly on issues impacting teachers and school funding.
He helped engineer Oklahoma’s last major teacher pay raise in 2023, which increased all teacher salaries by $3,000 to $6,000, giving higher sums to those with more years of experience. Since then, Pugh has advocated annually for another boost in teacher pay.
The Legislature started funding six weeks of maternity leave for teachers after Pugh filed legislation on the issue in 2023. 
This year, Pugh and House Common Education Committee leader Dick Lowe co-authored a new law to extend the teacher salary schedule by 15 years, allowing educators to receive small wage increases annually for up to 40 years while working in the classroom.
The same law also lengthened the academic year for public schools by a day, setting the new minimum at 181 days or 1,086 hours. Lawmakers also plugged an extra $25 million into public school funding.
Other legislation from Pugh this year encoded in state law Gov. Kevin Stitt’s 2023 executive order that outlawed university spending on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
Opposing DEI programs was a major policy goal for Oklahoma’s former state superintendent, Ryan Walters, as well. 
Walters resigned from office on Tuesday to lead a conservative teacher nonprofit. He claimed to have eliminated DEI and “woke indoctrination” from public schools during his short tenure as superintendent.
Walters would have been eligible for a second four-year term in office, but he has not announced any intentions to launch another political campaign.
Pugh said if he’s elected, Oklahomans will see a “stark difference” in the tone and leadership from the office of state superintendent. 
“It’s not about me. It’s not about the title of state superintendent,” he said. “It’s about a person who has a heart of service that keeps kids and parents and teachers at the focal point of everything that happens in the Oliver Hodge building. And I think if we do that, we’re going to be successful.”

EGLE officials gathered with federal and local leaders, including from the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, at Heritage Landing park in Muskegon to celebrate the removal of Muskegon Lake from the U.S.-Canadian roster of Areas of Concern around the Great Lakes. 

These sites are characterized by high levels of historical pollution requiring cleanup, with the 1987 U.S.-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement establishing the Areas of Concern program to address the worst pollution. However, Muskegon was considered an area of concern before the program came into place, earning the label in 1985 after a century of pollution from industry and municipal waste. 
“Completing this long journey of recovery, restoration, and renewal is a tremendous community achievement that EGLE has been proud to assist,” EGLE Director Phil Roos said in a statement. “Along with many partners, we celebrate today’s success and look forward to supporting tomorrow’s stewardship and growth.”
Muskegon Lake covers 4,149 acres and flows into Lake Michigan from its location along the coast of the lower peninsula.
The cleanup was a joint effort between EGLE, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, local governments and tribes, and partners including Grand Valley State University, the Muskegon Conservation District, the West Michigan Shoreline Regional Development Commission and federal agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
According to EGLE, federal, state, and local project partners remediated more than 190,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment and restored approximately 134 acres of habitat and more than 6,000 feet of shoreline including nearly 100 acres of open water and emergent wetlands, as well as habitat for fish and native plants. 
The groups also removed more than 110,000 tons of logging-era sawmill debris from the lake.
EGLE says total remediation and restoration costs totaled more than $84 million, including $67 million in federal funds largely through the Great Lakes Restoration initiative alongside $17 million in state, local and private contributions.  
Muskegon Lake is the fourth area of concern in the state to be delisted, while ten sites remain.

Steve Federico, of Waxhaw, N.C., said if it hadn’t been for record keeping mistakes and plea deals that led to lighter sentencing, the man accused of murdering his daughter likely would have still been in prison. He certainly should have been, he said.
And Federico wants prosecutors to pursue the death penalty, the only punishment he thinks fits the charges against the accused killer, Alexander Dickey.
“He executed Logan,” he told the SC Daily Gazette on Wednesday. “I want him dead.”
Steve Federico said it’s what his daughter would have wanted, too.
“Logan believed in accountability,” he said. “She forgave, she forgot, but she believed people should be held accountable.”
“She wants justifiable vengeance; she deserves it,” Federico added.
On Thursday, the chief prosecutor for Richland County, Democrat Bryon Gipson, released a letter that says he hasn’t yet decided “whether or not to seek the ultimate punishment.” It criticizes Attorney General Alan Wilson for suggesting he’d take over if the solicitor doesn’t decide soon.

According to police, Dickey killed the young woman amid a multi-day crime spree that began with him stealing a car in Richland County and ended with his arrest after he broke into a Lexington County home and set it on fire.
Dickey remains in jail without bond after his indictment June 25 on 12 charges, including murder, burglary and possession of a weapon during a violent crime, according to Richland County court records.
He also is facing 23 charges in Lexington County, including arson, burglary, larceny and banking crimes, according to court records.

It’s unclear whether he intends to plead guilty or not guilty. His public defender, Fielding Pringle, declined to comment to the Gazette.
But it was Dickey’s history of past arrests and convictions that has Steve Federico questioning why Dickey was out of prison in the first place.
Since he turned 18, police have charged him with at least 48 crimes across 14 occasions, according to a criminal record report from the State Law Enforcement Division. Those are all before his charges from May.
That arrest history included 31 felony crimes — mostly breaking into vehicles, but also some theft and burglary. Ten of them were traffic crimes. He was convicted on eight of those felony charges and pled two more down to misdemeanors.
He served three terms in prison: November 2014 to May 2017, April to August 2018, and December 2019 to February 2021, state Department of Corrections spokeswoman Chrysti Shain confirmed.
At age 19, a grand larceny conviction, combined with a conviction for third-degree burglary, landed him a five-year prison sentence, of which he appears to have served half.
A drug charge led to his short stay in 2018. He was 23 years old.
And at age 24, a strong-arm robbery conviction resulted in a four-year sentence, of which he served a little more than one year.
For breaking into a vehicle in 2013 and another 2014 burglary charge, judges assigned him probation.
By reoffending, Dickey had broken the terms of his probation on multiple crimes, and a judge could have required him to serve another six years or more of prison time as a result. But that didn’t happen.
Missed information
Then, in 2023, police arrested him for burglary again.
After the prosecutors and Dickey reached a plea deal, a judge had the option of sentencing Dickey to as much as five years in prison. The judge also could have rejected the deal, keeping to the original second-degree burglary charge that comes with penalties up to 10 years.
Instead, the judge ruled the 411 days Dickey spent in jail waiting for his case to proceed was enough time served. He was let out on probation.

The issue, Lexington County’s chief prosecutor told NBC affiliate WIS-TV, was the earlier burglary charges didn’t show up in his criminal history record maintained by SLED, and the plea deal had treated the burglary as a first time for that offense, despite Dickey’s earlier convictions.
Had they known, 11th Circuit Solicitor Rick Hubbard told WIS, his office wouldn’t have struck the deal.
SLED’s explanation was that it never received fingerprints from the 2014 burglary arrest. A receipt of fingerprints is what prompts the agency to add charges to someone’s record, according to spokeswoman Renee Wunderlich.
The state police agency did not respond to the Gazette’s questions on any policy changes since for updating criminal records to prevent similar issues in the future.
‘You pissed off the wrong daddy’
In Steve Federico’s mind, everyone involved played a role. He blames the judge and solicitor for not researching Dickey’s past before approving a plea deal that let him back out into the community.
“Soft on crime is a problem,” he said. “This happened because of that.”

The story garnered national attention this week following his recounting of the crime during a Sept. 29 satellite hearing of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Oversight in Charlotte on victims of violent crime.
She was “begging for her life, begging for her hero, her father, me, that couldn’t be there. She was 5 foot 3. She weighed 115 pounds. BANG! Dead. Gone. Why?” Federico said, getting everyone in the room’s attention.
“I could sit down and explain the whole process of how it failed, how South Carolina failed Logan, the lack of communication,” he said. “What y’all did? You woke up a beast. And you pissed off the wrong daddy. And I’m going to put it out there, and I’m not going to be quiet.”
He asked the members of Congress to imagine their own children, asleep after coming home from a night out with friends, when a stranger enters and violently ends their life.
“I promise you, you will be sick and tired of my face and my voice until this gets fixed,” he said. “I will fight until my last breath for my daughter. You need to fight for the rest of our children, the rest of the innocents, and stop protecting the people that keep taking them from us.”
Politicians respond
Video of Federico’s comments, which racked up millions of views on social media, prompted responses from South Carolina politicians, including four Republicans running for governor.
In an email, Wilson issued a statement Wednesday saying he had spoken with the law enforcement agencies and was assured all were working on a plan to prosecute Dickey.
The attorney general “and the law enforcement partners involved are committed to delivering justice, upholding the rule of law and demanding law and order,” the statement continued.

Ltr from AG Wilson 9-30-25 
Weighing in on social media, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette called it a “clear illustration of our failed justice system” and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace specifically attacked Wilson, accusing him of doing “nothing” to prosecute the case.
U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman called for the impeachment of Gipson, the 5th Circuit solicitor, whom Federico accused of failing to communicate with him after his daughter’s murder.
“As the father of three daughters, my heart goes out to the father failed by a weak system that lets criminals go free,” the Rock Hill Republican said in an email sent out by his campaign and posted on social media.
Gipson issued a statement denying Federico’s accusations. In it, he said both he and his team met with the Federico family and their lawyer to discuss the status of the case within days of Dickey’s arrest. Since then, they’ve been in contact via text and phone calls, including a call as recently as Sept. 11, he said.
When asked by the Gazette on Wednesday whether he would seek the death penalty in the case, Gipson’s office declined to comment.
Then on Thursday, he sent out an email criticizing Wilson for his “hints” of taking over the case. Gipson released copies of Wilson’s letter, dated Tuesday, that asks the solicitor to “strongly consider” seeking the death penalty and reply with his intention by Oct. 10.

Ltr to AG Wilson 10-01-25 
Gipson contends making “such a determination a mere four months into the case … would set a dangerous precedent,” he wrote in a responding letter also released in Thursday’s email.
Other candidates weighing in include people wanting to replace Wilson as attorney general.
First Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, who switched parties earlier this year ahead of announcing his bid, said he met with Steve Federico. The “system failed Logan and the Federico family,” he wrote on social media.
What’s next
Because Dickey used credit cards he stole from Federico, who lived in North Carolina, and others, as well as stealing a car and a gun, the Federicos think there could be enough to get the case moved to federal court, according to Columbia attorney and former state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, who is representing the family.
The U.S. Attorney’s office has more manpower, including a special unit dedicated to death penalty cases, Harpootlian said. Federal prosecutors also don’t face the same backlog of cases Richland County does.
“Not to denigrate the local folks, they just don’t have the same resources,” Harpootlian said. “But ultimately, it’s up to the Trump Justice Department.”
Harpootlian said the family has not approached the state Attorney General’s office about taking the case.
Steve Federico said his focus for now is getting justice for his daughter.
But he also wants to pursue legislation governing how the court system handles repeat offenders. And he wants to set up a scholarship fund in his daughter’s name.
Logan Federico had recently decided she wanted to study to be an elementary school teacher, her father said. Two weeks later, she was killed.
“She would have made a difference,” her father said. “That’s what this world needed, and it’s gone.”
“Logan’s death can’t go unnoticed and in vain,” he added. “There’s got to be something positive that comes out of this.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/federico-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 12:57:51.431190

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed two new members to the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC), the agency responsible for regulating the state’s investor-owned utilities.
Ana Ortega, chief policy adviser to PSC Chair Mike La Rosa, and Bobby Payne, a former Seminole Electric Cooperative executive from Palatka who served eight years as a Republican in the Florida House (2016-2024), replace commissioners Art Graham and Andrew Fay, both former chairmen of the commission whose terms expire in January.
The PSC has come under fire for years by critics, at times approving rate increases beyond the recommendation of its own staff, sometimes with little explanation.
Speaking about Florida Power & Light’s nearly $10 billion proposed rate hike this summer that was slated to go before the PSC (the utility has since revised its proposal), Tampa Bay area Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor said the agency should be renamed the “Utility Service Commission” because “more often than not, they are in service to the electric utilities, rather than the public.”
According to research conducted by the group Food & Water Watch, the PSC has approved increasing Florida utility bills by 68% for Tampa Electric Co. customers since 2019; 44% for Duke Energy customers since 2019; and 38% for Florida Power & Light customers since 2019.
“For too long, DeSantis’ PSC has rubber stamped corporate utility wish lists, causing electricity prices to have skyrocketed under his watch,” said Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch following the announcement of the new commissioners.
“Floridians are struggling to afford the cost of living, and utility regulators have been failing to do their job. The new commissioners must break the pattern of neglect by prioritizing community need above corporate greed. Today’s appointees must usher in a new era of transparency, accountability, and affordable energy for all.”
PSC commissioners are paid $158,094 a year. Ortega and Payne’s appointments are effective Jan. 2, 2026. They are subject to confirmation by the Florida Senate.

But it’s not guaranteed he’d be called and unclear what he’d be asked.,"Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont could be called as a witness in the upcoming criminal trial of former state deputy budget director Konstantinos “Kosta” Diamantis, who is accused of soliciting bribes and gifts from construction contractors hired to build schools throughout the state. 
Diamantis’ attorney, Norm Pattis, filed a motion to add Lamont’s name to the witness list on Thursday. 
Pattis and federal prosecutors are preparing to select a jury on Friday morning, and testimony is expected to begin on Monday, despite the current federal government shutdown. 
The motion does not guarantee Lamont will be called as a witness. Federal prosecutors could object to the governor being added as a witness so close to trial or ask the judge to rule whether he is relevant. 
Lamont also could file a motion to quash the subpoena.

Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s spokesperson, did not immediately respond to questions about the motion. The CT Mirror couldn’t get a response from the U.S. Attorney’s Office due to the shutdown.
The addition of Lamont — a sitting two-term Democratic governor — to the witness list would add an additional dose of political intrigue to the trial. Diamantis faces 22 federal counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
It’s unclear what questions Pattis intends to ask the governor or what information he might provide that is relevant to the criminal trial. 
Pattis said Diamantis is also expected to take the witness stand to testify in his own defense.
“Wild horses couldn’t keep Kosta away from testifying in this case,” Pattis told the CT Mirror this week. “He has been waiting to tell his story for more than two years.” 
During Lamont’s first term as governor, Diamantis climbed to some of the highest ranks of the state government, becoming a deputy director in the state Office of Policy and Management, where he oversaw the state’s school construction program and a host of other projects, including the redevelopment of the State Pier in New London. 
Lamont fired Diamantis from that position, however, in October 2021 and opened an investigation into how Diamantis’ daughter obtained a high-paying secretarial job at the Office of the Chief State’s Attorney. 
[The Kosta Diamantis timeline: What you need to know]
Diamantis subsequently resigned his other position leading the state’s Office of School Construction Grants and Review. 
Around the same time, Lamont’s administration received its first subpoena from federal prosecutors seeking a litany of documents and information about Diamantis and a host of contractors and public building projects that he oversaw. 
Diamantis responded to his firing by filing a grievance over his termination and alleging that members of Lamont’s administration mistreated his former boss, OPM Secretary Melissa McCaw.
That grievance was eventually dismissed. 
Federal prosecutors accused Diamantis last year of soliciting bribes from a pair of contractors in return for those companies receiving lucrative deals to build several local schools. 
In court records, the U.S. Attorney’s office cited numerous text messages in which Diamantis allegedly demanded money from contractors and threatened to boot them from the construction projects if they didn’t pay up.
Some of the crimes that Diamantis is accused of committing took place prior to 2019, when Lamont assumed office and promoted Diamantis to his post in the Office of Policy and Management. 
But Lamont and his administration were always going to be part of the backdrop for the political corruption trial. 
Pattis previously asked U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill, who is overseeing the trial, to allow him to question potential jurors about their views on Lamont, who is expected to announce a bid for a third term. 
Several other former members of Lamont’s administration, including Josh Geballe, the former Commissioner of the Department of Administrative Services, were also included on an extended list of potential witnesses for the trial.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EDUCATION-AGLAWSUIT-0714-Cannon-DE-017-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 12:57:51.431190

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-02 15:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT resumes Clean Slate erasures after two-year delay,Molly Ingram | WSHU,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/02/ct-clean-slate-erasures-resumed/,The erasures of low-level criminal convictions have been a long time coming — they were supposed to happen more than two years ago.,"Connecticut has erased tens of thousands of low-level criminal convictions over the last few days under it’s Clean Slate law.
It’s been a long time coming — the erasures were supposed to happen more than two years ago.
Connecticut passed its Clean Slate law in 2021. It was expected to automatically erase misdemeanors after seven years and certain low-class felonies after 10 years.
When he signed the bill, Gov. Ned Lamont said it would change the lives of people who had committed low-level offenses and were missing out on job, housing, and education opportunities years later because of it.
Phil Kent, who is on the legal reform team at Congregations Organized for a New Connecticut, said his community was thrilled.
“When we got the law passed in 2021, you know, everybody was ecstatic about that,” Kent said. “It was a major step.”

However, the state struggled to keep its promise. Aging computer systems slowed the process, leaving people waiting.
Now, more than two years later, things are finally moving along.
“As of now, approximately 50,000 people have had their records partially or completely erased,” Rick Green with the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection said. “In the coming weeks, we expect to have erasures for more than 100,000 people.”
Kent said the update is cause for celebration. And he doesn’t have any hard feelings towards the state, even after years of delays.
“We were able to go back and develop a good working relationship with people in the administration to actually start to address some of those shortfalls,” Kent said. “And that then started us on sort of an upward swing to, you know, have progressive meetings where things were actually getting done, and we were seeing real efforts being made at the state level to address, you know, the promises made by the law that had been passed.”
But Kent is quick to admit that he’s a forgiving person, and doesn’t have a record — and for people who do, feelings about the delays are different.
“The trust has definitely been eroded,” Dawn Grant-Lockley said. “Do I think it can come back? I don’t know, because the delay said to me that it wasn’t important enough.”
Grant-Lockley isn’t eligible to have her record erased under Clean Slate, but she’s thrilled that the program is available for people who are.
And even though the delays are reportedly in the past, Grant-Lockley said the situation had a negative impact on a community that’s already weary of the justice system.
“I don’t think that the administration realizes what it feels like to go through that,” Grant-Lockley said. “To get your hopes up that something is actually going to help us.”

Grant-Lockley, though, is quick to complement the team that the state implemented to get the program moving this year.
“If this team had been in place before, I don’t believe that the delay would have been as long,” Grant-Lockley said. “But I think that this team was put into place because people were fed up because it was taking so long, because there was so much frustration, because they had said that they were able to do something and had not been able to do it. And we kept pressure on them.”
Now that erasures are back on track, she’s ready to start thinking about what’s next.
“I think it’s back to the drawing board and seeing, okay, so now we’re seeing the benefits of this,” Grant-Lockley said. “We’re seeing more people become gainfully employed. We’re seeing more people enrolling in school. We’re seeing all of these positive benefits of Clean Slate. So now let’s extend that. You know, instead of just Class E and Class B. Maybe look at some Class Cs.”
In the meantime, Connecticut’s Clean Slate law is among the most progressive in the nation.
And Grant-Lockley said, despite the delays, that’s cause for celebration.

After it was retained at the end of last session, a bill that initially proposed dissolving the Office of the Consumer Advocate is back. A newly proposed amendment could keep the office intact, though altered, but advocates said the amended bill would still compromise the office’s independence.
New Hampshire’s consumer advocate represents electricity, gas, water, and other utility customers in disputes with utility companies regarding rates, charges, and service quality. The office is charged in its establishing statute to advocate on behalf of ratepayers in any proceeding where their interests are at stake. This often occurs before the Public Utilities Commission, which regulates utilities in New Hampshire, but the consumer advocate can also represent ratepayers before other courts or boards.
Last session, Rep. Ross Berry, of Weare, introduced House Bill 610, which proposed eliminating the office and transferring its role and responsibilities to the Department of Energy.
At the time, Berry said he hoped the elimination of the Office of the Consumer Advocate would streamline energy negotiations, and that the Department of Energy was equipped to represent ratepayer interests. Consumer Advocate Donald Kreis said then that forwarding his office’s work to the governor-appointed staff of the Department of Energy would compromise the independence of the advocacy — something that, as he reiterated on Wednesday, Oct. 1, Kreis believes is essential to the office’s success.
“Our independence is our superpower,” Kreis said that day at a work session of the House Executive Departments and Administration Committee, where the bill was discussed.

Jeremy Slottje, of Hudson, listen to speakers during a Wednesday, Oct. 1, work session on a bill regarding the Office of the Consumer Advocate. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
At the session, the new committee chair, Rep. Erica Layon of Derry, introduced an amendment that would change the language of the bill entirely if adopted. Rather than dissolving the office, Layon’s amendment would alter the establishing statute of the Office of the Consumer Advocate. 
As presented Oct. 1, changes include a new paragraph that defines the consumer advocate’s role in advocating for different energy sources, calling for the advocate to pursue two defined duties: “to represent residential ratepayers by ensuring energy sources that provide the highest level of reliability are given preference over ones that are less reliable; and … to represent residential ratepayers by ensuring that the least costly of the energy sources are chosen over those that are more costly to ratepayers and taxpayers.”
The paragraph goes on to state that an advocate could be removed from their post by the governor for reasons including “a failure to fulfill these responsibilities faithfully” or “standard improprieties,” such as advocating for personal or political gain while in office.
The  amendment would also broaden the scope of professions eligible to hold the office from only attorneys to also include economists and professional engineers and require that the advocate appoint an attorney to their staff. 
Kreis said the amendment as written would challenge the office’s independence.
“I respectfully disagree with the idea of allowing the governor to remove the consumer advocate for what strikes me as potentially arbitrary and subjective reasons,” he said.
He also said focusing on different energy sources would represent a significant change for the office.
“In order to represent residential customers at the PUC, we simply don’t confront those choices,” Kreis said, adding that the structure of the electricity market meant that prices — rather than source — were the major determinant of what source purchased energy comes from.
Kreis also said it’s important that the consumer advocate is an attorney. 
“Our mission is advocacy, and that is what lawyers do,” he said. 
Residential Ratepayers Advisory Board member Neil Kirk also said the language about advocate removal should be tightened.
“It is so worded that a governor could, in effect, replace the advocate, even if they were doing a good job, because she didn’t like him. I think it’s important, I think it’s sensible, but it’s not clear enough so that it doesn’t become a political football. The one thing you don’t want is to have the consumer advocate as a political football,” he said.
Another provision in the amendment would specify that the Residential Ratepayers Advisory Board would have oversight authority over the Office of the Consumer Advocate. Kirk said that change would formalize a function that the board is already undertaking.
Representatives of the New Hampshire chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons also attended the work session to comment on the proposal.
“Utilities have a lot of money, and they have a lot of attorneys, and so having a valuable and effective consumer advocate is really important in the state,” said Patrick McDermott, New Hampshire volunteer state president. 
Layon said she introduced the amendment because the original version of the bill had failed to move forward. However, she said the committee would continue to work on the amendment; members did not vote on the amendment on Oct. 1.
The committee will take up the bill again at their next meeting.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kreisoca-1024x633.jpg,,,2025-10-02 11:58:45.897182

An ornate balcony or quirky garage door might be in reach for more Californians as homeowners associations across the state are being forced to govern without the power of exorbitant fees to enforce regulations.
Millions of California residents could get a break if they violate their homeowners association rules due to a new law that caps fines at $100, down from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Amid an affordability crisis, lawmakers and groups that represent homeowners have characterized the cap, which took effect July 1, as protecting the pocketbooks of middle- and low-income residents. However, HOA boards worry the new restriction will limit their authority to enforce rules.
Attorneys for homeowners and HOAs say it will get rid of extreme cases where board members impose unfair and egregious fines to retaliate against homeowners they dislike.
“I have seen the worst of the worst and HOAs fine thousands of dollars and foreclose on those homes,” said Edward Susolik, CEO and president of Callahan & Blaine, who represents both homeowners and HOAs. “Generally speaking, that seems reasonable to bring that down because that is one of the biggest issues living in California, because HOAs have very broad powers to enforce their rules.”
The cap on HOA fines was quietly inserted into unrelated major housing reform legislation, Assembly Bill 130, that exempts most new housing from environmental review and was led by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco. The language of a separate bill by Democratic Sen. Aisha Wahab of Fremont, Senate Bill 681, capping the HOA fee was included in the housing reform bill just days before the governor signed it into law, drawing little attention.
“We were in active negotiations with Sen. Wahab’s staff and actually provided amendments to the pro tem’s office as well. What we were promoting was greater transparency and notice when fines take place at associations and avoiding a cap at all,” said Louis Brown, an attorney who represents HOAs with the Community Associations Institute. “We were very surprised when the language showed up in AB 130.”
Sen. Wiener’s office did not respond to an email requesting comment.
 HOAs are proliferating nationwide

HOAs are a nearly inescapable reality for home buyers. Their rise continues to skyrocket as 67% of all new single-family homes built in 2024 nationwide were in communities with HOAs, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, up from 46% in 2009. In California, more than 50,000 HOAs govern around 65% of the state’s homeowners, according to the California Association of Homeowners Associations. California residents paid a median of $278 in monthly fees –– among the steepest in the nation, according to data from the Census Bureau.
They create and enforce rules for home, apartment and condominium owners and are controlled by the residents themselves, who elect and can recall board members. HOAs have faced the ire and frustration of some Californians for decades, and lawmakers have proposed legislation seeking more transparency on governing boards.
Most neighborhood disputes are resolved through casual conversation and end cordially without a fine needing to be imposed, according to David Zepponi, chief executive of the Executive Council of Homeowners and a lobbyist for HOA boards. In cases that require more formality, the board must hold a hearing where residents can explain themselves before a fine is levied. But there are extreme instances where situations escalate and devolve into expensive disputes between residents.
The new state law bans HOAs from charging late fees or interest in addition to the $100 cap, with the exception of rules that affect public health or safety. It also gives residents more leeway to absolve fees after they’ve been charged.
Lawmakers said it is a step toward addressing exorbitant fees prevalent in some HOAs.
“With nearly 65% of California homeowners living in HOAs, excessive fees have quietly drained family finances for too long,” said Wahab, who heralded the effort, in an emailed statement. “By capping fines –– except for health and safety –– we set fair standards, protect generational wealth, and finally put homeowners and HOA boards on equal footing.”
 ‘They’re guilty until the homeowner proves their innocence’

Some homeowners also see the new restrictions as a necessary check on boards that misuse their power over superfluous violations, such as painting a home a bold color.
“Our concern about violation fines in the past are that there has been no procedure for determining if a violation has occurred,” said Marjorie Murray, an advocate for homeowners with the Center for California Homeowner Association Law. “The board tells the homeowner they’re guilty until the homeowner proves their innocence.”
Many board members are fearful of the consequences of their diminished power and worry how it will affect their ability to enforce neighborhood rules, Zepponi said.
“You don’t have the leverage anymore to get people to change bad behavior,” Zepponi said. A neighbor who leaves their RV parked on the driveway in violation of association rules might just eat the $100 rather than pay for RV storage that is more expensive, he said.
“It takes a tool away from a board to make behavioral changes that are needed,” he said.
Board members have also argued that the lower fine could cost the entire community more if a neighbor continues to break the rules and refuses to pay their fees, forcing boards to pursue the only available alternative — costly litigation — more frequently.
The change is not expected to affect HOAs financially, as fines are not a significant amount of their revenue stream, according to Community Associations Institute lawyer Louis Brown.
“The days of homeowners associations telling you that your garage door needs to be painted might be over,” said Susolik, the attorney who has represented homeowners and HOA boards. “That’s probably a good thing.”

(Erica Shires/Getty Images)TOPEKA — The number of Kansans who are not affiliated with any religion, sometimes called “nones,” has doubled since 2007, in keeping with a national trend of a less religious but more spiritual America.
However, despite a nearly 15 percentage point decrease in the number of religiously affiliated Kansans in the past 16 years, a September report from the Pew Research Center ranked Kansas as the 10th most religious state in the country.
Christianity remains the dominant religion in Kansas, led by Protestants and Catholics, according to Pew’s religious landscape study that surveyed nearly 37,000 American adults. The national study showed that Christians in particular have stabilized their numbers since 2020, showing they make up anywhere from 60-64% of U.S. adults.
Kansas sits above the national average with 70% of adults identifying with Christianity. But more and more Kansans have rejected religion, favoring spirituality instead.
Atheists, agnostics and “nones” in Kansas have grown from 14% of adults in 2007 to 20% in 2014 and 28% in the most recent survey.
In 2023 and 2024, 60% of Kansans surveyed considered themselves at least somewhat religious, compared to 72% who considered themselves somewhat or very spiritual. Around 30% of adults in Kansas said in the most recent survey that religion is not too or not at all important, and 43% said it was very important. That’s a marked increase from 2007, when 13% said religion was not important and 61% said it was very important.
In 2014, 76% of Kansans said they were religious, and in 2007, 84% of Kansans claimed a religion. Most Kansas Christians in the most recent survey said they were evangelical or mainline Protestant. Catholics now make up about 18% of Kansas’ Christian population, while less than 1% of Kansans practice other religions.
The percentage of Kansans who attend religious services weekly has declined from 48% in 2007 to 34% in 2023 and 2024. Those who seldom or never attend services grew from 21% to 40%.
Pew cautioned trend comparisons with its most recent data because the two previous surveys were conducted by phone, while the 2023-2024 survey was conducted mostly online and on paper.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/churchphoto-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-10-02 11:58:45.897182

The newsroom found in September that of the $15.5 million of money nearly 150 local governments had received since 2022 from companies that contributed to thousands of Mississippi overdose deaths, elected leaders used less than $1 million to prevent the crisis from proliferating. That roughly $945,000 was the only part of Mississippi’s total settlement share, over $124 million as of this summer, used to address addiction.
Soon after the investigation was published, Jackson city council member Kevin Parkinson shared how the devastating effects of deadly overdose can permanently scar any family, including his own, at a late September council meeting. 
A few days later, years after Jackson received its first check from lawsuits intended to prevent more drug deaths, Parkinson told Mississippi Today he wants the city to use that money to curb an addiction public health crisis that has claimed the lives of thousands of Mississippians. 
The city had received over $500,000 since 2022 from drug companies that contributed to the decades-long opioid crisis. Jackson, so far, has spent that money on routine general expenses such as construction — a common trend among the 147 local governments in the state receiving settlement shares, according to the investigation. 
Parkinson, who was elected in June, said he didn’t know what the city had spent its money on until the newsroom’s investigation, and it was disappointing to learn about the dollars funding efforts such as moving city offices. 
He said his 32-year-old sister died of an overdose in 2023. She entered addiction treatment but relapsed a number of times, and Parkinson remembers when he and his parents would drive through the Chicago suburbs searching for any sign of her, hoping she was still alive.

Parkinson said he doesn’t see government bodies as the biggest victims in the epidemic, despite the fact Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office has allowed Mississippi local governments to use tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars for any public purpose. 
“Families really, really paid the ultimate price,” he said.
Parkinson said he wants to explore ways for Jackson residents with expertise about the epidemic to share ideas for the money’s best uses — whether that’s through a public hearing or a community-led task force. 
Mayor John Horhn, who took office July 1, said in September that he wants to see Jackson’s opioid settlement money spent primarily on violence prevention in the future. In the same speech, he said anything Mississippi governments can do to prevent fentanyl overdoses is a good thing.

Nic Lott, Horhn’s spokesperson, did not respond to an email that asked what steps the mayor wanted to take to address the addiction crisis and if Horhn would support a public hearing related to Jackson’s settlement dollars.  
Parkinson said Jackson needs to address important problems, including violence, but spending this money on addiction prevention, treatment and recovery could save lives. He said it would’ve been helpful for Fitch to restrict the funds for only those efforts.  
“This is a case where I would have appreciated more handcuffs,” he said. 
Officials representing four other Mississippi cities and counties, stretching from the Tennessee border to the southern end of the Pearl River, also confirmed they’ve recently taken steps to start spending the settlement money they control to prevent more deadly overdoses.
Officials in Lowndes County plan to send future settlement dollars of up to $50,000 over the next 12 months to Community Counseling Services, the region’s community mental health center, said county administrator James Fisher. Previously, the supervisors had directed over $140,000 for general services. 
“Counties are not really equipped to turn funds like that into something meaningful,” Fisher said. “We just decided that they would be better to use the funds than what we were using them for.”
Keenyn Wald, Community Counseling Service’s clinical and operations director, said the center lost state grant funding last spring that it used for its addiction treatment services. Before the cuts, one of those programs helped over a dozen people a month  receive treatment while they continue to work.
“Then that decreased pretty dramatically because the funding just stopped,” he said.
While Lowndes County opioid settlement money won’t fully make up that shortfall, Wald said, it will help the program scale up again. 
The Yazoo County Board of Supervisors recently agreed to use the dollars it controls to try to prevent more overdoses in the community if it wins additional funds from the state Legislature’s settlement share, according to the Yazoo Herald. The Legislature and the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council oversee most of the state’s money from the lawsuits, and they’re expected to start distributing that for opioid-related projects next year.

If lawmakers and the council approve Yazoo’s grant, the supervisors said they would combine those dollars with the money sent directly to them to hire two social workers to lead county overdose prevention efforts for four years. They’re calling the program Yazoo Health, Education, Access, Leadership and Sustainability — or Yazoo HEALS. 
Supervisors had previously placed around $74,000 of settlement money in the county’s general fund.
“We received the money but really had no plan on how to use the funding for opioid addiction,”  said David Peyton, one of the supervisors. 
He said if the HEALS plan moves forward, the county’s future settlement checks would also go to this fund. Now that the supervisors and county lobbyist Sam Martin have developed a plan, Peyton said it’s easier to see how the local dollars can prevent deaths. 
“If we can help people that have that addiction to find ways to stop using opioids in this way, then we’re really helping the community as a whole, one person at a time,” Peyton said. 
Near the state’s northern border, Hernando Mayor Chip Johhnson successfully lobbied the city’s aldermen in September to split future opioid settlement dollars between DeSoto County emergency mental health services and a local program to divert people charged with low-level drug crimes away from law enforcement and toward addiction treatment. 
In June, Johnson wrote to Mississippi Today that the city was using its $73,000 from the opioid settlement to offset the cost of an ambulance. He recently said he still believes that will prevent more drug deaths but hopes  spending money more directly on overdose prevention will go further toward that goal.
Johnson said he would recommend that other Mississippi mayors follow his example in spending settlement money for mental health. 
“It’s a long-term solution that is going to work for your city,” he said.
Pearl River County could use its more than $500,000 of unspent opioid settlement money to address addiction but is still figuring out the best way, according to County Administrator Adrain Lumpkin. 
He said local addiction treatment nonprofits also applied for opioid settlement grants from the state, which the advisory committee will prioritize if the applicants provide matching funds. If the nonprofits end up winning grants, the county wants to use opioid settlement dollars for those matching funds.
Lumpkin said Pearl River County officials are exploring a school program to dissuade kids from using opioids. They know prevention saves lives and money, but they don’t know the best ways to create that curriculum.

Other states’ governments have provided guides for cities and counties on how to determine a community’s addiction response needs, develop projects to address those needs and combine resources with other nearby governments. Fitch and the Mississippi Legislature haven’t done that, and Lumpkin said it’s been hard to know how to implement Pearl River County’s prevention ambitions. 
“My degree is in accounting. It’s not in social work,” Lumpkin said. “We’re going to have to invent a wheel, because we’re not getting it. It’s not passed down.” 
As she handed out free doses of the opioid overdose-reversing drug naloxone in Jackson on the city’s “Save a Life Day,” Brittany Denson stressed the life-saving potential of the settlement dollars. She’s in long-term opioid addiction recovery, and she uses her experience to help others struggling with the disease at the Hinds County sober living home Grace House.

The recovery residence only serves women, and she said there’s no equivalent nonprofit men’s setup in the area. That’s one of many overdose prevention resource gaps she sees in central Mississippi. 
She said public input opportunities, like the ones Parkinson is pondering, are crucial for spending settlement money responsibly. 
“It gets real dangerous when people of authority, who don’t understand lived experience, start changing the terms of what recovery looks like and kind of shuns people who have that lived experience out of those things.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25172300/Save-a-Life-Day-10.jpg,,,2025-10-02 10:56:42.651915

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — University officials across Kansas celebrated a third year of growing enrollments on Wednesday, even though  the future will present more challenges. 
“We’re obviously extremely pleased,” said Blake Flanders, president and CEO of the Kansas Board of Regents. “It’s a third consecutive year of growth, and we’re really glad to see that it’s spread out — the public universities, community colleges and technical colleges are all up, so very, very positive news.”
In general, Board of Regents public universities saw enrollment growth or stayed level. The only drop was at Fort Hays State University, which essentially stabilized with a decrease of 0.2%. Washburn University increased enrollment by 2.3%. 
Twelve of 19 Kansas community colleges also posted enrollment growth, although Fort Scott Community College seeing a decreased enrollment of 17.2%, Kansas Board of Regent data showed. All six technical colleges Increased or stayed stable in their enrollment. 
Emporia State University saw the biggest enrollment jump this year of 5.8%, a strong recovery after posting losses since 2020. The school increased enrollment by 263 students, for a total of 4,820.
In a letter to students, ESU president Ken Hush attributed the growth to no tuition or fee increase for two years, increasing student scholarships awarded by 141%, investment in student activities and more funding from the ESU Foundation, among other factors.
The university fired tenured faculty as part of restructuring efforts. 
“When we began our transformation, we predicted changes in our enrollment as we took on the challenges facing our university, with the prediction for fall 2025 holding stable after some initial decreases,” Hush wrote, adding he was pleased to instead post a 6% increase.


Kansas State and Wichita State increased enrollment at about the same rate, 4.6% and 4.3%, respectively.  The University of Kansas posted a 1.2% increase, while the University of Kansas Medical Center enrollment increased 1.9%.
“We’ve been working diligently on a strategic enrollment plan, and we’re really seeing the fruits of the labor across campus and have had some of the largest enrollment gains that we’ve seen,” said Karen Goos, K-State’s vice provost for enrollment management.
Freshmen enrollment numbers were up 7.5% this year, she said. Growth is occurring with both new students and retention of current students, Goos added. 
Scott Cason, Fort Hays State University spokesman, said the school’s on-campus enrollment increased by 2% this year and the number of new undergraduate students attending the school grew by 9%. 
“Our residence halls are in full capacity right now,” he said. “We haven’t seen that in a long time. It shows you that the on-campus experience is still a draw, even in times where there have been increasing questions about the perception of the value of the college degree.”
The school did see a small decrease in international students and in general in online enrollment, Cason said. Once dominating among Kansas schools in online enrollment, FHSU has more competition in that arena and experienced a drop after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other schools are reporting decreasing numbers of international students, but that data won’t be collected by the Board of Regents until later in the school year, Flanders said. 
Cason said Fort Hays State lost only three international students. He attributed that to their diversity of enrollment sources internationally. 
“We’re actually up in our early college program that includes our international students. We have partner campuses,” he said, adding that although they have strong partnerships in China, they also draw from Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia and Senegal.
“We haven’t seen the disruption that other schools have seen that count more heavily on traditional international student models,” he said.
Challenges are expected for post-secondary institutions in coming years as the number of students graduating from Kansas high schools will begin decreasing next year. The change is often referred to as an enrollment cliff. In addition, schools are already experiencing decreases in graduating high school students who enroll in higher education, she said.
“What we’re seeing is the percent of students who are having any post-secondary credentials after high school has declined pretty significantly,” Goos said. “We actually have seen an increase of high school graduates. This will be the last year. After this, we will start to decline.”
Flanders said the decrease in number of graduating high school students in 2026 is one of the primary challenges facing higher education. 
“That’s probably not going to be just a two- or three-year challenge,” he said. “That’s going to be that way for the foreseeable future. That just means the pool of traditional college-age students will continue shrinking, even as the demand for college-educated workers keeps growing.”
That makes it imperative for Kansas to increase the number of students going to college to meet workforce needs, Flanders said. 
“I think we’ve also got to work to enroll adult learners, including those who may already have some college credit but no degree,” Flanders said. “I don’t think that there’s going to be a silver bullet answer to it, but I’m really proud of the steps that the system in our institutions have taken to get ready for those challenges, and I think that we’ll be able to meet them.”

(Photos by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger has opened a double-digit lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor’s race, according to a new Emerson College Polling/The Hill survey that shows a dramatic shift among independent, male and younger voters.
Since January, Spanberger’s support climbed from 42% to 52%, while Earle-Sears ticked up just one point, from 41% to 42%, the poll found.
“Spanberger has picked up significant momentum since the first Emerson College poll at the beginning of 2025, driven by increases in support from independents, males and younger voters,” said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling. 
“Independent voters support Spanberger by a 19-point margin; a reversal from January, when they supported Earle-Sears by four points. Notably, the male vote, which traditionally favors the Republican candidate, shifted from a 15-point advantage for Earle-Sears to an even split, with 46% supporting each candidate,” Kimball added.
The Democratic nominee has also consolidated support among younger Virginians. 
“Spanberger’s support also increased among voters under 50: what was once a narrow 41% to 39% edge has grown into a 27-point lead, 59% to 32%,” Kimball said. “Meanwhile, Earle-Sears has not consolidated support among older voters; in January, those 50 and older were evenly divided, 43% for Spanberger and 42% for Earle-Sears. Nine months later, the group remains split with 49% for Earle-Sears and 47% for Spanberger.”
The poll found Spanberger and Earle-Sears’ ballot strength mirrored their overall popularity in the state. Spanberger holds a 51% favorability rating, compared with 42% for Earle-Sears. Thirty-eight percent have an unfavorable view of Spanberger, while 44% view Earle-Sears unfavorably.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who will leave office in January, maintains a 46% approval rating, with 41% disapproving. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is underwater in Virginia, with 42% approving of his job performance and 54% disapproving.
“While Governor Youngkin maintains a positive approval rating, Lieutenant Governor Earle-Sears does not appear to benefit from it,” Kimball said. “Among voters who approve of the Governor, 11% plan to support Spanberger, while 4% of those who disapprove of the Governor plan to support Earle-Sears.”
The survey also highlighted the issues shaping voters’ decisions. 
The economy tops the list at 35%, followed by threats to democracy at 20%, education at 10%, health care at 9%, housing affordability at 8%, immigration at 6% and crime at 6%.
When asked what issues are “very important” to their vote, 79% cited the economy, 78% education, 71% health care, 66% threats to democracy and 64% housing affordability. Just 27% said transgender issues were very important. Voters who prioritize the economy broke for Spanberger 51% to 44%.
The survey also tested opinions on key policy debates. A large majority — 76% — said they favor eliminating the state’s personal property tax on vehicles, a proposal popular across party lines: 89% of Republicans, 66% of Democrats and 73% of independents back repeal.
On data centers, 42% said they support building more in Virginia, 39% oppose the expansion and 18% are unsure. About two-thirds of voters said they are at least somewhat familiar with the facilities.
The Emerson College Polling/The Hill survey of 725 likely Virginia voters was conducted Sept. 28-29. The poll has a credibility interval, similar to a margin of error, of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

(Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)Every day, millions of gallons of oil move from the Arctic through the trans-Alaska pipeline to the small coastal town of Valdez, 600 miles away.
There, high above the waters of Prince William Sound, the oil is piped into massive storage tanks, where it sits until ships come to pick it up, typically bound for refineries in the Lower 48.
These tanks, and the risk they pose to the environment, are at the center of a new feud between the oil industry and Valdez’s city government.
City officials, through their attorneys, argue that aging environmental safeguards — part of contingency plans approved by state regulators last year — are no longer adequate to prevent stored oil from escaping the storage tanks and polluting the sound.
The consequences, they say, could be catastrophic, potentially involving a release of as much oil as the infamous 1989 spill that contaminated the sound when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef.
Any spill at the Valdez port “would have a huge impact on the citizens of Valdez, and on all Alaskans,” Jake Staser, an Anchorage-based lawyer representing the city, said in a phone interview.
Valdez’s economy is deeply intertwined with the oil industry, which sustains many of the town’s high-paying jobs and pays substantial local property taxes.
But the flare-up is the latest example of how the city’s interests have sometimes diverged from those of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. — the business that operates the trans-Alaska pipeline and the Valdez Marine Terminal, the massive shipping complex where the storage tanks sit. Alyeska is owned by affiliate companies of Hilcorp, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, the state’s major oil producers.
The new dispute comes on the heels of lawsuits brought by city officials over oil-related property taxes and financial transparency, and a few years after a lengthy report questioned safety practices at Alyeska’s export site.
Alyeska, for its part, says the likelihood of a big spill is vanishingly small. And state regulators note that the company, as required by law, has extensive measures in place to prevent and respond to one.
But observers and watchdogs say they’re increasingly concerned about the integrity of some of the company’s infrastructure and its risk of failure.
An aging barrier against spills
Alyeska currently uses 13 of the 18 tanks that were originally installed at the export terminal, and each can hold roughly 500,000 barrels of oil.
While they’re typically not all full at once, the site has the capacity to store more than 6 million barrels of crude — roughly one third of the nation’s daily petroleum use.
The current dispute is quietly playing out before regulators and an administrative judge — part of the state’s review of Alyeska’s contingency plan for spills at the export terminal. That plan is up for renewal every five years. Regulators re-approved it last year, and the city of Valdez contested that decision in March.
The contingency plan is expansive, filling three volumes with 1,000 pages. And Valdez’s appeal involves numerous issues, including Alyeska’s ability to detect leaks from its storage tanks and the company’s preparedness to respond to a spill.
One of the city’s primary concerns is a buried layer of asphalt that’s supposed to seal off the ground beneath the tanks from any oil that spills out of them, protecting groundwater and the Port Valdez fjord — an arm of Prince William Sound — from pollution.

The tanks sit in large dikes intended to keep spilled oil from leaving the site. Observers are less concerned about crude washing straight into the sound than it seeping into the ground through cracks in the asphalt, and potentially contaminating groundwater that flows into the ocean.
The asphalt liner was built at the same time as the tanks, in the mid-1970s. Since then, only a tiny fraction of it has been inspected for damage, according to documents submitted by the city to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
In the small portion of the liner that’s been assessed, “pre-existing holes, cracks, and tears” and “numerous spills and leaks” have been detected, the city says. The status of the asphalt has long been a cause for concern among local industry observers.
Alyeska has inspected less than 1% of the liner in its 48-year history, the city said in one of its submissions to the state.
Its lawyers have called on the company to replace the liner with newer technology — or, at a minimum, to fully evaluate and repair it by 2027.
“Nobody really knows what the integrity of that liner is,” said Joe Lally, a Valdez resident who works with a local industry oversight group created after the 1989 spill, the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council.
None of the players involved in the dispute have said how much replacing the liner could cost. But it’s clear that it would be an enormous task: The asphalt is buried under several feet of soil and gravel, and it spans more than 50 acres, underlying all of the active tanks.
Alyeska has proposed a few different ways to inspect it for damage, including flooding the tank farm with water or searching for holes or leaks with an electric current.
State regulators at the Department of Environmental Conservation have yet to approve a comprehensive testing plan, though, and have repeatedly asked the company for additional information. They told Alyeska last month that its test “must produce results that [the department] can rely on to make a determination about the integrity of the entire liner” and said that details in the company’s proposal were lacking.
Earlier this month, the city asked the department to take more “expedient action” on the issue.
“We want to know where the leaks are, and to what extent leaks exist,” said Staser.
Citing the ongoing appeal, a Department of Environmental Conservation spokesperson declined to answer questions about the liner and Alyeska’s proposals to assess its effectiveness. He said that even as the department’s review plays out, Alyeska’s re-approved spill plans remain in effect and require prevention measures, response equipment and trained crews “to be in place at all times.”
Department staff “live and work in Valdez, which means our inspectors are regularly present at the terminal,” said the spokesperson, Sam Dapcevich.
“During site visits, staff observe spill drills, verify response equipment readiness, and review day-to-day operations to ensure the terminal is meetings its contingency plan obligations,” he said.
An Alyeska spokesperson, Michelle Egan, declined to comment specifically on the liner or the city’s assertions, citing the ongoing appeal.
A ‘nightmare scenario’
Alyeska’s prevention plan notes the potential for “the simultaneous failure of two tanks” in the same area, spilling between 500,000 and 900,000 barrels of oil — roughly two to four times the volume that the Exxon Valdez released.
But in other documents, Alyeska mentions a more realistic estimate of a worst-case scenario to be around 200,000 barrels, and not all of it would wind up in the water.
A large spill also might occur in a less obvious way, according to an Alyeska official, Andres Morales, who testified about the risk in a separate court case last year.

A slow leak in the bottom of one of the tanks could go undetected for months, possibly accumulating into a spill of tens of thousands of barrels of oil, Morales said.
That would be a “nightmare scenario,” he added.
“Corrosion, pinhole leaks terrify me because they happen and you’re not aware they happened,” Morales said.
Alyeska, in its filings with the state this year, has said that a worst-case spill at the tank farm is exceedingly unlikely, estimated to occur roughly once every 100,000 years.
The tanks themselves are rigorously inspected, Egan, the company spokesperson, wrote in an email to Northern Journal.
Tanks are cleaned, inspected from the inside and re-coated with sealant every 10 to 15 years, and the exterior of each tank is subject to much more frequent inspections, Egan said.
She also said that a system of electric currents, known as cathodic protection, guards against corrosion in the floor of each tank.
Alyeska has a “substantial amount” of response equipment in the event of a spill, Egan added. That includes trucks and vacuums to suck up any oil that spills on land, as well as booms and barges to recover oil in the water.
“Protecting Prince William Sound is personal — many of us live here,” Egan said. “We’re committed to working productively with regulators, stakeholders and our neighbors to safeguard the place we all call home.”
Lally, with the watchdog group, spoke highly of Alyeska’s ability to respond to spills, including the extensive equipment and training the company has developed in the years since the Exxon Valdez disaster.
“They’re the gold standard for response,” he said.
But the aging asphalt beneath the company’s tank farm, he said, is a different story. .
“If something, God forbid, ever happens to one of the tanks, and they were to lose a significant amount of oil,” Lally said, “we want to make sure that secondary containment liner is going to act as designed and hold the oil long enough for them to clean it up.”

But for almost 20 years, the Bay State has had a way to connect some people deeply in need of mental health services to intensive treatment, case management, and housing support. 
The catch? They have to be arrested first. 
A set of three Boston municipal courts and five district courts hold special sessions of mental health court, or “Recovery with Justice.” They offer a ramp off the usual judicial process for defendants on pre-trial or post-conviction probation with serious mental health issues. If defendants, their attorneys, the district attorney, and the courts sign off, the participants embark on a supervised process of mental health treatment and assistance with job and housing supports, if needed.  
They are an attempt – part of a national movement toward such specialty courts – to grapple with overlapping issues of mental health and criminal conduct. 
“There’s been a whole bevy of studies and articles that show that incarcerating someone with a mental health condition only aggravates the underlying symptoms and the underlying conditions,” said Judge Kathleen Coffey, who founded the Massachusetts mental health courts in 2007 and retired in September after 32 years on the bench. “So, in many respects, when we criminalize mental health by locking people up rather than providing them with the access to treatment and the mental health services that they need, we’re turning people into criminals, unnecessarily, unfairly, and a lot of times without due process.” 
The mental health courts make a compelling offer: If the participants agree to use it, the system will connect them with long-term and accessible mental health supports often out of reach for people in prison or just trying to navigate the crunched behavioral health landscape. But they are expensive, resource intensive, and serve just a fraction of the people in need of mental health services in and out of the criminal justice system. 
Statewide, 1.15 million adults in Massachusetts struggle with mental health issues. Among young people with depression, 57 percent receive no care at all, based on KFF data on Massachusetts mental health outcomes.  
Health officials have warned for years that workforce shortages are leading to blockages in accessing intensive mental health care even as the stigmas around seeking treatment wane. And within the criminal justice system, mental health needs abound.  
In 2022, Hampden Sheriff Nick Cocchi, the vice president of the Massachusetts Sheriffs Associations, estimated that 75 percent of the inmate population incarcerated in county jails now require addiction and mental health services. 
More than 200 defendants are participating in the state mental health courts at any given time, according to Coffey. Defendants in the program must have serious mental illness or co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, and their condition must be connected to their criminal behavior. 
According to an analysis of the program from the courts, 25 percent of mental health court participants are female and 75 percent are male. Forty-seven percent identify as white, 37 percent as Black. Over half have experienced homelessness. 
The Recovery with Justice process is something of a middle ground between the controversial practice of involuntary court-mandated mental health care and ignoring mental health factors in the criminal justice process. Massachusetts is one of only three states without assisted outpatient treatment laws, which allow judges to mandate outpatient mental health care, according to the Treatment Advocacy Center, a national nonprofit group that advocates for involuntary commitment laws. 
“While mental health courts are critical for people with severe mental illness who commit criminal acts and face prosecution, criminal conduct should never be a prerequisite for receiving effective treatment,” the group wrote in 2015 when discussing the expansion of mental health courts in Tennessee.  
The structure of the mental health courts is unusual – a twist on the typical adversarial criminal justice process. Participants agree to a program of at least 90 days of intensive outpatient services, after which they transition to a “stepdown” outpatient program, and then to an integrated primary care practice. The whole process typically takes 12-18 months. 
At a sitting of the mental health court in June, visited by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Kimberly Budd, Coffey presided over about a dozen cases. Lawyers and clients offered updates on therapy progress, medication, work training, and housing situations. 
One man had missed several required therapy sessions, and prosecutors were mulling returning the case to trial.  
“You have to take your medicine and go to therapy,” Coffey urged. If he kept to the program, “this case is going to go away,” she said. “Criminal records aren’t good. They act as barriers.” 
He agreed, quietly, and promised to see his therapist that Friday. Outside the courtroom, after the session, his lawyer reiterated the seriousness of abandoning the mental health probation process and finding himself back on the trial track.  
Participation in the mental health courts is voluntary, though mental health advocacy organizations often consider the programs with a wary eye. 
“Mental health courts are inherently coercive because defendants with mental illnesses agree to treatment with the threat of prosecution hanging over their heads,” according to Mental Health America. At the same time, the organization says, “our support for mental health courts is predicated on the fact that even coerced treatment in the community is almost always better than the manner in which persons with mental illnesses are treated in prisons and jails.” 
The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law notes that mental health courts “do not solve the systemic problems that cause people with mental illnesses to be arrested and incarcerated in disproportionate numbers.” They may also “inadvertently create incentives to arrest people to get them into services” and “lead mental health authorities to prioritize scare resources to be delivered at a late state, as part of a system that involves coercion.” 
The clinicians who work in these courts are employed by Boston Medical Center, not the court system, creating what Coffey calls “a true partnership” among the court, clinicians, probation officers, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. 
“The focus in a mental health session is, how can we assist this person to navigate systems, to access treatment, to monitor their treatment, to provide the necessary supports, so that when they complete a period of probation — either pre-trial probation or post dispositional probation — they have a skill set that will enable them not to get rearrested due to mental health concerns,” Coffey said. 
Participants at the June session assured the judge that they liked their program, that it was a “good journey,” and that they were doing their best to keep up with their programming. But even with a dedicated team, system strains intruded. One probation official explained that her defendant was struggling to access treatment beds when needed. 
That is an all-too-familiar problem for Bay State residents generally.  
Massachusetts residents seeking mental health care through traditional channels can face wait times exceeding two months for an initial assessment, according to a 2022 report from the Association for Behavioral Healthcare. Patients who seek emergency room care for behavioral health visits encounter long wait times — stuck in emergency rooms without treatment in what is known as “emergency room boarding” for more than a day — due to serious staffing shortages, according to a report from the Health Policy Commission. 
The “growing trend” of behavioral health emergency room boarding “is not only harmful for these patients and their families,” HPC Director David Selz said, “but also impacts hospital staff, non-[behavioral health] patients, and emergency medical services across the Commonwealth.” 
According to a March 2023 report, 568 inpatient beds were unavailable due to staffing shortages in August 2022, and by the end of the year 666 patients were boarding in acute care emergency departments awaiting inpatient psychiatric placement. The commission launched a program aimed specifically at boosting the behavioral health workforce in 2024. 
Having access to immediate and tailored clinical support through the mental health courts can be something of a workaround to access care, for the small number of applicants that meet the strict criteria. 
As the state grappled with provider shortages, the past four years have been a period of growth for mental health courts in Boston, which were first backed by private foundation funding and championed by retired Judge Maurice Richardson. Coffey and others looked to models in Florida and New York as they developed the Massachusetts approach, landing on a supervised recovery model and a combination of state and private buy-in. 
An expansion of the Recovery with Justice program was funded for four years by a $4 million federal grant awarded in 2020. The Boston Outpatient Assisted Treatment (BOAT) Program supported the Boston Municipal Court and Boston Medical Center partnership until funds ran out in December 2024, though the broader Recovery with Justice program is still funded by the state specialty courts budget line item. 
The state’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget allocates $7.97 million for the operation of all specialty courts statewide, a line item that covers not only the eight mental health court sessions but also 35 drug courts, six treatment courts for veterans, two homeless courts, and other specialized sessions across Massachusetts.  
Like many other parts of state government, the courts are feeling a financial squeeze in the face of looming federal cuts. While state lawmakers increased the Trial Court system budget this year, it fell far short of the extra $30 million court advocates said was needed to address serious staffing shortages and burnout.  
The program takes funding and coordination across courts, health centers, prosecutors’ offices, and treatment sites. While it has managed to weather workforce and bed shortages for the past two decades, even its boosters still note the paradox of walling off care behind a courthouse door. 
“There’s a definite weakness and flaw in our system where people have to get arrested in order to access and have the necessary supports, without question,” Coffey said. “But unfortunately, that’s the system that’s been in place. To our credit, we’re trying to make the courts accountable, accessible, and responsive to the needs of the community that we serve, and certainly individuals with a mental health condition are a very distinct and worthy community.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5F65B303-7231-4027-9244-80F95C116CD9-edited-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 09:57:47.091001

In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections that were explicitly allowed under a 2024 California law.


Three of the four California counties empowered to inspect federal immigration detention facilities have not done so, and the fourth has conducted only basic reviews of food this year, records obtained by CalMatters show.
If they were checking, local officials would be providing an additional layer of oversight at a time when the number of people held in detention centers has surged because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants. 
Two state laws provide state, county and local officials the authority to review health and safety conditions in privately-run immigration detention facilities. 
The first, passed during the first Trump administration, allows the attorney general’s office to inspect for violations of national detention standards and health or safety issues. The AG’s office has used that power to publish annual reports on conditions inside detention centers, including one this year that alleged deficient mental health care.
The second, a 2024 law, empowers counties to inspect privately run detention facilities. In the past, counties have inspected jails and prisons, finding mold, rats, and other health violations. But county health officials have not used that power to inspect federal immigration detention facilities. 
In Kern County — where three detention centers operate — the health officer, through an attorney, has said in testimony before a federal judge that he has “no intention” of exercising his new authority to inspect the facilities to ensure they comply with state and local health standards.
The companies that manage the detention centers through contracts with the federal government say they take seriously their responsibility to adhere to federal standards and uphold human rights. One unsuccessfully sued to overturn the new California inspection law, alleging it was unnecessary and an intrusion on the federal government’s authority.
More than 5,700 people are in immigration detention in California, an 84% increase since the spring. On April 16, there were  3,100 people detained in the state, according to the California Attorney General’s latest report. 
Advocates for detainees are drawing attention to what they describe as unhealthy conditions, including in the state’s newest detention center. It opened in Kern County without proper permits or a business license as required by state law, according to California City’s mayor. 
CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed immigration detention center there sits on 70 acres in the Mohave desert about 80 miles east of Bakersfield. 
A detainee who goes by the name of Loba has been locked up in the California City facility since Aug. 28. She said some detainees have not received the medication they need for more than 20 days. She asked CalMatters not to fully identify her because she feared retaliation by CoreCivic guards for speaking with a reporter. 
“There’s a lack of interest on the part of CoreCivic to care for individuals with diabetes problems and people who have heart problems or any other health conditions. They’re really not caring for detainees and not giving us the proper medical treatment in detention,” Loba said.  
She said she observed five people who needed emergency care because they could not get medication. Another California City detainee described similar conditions in an interview with CalMatters. 
Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”
“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said. 
Counties reviewing inspection law
In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections allowed under the 2024 law. A San Bernardino County spokesperson said the county has the authority to inspect for disease control and “general health and sanitation,” but he later said the reviews are limited to the facilities’ food processing and service. 
Officials from two other counties said they’ll use their new authority to respond to specific concerns, but that they had not yet done any inspections. 
The Imperial County health department said it would respond to a complaint “if the facility falls within our legal authority to inspect.” The San Diego County health department said only that it “is exploring how to effectively operationalize this law in its jurisdiction.”
California has seven immigration detention centers: Adelanto ICE Processing Center and Desert View Annex in San Bernardino County; The Golden State Annex, Mesa Verde ICE Processing facility, and the California City detention facility in Kern County; The Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County; and the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County. 
ICE pays the for-profit prison company GEO Group to operate four of the centers: Adelanto, Desert View Annex, Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center. 
MTC manages the detention center in Imperial County, while CoreCivic manages Otay Mesa and California City. 

The 2024 law gives local health officials the authority to inspect private detention facilities as they deem necessary, but it does not require them to do so unless requested by local lawmakers or law enforcement. And it does not specify exactly what county health inspectors should check, despite lawmakers and cosponsors of the bill citing “detainees facing challenges in accessing timely medical attention” as one of the reasons the new law was necessary. 
As the bill moved forward, lawmakers also cited a May 2020 COVID-19 outbreak at the Otay Mesa Detention Center that resulted in more than 300 staff and detained individuals becoming infected. “Conditions in these facilities not only affect the lives of those detained, but also impact the surrounding communities,” wrote the bill’s author, state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles. 
It passed without any recorded opposition and with unanimous votes in the Legislature. 
GEO Group sued to challenge the law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it stepped on the federal government’s authority to manage detention centers. By extension, GEO claimed intergovernmental immunity as a contractor.
“This case involves the latest in a string of attempts by the State of California to ban federal immigration enforcement in the state, or so significantly burden such efforts as to drive federal agencies and contractors involved in that constitutionally-mandated national security function from California,” GEO attorneys argued in the suit, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of California.
In federal court this year, Kern County attorney Jeremy McNutt said county health officer Kristopher Lyon doesn’t want to use the new law to inspect the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex facilities in his county. McNutt said Lyon would inspect the facility if the governor ordered him to, but otherwise, he “has no intention of inspecting the facility whatsoever.” 
“If he’s not ordered to do it then he has no intention of doing it, doesn’t really care to have the right to do it or not,” McNutt said of Lyon. “We don’t believe he has a duty to inspect the facility … There is no commitment or desire to inspect.”
A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in May, letting the law stay in place. Lyon did not respond to a request for comment about whether his position has changed in light of an influx of new detainees and the opening of a new detention center.

In the only county making use of its powers to access the detention centers, a San Bernardino County inspector spent about an hour on May 29 at  the Adelanto center for food and service issues. The facility passed, according to inspection reports. 
San Bernardino County inspector Mary Ann Glass made no notes or comments, and she found no deficiencies or violations at the facility, the paperwork shows. 
 “Yes, our inspections are limited to food processing and service,” confirmed San Bernardino health department spokesperson Francis Delapaz.
Adelanto is where a 39-year-old detainee was being held shortly before his death in September.
Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto in August, Ismael Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening and last week escorted him to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. About an hour and a half later, medical staff sent him back to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, where he died.  
Adelanto detainees, who spoke with CalMatters on condition that they not be named because they fear retaliation, said the sites are crowded, and it’s taking a long time to access medications and medical care.  
An immigrant who was arrested in an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June and spent more than a month at Adelanto, said it took three days for him to be assigned a bed when he arrived at the facility. 
During that time, he wasn’t allowed a shower or a change of clothes and wasn’t permitted to call his family. He said the dorm he ultimately slept in doubled in population, to its full capacity of about 90 people. Staff, he said, asked for volunteers to keep the walkways and windows clean, and detainees waited longer than three days to hear back about medical requests.
“Everyone was getting sick with coughs, the flu, with the air being cold all day,” he said. “Almost 50% of the people were like that.”
A Geo Group spokesperson said the company provides around-the-clock access to medical care. 
“Geo strongly rejects these baseless allegations,” spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in an email to CalMatters. “Our contracts also set strict limits on a facility’s capacity.  Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.” 
California tried to ban for-profit detention
The federal government’s own inspections indicate allegations of abuse and possible lapses in suicide prevention at the Adelanto facility. In 2024, the Office of Detention Oversight found one detainee who alleged an officer inappropriately squeezed his chest and genitals during a pat-down search, and another told inspectors he had thoughts of self-harming because of the poor conditions inside the facility. 
State inspectors released a report in April that documented similar issues with conditions across the state. Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, the report stated.  
Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that state and local oversight over detention facilities is limited, particularly after the state in 2019 attempted to ban private for-profit facilities, a bill Bonta authored as a legislator. The 9th Circuit  U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional. 
Legislators “thought the conditions and practices inside these detention centers were so bad that they should be completely prohibited. And unfortunately, that was struck down,” Bonta told CalMatters. 
“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do. The authority rests more with the federal government, particularly Congress,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092225_CalCity-Detention_MV_CM_16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

Millions of California residents could get a break if they violate HOA rules under a new state law that caps fees at $100, without late fees or accumulating penalties.


An ornate balcony or quirky garage door might be in reach for more Californians as homeowners associations across the state are being forced to govern without the power of exorbitant fees to enforce regulations.
Millions of California residents could get a break if they violate their homeowners association rules due to a new law that caps fines at $100, down from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Amid an affordability crisis, lawmakers and groups that represent homeowners have characterized the cap, which took effect July 1, as protecting the pocketbooks of middle- and low-income residents. However, HOA boards worry the new restriction will limit their authority to enforce rules.
Attorneys for homeowners and HOAs say it will get rid of extreme cases where board members impose unfair and egregious fines to retaliate against homeowners they dislike.
“I have seen the worst of the worst and HOAs fine thousands of dollars and foreclose on those homes,” said Edward Susolik, CEO and president of Callahan & Blaine, who represents both homeowners and HOAs. “Generally speaking, that seems reasonable to bring that down because that is one of the biggest issues living in California, because HOAs have very broad powers to enforce their rules.”
The cap on HOA fines was quietly inserted into unrelated major housing reform legislation, Assembly Bill 130, that exempts most new housing from environmental review and was led by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco. The language of a separate bill by Democratic Sen. Aisha Wahab of Fremont, Senate Bill 681, capping the HOA fee was included in the housing reform bill just days before the governor signed it into law, drawing little attention. 
“We were in active negotiations with Sen. Wahab’s staff and actually provided amendments to the pro tem’s office as well. What we were promoting was greater transparency and notice when fines take place at associations and avoiding a cap at all,” said Louis Brown, an attorney who represents HOAs with the Community Associations Institute. “We were very surprised when the language showed up in AB 130.”
Sen. Wiener’s office did not respond to an email requesting comment.
HOAs are proliferating nationwide
HOAs are a nearly inescapable reality for home buyers. Their rise continues to skyrocket as 67% of all new single-family homes built in 2024 nationwide were in communities with HOAs, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, up from 46% in 2009. In California, more than 50,000 HOAs govern around 65% of the state’s homeowners, according to the California Association of Homeowners Associations. California residents paid a median of $278 in monthly fees –– among the steepest in the nation, according to data from the Census Bureau.
They create and enforce rules for home, apartment and condominium owners and are controlled by the residents themselves, who elect and can recall board members. HOAs have faced the ire and frustration of some Californians for decades, and lawmakers have proposed legislation seeking more transparency on governing boards.
Most neighborhood disputes are resolved through casual conversation and end cordially without a fine needing to be imposed, according to David Zepponi, chief executive of the Executive Council of Homeowners and a lobbyist for HOA boards. In cases that require more formality, the board must hold a hearing where residents can explain themselves before a fine is levied. But there are extreme instances where situations escalate and devolve into expensive disputes between residents.
The new state law bans HOAs from charging late fees or interest in addition to the $100 cap, with the exception of rules that affect public health or safety. It also gives residents more leeway to absolve fees after they’ve been charged.
Lawmakers said it is a step toward addressing exorbitant fees prevalent in some HOAs.
“With nearly 65% of California homeowners living in HOAs, excessive fees have quietly drained family finances for too long,” said Wahab, who heralded the effort, in an emailed statement. “By capping fines –– except for health and safety –– we set fair standards, protect generational wealth, and finally put homeowners and HOA boards on equal footing.”

‘They’re guilty until the homeowner proves their innocence’
Some homeowners also see the new restrictions as a necessary check on boards that misuse their power over superfluous violations, such as painting a home a bold color.
“Our concern about violation fines in the past are that there has been no procedure for determining if a violation has occurred,” said Marjorie Murray, an advocate for homeowners with the Center for California Homeowner Association Law. “The board tells the homeowner they’re guilty until the homeowner proves their innocence.”
Many board members are fearful of the consequences of their diminished power and worry how it will affect their ability to enforce neighborhood rules, Zepponi said.
“You don’t have the leverage anymore to get people to change bad behavior,” Zepponi said. A neighbor who leaves their RV parked on the driveway in violation of association rules might just eat the $100 rather than pay for RV storage that is more expensive, he said.
“It takes a tool away from a board to make behavioral changes that are needed,” he said.
Board members have also argued that the lower fine could cost the entire community more if a neighbor continues to break the rules and refuses to pay their fees, forcing boards to pursue the only available alternative — costly litigation — more frequently.
The change is not expected to affect HOAs financially, as fines are not a significant amount of their revenue stream, according to Community Associations Institute lawyer Louis Brown. 
“The days of homeowners associations telling you that your garage door needs to be painted might be over,” said Susolik, the attorney who has represented homeowners and HOA boards. “That’s probably a good thing.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/021925_ADU-VS-HOA_AH_CM_39.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

How Silicon Valley has fared under Trump",Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/silicon-valley-h1b-visas-trump/,"President Trump’s policies have affected Nvidia, AMD and the rest of the tech industry differently. Some experts are worried about the effects on innovation.","In summary
President Trump’s policies have affected Nvidia, AMD and the rest of the tech industry differently. Some experts are worried about the effects on innovation.


In exchange for its embrace of Trump 2.0, Silicon Valley has received a grab bag of policies that some experts worry could hurt the U.S. tech industry in the long run. 
On the one hand, corporate tax rates will stay low and the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors can count on less stringent regulations. On the other hand, tech companies are facing higher costs because of tariffs on many goods, the threat of 100% tariffs on semiconductors and new H-1B visa fees. 
The tech industry has also agreed to unprecedented or highly unusual deals with the government: President Donald Trump said the federal government will get a 15% cut of the sales revenue from Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales to China; and the United States has taken a 10% stake in Intel.
The potential effects of this mishmash of policies have experts concerned about the nation’s long-term ability to attract top talent and lead the AI race. And the worries go beyond the tech industry: As a provider of jobs, innovation and tax revenue, Silicon Valley plays a significant role in California’s economy. 
Now, “the valley has become more tense,” said Russell Hancock, the longtime president of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a think tank whose board includes leaders from the public and private sectors. 
Hancock said the Silicon Valley of old was “so amazing… ‘we (ate) gourmet food all day long at our workplace.’ ” Today, he said the valley is being “pummeled by inflation and wars and international instability.” Workers, many of whom have been ordered back to the office, are worried about AI making them obsolete, he said.
Then there’s the politics: the tech industry donations to the president’s inauguration, executives visiting Mar-a-Lago and tech CEOs accompanying Trump on his state visit to the United Kingdom. 
“There is a new set of tensions between workers and management, with workers not necessarily on board with this rightward shift,” Hancock said.
H-1B visas
The Trump administration recently unveiled $100,000 fees on H-1B visa applications. Tech companies, including many in California, are some of the nation’s biggest employers of workers on the visas.  The new fees are likely to hit smaller companies harder, because large companies that employ visa holders can afford to pay.

H-1B visas have long been controversial. Trump’s rationale for the new fees echoes complaints that companies use the visas to hire foreign workers to save money, taking jobs away from American-born workers.
“The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” the White House announcement said.
But some tech workers, like the Alphabet Workers Union, say immigrants are a “crucial” part of the industry, and are calling on Google parent Alphabet to protect them. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is among the famous tech CEOs who were once H-1B visa holders, along with Tesla’s Elon Musk, Zoom’s Eric Yuan and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.
“The gist of it is making sure workers are protected from these crazy and spontaneous changes that the Trump administration has been making,” said Olivia Asemota, a San Francisco-based software engineer who is vice president of the union. “We’re fighting for job security for all of us.”
Jeremy Liew is a retired venture capitalist who has invested in many startups, including Snapchat and Affirm, which went on to become big in social media and in financial technology, respectively. Born in Singapore, he was raised in Australia and eventually made his way to California.
“I’d like to think I was a positive in America from my time here,” said Liew, who lives in San Francisco. “I certainly know plenty of stories like mine,” he said, referring to people who helped start or fund companies.
Liew said he saw many immigrants working at startups, some of whom were likely H-1B visa holders — he never asked. He said he thinks the visa fees could have a negative impact on the U.S. tech talent pool.
‘Gangster move’
In April, the Trump administration banned American companies from selling AI chips to China, including modified chips that Nvidia had created in response to export controls under former President Joe Biden. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Trump a couple of months later, and in August, the Trump administration said it will be taking a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD’s sales of AI chips to China. 
“I said ‘If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something,’ ” the president said.
There are few details about the legalities and how the arrangement will work. The U.S. Commerce Department has yet to issue a regulation codifying the arrangement, according to an August financial filing by Nvidia with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The department did not respond to CalMatters’ questions about the deal. Nvidia spokesperson Christina Spellman said she would have no comment.
AMD did not respond to CalMatters’ questions. On an earnings call in early August, CEO Lisa Su said the company was “working very closely” with the Trump administration as it sought to get its export licenses approved to sell chips to China, which reportedly have since been approved. 
Many national security experts object to U.S. companies selling AI chips to China. 
Dan’l Lewin, a former Microsoft executive and former CEO of the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley, called Trump’s arrangement with Nvidia and AMD a “gangster move.”
“Long term I’m a reasonable optimist about good things coming out of Silicon Valley,” Lewin said. “But right now there’s a lack of oversight and rational industrial policy. Instead, we’re at a gangster’s thug-like whim.”
That echoes the sentiment of other tech industry experts, though some are choosing their words more carefully.
Tariffs and other concerns
Ahmad Thomas is CEO of Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a tech advocacy group whose members include some of the valley’s biggest tech companies. Trump’s threats of 100% tariffs on chip imports for companies that don’t promise to “build” in the United States has been of particular concern for the group. 
“Semiconductors are the backbone of the future of the AI economy,” Thomas said. “Unevenness with policies with such great economic value attached to them is challenging.”
Lance Hastings, CEO of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association, said “it would take years and years” to get to the president’s desired manufacturing-based economy, and would require a serious, long-term commitment to changing economic policies. 
He is optimistic California ports will continue to move goods, though he predicted the president will continue using tariffs as “a negotiating tool” and the uncertainty around tariffs — which many businesses are concerned about — will drag on. 
Gas, energy and food prices rose in August, along with other costs. Tariffs have had an uneven effect, with inflation further exacerbating inequality, the most recent economic indicators show.
Stephen Levy, economist and director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a private research organization, said some tech industry workers are feeling the effects of other Trump policies besides tariffs.
“It’s hard for the tech economy to survive if the workers who are lower- or middle-income are losing their health care and nutrition, maybe their (Affordable Care Act coverage),” Levy said, referring to federal funding cuts for different programs. 
Intel stake
The deal between Intel and the Trump administration, in which the federal government has taken a 10% stake in the company, is meeting mixed reviews. 
It happened after Trump called on Intel CEO Lip Bu-Tan to resign, citing his investments in Chinese companies. Then, after Tan met with Trump at the White House, the president said that the government would buy almost $9 billion worth of Intel stock.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, expressed support for the agreement, saying U.S. taxpayers deserve to get a return on their investment in companies. 
But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, has pressed U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for more details. 
As part of the deal, Trump threw out some of the requirements Intel was supposed to meet under the Biden-era CHIPS Act. The government had already invested more than $2 billion in grants to Intel as part of that law, tying such grants to expectations that the company would build manufacturing facilities, also known as fabs, in a handful of states. 
“The company no longer needs to invest in onshoring semiconductor production or build its previously planned fabs,” Warren wrote in a letter to Lutnick dated Sept. 3. “What is the American public getting from this deal? An extremely risky investment,” she added, pointing out that Intel’s stock fell 60% last year.
Intel’s financial filings about the deal say that the U.S. government’s stake in the company is passive, meaning that it will have no seat on the chipmaker’s board of directors. Warren also took issue with that. 
Warren asked Lutnick for a response by Sept. 17. Her office did not respond to an email from CalMatters about whether she got answers to her questions. The Commerce Department did not respond to CalMatters’ questions about the senator’s letter. Intel spokesperson Sophie Metzger said the company has no further comment.
What’s next for Silicon Valley
Other Silicon Valley observers say tech leaders seem to think they’re just doing what they have to do to deal with Trump and his scattershot policies.
For example, Apple iPhones are exempt from tariffs because CEO Tim Cook has cultivated a relationship with the president and promised a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing.
“I think their initial reaction is simply ‘How do we mollify and pacify this guy?’ ” said G. Pascal Zachary, a former professor, tech journalist and author. He said tech executives risk “repelling” employees who may be put off by Trump. Combine that with the new H-1B visa fees — which he said “sounds like a shakedown” — and limiting or canceling student visas, and it raises questions about the future of a workforce that has helped propel the U.S. tech industry to dominance.
“International talent is crucial,” Zachary said. 
Lewin, the former Microsoft executive, feels the same. He believes Canada and Europe will benefit from the U.S. driving talent away.
“We will lose (international) students’ financial contributions, their IQ and diversity in the room(s) that stimulates invention,” Lewin said.
Along those same lines, Stanford University professor Mark Lemley said he thinks Trump’s policies will drive tech companies to hire foreign workers outside the United States.
Lemley is also an intellectual property lawyer who in January declared that he fired Meta as a client because of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s support for Trump, and what he called “Facebook’s descent into toxic masculinity and neo-Nazi madness.” 
“The smartest people in the world all came here to go to school, they stayed, they started companies,” he said. “And the idea that we are doing everything in our power to discourage that, to tell people to go home because ICE might come after you … stay home, you can’t have a visa … that’s going to be corrosive.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040124-Semi-Conductor-Manufacturing-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

Bench Ansfield
Bench Ansfield is an assistant professor of history at Temple University and author of “Born in Flames: The Business of Arson and the Remaking of the American City.”


Today, most think of the California FAIR plan as a safeguard against wildfire risk. Few are aware that the state’s insurance provider of last resort was created as a band-aid response to a very different L.A. conflagration: the Watts uprising of 1965. 
Sixty years later, as climate change triggers a new crisis for insurance markets, firms and policymakers can draw an important lesson from the program’s first decades, when it not only allowed the wounds of injustice to fester, but ultimately stood in the way of transformative change. 
By continuing to lean on insurance-based solutions to deep-seated societal problems, California has put itself on a path toward repeating the mistakes of the past.
The proximate spark for the Watts rebellion, which began on Aug. 11, 1965, was the violent arrest of a Black motorist. But the kindling for the six days of unrest had been laid by decades of racist policing and discrimination in housing, employment and education. Despite the tangible victories of the civil rights movement — the Voting Rights Act had been signed just a week earlier — white supremacy remained regnant in South Central.
As Watts burned, insurance men beat the National Guard to the scene by a full day. Entering the still-smoldering Los Angeles neighborhood to gauge the insurable damages, these were capitalism’s first responders. 
After tallying the $40 million in losses, the industry sharply reduced the supply of insurance in Watts and other neighborhoods of color. In those areas, many property owners could no longer access insurance, and even when they did manage to find coverage, premiums were at least double — and often many times more — what they had been a short while before.
Two years later, amid unrelenting rebellion across American cities, President Lyndon B. Johnson convened the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission, to propose nationwide remedies for the unrest. An insurance-related offshoot of the Kerner Commission saw the Watts pool as an important prototype for what became the FAIR plan, a government-organized pool of all property insurers operating in a given state. Established on a state-by-state basis beginning in 1968, the FAIR plan was Washington’s answer to the deepening crisis of insurance redlining. 
By increasing access to property insurance in “riot-prone areas,” federal policymakers hoped the FAIR plan would help douse the flames engulfing American cities. Instead, the program merely protected the real estate and insurance industries from the risks posed by those systemic problems. As American cities entered the 1970s, the FAIR plan buffered landlords and insurers from the growing urban crisis, introducing perverse incentives that led landlords to burn down their own buildings for insurance payouts.
Blazes tore across Los Angeles’ rental stock as the city experienced a 500% increase in arson during the second half of the 1970s. But the epicenter of the arson wave was in the Bronx and elsewhere in New York City, where tens of thousands of apartment units — most insured by the New York FAIR plan — were torched by landlords or their hired lackeys. Insurers, for their part, were able to absorb the resulting losses through a number of arcane industry techniques, all legal, including simply passing along the losses to every policyholder in the state.
In the 2000s, as the costs of climate change became less and less possible to ignore, statewide FAIR plans began shifting their focus from the urban crisis to the climate crisis, increasingly issuing policies to wealthier homeowners at risk of fires or flooding. In Los Angeles, the plan’s “high-risk” policyholders are now just as likely to reside in Santa Monica as in South Central. 
But the industry’s favored mechanism for offloading these hazards is effectively the same as it was in the 1960s: hike prices on consumers and devise sophisticated financial instruments for transferring the losses elsewhere. Should the regulators at the California Department of Insurance stand in their way with muscular consumer protections, insurance companies can leave the state, or merely threaten to, until their underwriting autonomy is restored. 
What this means is that we have a property insurance program first designed for so-called “riot-prone areas” now standing as the only source of indemnity for the vast geographies of fire and flood that seem to grow vaster with every passing year.
With all eyes on California’s insurance market, the country stands at a crossroads. Because property insurance offers a potent tool for absorbing economic shocks, it remains the economic order’s first line of defense against unexpected ills. But in the absence of further-reaching transformation, property insurance can merely bandage over the root causes of the present crisis, making them harder to see.

California has laws that prohibit employers from firing workers over their political views but employers can restrict speech if it’s disruptive to the workplace.


At least 20 teachers in California’s K-12 schools are facing disciplinary action after they made derogatory comments about right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk in the wake of his assasination last month.
Most of the disciplinary investigations are based on comments that teachers made on social media during non-working hours, a possible violation of their right to free speech, said David Goldberg, president of the California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union.
“People are ready to pounce on educators. The goal is to sow fear,” Goldberg said. “It’s part of a larger attempt to bring the culture wars into schools and silence teachers.”
Kirk was fatally shot during a campus event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, in what officials described as a political assassination. Following his death, hundreds of people  who criticized Kirk’s ideology have been fired, disciplined or doxxed — had their private information posted online to stoke harassment. 
Other states have seen far more teachers fired or disciplined for Kirk-related comments. In California, state laws protecting free speech and strong union contracts have so far kept the numbers relatively low. Texas, for example, is investigating at least 280 teachers for criticizing Kirk.
‘Safe and respectful environment’
In California, one of the incidents happened in the Pacheco Union School District in Redding, where a teacher allegedly posted, “You reap what you sow, Mr. Kirk” on their personal social media account. The district has not named the teacher. Other news organizations have published his name but CalMatters was unable to independently confirm it.
Earlier, the teacher had also allegedly posted a video of Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene with the words, “Will someone please kill her?” The teacher was placed on paid leave and then the school board fired him.
“We are committed to ensuring that our classrooms and our entire school community remain a positive and secure place for all students to learn and grow,” Superintendent Jakob Fuller wrote on the school’s website. “The district does not condone violence in any form and is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all.”
Another incident occurred at the Dry Creek Unified School District, a TK-8 district in Roseville, near Sacramento. A middle school teacher apparently called Kirk “a piece of s—,” among other things, on their personal social media account, prompting a swift backlash from parents and others.
The district would not confirm the teacher’s identity, and while it has been reported by other news organizations, CalMatters was unable to independently confirm it. The teacher, who did not respond to emails from CalMatters, is on paid leave until the district completes an investigation.
“The post is both unprofessional and concerning,” the district said in a statement. “The personal comments allegedly made by the employee do not reflect the values, standards, or mission of the district. We are taking this matter seriously.”
Jonathan Zachreson, a conservative education activist in California, said he’d like to see accountability for the teacher and condemnation from the union. A board member for a different Roseville school district, Zachreson has been an outspoken advocate for K-12 policies notifying parents if students identify as LGBTQ, a policy Kirk also championed. Dry Creek board members could not comment on the case because the investigation is ongoing.
Zachreson said incidents such as these should be handled on an individual basis, depending on the nature of the comments and how private the posts were. But if the Dry Creek district’s investigation concludes that the teacher did write that comment, the teacher should be fired, he said.
“Many parents don’t want their kid in a classroom with someone like that,” Zachreson said. “Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom from consequences.”
A dangerous precedent?
California has laws that prohibit employers from firing workers over their political views. And the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, but there are some limits: Employers have a right to restrict workers’ speech if it’s disruptive to the workplace.
Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley Law School, said that teachers posting to their private social media accounts during non-work hours is not likely to disrupt their classroom work.
“There’s always the impulse to punish speech we don’t like. But the First Amendment protects all speech,” Chemerinsky said. “Once you open this door, it could set a very dangerous precedent. What about teachers who criticize Donald Trump?”
The California School Boards Association hasn’t provided school boards with specific guidance on handling Charlie Kirk comments because each district has its own contract with teachers, and personnel matters are considered a local issue.
But typically, a teacher who’s suspected of disrupting the workplace through inappropriate speech would be subject to a district investigation and, if found to be at fault, discipline from the school board. New employees who are still on probation have fewer protections, but any employee could face consequences ranging from a reprimand to termination. The teacher could protest the action by filing a grievance, and if that fails, they could appeal the decision. Some teachers in other states have filed lawsuits. Teachers at private schools typically have fewer protections. 
Regardless of the outcome, the process can be disruptive to staff and harmful to students, Goldberg said. Students could lose their teacher midway through a school year, and teachers “could have their lives turned upside down,” he said. Most teachers lack the resources and patience to take on a protracted legal fight that in the current political climate might not be successful, he said.
That’s why the union recently advised its members to be extra cautious when posting online.

What matters is how it brushes up against them.,"This is both an admission and an observation: The ramifications of homelessness, for most people, are anecdotal.
Statistics don’t do much to convince people of the seriousness of the problem or persuade them much that it’s getting better or worse. What matters is how it brushes up against them directly.
I was reminded of this last week, when I passed an encampment that is a part of my everyday life in Los Angeles, an unsightly and vaguely threatening bundle of tents and trash beneath the 101 freeway, not far from my son’s Silver Lake apartment. When Mayor Karen Bass took office in 2022 with a promise to make reducing homelessness her central mission, I told myself I’d believe it when that encampment came down.
Nearly three years later, it finally has. At least for now.
I was leaving the area last Wednesday morning, when I discovered the onramp to the freeway was closed, fenced off while crews poured through the little strip of land beneath the freeway and bagged up boxes, shopping carts and the flotsam that gathers in and around these sad communities. 
By the next day, the tents were gone. Mountains of trash were piled a hundred feet from where the encampment once encroached on the road along the underpass. A few of the former residents of the tents were picking through the debris, searching for lost items. 
But most had moved along. The neighborhood felt different. 
And that’s a bitter truth about street homelessness and what it does to communities. It’s not fair to demonize poverty, to blame people for their illnesses or addictions, but it’s hard to live near these encampments. 
A neighborhood with and without tent dwellers
Driving through the area often means snaking through addled men and women wandering into traffic. Some beg for change, sometimes aggressively. Others wander, muttering to themselves and teetering on the edge of eruption.
The neighbors complain of stolen mail and uncomfortable interactions. The streets are dirty and strewn with trash. Human feces dries in the hot sun.
This is not a high-crime neighborhood by most standards, but it’s made grimmer and grittier by the presence of this knot of tents and their inhabitants. That creates a kind of compassion fatigue. 
It can be easy to forget that these people are suffering and that their plight should trigger our sympathy — not our revulsion or fear. But that’s a difficult feeling to hold on to when your mail is stolen, the sidewalk is blocked or a wild-eyed man approaches you on the street, sputtering with incoherent rage.
With the encampment suddenly gone, life in the surrounding neighborhood felt lighter, easier. On Sunday, I dropped in at the Target a block or so from where the encampment had been. The security guard at the entrance noted that the store and neighborhood were “calmer this week.” The store, which locks up many items behind plexiglass barriers, had a smattering of customers shopping for groceries and home supplies.
On the next block, the local liquor and convenience store was quietly busy as well, and the clerk there was relieved at the relative serenity in the area.
The homeless people who congregated outside the store affected business, he said. The place relies on foot traffic. When sidewalks are impassable or clogged, customers shy away. This morning, a few patrons formed a line, picking up cold drinks and snacks. 
It’s risky to make political judgments based on personal experience, but homelessness encourages it. It matters far less to most people that the mayor can point to data showing progress when their daily lives are impacted.
So yes, Bass can rightly say that street homelessness has declined in back-to-back years, even as some cities have seen an increase. She is right to express pride in a 17.5% decline in the number of people living on Los Angeles streets. Those results, as she noted in July, are more than just data points. 
“They represent thousands of human beings who are now inside, and neighborhoods that are beginning to heal,” she said at the time. 
When homelessness feels worse than it is
She’s right, and it should hearten those who care about unhoused people and the impact homelessness has on the broader city. But until people feel those gains directly, until they sense that healing for themselves, it can be hard to internalize.
In that way, homelessness is different from some of the other pressing issues of our day. For instance, it can be hard to gauge the full scale of inflation or unemployment. It’s hard to know whether a person’s experience is typical, and so many voters rely on what their leaders say about data. 
That’s why it’s easy for President Trump to lie about the data, to announce glibly that gas prices have dropped below $2 a gallon (they have not) or to proclaim the United States has “no inflation” (it does). His supporters — even those facing high prices or lacking jobs — imagine they’re the exception, that the economy overall is doing well because the president says so.
Those are data-driven debates, subject to lies, as Trump well knows. 
Homelessness is an experience-driven debate, where voters are less likely to trust numbers and leaders. But it’s vulnerable to a different kind of misunderstanding: the distortions of our own experiences. 
Homelessness isn’t worse just because I have a bad run-in with an unhoused person, but it feels like it. And it isn’t better just because the encampment near my son’s apartment is gone for the moment. 
But I have to admit that it seemed better. 
And, what’s more, the measure of progress on this issue is not just personal, it’s also ephemeral, more a feeling of respite than of resolution. Even as my son’s Silver Lake neighborhood enjoyed the calm of last week, there was an air of resignation in the community, a near-certainty that the encampment, though dispersed for the moment, would eventually form again.
When I drove through there Tuesday, one tent had returned beneath the freeway. As the weather turns colder, more may follow. With that will come the bracing reminder that healing in this area is hard to assess and hard to hold on to.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092325_Los-Angeles-Homeless_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

In the Senate, passage occurred after several hours of debate and a failed amendment brought by Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) that would have cut $3 million to contract for health care services by the nonprofit Planned Parenthood, saying he objected to the state’s paying for abortion care. 
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), the chair of the Finance Committee, told lawmakers during debate that Planned Parenthood offered more services beyond abortion such as routine check-ups, vaccines and postpartum care and that it was a small portion of the total bill.
“The new administration has chosen not to fund these through Medicaid, so where are those people going to go?” Muñoz said during the debate.

Senate Ethics meets on Stewart issue
Just after the floor session, the Senate Ethics Committee — made up of four members from each party  — met to determine what to do with the subcommittee’s recommendation to drop any sanctions against Pro Tem Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) for calling a staffer “stupid” and shouting at her during the session in January from an ethics complaint. 
There was no discussion and a roll call vote concluded at a 4-4 tie along party lines, likely meaning no further action will be taken.

Smith started a program for military, veterans and first responders struggling with PTSD, depression and suicide.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)When Jason Smith was in the U.S. Marine Corps, a clinician waited for him and his fellow troops as they got back from missions to record their mental health.
“I remember getting back from Ramadi on my first tour, and when I got off the bus, we had a psychologist sitting there with a PHA, a post health assessment, asking us all kinds of crazy questions,” Smith said. “Do you think any of us got off that bus wanting to talk about that at that moment? No, because we’re getting ready to pull another six months, and nobody wanted to be pulled off deployment. So we just go on and on.”
Since he retired from the military after 20 years, Smith said, he has lost eight marines to suicide and more than a dozen to drug and alcohol overdoses. He started the S.A.F.E.R. Together program in Alabama for military, veterans and first responders struggling with their mental health and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

“So when you ask, what’s the number one enemy right now? It’s not Hezbollah, the Taliban or Al Qaeda, it’s stigma,” he said.
Smith’s program was one of many that the Interim Study Commission on PTSD in First Responders learned about at its meeting Tuesday morning. The commission is tasked with using existing funding to help first responders with PTSD. 
Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris, chair of the commission and a retired assistant police chief in Birmingham, said that it’s about priorities in the Legislature. 
“I know the money is going to be tight, but we seem to find money for a lot of other things,” Treadaway said. “I don’t know too many that would be more important than funding our public safety officers who need to be back to work.”
According to the Mayo Clinic, both the symptoms of PTSD and when they arise can vary from person to person. Typically, symptoms appear within the first three months of the traumatic event, but it could also take years and last for a year, or more. Symptoms are grouped into four categories, according to the Clinic: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.
According to a 2023 study, about 1% of all suicides in the United States between 2015 and 2017 were first responders. Most of them were law enforcement officers, followed by firefighters.
The commission sent a survey to first responders throughout the state, Treadaway said, which found that most are afraid to report symptoms of PTSD out of fear of losing their jobs 
“I’m not a doctor of any kind, but I’ve also seen or read that there’s a lot of different levels of PTSD,” Treadaway said. “Most of them do not prevent you from working.”
The commission is made up of representatives from the Alabama Fire College, the Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH), legislators, the Legislative Services Agency, the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA), the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) and the Alabama League of Municipalities. 
The consensus among the members was that the stigma around mental health and PTSD and lack of education on resources keep first responders from seeking treatment. 
“Part of the reasoning that I kind of read between the lines was because there is some stigma of if I get this diagnosis, then I may not be seen as fit for duty, and we’ve got to fix that,” Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville, said.
Rigsby, who was a volunteer firefighter in Monrovia, said a PTSD diagnosis should not deprive a first responder of their livelihood. Treadaway plans to introduce legislation in 2026 to help retrain first responders who lost their jobs or left them due to PTSD.
“It’s a way to get these folks that cannot be employed in public safety because of traumatic incidents that they’ve been involved in, and get them back in the workforce,” Treadaway said. 
Those first responders are not able to qualify for disability pay, Treadaway said, because the state only recognizes physical disabilities. 
“I just think that the state ought to have a way to put them back in the workforce,” Treadaway said. “So anything that has a certification in the state, junior colleges and training schools that we have, they’d be able to go.”
Treadaway is waiting on feedback from members of the commission before he prefiles the bill. It includes a $1 million fiscal note, which Sen. Lance Bell, R-Pell City, said might be hard to appropriate.
“I know we’ve been talking about the budget with our budget chairs, and the budget don’t look good for 27 looks even worse for 28,” Bell said. “That’s the concern I’ve got.”
The Senate General Fund budget chair, Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, said in August that it will be hard to fulfill all funding requests due to an increased responsibility in funding programs like SNAP after federal budget cuts.
The commission will meet again in a few weeks, Treadaway said, to discuss his legislation and funding options moving forward. He said his inclination is to fund PTSD resources and education for first responders through the ADMH.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0554-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar bill last year,"In political jargon, “heat” means pressure on politicians to do something they may be reluctant, for whatever reason, to do.
But heat itself — high temperatures, sometimes in triple digits, that afflict inland California each summer — is a political issue with life-and-death consequences.
Assembly Bill 1336, now awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature or veto, is the latest skirmish in a decades-long conflict over protecting workers from heat effects on their health, whether they work outdoors or inside.
The measure, if approved, would create a new legal presumption — that workers suffering from heat illness or injury would be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits if their employers failed to comply with standards set up to protect employees from heat effects.
Newsom’s signature on the bill is not a foregone conclusion. Last year, he vetoed an almost identical measure, Senate Bill 1299, saying, “There is no doubt that climate change is causing an increase in extreme temperatures and that California farmworkers need strong protections from the risk of heat-related illness. However, the creation of a heat-illness presumption in the workers’ compensation system is not an effective way to accomplish this goal.”
Twenty years ago, California saw a spate of heat-related deaths among farmworkers, leading former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s administration to adopt rules requiring employers to provide clean drinking water, adequate shade and paid breaks for outdoor workers during periods of high heat.
However the United Farmworkers Union has contended that staff shortages and lackadaisical management prevent the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health, better known as Cal/OSHA, from effectively enforcing those rules, leading to workers’ debilitating conditions and even death.
The union’s position was bolstered by a sharply worded report issued in July by state Auditor Grant Parks, laying out the agency’s shortcomings, particularly its shortage of adequate staff.
Backers of the two bills say not only are they seeking aid for heat-disabled workers, they also hope making employer-paid compensation more available spurs organizations to follow the state’s heat rules.
Meanwhile Cal/OSHA last year promulgated a new set of rules regarding heat in indoor workplaces, such as warehouses. They would require actions similar to those affecting outdoor workers when indoor temperatures hit 82 degrees.
As the issue of workplace heat simmers in California and other states, some federal agencies are pondering adopting heat-related protections for their employees. And a new study by the Massachusetts-based Workers Compensation Research Institute concluded that California’s pioneering regulations have had a dramatic effect on heat-related injuries and illnesses.
Previous research by the institute found that “excessive heat not only causes heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion but also impairs judgment and perception, increasing the risk of accidents, such as being struck by machinery. Heat-related illnesses are 11 to 18 times more frequent on days above 95°F, compared to days between 75 and 80°F, yet they represent 20 to 25 percent of all injuries attributable to heat.”
The study found California’s rules have reduced heat-related injuries by 15-17% in construction, 24-27% in agriculture and 19-25% in transportation. The strongest impact was when temperatures soared over 95 degrees, and the greatest effect was on young workers.
“These findings offer measurable evidence of how California’s policy reduced injury rates during extreme heat and offer relevant data to inform the national conversation about worker protection,” Ramona Tanabe, president of the research bureau, said in a statement with the report.
Still, agricultural and business groups have opposed both heat-related compensation bills. They say the workers’ compensation system isn’t equipped to make determinations about employers’ compliance with Cal/OSHA rules.
But if employers don’t like this approach to the issue, then they should be willing to do whatever is necessary to shore up Cal/OSHA. After all, protecting workers from high heat improves not only their lives but employers’ interests in maintaining productivity. It shouldn’t be a political football.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/041323-QUITO-VILLAGE-MHN-CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Local leaders warn the federal government shutdown could result in widespread ramifications for public programs and leave thousands of federal workers without a paycheck.
More than 22,000 federal employees work in Nevada, many of whom will be placed on furlough or be required to work without pay during the shutdown. 
It’s not clear when the shutdown, which began early Wednesday, will end. Negotiations could drag as Democratic lawmakers demand Republicans in Congress extend health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and reverse health care cuts made in President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill. 
In response, the Trump administration floated a plan to fire federal workers en masse and cancel grants to states during the shutdown.
Linda Ward Smith, Nevada State AFL-CIO vice president, said withholding pay from federal workers during a period of economic instability in Nevada could harm the state’s economy if it continues for long. 
The last major government shutdown happened during Trump’s first term. It was the longest government shutdown in history, clocking in at 35 days.
“The last shutdown, we know in Nevada, did affect a lot of working class people. We had people in food banks just utilizing resources because they didn’t have a paycheck,” Smith said. “We’re hoping that this doesn’t happen this time.”
Federal workers in Nevada deemed essential will be required to continue working without pay despite the shutdown. That includes public safety and emergency workers like air traffic controllers, federal food safety inspectors, law enforcement agents, and border patrol officers.
Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo said his office is closely monitoring the federal government shutdown and is working to assess its full impacts on the state.
The shutdown’s impact on Nevada’s state budget and state services will largely depend on how long it continues. If the shutdown extends more than 30 days funding for state programs will be heavily impacted, according to the governor’s office.
Mandatory programs are exempt from the annual government funding process, including Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. That means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.
However, the government shutdown does impact federal workers who help administer federal programs, which can limit Nevadan’s ability to apply for those programs or seek assistance.
The governor’s office said it’s likely Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans payments will face administrative disruptions in Nevada as a result of the government shutdown.
SNAP and WIC
Nevada’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) will also continue to receive funding through October, according to the Department of Agriculture’s contingency plans posted Tuesday afternoon.
Elisa Cafferata, executive director of Children’s Advocacy Alliance, said over 500,000 Nevadans benefited from SNAP and about 57,000 benefited from WIC in fiscal year 2024.
“The impact won’t be immediate, but if this goes more than a week, then that could impact the next distribution of benefits,” Cafferata said during a press conference Wednesday.
“The longer a shutdown persists, the more likely it is that serious issues will arise — especially due to the impact on the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicaid at the federal level,” she continued. 
Conine fears state could get stiffed by Trump after fronting funds during government shutdown 

The governor’s office noted that state general funds can support public programs in the short-term with minimal disruptions to services, which can be reimbursed by the federal government once the shutdown ends.
Other impacts on the general public
Depending on the length of the shutdown, federal unemployment benefits that augment state unemployment benefits could be affected, according to the governor’s office. Regular unemployment benefits distributed by the state, however, “will continue without interruption.”
Government grant reimbursements that fund various state projects are also expected to pause during the shutdown, according to the governor’s office. 
Nevada’s Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security warned partners Wednesday the shutdown could pause or delay the disbursement of federal funds and reimbursements to subgrant recipients.
The Clark County School District, which receives about 11% of its budget from the federal government, said they do not expect a major impact on programs or staff positions in the near-term.
However, if the shutdown continues for a longer period of time school district jobs funded by federal dollars could be at risk, said the school district. CCSD receives about $365 million in federal funding annually, which is fully or partially funding more than 1,700 positions in the current school year. 
National parks and recreation areas, including the Great Basin National Park and Lake Mead National Recreation Area, in Nevada will remain partially open during the shutdown, according to Interior Department contingency plans posted Tuesday afternoon.
Blame game
“While I appreciate the leadership of Republicans and some select Democrats in Washington to avoid a government shutdown, I’m disappointed in the continued gridlock that allowed this to happen,” Lombardo said in a statement. “As D.C. works through its issues, our administration will continue to support Nevadans in any way we can throughout this unnecessary federal government shutdown.”
Nevada State AFL-CIO Executive Secretary-Treasurer Susie Martinez called on Republicans to join a Democrat-backed bill that would extend health care subsidies, adding that thousands of workers could lose their health care coverage without it.
“This isn’t just a shutdown, it’s a meltdown,” said Martinez in a statement. “This is more than just a lapse in funding; it’s a collapse in leadership.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFSCM1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

(Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)When a judge this week disqualified Trump-appointee Sigal Chattah from prosecuting cases for the Nevada U.S. Attorney’s office, it produced something Chattah has obviously wished long and hard for: national headlines.
But while no one can deny Chattah has been an energetically performative public figure, one would be hard-pressed to describe her as a consequential one.
Still, her stint as interim then acting U.S. Attorney presents a useful case study in common Trumpian themes playing out in Nevada.
For starters, as the judge noted in his ruling on Chattah’s appointment Tuesday, Congress has enacted a law for filling U.S. attorney vacancies, and that law’s “purpose would be defeated if the Executive Branch – the very branch Congress was trying to constrain – could choose whomever it wanted, whenever it wanted.”
Few things scream MAGA 2025 more than the Trump administration trampling over laws passed by Congress to do whatever it wants whenever it wants.
Though five years later, the fixation on 2020 continues to hold a treasured place in MAGA hearts.
And if Chattah doesn’t share Trump’s obsession with his 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Nevada, she’s willing to pretend she does.
Not long before Tuesday’s court ruling effectively invalidated Trump’s appointment of Chattah, Reuters reported that Chattah had asked FBI director and fellow performative Nevadan Kash Patel, or the organization Patel putatively leads, anyway, to once again launch investigations into the 2020 presidential election in Nevada that Trump lost.
In case you forgot, Trump’s campaign and Republican party organizations filed lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit claiming exotic conspiracies and/or election fraud surrounding Nevada’s 2020 presidential election. The suits landed in courts with audible thuds, and were either rejected by judges or, in an uncharacteristically sensible moment, abandoned by the very Republicans who filed them. 
Additionally, an after-action analysis by Nevada’s Republican then-secretary of state found the claims of fraud trumpeted by Trump’s campaign and party officials to be baseless.
But that was in 2020, before the rule of law had been supplanted by the rule of Trump.
So now Trump is hoping minions like Chattah, Patel, and Attorney General Pam Bondi will deploy any means necessary to force the United States of America, up to and including the noxiously Trump-friendly U.S Supreme Court if necessary, to give Trump what he desires even more than the Nobel Peace Prize: official pieces of paper that say he won the 2020 election after all.
In an echo of one of Trump’s discredited claims about his 2020 election loss in Nevada, Chattah was/is also reportedly planning to cleanse Nevada’s voter rolls of “illegal aliens,” particularly in Nevada’s 4th congressional district. As a result, according to Chattah logic, Democratic U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford would have a much harder time winning reelection in 2026.
More than 332,000 people voted in CD4 last year. There were more fake presidential electors (six) in Nevada in 2020 than there are confirmed documented instances of noncitizens voting in the state.
But to the Trump faithful, math, like facts, are annoyances to be brushed aside. Chattah wants to root around in Nevada voter rolls for the same reason Trump ordered Bondi to badger Nevada to fork over every piece of information the state has on every voter: they want to identify voters they think it would be to Republicans’ benefit to disenfranchise, and then disenfranchise them.
That’s the point of “competitive authoritarianism,” the term some scholars use to describe an authoritarian regime that continues to allow elections, except the elections are procedurally and structurally rigged in advance so the regime always wins.
Disenfranchisement is only one of the many  ways the Trump regime hopes to instill competitive authoritarianism in the U.S. Unconstitutionally interfering with Nevada mail-in voting procedures, to which Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo has given his blessing, is another. So is gerrymandering Texas and other red states to eliminate Democratically held congressional districts.
According to documents cited in the Reuters story, Chattah is also dedicated to seeing all state charges dropped against Nevada’s aforementioned 2020 fake electors and having them proclaimed innocent. If history must be rewritten, and facts locked away, in order to declare Trump won Nevada in 2020 even though he lost it, the only possible number of Nevada fake electors there could have been is zero. And that’s some math authoritarians can get behind.
Chattah also reportedly told Department of Justice Department officials she is eager to sink her teeth into an investigation of a conspiracies involving Biden, state attorneys general, and nonprofits and unions that register people to vote because… deep state cabal, presumably.
So let’s see:

Serial and unlawful trampling over the legislative branch of the U.S. government
Replacing the rule of law with the rule of the ruler
Ongoing obsession with Trump’s 2020 loss
Exacting retribution on political opponents
Disenfranchising voters
Trying to erase facts while rewriting history
Racist fear-mongering
Unconstitutional interference in state election procedures
Spreading conspiracy theories to undermine the public’s faith in elections
Replacing democracy with competitive authoritarianism
And of course, appointees to important positions whose only qualification is unquestioning loyalty to Trump

Chattah has no achievements to speak of that she can call her own as Nevada’s almost U.S. Attorney. 
But by virtue of her participation in and/or tacit support for the activities listed above (and likely more) since her appointment to the role, there’s no denying she is a reliable upholder of MAGA myths and an eager practitioner of MAGA methods. 
Just like Patel, Bondi, and all the rest of them.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chattahgetty-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-10-02 09:57:47.091001

The commission Wednesday issued two opinions on state Ethics Act's ""Revolving Door"" provisions, saying former public officials and employees after leaving their public jobs can take positions with companies they dealt with in a public capacity, provided they do not lobby for them.  (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Ethics Commission Wednesday said former public officials and employees may accept employment after leaving government from businesses they or their employers dealt with as public officials, provided they do not lobby for them.
The three-member panel voted to approve two opinions from commission staff that permits Gary Fuller, the outgoing mayor of the city of Opelika, and Micah Williamson, a former rehabilitation specialist with the Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, to take positions with third-party firms without violating the “Revolving Door” provisions of the Alabama Ethics Act.
According to a guidance published by the Association of County Commissions of Alabama, the “Revolving Door” provision targets lobbying. It prohibits public officials or employees for two years after leaving office from representing a firm with business with a former agency or government body where they worked.

The provision also bars former public officials or employees from accepting a job with a business that they personally regulated, audited or investigated or from participating in efforts to solicit public business from their former employers.
Williamson asked for guidance from the commission after receiving an  offer to be the executive director for Darden Rehab, a nonprofit based in the state. The company receives fees for referral services it provides to the Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, his former employer, at rates set by the agency.
Williamson provided technical assistance to the company while he was employed at Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services. He also helped Darden implement a project but did not have any input regarding the services that the company provided.
Brian Paterson, assistant general counsel for the Alabama Ethics Commission, said that Williamson could accept employment as he had not “personally participated in the direct regulation, audit or investigation of Darden.” The commission said Williamson cannot represent the company before the Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services for two years after leaving the agency.
Fuller, who will end his time as mayor of Opelika at the end of the year, plans to work as a consultant for the city under contract for the Opelika Industrial Development Authority, a public corporation affiliated with the city, after he retires.
Fuller would advise the city regarding continuing economic development projects; consult with city officials for fostering economic growth; expanding and attracting new business, and securing funding for economic development projects.
Staff, when it issued its recommendation, referred to a previous advisory opinion in 2019 that stated that the “Revolving Door” provision of the Alabama Ethics Act “does not apply to agencies or governments that rehire former employees or contract with former employees or officials to provide personal or professional services on behalf of the agency,” Paterson said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250806_093132-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-02 08:57:20.232363

Gretchen Whitmer addresses the 2025 state budget impasse and the damage of federal tariffs on the state's economy at Heritage Hall in Lansing, Mich. Sept. 16, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceWhile Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has long demurred on the topic of her plans after 2028, when she will be term-limited out of the governor’s office, she offered another hint Wednesday suggesting a run for the Oval Office may not be in the cards. 
Heading into the 2024 election, Whitmer’s name was on many Democrats’ short list as a potential replacement nominee for former President Joe Biden or running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Whitmer served as a top adviser for both Biden and Harris’s campaigns, she has repeatedly maintained that her focus lies on finishing out her term.
During a conversation with Canadian journalist Steve Paikin following a Wednesday speech at the Empire Club of Canada, the question of Whitmer’s plans for 2028 once again came into the spotlight. 
While it’s a big compliment that people are looking to her as a potential presidential nominee, Whitmer once again emphasized her focus on serving as governor, telling Paikin “I got a big job right now to stay focused on, and I’m going to do that. I don’t want to take my eye off the ball and go out having missed something, having lost something, having a catastrophe happen under my watch.”
“I don’t know if I need to be the main character in the next chapter, but I want to have a hand in writing it, and I think I’ve got an important vantage point as the governor of an important swing state,” Whitmer said. “And so I anticipate helping, but I don’t know if I’m going to be the person.”
During her speech earlier in the day, Whitmer emphasized the strong relationship between Michigan and Canada, criticizing President Donald Trump’s tariffs, particularly the impact these taxes on imports will have on the automotive industry in North America
While Whitmer noted she doesn’t have the authority to control the national tariff rate, she has voiced those concerns with the White House. 
“I’ve sat with the President and told him that when we say ‘no’ to Canada, we say ‘yes’ to China and we can’t let that happen,” Whitmer said. “A decline in trade between [the] U.S., Mexico, and Canada would cause massive job losses, widespread supply chain disruptions, and shortages of fuel, parts and produce. China would love nothing more than to watch us cripple our own economies. We cannot afford to serve them the North American auto ecosystem on a silver platter.

(Washington State Department of Agriculture)Washington’s agriculture department is seeking more than $13 million to deal with a pair of invasive insects that can destroy and damage a variety of plants, crops and trees.
The Department of Agriculture submitted a 2026 supplemental budget request to the governor’s office earlier this month, asking for $12.3 million to backfill state funding for its Japanese beetle eradication plan. 
The plan was partially funded in the current two-year budget, but this funding only allows the department to treat 500 of 11,800 acres infested with the beetle. 
Japanese beetles were first detected in Grandview, Washington, in 2020. The beetle now infests much of south central Washington and the SeaTac area, with a total of 51,065 beetles trapped statewide so far this year. 
The beetles can eat more than 300 species, chewing large, irregular holes in leaves, while larvae eat roots in the soil. 
Successful eradication of the insect is “critical” for Washington’s agricultural industry, the Department of Agriculture says. 
“Without adequate funding, we may lose the fight against this extremely destructive pest,” the Department of Agriculture states in its budget recommendation summary. 
Funding from the supplemental budget would allow the department to continue a special yard waste disposal program for areas the beetle has moved into and to treat all 11,800 infested acres with insecticide in the spring of 2026. 
The department is also asking for $928,000 for spongy moth eradication. This would provide a cushion in case federal funding is cut, the agency said.
The spongy moth, formerly known as the gypsy moth, is widely considered to be one of the most destructive forest pests in the United States. The moth’s caterpillars can eat the leaves of over 300 species of trees and shrubs, including evergreens, causing defoliation and tree death. 
The department anticipates that spongy moth eradication efforts could be needed in Lakewood and Kent next spring, but they won’t know for sure until surveys are completed in October. 
There have been “unprecedented interceptions” of live spongy moths on cargo ships in Washington’s ports this year stemming from a possible outbreak in Japan, according to Sven-Erik Spichiger, an entomologist with the Department of Agriculture. 
Port officials notified Department of Agriculture staff and were able to redirect the ships to prevent the insect from spreading. 
“But what I can tell you is it’s kind of scary, because we’ve never had these types of interceptions,” Spichiger added during an update to the Washington State Invasive Species Council last month. 
The Department of Agriculture’s invasive moth program has successfully prevented the spongy moth from gaining a foothold in Washington for the last 50 years, but the program depends on federal funds for half of its costs. 
Several states, including Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Carolina, have already had their spongy moth eradication efforts interrupted by a loss of federal support, and Washington won’t know if its program has federal funding until December 2025 at the earliest. 
The supplemental budget request would allow for eradication efforts in Lakewood and Kent next spring, even if the program loses federal funding. 
Other state departments that work to combat invasive species did not request funding from the 2026 supplemental budget to continue their work. 
This year, the Legislature provided $12 million in the 2025-27 budget towards managing the European green crab, consistent with the funding the initiative received in the last biennium. 
The invasive crabs were first found in the late 1980s on the West Coast and began to surge in Washington’s waters about six years ago. They pose a threat to native wildlife, the shellfish industry and shoreline habitats.
A 2022 order from then-Gov. Jay Inslee, declaring the growing green crab population an emergency and urging the Legislature to provide emergency funds to manage the infestation, is still in effect. 
Over 1.1 million green crabs were removed from Washington’s marine waters between July 1, 2024 and June 30, 2025, according to a Department of Fish and Wildlife report released last month. 
The Washington Invasive Species Council voted in July to recommend that the Department of Fish and Wildlife classify the golden mussel — a freshwater species known for its fast reproduction and ability to clog water infrastructure — as a high-priority invasive species. 
But that process is ongoing and a management plan is still in the works, according to Justin Bush, aquatic invasive species policy coordinator for the Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
“We’re trying to work as fast as we can through that with that imminent threat,” Bush said, adding that the department has criteria for determining when the situation requires an emergency proclamation like the green crab’s. 
The golden mussel has not yet established itself in Washington state, though it has been intercepted on some ships from California. 
The golden mussel was first detected in California last year, marking the species’ debut in North America. Since then, the golden mussel has spread through much of the state.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/japanese-bettle-1024x601.jpg,,,2025-10-02 07:57:35.082667

(Photo from official X account)An Oldenburg nunnery tour. The 2025 presidential inauguration. A high school debate competition. Annual industry conferences.
State officials logged roughly $97,000 in state expenses for trips across Indiana and the nation, according to new reports filed Wednesday.
That count includes Gov. Mike Braun, his cabinet secretaries and all statewide officeholders during the 2025 fiscal year, which ran from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. Of the 19 reports reviewed by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, many officials had only been in office for part of the fiscal year.
A new state law mandates reporting every Oct. 1 on travel expenses for trips “taken in an official capacity,” including whether state funding was used to cover costs.
The legislature passed the bill on the heels of controversy, when Secretary of State Diego Morales left the country for an international trip without disclosing who paid for his travel. He attended the National Association of Software and Service Companies Global Conference.
Following pushback, Morales said he reimbursed expenses for the trip to India using personal funds. He reported another trip to Vancouver in September for a securities conference but said no state funds were used.
Morales’ report didn’t include a May trip to Hungary, which he repeatedly emphasized was a personal visit in various social media posts. He also said the trip was paid for by a conservative group.
He documented another 19 trips out of state, including an association conference for secretaries of state in Puerto Rico. Nine of those trips were to Chicago, mostly to meet with foreign dignitaries. The San Juan trip cost $4,241 and was the most expensive claim, coming out of his office’s general fund.  
Of the nearly $33,000 Morales reported spending, roughly a third was devoted to monthly fuel costs. The widely traveled state official previously boasted about his in-state travel, saying he completed the 92-county circuit faster than other statewide officeholders upon taking office. 
Some officials provided very specific details on their travel, such as the groups they spoke to or met with. But Attorney General Todd Rokita listed only “official business” for his 100 events. Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith generally categorized his trips as “attend event” or “meeting,” and included an annual horse racing banquet.
Cabinet secretaries also varied on what they shared in the reports. For example, one cabinet secretary included a “Secretaries Retreat” on June 24 at the Indiana State Museum, but not every one of her counterparts did the same. Some included total spending, while others didn’t. 
 Other statewide officials

State Comptroller Elise Nieshalla spent the second-most on travel — almost $12,000 on 71 trips. Most of them were to meet with county auditors all around Indiana. She also toured a local homeless shelter, served as a panelist or speaker at various events and visited former Gov. Eric Holcomb.

Her most expensive single trip cost about $1,500 to attend the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers annual conference in North Carolina. She also went to Ohio, Orlando, Anchorage, Washington, D.C. and Denver.
State Treasurer Dan Elliott racked up $9,300 on more than 50 trips. His report was not specific, often citing a “public event,” “conference” or “meeting.”
His largest trip cost $1,470 — to attend “official events” in Washington, D.C. for Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Elliott also went to New York City, Orlando and Scottsdale. 
Braun reported more than 144 trips for just over $7,800. Over half of that spending was at Trine University, a private school in Angola, where he was invited to give the May commencement address. 
Flying back from Angola to his private home in Jasper in an Indiana State Police helicopter cost $4,200, which came from ISP’s Aviation Rotary Fund. For the commencement, he claimed another $19, which came from ISP’s Motor & Carrier Fund. Braun always travels with a security detail provided by the Indiana State Police. 











Most reports calculated fuel reimbursements monthly, but Braun logged it by trip — potentially inflating the number of reported trips. Many of those line items were under a dollar. 























The state’s chief executive also claimed two ice cream expenses, at Glover’s in Frankfort and Zaharako’s in Columbus, for $23 and $33, respectively











He reported visiting Washington, D.C., four times — for the inauguration and meetings with federal officials — but no other out-of-state travel.
Braun, a former U.S. senator, also has access to campaign accounts.
Beckwith submitted $4,300, all for fuel expenses related to attending more than 100 events around Indiana. 
He listed five out-of-state trips: an “Army event” in Kentucky and speaking events in Virginia, Georgia, Ohio and Michigan. But none of those events included specific costs. 
Rokita totaled $4,650 in expenses for 100 trips with his biggest cost being $2,237 for a Washington, D.C. visit in September 2025. He had nine out-of-state trips, including seven to the nation’s capital and others to Las Vegas and Yuma, Arizona.
 Cabinet Secretaries

All eight cabinet secretaries submitted reports alongside the superintendent of Indiana State Police and adjutant general of the Indiana National Guard. The latter two categories include former appointees alongside current officials.

One secretary — Mike Speedy, who oversees business affairs — didn’t include any costs in his report, though his 29 total trips included the presidential inauguration and a nunnery tour with a local state lawmaker. 
Management and Budget Secretary Lisa Hershman and Braun’s chief of staff Josh Kelley reported no official travel during the period. Secretary Gloria Sachdev claimed just $73 in travel expenses related to a Washington, D.C. hotel stay for a meeting of health and human services secretaries.
The most widely traveled cabinet member was Secretary of Education Katie Jenner, with 71 trips, followed by former Secretary of Public Safety Jennifer-Ruth Green, with 65 trips reported. Jenner’s report covers a year of travel while Green started in late January. 
Jenner extensively logged her statewide travel, including several Indianapolis-area speaking engagements alongside dozens of school site visits across the state. Of the $7,198 she reported in total travel expenses, $1,872 of it was devoted to monthly fuel card transactions. Her two most expensive trips — to Austin, Texas, and San Diego, California, — cost $1,377 and $1,457, respectively, where she spoke in an official capacity at national conferences.
Green reported spending $3,237, though nearly all of that was spent on gas with the exception of two Washington, D.C. trips. The March trip says only “Washington, D.C. Meetings” for $842 while the April trip is for “GHSAC,” or the Governors Homeland Security Advisors Council, and cost $1,577.
Another notable trip was Secretary of Commerce David Adams Montreal visit for $1,288, which he categorized as a “Business attraction meeting for Bombardier based in Montreal.” Bombardier is a Canadian aerospace manufacturer. Those funds came from the Indiana Economic Development Foundation’s purse, not state funds. Private businesses donate to the opaque account, which Braun has vowed to close.

Rhode Island residents and businesses in the seven municipalities with independent electricity programs will pay slightly less than Rhode Island Energy customers this winter.
The 14.69 cents per kilowatt-hour “standard” usage rate for participating municipal customers, announced by the city of Providence Wednesday, is 0.5% less than the 14.77 cents base usage rate that took effect for Rhode Island Energy customers Oct. 1. For the average residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt hours of electricity per month, this translates to a $2.50 savings. 
About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.
That includes those who participate in community choice aggregation plans, which have been available in Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown since May 2023. By leveraging bulk buying power through a third-party supplier, NextEra Energy Services, the municipal plans aim to reduce electricity prices while boosting energy from renewable sources — 5% more than mandated under state law in the “standard” plan.
Higher-priced community electricity plans are also available for residents who choose to purchase power with an even greater supply from renewable energy sources, up to 100%, with a corresponding 17.65 cents per kilowatt-hour price for this winter.
The community aggregation seasonal rates start Nov. 1, and last through May 1.
Additional relief may be on the way for all residents, regardless of where they buy electricity, under a series of bill credits proposed by Rhode Island Energy executives and Gov. Dan McKee. The discounts, which would shave an estimated $20 to $30 off monthly electric bills and $30 to $40 off gas bills for the first three months of 2026 and 2027, are meant to offset tax costs tied to the 2022 sale of the state electric and gas business. The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission is still reviewing the proposal ahead of a Jan. 1 start date.
Customers already enrolled in community aggregation plans already do not have to take action to continue service through the winter. Enrollment information is available through each participating municipality.

DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a statement to Mississippi Today that building long-term infrastructure in the South is a top priority for him, which is why the committee is investing in Mississippi during an off-year election cycle. 
“With this major investment, the DNC is turbocharging Mississippi Democrats’ organizing efforts to win crucial legislative races this November and continue us on the road to a blue Mississippi,” Martin said. 
The committee did not say exactly how much it was spending on the Mississippi races.
Republicans have supermajority control of both chambers of the 174-member Mississippi Legislature.
The DNC’s investment will go directly to the Mississippi Democratic Party, according to a news release. The state party is expected to use the funds to support on-the-ground organizing efforts, boost paid advertising and build infrastructure. 
Mississippi is conducting special elections this year because a federal three-judge panel recently ruled that the Legislature diluted Black voting strength when it redrew legislative districts in 2022.
Of the 14 seats lawmakers redrew, seven have a contested general election where a Democratic nominee is competing against a Republican nominee.

Senate President Nicholas Scutari wants new e-bike regulations after a number of fatal crashes involving them. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)Tighter regulations for e-bikes could be coming to New Jersey after a series of fatal crashes across the state.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said he’s worried that amid the skyrocketing popularity of e-bikes and e-scooters that go at speeds exceeding 35 miles per hour, more crashes will occur.

“We’re in a new era of e-bike usage … They’re more affordable, they’re faster, they’re more powerful than we’ve ever seen before, and the risks have increased to those on the roadways and more particularly, those that are using them,” he said at a press conference on the steps of Scotch Plains Town Hall Wednesday. 
A 13-year-old boy died Sept. 24 after his e-bike was hit by a landscaping truck in Scotch Plains, and a 22-year-old died on Sept. 22 when police say he was crossing opposing traffic on his e-bike and was hit by a van in Orange. 
Two girls on an e-bike were killed in Cranford Monday, according to prosecutors, who have charged the Garwood teen driver accused in the motor vehicle crash with two counts of first-degree murder.
Nationally, e-bike injuries rose by 293% from 2019 to 2022, according to Columbia University researchers.
Scutari said he’s not looking to ban e-bikes. He said he recognizes they’re an environmentally friendly way to travel, and said he wants to get groups like insurance companies on board with his plan for more regulation.
He’s planning to introduce legislation in October that would reclassify e-bikes depending on how fast they go and require the state Motor Vehicle Commission to create an electric bicycle registration and sticker system. Under the legislation, riders would be mandated to obtain insurance and minors under the age of 17 would be prohibited from operating e-bikes that exceed 18 miles per hour, unless they’re licensed as mopeds. 
A draft of the legislation was not available. The Legislature has been on a recess since June 30 and is not expected to return to Trenton until after November’s election, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot.
Some towns like Westfield have already taken action to limit where electric bikes can be ridden. Union County Commissioner Kimberly Palmieri-Mouded said the county plans to ban e-bikes at all county parks.
“As a mother of five, the recent e-bike tragedies — especially the heartbreaking loss of a 13-year-old in Scotch Plains — strike very close to home,” Palmieri-Mouded said in a statement.
Scutari also wants riders and drivers to get education on e-bike safety. Scutari said he sees people riding e-bikes without helmets, running stop signs, and driving in the wrong direction on roadways. 
The Senate president warned that parents should be cognizant of how fast and far these bikes can go before purchasing them as if they’re pedal bikes. 
“They go so fast, but they go so far that your child could end up two counties away in New Jersey. You’ve got a 20, 40-mile radius on some of these things. He could be in Manhattan, he could be down the shore, and (parents) don’t know where they’re at,” he said.

Being as specific as possible keeps us accountable to one another and makes government work through real dialogue, decisions and action.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Laura Sibilia: When we disagree with others, who is ‘they’?.","This commentary is by Laura Sibilia, of Dover. She is an independent representing the Windham-2 District in the Vermont House of Representatives.


Political violence is not protest, debate or disagreement. It strikes at the heart of democracy — and the responsibility we all share to govern ourselves. 
The recent assassinations of Charlie Kirk and Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, show how quickly violence is replacing dialogue in our national life. Vermonters cannot afford to think it will not touch us.
Too often, when people talk about those they disagree with, I hear “they” or “them.” Used this way, these words are vague and dehumanizing. They create distance and make it easier to dismiss or demonize. 
The same happens with phrases like “those people,” “the left,” “the right,” “the politicians,” “the media” or “the elites.” All of these labels lump people together and let us avoid dealing with what individuals are actually saying or doing. Being as specific as possible keeps us accountable to one another and makes government work through real dialogue, decisions and action.
There is an old teaching from the Stoic philosopher Epictetus: “It is impossible for a person to learn what they think they already know.” 
The lesson is simple. Once we decide we already know everything about “them,” we stop listening. Once we stop listening, we stop learning. In Vermont, that matters at every level, whether it is sitting across from a neighbor at town meeting, serving on a selectboard or working side by side after a flood. 
Real progress starts when we stay open to learning from one another. If we stop listening, we stop learning, and if we stop learning, we stop participating — and democracy cannot survive if we citizens do not participate.
So here is the question I am trying to keep front and center, and I invite you to do the same: What does respect look like to you? How do you show it to someone you disagree with? The answers matter. Because respect is the foundation of dialogue, and dialogue is the foundation of democracy.
That commitment to respect is not abstract. It shows up in the way we govern and in whether people feel safe enough to step forward and serve. At the Vermont Statehouse, we now have more security, and this summer legislators received safety guidance from our sergeant-at-arms. 
That is not normal, but it is where we are. What worries me most is that fewer people might step forward. The government is not someone else’s job — it is everyone’s job. Vermont works best when citizens feel safe enough to serve.
The need for participation goes far beyond the Statehouse. Our communities are already under real stress: flooding, housing, health care, workforce shortages. This is when showing up matters most. Neighbors serving on selectboards, volunteering on fire departments or running for the Legislature all strengthen our state’s ability to meet these challenges together.
It is easy to get discouraged by national headlines. But Vermont’s strength has always come from citizens willing to take responsibility locally, even when they disagree. Town meetings, a planning commission or helping after a flood — these are not small things. This is the work of democracy. Every act of participation reminds us that the government is all of us, and it only functions when we each do our part.
National politics has grown more unstable, with threats, lies and violence replacing dialogue. We are already seeing some of that emerge here in Vermont, with outside groups like Americans for Prosperity working to inflame division. 
We need to be careful not to follow that path. We are losing balance, and we need to find it again. The Legislature, the Scott administration and Vermonters in every community share responsibility for lowering the temperature and keeping space for disagreement.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin paused abortion services Wednesday at its Madison, Milwaukee and Sheboygan locations due to the megabill signed by President Donald Trump in July. The law — officially titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act — included a provision that would take away federal funding from the organization if it continues providing abortion services. 
The organization announced the pause last week, saying that it was looking to see as many patients as possible before the Oct. 1 deadline. Wisconsin is the first state in the country where Planned Parenthood has taken this step in response to the federal law. 
In reaction, Democratic lawmakers called Wednesday morning for the state to reverse other restrictions on the books to help increase accessibility to the remaining independent abortion providers in the state.
“We’re sounding the alarm, but we’re also saying we can do something about this,” Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said at a press conference. “We know that this is going to be a legal battle, and there will be other means by which Planned Parenthoods are fighting this change, but in the meantime, we cannot let Republicans block access for Wisconsin women to the care that they need.” 
This is the second time that Planned Parenthood is halting abortion services in Wisconsin since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, ending federally protected abortion rights. The group stopped providing abortions from June 2022 until September 2023, when a Dane County court held that a 19th century state statute did not ban abortions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court also ruled in July that the same 19th century law was invalid and unenforceable and had effectively been repealed by other laws passed after it. 
Planned Parenthood’s decision to pause services again leaves just two independent clinics that provide abortion care in Milwaukee. Abortion providers in neighboring Illinois have declared that they are prepared to provide services for Wisconsin women.
“We know that people in Wisconsin can go to other states that do not have these restrictions to access abortion care, but we think that that’s unacceptable, and that no matter who you are or where you’re from you deserve the freedom to get the health care that you need here in Wisconsin,” Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said at the press conference.
The public health department for Madison and Dane County offered to help patients in need of services navigate their limited options. 
“Losing Planned Parenthood clinics as an option for abortion care means the full spectrum of reproductive health care will become very difficult to access in Wisconsin,” said Public Health Supervisor Sarah Hughes. “We know this changing landscape can be confusing and overwhelming, that’s why our Nurse Navigators are standing by to help people understand all options around pregnancy and reproductive health care.”
Planned Parenthood has been able to use federal funds via Medicaid payments and Title X, a federally funded family planning program, to help provide services other than abortion care, including contraceptives, STI testing, pregnancy testing, and gynecological services to low-income and uninsured individuals. The Hyde Amendment has barred federal money from being used to fund abortion care across the country for decades. 
The new federal law puts the other services that Planned Parenthood offers at risk by barring Medicaid payments for one year for organizations that received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in fiscal year 2023 and primarily engage in family planning services and reproductive health and provide abortions.
“This was targeted directly at Planned Parenthood,” Subeck said. 
“Let me be clear, Republicans in the federal and state governments will stop at nothing short of a full abortion ban,” she added.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its member organizations in Massachusetts and Utah filed a legal challenge in July, but an injunction that was blocking the law from taking effect was lifted in September.
Attorney General Josh Kaul has also joined with other state attorneys general on a legal motion that argues the provision “impermissibly and unconstitutionally targets Planned Parenthood health centers for their advocacy and their exercise of associational rights” and also that “Congress ran afoul of limits on its spending power” because of its ambiguity. It argues the provision “fails to adequately define the scope of providers who qualify as “prohibited entities”; fails to provide clear notice of the timing of its implementation; and constitutes a change that [states] could not have anticipated when joining Medicaid.” 
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has said that ongoing litigation could change what the organization is allowed to do and that it  will continue to monitor the legal landscape and will be prepared to act the moment it is able to resume care.
Roys and Subeck introduced legislation Wednesday to help the last two clinics in Milwaukee take in patients. 
The Democratic bill would repeal several of the other restrictions on the books in Wisconsin, including a requirement that patients attend two appointments with the same physician 24 hours apart before receiving care, requirements that a patient have a physical exam and that a physician be physically present when medication is taken, and a requirement for an ultrasound. It would expand the number of providers allowed to provide abortion care from just physicians to physician assistants, nurse practitioners and advanced practice registered nurses. 
The lawmakers said the bill would help the two independent Milwaukee clinics — Care for All Community Clinic and Affiliated Medical Services — reach as many patients as possible while Planned Parenthood no longer offers services by removing barriers to providing access. 
“We don’t have a direct way to overrule what the Republican regime has done in the big, ugly bill,” Roys said. “We certainly can do everything we can in Wisconsin to make sure that the existing two independent clinics that provide abortion services are able to see as many patients as they possibly can and try to absorb some of the loss of service [provided by] Planned Parenthood, and open the door to make sure that patients in Wisconsin don’t suffer access restrictions that patients in other states don’t have to suffer.” 
Roys said the purpose of the restrictions “has always been to make abortion as onerous and as difficult for people to access as possible. It has nothing to reduce the need for abortion.” By lifting the restrictions, she said, the bill could help “increase abortion access, despite the federal backdoor abortion ban.”
However, in a Republican-led Legislature, the bill is unlikely to move ahead.
Conservative groups and some Republican lawmakers celebrated the news of the pause in abortion services last week. Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) called the pause in services at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin a “hopeful moment” in a statement last week.
“Every heartbeat silenced by abortion was a life full of possibility,” Goeben said. “This pause means more of those lives may now have a chance.”
Goeben and 11 of her Republican colleagues recently introduced a bill that seeks to narrow the definition of  abortion in Wisconsin. According to a bill summary, it would amend the definition of abortion to make an exception for “physician’s performance of a medical procedure or treatment designed or intended to prevent the death of a pregnant woman and not designed or intended to kill the unborn child, including an early induction or cesarean section performed due to a medical emergency or the removal of a dead embryo or dead fetus, or an ectopic, anembryonic, or molar pregnancy, which results in injury to or death of the woman’s unborn child when the physician makes reasonable medical efforts under the circumstances to preserve both the life of the woman and the life of her unborn child according to reasonable medical judgment and appropriate interventions for the gestational age of the child.” 
“Democrats should be lining up to sign on to this bill,” Goeben said in a statement about the bill. “This is what liberals have been shouting about from the rooftops for decades. However, they continue to perpetuate the notion women are not going to get the care they need in a heart wrenching emergency situation.”
Physicians, Democratic lawmakers and others have spoken to concerns since the overturn of Roe v. Wade that restrictive state laws governing abortion would result in women not receiving adequate medical care, even when there is an emergency. ProPublica has reported on the preventable deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, both of whom were denied timely care due to confusion created by Georgia’s six-week abortion ban. It has also reported on two women in Texas, Josseli Barnica and Nevaeh Crain, who died under the state’s restrictive abortion ban after care was delayed for their miscarriages.
Roys said the bill is an example of Republicans trying to distance themselves from the impact of restrictive abortion policies. 
“Republicans know that their abortion bans hurt women, and they kill women, and Americans are horrified to see women being arrested and jailed instead of taken to the hospital for treatment when they have a miscarriage. They are horrified to see pregnant people turned away from emergency rooms so that they can bleed out and almost die in Walmart parking lots… and now Republicans are desperately searching for a way to distance themselves from the terrible effects of the laws that they passed. And [to] simply say if you need to end your pregnancy, we’re going to call it something different than abortion is nonsense.” 
Roys said the bill is “pernicious” because it would essentially tell providers to provide a C-section or induce labor rather than provide an abortion. Those procedures, she said, are “much more difficult, painful, and risky and invasive than doing an abortion.” 
“It affects a woman’s future ability to birth and be pregnant the way that she wants to be, and it is incredibly cruel,” Roys said.

UW Health started offering the new edition vaccine to patients Wednesday and will start scheduling COVID-19 shots beginning Monday.
Dr. James Conway, UW Health
The Madison-based hospital and clinic system previously began giving the vaccine to people older than 65, considered the highest-risk population for the respiratory infection, according to Dr. Jim Conway, an infectious disease specialist and medical director for the UW Health immunization program.
The 2025-26 version of the vaccine is “built around the most current, circulating strains of COVID that are out there,” Conway said in an interview Wednesday. “As we all learned during the entire pandemic, these strains are mutating constantly, and so they’re constantly changing . . . You try to keep up with what’s the most prevalent.”
Major pharmacy chains typically get the first available allotments of the vaccine and have already, Conway said. In the meantime, UW Health and other health systems have been preparing to offer the shot and preparing their scheduling systems.
The vaccine’s components are developed following discussions among health experts for the World Health Organization and other agencies, Conway said. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) take part in those discussions.
In the weeks leading up to Sept. 19, when the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) opened its most recent meeting, public health professionals were apprehensive that the body might limit access to the COVID-19 vaccine.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has a long history of embracing unfounded claims critical of vaccines. Kennedy replaced the members of the ACIP with people viewed as skeptics of vaccination. Susan Monarez, appointed CDC director earlier this year by President Donald Trump, testified at a congressional hearing in September that Kennedy fired her for refusing to agree to his demand that she endorse ACIP’s recommendations without reviewing them.
Ahead of ACIP’s meeting, “we were all really nervous,” Conway said. Medical professional groups emphasized their endorsement of the COVID-19 shot to counter messaging from Kennedy and other HHS officials that appeared to cast doubt on the vaccine.
“Our professional societies make recommendations every year, but this year we really leaned into making sure people were aware of those and really were promoting those as … evidence-based, data driven,” he said.
When ACIP met just two days after Monarez’s testimony, the panel left in place the CDC’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations from the age of six months to 64. While the panel’s recommendation highlighted concerns about risk, ACIP rejected a proposal to require a prescription for the shot.
“It’s actually in some ways reassuring that even people that may come across as skeptics and doubters at some level as they were repopulating the ACIP — even they couldn’t be swayed from how clear the evidence and the data is that these vaccines are really valuable and really safe,” Conway said. “It was a very pleasant surprise.”
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued an executive order to ensure COVID-19 vaccine access and the state Department of Health Services followed up with a health order that functions as a statewide prescription for the shot. The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance also issued guidance that insurance companies in Wisconsin are expected to cover the vaccine without requiring a patient co-pay.
Conway said with those actions insurers began announcing in the last week their coverage plans, which set the stage for providers to set up their vaccine programs.
The first objective of a vaccine is “to prevent you from getting serious disease,” Conway said, so patients don’t have to go to a doctor, “or aren’t getting admitted to the hospital or aren’t getting in the ICU [intensive care unit] or aren’t going on a ventilator or, God forbid, aren’t dying. That’s the ultimate goal, and that’s what the vaccines are really very good at.”
If the shot prevents a person from getting sick from the virus at all, that’s a bonus,  “but we know that that’s never completely possible with these kinds of respiratory viruses,” he added. “But we know that even if you get ill, you’re much more likely to have a very, very mild case.”
Vaccination also helps prevent the spread of disease as it reduces the amount of virus infected people are shedding, Conway said. That can reduce the chances that others will be exposed to the virus, helping to protect people whose immune systems are suppressed due to age or an underlying medical condition.
With enough people vaccinated, that allows  community immunity — “what used to be called herd immunity” — to develop, Conway said. That reduces the risk of outbreaks, “but it also starts to protect the really vulnerable parts of your population.”
The vaccine’s availability came as good news Wednesday to Patricia Fisher, a graduate student and the mother of a six-month-old. Fisher was disappointed this week when the vaccine wasn’t available at her baby’s check-up.
“It’s not just about my baby,” said Fisher,  who is enrolled in a sociology Ph.D. program at the University of Wisconsin. “The community is safer if more people are vaccinated.”
Fisher has a master’s degree in public health. While her own research focuses on food systems, climate change and health, she said she’s learned enough about population health outcomes to make her alarmed at the prevalence of anti-vaccine attitudes.
“I find it really, really frightening how anti-vaccine some people are, and that people are particularly worried about [vaccines for] COVID, flu and RSV [respiratory syncytial virus],” Fisher said. “COVID is a very clear and present threat to infant health and so it’s very worrying to me.”
Between the national upsurge in measles that has surfaced in Wisconsin, surges in pertussis (whooping cough) in the last couple of years, influenza and COVID-19, “there’s a lot of threats out there,” she said. “I just didn’t think that infectious disease would be the thing about parenting that would be the most stressful, but it definitely is.”
On Wednesday she made an appointment for her child’s COVID-19 shot in mid-October. “I’m thrilled it’s going to be available,” she said.
Conway said the flood of both information and misinformation about the vaccine can overwhelm people. “Sometimes the natural human response is to just hunker down and do nothing,” he said.
He counsels patience and keeping messaging simple: pointing to the decades of data on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines along with the number of professional medical organizations that have made recommendations on the basis of scientific evidence.
“I think people should understand that there’s an opportunity here to protect themselves and their families from these really potentially very unpredictable diseases that can devastate individuals, families and communities,” Conway said.

Pete Ricketts' forum at the Nebraska State Fair in Grand Island on Aug 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn raised more than $1 million last quarter for his 2026 race against Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, his campaign announced.
The Osborn campaign says more than 17,000 donors gave to the former Omaha labor leader, with an average contribution of $43.46. Fundraising reports are still being finalized with the Federal Election Commission.
“I’m proud that Republicans, Democrats and independents are joining our coalition, because we all believe it’s time to get big money out of politics and lower costs for working people,” Osborn said.

The haul is the latest indication that Osborn can once again raise enough to mount a serious challenge to a sitting senator. He outraised Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer in the 2024 race, according to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks federal fundraising.
He raised $14 million. Fischer raised $8 million and beat Osborn by about six percentage points.  Both drew significant out-of-state money, with Osborn raising $7.77 million and Fischer $3.8 million. 
Osborn’s fundraising pace is running ahead of his first full fundraising quarter after joining the 2024 race, which was $171,000, according to the Osborn campaign.
The Ricketts campaign said it is waiting to release fundraising totals until the Oct. 15 deadline for reporting third-quarter tallies to the FEC — though the former two-term governor significantly outraised Osborn in the previous fundraising quarter. His campaign raised $901,113 and his separate Pete Ricketts Victory Fund raised $1.2 million. His victory fund can be used to support other candidates, political parties and causes, and also helps his campaign. 
Ricketts has a combined war chest of about $1.5 million in cash on hand. He ran in a 2024 special election to finish the last two years of former GOP U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term. For that race, he raised $5.8 million against Preston Love Jr., fundraising records show. Ricketts raised more than half of his funds for the 2024 race out of state.

Before Osborn’s 2024 bid, The last non-Republican Nebraska U.S. Senate candidate to raise more than $1 million in a quarter was Bob Kerrey in 2012. Kerrey had served as Nebraska’s governor and as a U.S. senator.
The Ricketts campaign criticized Osborn’s seven-figure haul, telling the Examiner that “95% of Dan Osborn’s donations came from out of state in 2024” and “Democrat Super PACs spent more than $20 million to get him elected.”  
Osborn did receive late help in 2024 from Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Ricketts’ political team has also criticized Osborn for using ActBlue, a fundraising tool often used by Democrats.
“Fake Dan Osborn pretends he will fight for working Nebraskans. But Democrats are working to get him elected because Osborn will work for them – not Nebraska,” said Will Coup, Ricketts campaign spokesman
Osborn’s relationship with Nebraska Democrats is complex. He flirted with seeking Democratic support in 2024 until it was too late for the party to run its own candidate, which led to some Democrats grumbling at Osborn and his supporters for trying to minimize the number of names on the general election ballot. 
This time around, the state’s Democrats have said they are not actively recruiting a Senate candidate, signaling support for his bid against Ricketts. 
This week’s fundraising numbers could hint at a competitive race between Ricketts and Osborn. The matchup has already garnered national attention. Part of the draw is Osborn’s labor populist style from 2024 that others have joined in testing nationally for the 2026 midterms.  
The campaign has started off hot, as Ricketts and Osborn tussled over the past few months – a major difference compared to Fischer’s approach to Osborn. She largely ignored him until the race’s last few months.
The Ricketts team is trying to paint Osborn as  a “fake” independent. Osborn recently called Ricketts a “fake senator” last month, saying he “brought way into the Senate with…dad’s money.”

Less than three months before right-wing podcast host and grassroots activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated during a public event on the campus of Utah Valley University, two Democratic Minnesota lawmakers and their partners were shot in their homes.
Minnesota House Democratic Leader Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark and their dog Gilbert died after the shooting. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were seriously injured.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was among dozens of Democratic officials named in writings found in the alleged shooter’s vehicle.

But Benson, a Democratic candidate for governor, told the Michigan Advance following a campaign event in Saginaw that while being named by the shooter is “chilling,” she would “use the threats to not just build strong security systems for all public officials, which I’m dedicated to doing, but ensure we’re staying focused on our work, and even doubling down on that work.”
“The goal of these threats is to get us to feel fear and be afraid of leading, be afraid of serving,” Benson said. “And if anything, they only make me more determined to do my job well, with integrity, and to continue to serve the people of Michigan.”
Other Michigan Democrats reportedly mentioned by the alleged gunman, Vance Luther Boelter, include U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin and U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell, Hillary Scholten, Rashida Tlaib and Shri Thanedar.
About two months before the Minnesota shooting targeting lawmakers in their homes, the Pennsylvania Governor’s Residence was set on fire using two Molotov cocktails while Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, and his family slept inside.
Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who is also running for governor as a Democrat, said there was a credible bomb threat at his home following Kirk’s assassination earlier this month.

Gilchrist noted that he and his wife, Ellen, raise their young children in the home.
“The purpose of this violence is to silence, intimidate, and eliminate people and their voices from our society,” Gilchrist said in a statement. “That won’t work on me. We cannot let this remain our reality.”
“We cannot tolerate political violence,” Gilchrist continued. “We cannot excuse it. We cannot normalize it. We have to push through this and do the work to do better. It’s not easy, but nothing important ever is.”
While several Republican candidates for governor – including former Attorney General Mike Cox, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.), Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.) – weighed in on Kirk’s assassination, with Nesbitt calling it “an act of terrorism,” only one returned a request for comment after the Minnesota lawmakers were killed.
Former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard said in a statement that restoring civility is an issue he has long cared about, pointing to a speech he gave after being elected speaker in late 2016, which he called, at the time, “one of the most uncivil [election cycles] in our nation’s history.”
“I believe over the next two years, the citizens of our state not only want to see more civility in our political process, I believe they are going to demand it from us,” Leonard said at the time.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Michigan Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield) said in a statement that he, like Gilchrist, also received a “detailed and specific message” threatening him with a bomb at his home the day after Kirk’s assassination.
Moss is running for the U.S. House in the 11th Congressional District, seeking to succeed U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is running for U.S. Senate.
Stevens declined an interview request but said in a statement that she is “looking forward to traveling to every corner of our state as part of this campaign.”
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) told the Michigan Advance that legislators don’t have the same resources that statewide officials do, like dedicated security details.
McMorrow said that when she first entered office, she was comfortable simply showing up to public events without thinking about exits or security.
She had been in the state Senate for a little more than a year when men carried long guns into the chamber’s gallery during a protest of emergency orders meant to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections in 2020.
“We all understand when we get into these jobs that we expect a level of scrutiny,” McMorrow said. “We don’t expect somebody showing up at your house with a premeditated plan to kill you.”

Now, as a candidate for U.S. Senate, McMorrow says she is taking additional precautions, like making local law enforcement aware of all her public campaign events and holding security briefings to talk through plans for arriving at and departing events. She also has a body guard and said she and her husband, Rey, think carefully about when to bring their young daughter to public events and what pictures to share online.
But McMorrow said she will go out of her way to hold more public events because she feels strongly that candidates and officials have to be accessible and available in order to rebuild relationships with voters, but she has concerns that the political violence could deter people from running for office.

“I worry about the people who will want to do these jobs in the future,” McMorrow said. “I’ve certainly talked to, particularly women, who have thought about running for office, who decided not to over the last few years because they just cannot put themselves into this position, and I don’t blame them.”
Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson said in an interview with the Michigan Advance that multiple current and former elected officials have asked him for advice on how to protect themselves, including a retired judge who received a threatening text message related to a case he heard while on the bench.
“I say the same thing: Cameras, dogs and lights,” Swanson said. “Those are the things that deter people from doing things that are violent.”
Swanson, who is running for governor as a Democrat, said he still feels safe on the campaign trail, citing his law enforcement background.
“I carry a firearm wherever I go,” Swanson said. “I carry my badge and my handcuffs, and if anything were to happen, I am going to deploy in police protect mode. The 33 years in this field that I’ve had has allowed me to be in very dangerous situations. So I am cautious, but I’m not fearful.”
But he says his wife has concerns after seeing elected officials and their families targeted in their homes.
“These are things that have gotten people, and for good reason, concerned,” Swanson said. “It’s human nature to think that could have been me, and nobody’s immune from it.”
Swanson likened the current political climate to that of the 1960s, when four major political leaders were assassinated.
“We are going to have adamant disagreement. But political violence? NEV-ER,” Swanson said, breaking his final word into two distinct syllables for emphasis.
Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, said the trend is especially troubling because each act of political violence is a sign that part of the country gives “a certain level of validation to foreclosing on the democratic process.”

“Whether you’re participating as a candidate or you’re participating as a voter, or you just believe in democracy and haven’t voted in a minute, this should be really scary to you,” El-Sayed said. “Because the thing about violence is that it usually doesn’t stop at one go. And so the question that we have to ask ourselves is where are we in this collapse, and does it go further?”
El-Sayed, a former director of Wayne County’s health department, said the solution is to double down on democracy and recognize the circumstances that led people to feeling like violence was the only solution.
“Nothing can explain or justify what that shooter did,” El-Sayed continued. “I think we have to understand that we live in a society that creates shooters like that right now, and we need to make sure that we are healing as a society, and that means using the democratic process to solve the challenges that exist in too many people’s lives.”
El-Sayed said he keeps his two young daughters and his wife, Sarah, at the forefront of his mind when campaigning. He never shares photos of their faces in public.
But ultimately, he said his daughters increase his resolve.
“I don’t want them to grow up in a world where people get shot because of their political opinions. And so that means that you have to work toward that world,” El-Sayed said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0189-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 06:56:24.670134

The BLM's Rock Springs plan, under Biden, represented a widely supported conservation and development compromise, advocacy groups say.
The post Feds to redo management plan for 3.6M acres in southwest Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Bureau of Land Management will amend its management plan for 3.6 million acres of public land in southwest Wyoming, the federal agency said Wednesday. 
The highly anticipated and unusual redo comes just nine months after the Rock Springs resource management plan was completed in December. That plan set off a firestorm of criticism from conservative critics for being overly restrictive. Now, conservation groups lament that what they considered a widely supported compromise cemented under the Biden administration is at risk of a massive overhaul by the Trump administration.
In fact, the BLM said it will “review and revise” the plan to ensure it complies with several executive orders issued under the Trump administration, including Unleashing American Energy and Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.
“The BLM has determined that the special management designations and their associated mineral restrictions within the field office are inconsistent with recent executive orders and need to be reviewed,” the agency said.
What’s at stake
The region encompasses the highly industrialized east-west Interstate 80 and railroad “checkerboard” corridor, as well as large undeveloped portions of the Red Desert. The desert is home to myriad cultural and environmental features such as Boars Tusk, Honeycomb Buttes, Adobe Town, the Big Sandy Foothills and Greater Little Mountain. It also includes climate-stressed sagebrush-steppe habitat, which is vital to the greater sage grouse (a species of concern), pronghorn and mule deer.

Conservation groups hailed the 2024 plan as a workable compromise that recognized the value of maintaining several “areas of critical environmental concern” to protect wildlife habitat, as well as blocking 1.1 million acres from new industrial-scale development via rights-of-way “exclusion areas.” Even with new protections, about 75% of the 3.6-million-acre BLM Rock Springs Field Office management area is already leased or technically available for energy development, according to a Wilderness Society report.
The exclusion areas mainly applied to the northern portion of the region, a mecca for wildlife and an area mostly untouched by large-scale oil and natural gas activity. But the U.S. Geological Survey published a new assessment earlier this year proclaiming a massive volume of oil and gas previously “undiscovered” and now “technically recoverable” in the area. That leaves wildlife advocacy groups and environmental watchdogs fearful that the USGS report, as well as Trump administration orders to “unleash American energy,” will be used to justify rolling back protections.
In fact, the BLM’s notice this week alludes to the potential for more energy development: “Potential for fluid mineral development was previously determined to be low for much of the special management designated areas,” it said. “However, new technologies and industry interest have changed over recent years and the reasonably foreseeable development needs to be reevaluated.”
Reactions
The BLM’s actions signal a disregard for conservation measures supported by 92% of public comments submitted during the planning process, as well as a majority of a local stakeholders group convened by Gov. Mark Gordon, the Sierra Club noted.

“The plan was a compromise between many different Wyoming communities who have weighed in over the years,” Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Director Rob Joyce said in a prepared statement. “Now, before the agency even has time to implement [the 2024 plan], we’re being asked to weigh in again. It’s time to listen to the science and to the public and let the plan live.”
Conservation groups also worry about the Trump administration’s promises to expedite actions on federal lands.
“The work behind [the 2024 plan] demonstrated what’s possible when the government listens to the people who know these lands best and operates in a balanced and transparent way,” The Wilderness Society’s Wyoming State Director Julia Stuble said. “There is no reason to redo a plan finalized less than a year ago, after decades of local input,” Stuble said. “Rewriting the plan now, especially through this fast-tracked amendment process, will undercut years of community work and end up excluding the voices of those who live, work and recreate in southwest Wyoming.” 
Oil and gas industry officials, meantime, praised the BLM for reopening the management plan for revision.
“We are pleased the BLM is beginning the process to amend the Rock Springs [management plan] after the Biden [administration] locked away so many acres from productive uses,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming Vice President and Director of Communications Ryan McConnaughey told WyoFile. “We look forward to a process that takes into account meaningful public comment from all stakeholders involved and analyzes the best available science.”
That includes the USGS oil and gas assessment for the area, McConnaughey added.
The BLM indicated the official notice-of-intent will be published in the Federal Register this week, kicking off a 30-day public comment period — an action that is unaffected by the federal government shutdown, according to those close to the issue, as well as the BLM’s shutdown contingency plan.Comments can be submitted via the BLM’s planning website or via email to blm_wy_rockspringsrmp@blm.gov.

The state currently relies on electronic election equipment to tabulate votes. Some lawmakers want to outlaw that. 
The post Weston County election snafu renews calls for hand counting Wyoming election results appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—A miscount in Weston County’s 2024 general election and the ensuing fallout over the last year have refueled calls for banning electronic election equipment in Wyoming. 
The state already relies on paper ballots in all but one county, but such a move would make Wyoming the only state in the country to count all its ballots by hand. 
“I’m so thankful that I work with legislators that are serious about making sure that we get good answers for what happened, and we don’t blow this off,” Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, told the Wyoming Legislature’s Weston County Clerk 2024 General Election Subcommittee as it met Monday in Casper.
The subcommittee was formed this summer to investigate Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock.
In November, as Neiman was running unopposed for reelection to the House District 1, he and other voters noticed some funky-looking numbers on the night of the general election. Initially, the results showed Neiman received 166 votes, while 1,289 voters left that part of their ballot blank, also known as an undervote. 
It was soon discovered that Hadlock had used a combination of the correct ballots and misprinted ones and a hand count ultimately worked to sort out the results. The mishap, however, concerned many Weston County voters who say their trust in elections has been broken. 
It’s now up to lawmakers to mend that, Neiman told the committee. 
“Paper ballots and a hand count would have stopped all this and would have never even got out of the gate,” Neiman said, prompting several meeting attendees to cheer and applaud. 
“We will do everything that we possibly can to make sure that the people of the state of Wyoming have confidence in their elections and they feel good about what’s going on and they know that their votes have been cast and they’ve been counted correctly,” Neiman told the committee. 
Neiman’s promise comes with considerable weight. As speaker of the House, he has unilateral power to prioritize bills, or hold them back in his drawer to kill them. Neiman is also a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which holds the majority in the House.

Altogether, a bill to hand count ballots could likely go further in the upcoming legislative session than in years past when Republicans — including several Freedom Caucus members and endorsees — got cold feet and killed mirror bills to ban electronic election equipment. 
Meanwhile, lawmakers are pursuing criminal charges against Hadlock after she failed to appear at the Monday meeting despite being subpoenaed. 
Background
Calls to prohibit electronic ballot tabulators aren’t new to Wyoming. 
In 2022, for example, Republicans in Park County led a pursuit of hand counting ballots, but their efforts came up short. And GOP organizers sought signatures in 2024 for a ballot initiative to require county clerks to use a hand-tabulation system.
More recently, Rep. Scott Smith, R-Lingle, and former Sen. Darin Smith, R-Cheyenne, brought mirror bills in the 2025 general session to not just eliminate tabulators but also ban electronic pollbooks as well. 
Earlier this year, Secretary of State Chuck Gray encouraged lawmakers to keep the door open on some of the more sweeping election measures from 2025, including a ban on all electronic election equipment, including voting machines, tabulators and pollbooks. 
“It’s something that we really need to be examining,” Gray said when pressed by House Minority Leader Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, to clarify his stance on banning such equipment. 
Gray did not respond by publishing time to WyoFile’s request Wednesday to confirm his support for prohibiting electronic voting equipment, or whether it will be his top priority of the 2026 budget session. 
In August, Gray, alongside the Freedom Caucus, backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using mail-in ballots and voting machines. Such an executive order has not been issued yet, but is expected to be soon. 
At the meeting in Casper, Sen. Bob Ide, R-Casper, asked Neiman and Gray if they had “any comments to help us along here as far as whether we could try to move legislation to eliminate the voting machines and go to paper ballots and hand [counts?]”

Gray pointed to legislation from earlier this year, including the two Smith bills, and said he supported that legislation and “certainly can continue to be involved in that conversation and supportive of that conversation.” 
Post-election audit
The subcommittee Monday focused less on the initial miscount in Weston County, and more on a post-election audit Hadlock submitted to Gray’s office that included false information. 
County clerks are required by law to perform a post-election audit using a statistical analysis developed by the University of Wyoming during Ed Buchanan’s tenure as secretary of state. The audit was designed to measure election accuracy, and the Wyoming State Canvassing Board uses its results in deciding whether to certify results. 
However, Hadlock submitted an initial post-election audit showing no errors despite the discrepancy in the results in Neiman’s race as well as a county commissioner contest. 
Gray spent much of his public testimony criticizing Gov. Mark Gordon, accusing him of ignoring the post-election audit in his decision against seeking Hadlock’s removal from office. Betsy Anderson, general counsel for the governor, told the committee the governor’s office had “reviewed and considered” Gray’s own investigation, which highlighted the post-election audit. 
In his review, Gordon concluded that while Hadlock “made many serious mistakes” in the 2024 election, her actions did not “rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance” required to recommend that the attorney general seek the clerk’s removal in district court. 
“I take election integrity seriously. A single note of distrust in our system can reverberate to many times its size, even in uncontested elections like this one where the outcome was never affected,” Gordon told WyoFile in a statement after the meeting. “The sanctity of our elections is of the utmost importance. Decisions of the voters should not be casually cast aside in favor of a process in which only a few can participate in nominating a replacement officer without compelling evidence of misconduct or malfeasance.”
Other clerks 
“The further into this we get, I recognize that Clerk Hadlock has the answers to the pieces in this that are missing,” Casper Republican Rep. Jayme Lien said at the meeting. 
While Hadlock did not show up Monday, other county clerks did, including Platte County Clerk Malcolm Ervin, who is also president of the County Clerks’ Association. 
“I hope I can provide information to your committee that is helpful to understand that the matter at hand was an isolated incident,” Ervin said. 
In Platte County, Ervin said, there were a number of voters who expressed concerns in light of events in Weston County. 
“Ultimately, the acts of one county clerk have called into question the honesty and accountability of other clerks,” Ervin said. “I hope our presence today shows we understand this is a very serious matter. We owe it to the public to give answers and be accountable for our actions.” 
While Ervin said the Weston County incident was isolated, going forward, county clerks intend to do six things as a group to ensure it doesn’t happen again. 
That includes suggesting the Legislature form an audit working group, seeking and developing more election training for county clerks and their election staff, as well as continuing to work on testing standards for equipment. 
Fremont County Clerk Julie Freese also attended the meeting. Powell Republican Sen. Dan Laursen asked her if the clerks’ association had discussed the topic of hand counting. 
“Yes, we have,” Freese said, adding that the clerks did a training in the last week on hand counting ballots to prepare for any forthcoming legislation. 
“We are here to help. This is what we want to make sure all citizens have the right to vote and that their vote counts,” Freese said. “We weren’t subpoenaed to be here. We chose to come here today. And it’s been tough. It’s been tough. I’m not going to lie.” 
Several speakers had been critical of county clerks in their testimony throughout the meeting, including a Sheridan resident who used a pejorative term to describe one of the clerks. 
The subcommittee will hold a virtual meeting Monday.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State transportation officials announced a new pilot program that will create an express bus route between Vineland and Atlantic City in a bid to boost transit accessibility and job access for South Jersey residents.
The program will see two round-trip weekday buses tailored to worker schedules in Atlantic City and would nearly halve transit times compared to existing bus routes connecting Cumberland County to the gambling mecca.
“This pilot will provide a reliable, affordable option for workers and residents in Cumberland County who need to reach Atlantic City,” Transportation Commissioner Fran O’Connor said Wednesday.

The shuttles could ferry 40 total riders each day and would charge $6 for a one-way ticket, matching existing NJ Transit bus prices. The South Jersey Transportation Authority, which would operate the buses, will also honor existing eight-zone bus passes.
The program won plaudits from Republican lawmakers who have traditionally been critical of NJ Transit and its comparatively sparse services in South Jersey.
Sen. Mike Testa (R-Cumberland), who has sometimes lampooned the agency as “North Jersey Transit” over the dearth of services in South Jersey, said the program would boost job access for Cumberland residents, particularly lower-income residents without access to a vehicle.
“We have much to be proud of. This is the start of something very big for southern New Jersey, and it shows you what good government looks like when we all work together and pull in the same direction,” Testa said at a press conference in Vineland.
The senator credited former Unite Here Local 54 president Bob McDevitt for helping develop the idea. Local 54 is the chief union for Atlantic City Casino workers.
The program is expected to cost about $270,000 annually and could be expanded if successful, NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri said.
“If it works, I think it’s an absolute test case for other areas in the state,” he said.

Wyoming is down to one marketplace individual health insurance provider. With less competition and limited government intervention, health care costs will continue to climb, writes Alexander Muromcew. 
The post Without affordable health insurance, all Wyomingites suffer appeared first on WyoFile .","Recently, the Mountain Health Co-Op, one of two insurers offering individual insurance, announced that it was withdrawing from the Wyoming health insurance marketplace. The co-op’s 11,000 Wyoming members will have to find a new health insurance carrier before next year — if they can afford it. Rates in Wyoming are forecast to increase by approximately 25% in 2026. Due to high claims costs and significant losses here, the co-op will focus its operations on its other two markets: Idaho and Montana. 

Opinion

While this is a blow for the co-op’s Wyoming members, the withdrawal of a health insurer is significant for everyone for several reasons. We should all take note. First, a little background.
Mountain Health Co-Op was established to offer a low-cost health insurance option in the individual market. Initially, it offered health insurance only in Montana. Eventually, both Idaho and Wyoming reached out to Mountain Health to offer plans because neither state had a co-op option. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming was the only option for Wyoming workers whose employers did not offer coverage. In the co-op’s first year of operation in Wyoming, health insurance premiums dropped 12% confirming that customers benefit from competition. Recently, the operating environment for all health insurers nationwide has been deteriorating. Publicly listed insurers such as UnitedHealthcare and Cigna have reported disappointing earnings because of the continued rise in health care costs. The drop in Medicaid funding in the Big Beautiful Bill and the expiration of the enhanced advanced premium tax credits at the end of this year have darkened the outlook for all health insurers. 
The co-op is not the only health insurer re-evaluating markets and refocusing operations. Unfortunately, health insurance rates will be rising by double digits across the United States as health insurance companies scramble to keep up with rising costs. The co-op’s departure is a symptom of some deep-rooted challenges facing Wyoming.
First, providing health care in Wyoming is very expensive. We have a small population, which makes it difficult to spread risk. Being a thinly populated, rural state makes the cost of providing health care more expensive. To do business here, a new insurer must negotiate provider contracts with nearly every provider, even if that provider only sees a few insureds. This means the health care entity holds all the power in the negotiation. By law, the insurer needs to contract with every hospital and most doctors to be eligible to sell insurance here. There is simply no control over what health care providers can charge for care. Moreover, Wyoming has one of the oldest populations of the 50 states. An older population consumes more health care. Without younger, healthier members to offset the risk pool, insurance costs rise.
Wyoming likes to believe that it is a business-friendly state. In general, we offer a lower cost of doing business, such as lower taxes and fewer regulations. But Wyoming ranks toward the top in health care costs and health insurance costs. This is a hidden tax, and a very expensive tax, for any business or sole proprietor. The Wyoming Legislature, as well as our federal delegation, has tools available to help lower health care costs. 
When we look for care, we often don’t factor in the cost when we have insurance. The cost for the same procedure could vary by thousands of dollars between providers, but we pay the same out of pocket with our benefits. As health care consumers, we have a stake in the game, too. We should try to keep our costs down and challenge health care providers who charge much more than others for the same services. 
The rising cost of health care is not a new discussion. As the number of people without health insurance increases, the amount of care going unpaid increases. Those uncompensated costs are passed along to those who have insurance. Then, health insurance rates go up. What most of us see is the cost of health insurance, but we don’t examine what drives those costs. The U.S. was starting to get a handle on these drivers. Expanded Medicaid eligibility, expanded premium tax credits, coverage of essential and preventive care, and requiring insurance companies to spend more of your premium on care help keep the cost of care down. 
Mountain Health is the type of company we want operating in Wyoming. They are a true nonprofit that is governed by its members. They invest in their members with zero-dollar co-pay prescriptions, travel reimbursements for more specialized care, a focus on preventive medicine and they invested in our communities. The next company that comes in to sell insurance in Wyoming may not have that commitment. The departure of the co-op should be a wake-up call to all of us that our state faces some serious problems. The can has been kicked down the road long enough.

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)LOUISVILLE, Tenn. — When a big storm hits, Peninsula Hospital could be underwater.
At this decades-old psychiatric hospital on the edge of the Tennessee River, an intense storm could submerge the building in 11 feet of water, cutting off all roads around the facility, according to a sophisticated computer simulation of flood risk.
Aurora, a young woman who was committed to Peninsula as a teenager, said the hospital sits so close to the river that it felt like a moat keeping her and dozens of other patients inside. KFF Health News agreed not to publish her full name because she shared private medical history.
“My first feeling is doom,” Aurora said as she watched the simulation of the river rising around the hospital. “These are probably some of the most vulnerable people.”
Covenant Health, which runs Peninsula Hospital, said in a statement it has a “proactive and thorough approach to emergency planning” but declined to provide details or answer questions.
Peninsula is one of about 170 American hospitals, totaling nearly 30,000 patient beds from coast to coast, that face the greatest risk of significant or dangerous flooding, according to a months-long KFF Health News investigation based on data provided by Fathom, a company considered a leader in flood simulation. At many of these hospitals, flooding from heavy storms has the potential to jeopardize patient care, block access to emergency rooms, and force evacuations. Sometimes there is no other hospital nearby.
Much of this risk to hospitals is not captured by flood maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which have served as the nation’s de facto tool for flood estimation for half a century, despite being incomplete and sometimes decades out of date. As FEMA’s maps have become divorced from the reality of a changing climate, private companies like Fathom have filled the gap with simulations of future floods. But many of their predictions are behind a paywall, leaving the public mostly reliant on free, significantly limited government maps.
“This is highly concerning,” said Caleb Dresser, who studies climate change and is both an emergency room doctor and a Harvard University assistant professor. “If you don’t have the information to know you’re at risk, then how can you triage that problem?”

The deadliest hospital flooding in modern American history occurred 20 years ago during Hurricane Katrina, when the bodies of 45 people were recovered from New Orleans’ Memorial Medical Center, including some patients whom investigators suspected were euthanized. More flooding deaths were narrowly avoided one year ago when helicopters rescued dozens of people as Hurricane Helene engulfed Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee.
Rebecca Harrison, a paramedic, called her children from the Unicoi roof to say goodbye.
“I was scared to death, thinking, ‘This is it,’” Harrison told CBS News, which interviewed Unicoi survivors as part of KFF Health News’ investigation. “Alarms were going off. People were screaming. It was chaos.”
The investigation — among the first to analyze nationwide hospital flood risk in an era of warming climate and worsening storms — comes as the administration of President Donald Trump has slashed federal agencies that forecast and respond to extreme weather and also dismantled FEMA programs designed to protect hospitals and other important buildings from floods.

When asked to comment, FEMA said flooding is a common, costly, and “under appreciated” disaster but made no statement specific to hospitals. Spokesperson Daniel Llargués defended the administration’s changes to FEMA by reissuing an August statement that dismissed criticism as coming from “bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency.”
Alice Hill, an Obama administration climate risk expert, said the Trump administration’s dismissal of climate change and worsening floods would waste billions of dollars and endanger lives.
In 2015, Hill led the creation of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, which required that hospitals and other essential structures be elevated or incorporate extra flood protections to qualify for federal funding. 
FEMA stopped enforcing the standard in March.
“People will die as a result of some of the choices being made today,” Hill said. “We will be less prepared than we are now. And we already were, in my estimation, poorly prepared.”
‘Flood risk is everywhere’
The KFF Health News investigation identified more than 170 hospitals with flood risk by comparing the locations of more than 7,000 facilities to peer-reviewed flood hazard mapping provided by Fathom, a United Kingdom company that simulates flooding in spaces as small as 10 meters using laser-precision elevation measurements from the U.S. Geological Survey.
Hospitals were determined to have a significant risk if Fathom’s 100-year flood data predicted that a foot or more of water could reach a considerable portion of their buildings, excluding parking garages, or cut off road access to the hospital. A 100-year flood is an intense weather event that has roughly a 1% chance of occurring in any given year but can happen more often. 
The investigation found heightened flood risks at large trauma centers, small rural hospitals, children’s hospitals, and long-term care facilities that serve older and disabled patients. At least 21 are critical access hospitals, with the next-closest hospital 25 miles away, on average.
Flooding threatens dozens of hospitals in coastal areas, including in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and New York. Farther inland, flooding of rivers or creeks could envelop other hospitals, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. Even in the sun-soaked cities and arid expanses of the American West, storms have the potential to surround some hospitals with several feet of pooling water, according to Fathom’s data.
These findings are likely an undercount of hospitals at risk because the investigation overlooked pockets of potential flooding at some hospitals. It excluded facilities like stand-alone ERs, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes.
“The reality is that flood risk is everywhere. It is the most pervasive of perils,” said Oliver Wing, the chief scientific officer at Fathom, who reviewed the findings. “Just because you haven’t experienced an extreme doesn’t mean you never will.”
Dresser, the ER doctor, said even a small amount of flooding can shut down an unprepared hospital, often by interrupting its power supply, which is needed for life-sustaining equipment like ventilators and heart monitors. He said the most vulnerable hospitals would likely be in rural areas.
“A lot of rural hospitals are now closing their pediatric units, closing their psychiatry units,” Dresser said. “In a financially stressed situation, it can be hard to prioritize long-term threats, even if they are, for some institutions, potentially existential.”
Urban hospitals can face dangerous flooding, too. Fathom’s data predicts 5 to 15 feet of water around neighboring hospitals — Kadlec Regional Medical Center and Lourdes Behavioral Health — that straddle a tiny creek in Richland, Washington.
By Fathom’s estimate, a 100-year flood could cause the nearby Columbia River to spill over a levee that protects Richland, then loosely follow the creek to the hospitals. Some of the deepest flooding is estimated around Lourdes, which was built on land the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set aside in 1961 as a “ponding and drainage easement.”
At the time, this land was supposed to be capable of storing enough water to fill at least 40 Olympic-size swimming pools, according to military documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. A mental health facility has occupied this spot since the 1970s.
Both Kadlec and Lourdes said in statements that they have disaster plans but did not answer questions about flooding. Tina Baumgardner, a Lourdes spokesperson, said government flood maps show the hospital is not in a 100-year flood plain.
This is not uncommon. Of the more than 170 hospitals with significant flood risk identified by KFF Health News, one-third are located in areas that FEMA has not designated as flood hazard zones.
Sometimes the difference is stark. For example, at Ochsner Choctaw General in Alabama — the only hospital for 30 miles in any direction — FEMA maps suggest a 100-year flood would overflow a nearby creek but spare the hospital. Fathom’s data predicts the same event would flood most of the hospital with 1 to 2 feet of water, including the ER and the helicopter pad.
Ochsner Health did not answer questions about flooding preparations at Choctaw General.


FEMA flood maps were launched in the ’60s as part of the National Flood Insurance Program to determine where insurance is required and building codes should include flood-proofing. According to a FEMA statement, the maps show only a “snapshot in time” and are not intended to predict where flooding will or won’t happen.
 FEMA spokesperson Geoff Harbaugh said the agency intends to modernize its maps through the Future of Flood Risk Data initiative, which will enable the agency to “better project flood risk” and give Americans “the information they need to protect their lives and property.”
The program was launched by the first Trump administration in 2019 but has since received sparse public updates. Harbaugh declined to provide a detailed update or timeline for the program.
Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said it is unknown whether FEMA is still trying to upgrade its maps under Trump, as the agency has cut off communications with outside flooding experts.
“There has been not a single bit of loosening of what I’m calling the FEMA cone of silence,” Berginnis said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Floods are expected to worsen as a warming climate fuels stronger storms, drenching areas that are already flood-prone and bringing a new level of flooding to areas once considered lower risk.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said that 2024 was the warmest year on record — more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 20th-century average. Scientists across the globe have estimated that each degree of global warming correlates to a 4% increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall.
“Warmer air can hold more moisture, so this leads us to experience heavier downpours,” said Kelly Van Baalen, a sea level rise expert at the nonprofit Climate Central. “A 100-year flood today could be a 10-year flood tomorrow.”
Intensifying storms raise concerns about Peninsula Hospital, which has operated for decades mere feet from the Tennessee River but has no known history of flooding.
Peninsula spokesperson Josh Cox said the river is overseen by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which uses dams to manage water levels and generate electricity. Estimates provided by the TVA suggest the dams could keep Peninsula dry even in a 500-year flood.
Fathom, however, said its flood simulation accounts for the dams and stressed that a large enough storm could drop more rain than even the TVA could control. These predictions are echoed by another flood modeling firm, First Street, which also says an intense storm could cause more than 10 feet of flooding in the area around Peninsula.
“It’s a hospital right on the banks of a major American river,” said Wing, the Fathom scientist. “It just isn’t conceivable that such a location is risk-free.”
Jack Goodwin, 75, a retired TVA employee who has lived next to Peninsula for three decades, said he was confident the dams could protect the area. But after reviewing Fathom’s predictions, Goodwin began to research flood insurance.
“Water can rise quickly and suddenly, and the destruction is tremendous,” he said. “Just because we’ve never seen it here doesn’t mean we won’t see it.”

[…],"Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee during her confirmation hearing for U.S. attorney general in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on Jan. 15, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Louisiana’s Liz Murrill has joined attorneys general from 13 other states in asking the Trump administration to challenge a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that placed the death penalty off limits for persons who rape children. 
The case in question involves a Louisiana man who was sentenced to death for sexually assaulting his 8-year-old stepdaughter. Justices set aside that punishment, ruling that it was “cruel and unusual” in violation of the 8th Amendment. 
The attorneys general say the decision limits the authority of states to impose capital punishment. 
Florida’s AG James Uthmeier sent a letter last month to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House counsel Dave Warrington asking for their support of state efforts to uphold the death penalty in child-rape prosecutions. Murrill announced Wednesday she has added her signature to the letter, joining her fellow Republican counterparts from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. 
The Supreme Court decision stems from a Louisiana case in which Patrick O’Neal Kennedy was sentenced to death for the 1998 rape of his 8-year-old stepdaughter at his Jefferson Parish home. His punishment was cleared under a 1995 Louisiana law that expanded the use of death penalty for aggravated rape when the victim is under age 13. Kennedy was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to die.
His appeal ultimately landed before the Louisiana Supreme Court, which upheld the death sentence. State justices noted in their ruling that five other states had also enacted laws to allow capital punishment in child rape cases.
In its 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court found that five states did not constitute a “national consensus” on treating child rape as a capital offense. 
Kennedy’s death sentence was converted to life in prison. Now 60, he is being held at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel, according to state corrections records.  
In his letter, Uthmeier said the 2008 ruling “acknowledged, though, the possibility of a ‘further or later consensus in favor of the [death] penalty’ that might … warrant a different result in future litigation.”
Toward that end, Florida two years ago reauthorized the death penalty for sexual battery committed against children under 12, Uthmeier wrote. The signatory AGs from states that have yet to permit executions for child rapists have committed to urging their state legislatures to approve such measures, he said. The letter asks Bondi “to support States’ efforts to pursue justice” by filing briefs to uphold the death penalty in child-rape convictions.        
“We have every confidence that, with President Trump’s strong leadership and with principled, rule-of-law Justices on the Supreme Court, Kennedy’s days are numbered, and child rapists can be appropriately punished for their unspeakable crimes,” Uthmeier said.
Murrill was more direct in a statement she released about adding her name to the Florida attorney general’s letter.
“As I’ve stated many times before, child rapists deserve the death penalty,” Murrill said. “The United States Supreme Court needs to reverse this egregiously wrong ruling.”
The Louisiana Legislature has recently enacted harsher penalties for sex offenders who target children. 
In 2024, Gov. Jeff Landry approved a bipartisan-backed measure to allow surgical castration for certain sex crimes when the victim is younger than 13.
Louisiana approved the use of chemical castration, a reversible procedure carried out through medication, in 2008 – the same year the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Kennedy case.

(Photo by Lexi Browing/West Virginia Watch)Three West Virginia jails are being used to house immigrant detainees in a deal that has made the state’s corrections division more than $333,000 so far this year.
During President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, 48 West Virginia beds have been made available daily under the contract with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, according to West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesperson Andy Malinoski.
“Inmates are moved within the facility to accommodate ICE detainees,” he said.
There were 101 ICE inmates detained as of Sept. 29, according to state corrections records. The immigrants could be from anywhere in the country as they await their next steps in the process. 
ICE pays West Virginia $90 for each day it holds an ICE detainee — about the same amount the state pays per day for each incarcerated person. From June 2024 to July of this year, the state billed ICE for a total of $339,615.
South Central Regional Jail in Charleston, Northern Regional Jail in Moundsville and Eastern Regional Jail in Martinsburg are designated ICE detention centers. Western Regional Jail is “usually only holding an ICE inmate that has a pending state/city charge and for no longer than 72 hours,” Malinoski said.
West Virginia jails have regularly been at capacity or crowded, prompting safety concerns. In the last decade, the state’s jails were the deadliest in the country.
Most immigration violations are a civil offense, like an expired visa or improper entry into the United States. Immigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in the country’s immigration detention centers, according to data released by ICE.
ICE has a network of 200 detention facilities nationwide, including county jails. Immigration rights advocates have raised concerns about conditions at detention centers, saying county jails don’t have to provide immigrants the same level of legal and medical services compared to ICE facilities.
In other states, some county jails are using the contract with ICE to shore up their budgets and pay down jail bills. The corrections division did not say if this was the case in West Virginia.
DCR Commissioner David Kelly recently told lawmakers that multiple West Virginia counties were unable to pay their jail bills, pushing the cost onto the state. West Virginia counties pay the state per inmate per day to house inmates at regional jails.
The state corrections division is participating in Gov. Patrick Morrisey partnership with ICE that gives specially-trained police officers and National Guard members the authority to perform specified immigration enforcement functions.
Law enforcement can question people on their immigration status during routine police duties. 
As part of the program, Division of Corrections officers will serve and execute administrative warrants for undocumented immigrants who currently are in state correctional facilities. During a press conference about the program, Kelly said it would reduce the premature release of potentially dangerous individuals into communities.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A bipartisan group of Wisconsin lawmakers announced legislation Wednesday to  create a statewide registry for Parkinson’s Disease.
Parkinson’s, a neurological condition that is characterized by tremors, but also by a variety of other symptoms, has been increasing disproportionately, according to Dr. Brian Nagle, a movement disorder specialist.
“It’s the second most common neurological disease after Alzheimer’s disease, but it’s the fastest growing,” Nagle said in an interview Wednesday.
The speed with which Parkinson’s diagnoses are increasing is outpacing the aging of the population, “which suggests that it’s not just due to our population getting older, but that there may be some sort of risk factor that is causing it to grow more rapidly,” Nagle said.
A statewide registry of Parkinson’s patients could help provide clues about factors, such as environmental conditions, that may be at the root of the illness, he said.
Republican Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara speaks Wednesday, Oct. 1, about a bill creating a state Parkinson’s Disease registry. Cabral-Guevara and Democratic state Rep. Lisa Subeck, left, have coauthored the legislation. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)
State Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Fox Crossing) and state Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) began circulating a draft bill Wednesday to create the proposed state registry.
“Right now, when patients and their doctors are looking for answers, we struggle a little bit,” said Cabral-Guevara, who is a nurse practitioner, at a press conference to announce the legislation.
“We simply don’t have the data that we need,” she said. “We don’t know who is infected. Where the disease is hitting the hardest. Are there environmental factors that impact this, that cause this, that make it progress even faster? That lack of the clear picture of this is a barrier.”
The legislation was the brainchild of Stephanie Johnson, director of the Parkinson’s Disease Alliance of Wisconsin. Johnson told reporters Wednesday that her husband, Rick, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s 15 years ago when he was 61. After living with the illness for 13 years, he died in December 2023.
“I think we typically think of Parkinson’s as tremors or shuffling,” Johnson said, “but Rick had dangerously low blood pressure that would cause him to pass out. He had cognitive changes that made it very, very challenging for him to communicate. And he had visual hallucinations and many other non-motor symptoms.”
Johnson said she was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s three months after her husband’s death — a finding that astonished her. Then she learned that in the neighborhood where they had previously lived for 20 years, they were two of six residents who developed Parkinson’s disease, she said.
“And I thought, this can’t be a coincidence,” Johnson said, “And I wondered, is this a disease cluster? I didn’t know.”
“We don’t have a systematic way of tracking the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson’s in Wisconsin,” Johnson said.
The proposed legislation is aimed at filling that gap. The bill’s authors have named it in memory of Johnson’s husband at her request.
Fourteen U.S. states have some form of registry for Parkinson’s Disease, with some tracking other conditions as well, according to the Michael J. Fox foundation, a national research nonprofit named for the TV actor who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease when he was 30.
The draft legislation calls for the establishment of a registry at the Department of Population Health Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health. The registry would include a website with annual reports on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson’s Disease in Wisconsin.
Health care providers would file information with the directory about patients they treat for Parkinson’s or closely related conditions. If patients don’t consent for their information to be shared, the incidence would be reported and nothing else, according to the bill.
Parkinson’s Disease is the subject of “a lot of mysteries,” Subeck said. “The reality is we are not going to get closer to curing Parkinson’s unless we do the research, unless we collect the data, and unless we enable that data to be used in meaningful ways.”

Burton and Marshall Keeble breaking ground on Nashville Christian Institute in 1942. (Photo: Courtesy of Center for Restoration Studies, Abilene Christian University)In the spring of 2015, the redrawing of Nashville’s skyline spurred my impromptu visit to its first true skyscraper, Life & Casualty Tower, finished in 1957 and Tennessee’s tallest building through 1965.
It seemed larger, shinier buildings soon would completely overshadow and envelope stately L&C.
“The tower is beginning to fade into obscurity,” I thought, and my songwriter brain couldn’t avoid an obvious and poignant metaphor: “as is the memory of the man who built it.”
Now, my great-grandfather, A.M. Burton, did not literally build L&C Tower. He founded and built its namesake, Life & Casualty Insurance Co. That fact alone represents a classic, self-made American success story: A Trousdale County farm kid with mere months of formal education came to Nashville in 1896, earned $1 a day shoveling dirt for the construction of Centennial Park, saved half his pay until he had enough to start an insurance company, and made a fortune.
And yet, Burton was so much more than a successful entrepreneur. Making a fortune isn’t the story. The story is what he did with it.
He gave it away as he made it.
A.M. Burton, one of the founders of Life and Casualty Insurance, was a generous philanthropist. (Photo: Courtesy of Burton family)
By the late-1920s, Burton was a mere conduit for most of his own income, with 75% passing right through to charitable causes. As the years went on, that share grew to 90%. His will was two pages.
Burton was one of the most generous philanthropists of his time, giving away over $100 million total before his death in 1966 (nearly $1 billion in 2025 dollars). Beneficiaries included colleges and universities throughout the country. The church he founded, downtown Nashville’s Central Church of Christ, opened one of the nation’s first daycare centers. 
“The work we are doing is non-sectarian and non-partisan in spirit,” Burton said in an April 1926 radio address printed in part by the Tennessean. “A number of children have been kept in school during the past winter only by our supplying the needed clothes for the cold weather. … We have also been able to find homes for a number of orphaned children, and secure work for unfortunate older persons.”
Central was not just a church but “in reality a civic center,” the Nashville Chamber of Commerce proclaimed in 1927.
Burton founded the Nashville Christian Institute, a school for African Americans whose alumni include the segregation-fighting icon, Attorney Fred Gray Jr. Burton befriended and financed the work of Marshall Keeble, a Black preacher who helped bridge racial divides before the Civil Rights Movement. L&C itself bucked Jim Crow-era prejudices in the insurance industry and got its start selling fair, affordable accident and death insurance policies to Black Nashvillians.
While Burton’s legacy was a constant presence throughout my life, for me he was more reference material than man, a story that grounded and exemplified our family ethos and provided an example we could aspire to emulate. I was just 5 when he died.
So, what I craved as I walked in the doors of L&C Tower a decade ago were details. Specificity. Words he wrote. Pages he touched. Inhabiting a shared place. Walking his halls. In short, I craved the closest thing to a conversation one can have with a person already gone. Such opportunities, like the chances of easily picking L&C out in the skyline, would inevitably grow fewer.
The staff were tremendously helpful and kind in response to my unannounced visit, rambling explanation of it and my uncertainly defined request. (To them all, thank you.) In short order I was given access to artifacts in the basement and some vacant office space on the top floor to pore over the collected words he had written and a spectacular view of the growing city. 
I found myself sitting cross-legged on the floor, eyes closed in contemplation.
“How do I tell your story?” I asked. “How do I tell your story?”



				My great-grandfather A.M. Burton’s legacy was a constant presence throughout my life. His story grounded and exemplified our family ethos and provided an example we could aspire to emulate. 


It wasn’t exactly a prayer, but it was nonetheless answered in a most unexpected manner.
I believe in the power of stories — and Burton’s, specifically — to win hearts, change minds and inspire action. I wouldn’t be a songwriter if I didn’t. But bigger questions have started to replace that initial desire: What do I do with your story? What have I learned from it? How do I honor it? How do I live it?
It’s time to walk the walk.
Arriving at the 100-year anniversary of Central Church of Christ’s first service on Oct. 5, 1925, my family proudly announces the A.M. Burton / Matthew 25 Fund. We start from humble beginnings, just like Burton. We will be guided by his example of service, community empowerment, and civic responsibility, with a core mission to uplift individuals and thus strengthen our city.
Luckily, the causes Burton championed, and the philanthropic services Central offered to all, provide a roadmap for our efforts: from charity medical care and disaster relief to affordable housing and childcare. The community’s voice, support and needs will determine our future.
Decades ago, L&C Tower’s color-coded weather beacon shared the day’s weather forecast to all with a clear view of downtown Nashville.
The beacon is long defunct, but A.M. Burton remains a guiding light.
We share his hopeful vision for a more compassionate and equitable Nashville. We humbly invite you to join us in the pursuit. Learn more at www.cfmt.org/amburton.

A proposed bill from House Republicans would make Michigan’s school board candidates declare a party affiliation, a change that’s drawing criticism from local election officials and school board members.
Under state law, school board positions are explicitly nonpartisan. House Bill 4588, introduced by Rep. Jason Woolford, would tweak the law to require candidates for local school boards to declare a party affiliation.
That requirement could force the races to have primary elections in August, in addition to the November general election when school board seats are typically voted on, officials said.
Michigan clerks warn that the bill could create a range of problems for local election offices, including longer ballots, voter confusion, and thousands of extra dollars in expenses.
For one thing, it would require changing the layout of primary ballots to include school board candidates in the partisan section, which could be confusing for voters and expensive to implement, Hillsdale County Clerk Abe Dane told Votebeat.
Woolford, a Republican from Howell, said Tuesday before the House Election Integrity Committee that his proposal would improve transparency around a candidate’s values and improve voter turnout.
“Party labels create policy consistency,” Woolford said. “Boards with clear ideological balances, whether conservative, progressive or mixed, can avoid gridlock and deliver on promises from better budgets to safer schools. Without labels, we risk surprises or recalls when candidates’ true colors show up too late.”
Education policy is largely determined by the state, but school boards have increasingly become a battleground for groups trying to influence policy at the most local level. In some communities, conservative groups have focused on school boards as a place to assert “parental rights” on everything from COVID vaccine requirements to LGBTQ inclusion.
A small number of states already use party labels on ballots for school board candidates, while others allow for it but don’t require it. In Michigan, candidates for the three public-university boards that are elected statewide are listed on ballots with their party affiliation. But these candidates are selected during party conventions, not through primaries.
It’s the prospect of partisan primaries for local school boards that has some election officials worried. Dane, in Hillsdale County, said that in counties like his where a single party dominates most offices, adding another race to the partisan section of the primary ballot could make ballots longer and costlier.
“If you throw in a second piece of paper for every single voter? God, help us,” Dane said. “You’re going to create nightmares for balancing, tabulator issues. Voters are going to drop off and give up after a while of filling out the ballot.”
He said the cost could easily run a clerk’s office thousands of dollars.
He dismissed the idea that a switch to partisan elections would improve voter turnout. “Anyone that is interested in a school board election is probably going to be voting in an August primary regardless,” he said.
School board members at the hearing overwhelmingly testified against the bill as well, arguing that requiring candidates to declare a party affiliation goes against the mandate for school board members to support students and schools.
Jennifer Smith, director of government relations for the Michigan Association of School Boards, said “the vast majority” of MASB members opposed the bill, because they don’t see themselves as political people. Such a change could discourage people from running for school board — at a time when many school board seats are already going unfilled — because candidates would have to be prepared to campaign in both a primary and a general election, she said.
In emailed testimony, Tom Buffett, president of the Okemos Public Schools board, wrote: “Frankly, in an increasingly polarized and politicized society, I view the prospect of having party-affiliated Trustees as a divisive distraction of what Boards of Education need.”
Democrats on the committee appeared opposed to the bill. Rep. Stephen Wooden, D-Grand Rapids, discussed the risk that partisan elections could lead to significant policy changes from one election to the next, to the detriment of students.
Even Republicans didn’t seem convinced. Rep. Pat Outman, a Republican from Six Lakes, said he wished “we could get the politics out of school,” citing President George Washington’s farewell address in which he warned against partisan factions. Outman said he hadn’t solidified his opinion yet but had concerns about the bill.
The committee did not vote on the bill Tuesday. Even if the bill were to make it to the House floor and through the chamber, it is unlikely to win favor in the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate.

Twenty-four decomposing bodies and other human remains were discovered hidden inside a private funeral home owned by the county’s elected coroner, Brian Cotter. The details are stomach-turning: families possibly given fake cremains, remains improperly stored for years, and a shocking abuse of public trust.
But as shocking as this case is, it also demonstrates that when state employees are empowered and well-resourced to do their jobs, they protect all of us.
The wrongdoing at Davis Mortuary did not come to light by chance. It was uncovered during a routine inspection by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies on Aug. 20. Inspectors found the remains, issued an immediate suspension of the mortuary’s license, and triggered a criminal investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Within days, Gov. Jared Polis declared a disaster emergency and moved emergency funding to support the community.

This discovery would not have happened without a change in state law last year. In 2024, lawmakers passed House Bill 24-1335, which expanded DORA’s inspection authority and required routine, periodic inspections of funeral homes. The law was a response to previous tragedies, including more than 200 bodies found in a Penrose funeral home and dozens of cremated remains discovered in Littleton. Legislators recognized that voluntary compliance wasn’t enough and that Colorado needed proactive, consistent oversight backed by real resources. Without that legislation, Davis Mortuary might have continued operating in the shadows, with families never knowing the truth about their loved ones.
This case highlights a broader truth: State employees are the frontline watchdogs protecting Coloradans and the backbone of public safety in our communities.
Whether it’s inspectors uncovering misconduct at a funeral home, engineers checking the safety of our bridges, scientists testing our drinking water, or workplace investigators ensuring fair and safe conditions, state employees are the frontline guardians between Coloradans and exploitation, neglect, systemic mistakes, and outright wrongdoing.
Yet too often, these watchdogs are asked to do more with less. They are stretched thin, working with insufficient staffing and inadequate tools. That makes it harder to catch problems early and harder still to prevent tragedies before they spiral out of control.
The governor recently announced a hiring freeze for state agencies due to the fiscal impacts of the recent federal tax and spending law, H.R. 1. This freeze will only make matters worse. With vacancy rates in state agencies already around 20%, many critical roles have gone unfilled for months.
The result is inspectors stretched thin, delayed oversight, and greater risk to public health and safety. As one Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment worker noted in an interview with KUNC, just three staff are overseeing more than 500 clinicians at Colorado’s safety net health centers due to unfilled roles in the department, a workload that makes it next to impossible to ensure essential protections. And that’s before the hiring freeze.
As the executive director of Colorado WINS, the union representing more than 27,000 state employees, I see firsthand the dedication these workers bring to their jobs. They don’t do this work for recognition. They do it because they believe in public service and in keeping our communities safe. But they need the resources, staffing, and support to match the weight of their responsibilities.
That’s why sustainable funding for state services is so important. The passage of HB-1335 was an acknowledgment by lawmakers that oversight matters, and that oversight requires funding. If we want safe, healthy communities, we need to continue investing in the services that safeguard Coloradans.
The lesson here is clear. If we want safe communities, if we want to protect families from exploitation, if we want to prevent disasters rather than respond to them after its too late, then we must invest in state services. That means full staffing levels and consistent funding for the workers who do critical jobs every day.

Getting health care when you need it can be the difference between life and death, between happiness and misery. It should be a right for everyone, especially in the richest country on earth.
But 78% of Americans say health care costs are a source of stress and that number is likely higher in Kentucky, where workers’ wages are lower and health is poorer.
At a time of rising costs for groceries, housing, electricity and more, keeping health care costs from spiking is essential. And that’s what the current standoff in Washington D. C. is in part about. The government has shut down because Congress and the president so far refuse to cancel looming cuts that will cause insurance premiums to skyrocket, take coverage from millions of Americans, and put rural hospitals and other providers at risk of closing.
The immediate threat comes Nov. 1. That’s when nearly 100,000 Kentuckians who get their health insurance through the Kynect marketplace will face sticker shock during open enrollment. Premiums are expected to increase nationally by 114% on average. Though exact price hikes will vary, examples include:

A family of three in Berea earning $50,000 a year will see monthly premiums jump from $63 to $250, an increase of $187 a month.
For a 60-year-old in Hopkinsville earning $62,700 a year, premiums will rise from $444 to $933, an increase of $489 a month.
For a family of five in Louisville earning $65,900 a year, costs will increase from $55 to $296 a month, a jump of $241.

Prices will skyrocket because subsidies put in place in 2021 to lower costs on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are set to expire. Congress failed to extend those subsidies this summer in HR 1, the budget megabill that makes major cuts to health care and food assistance while giving huge tax cuts to the wealthy.
A projected 18,000 Kentuckians will be priced out of Kynect as a result, and most of them will become uninsured. Because those most likely to forgo health insurance are younger and healthier on average, costs will also rise for everyone else.
The price spikes on Kynect are just the first step in a rolling health care disaster. HR 1 will create new red tape for Kentucky workers covered by Medicaid, taking health coverage away from an estimated 210,000 Kentuckians. In addition, the law shifts costs and burdens to the state budget and massively cuts payments to providers. That will threaten Medicaid cuts for all 1.5 million kids, seniors, people with disabilities and low-wage workers covered by the program. 
And it will put the very existence of health care at risk in some communities. Many providers depend on Medicaid payments to keep the doors open. Kentucky has 35 rural hospitals at risk of closure due to HR 1, the most of any state. 
Health care is among the key household costs that keep many working families awake at night. Too many people struggle in an economy where hard work no longer translates to middle-class comfort and peace of mind. Americans want their government to solve that problem, not make it worse.
That’s why a fight for health care in this country is essential. On the other side is the calm freedom that comes in knowing that care and security will be there for the scariest moments in life.

(Courtesy of campaign)On a Monday evening in early September, a mix of Virginia politicos and Washington regulars filed into Butterworth’s, the Capitol Hill newcomer profiled by Washingtonian this spring as “the MAGA crowd’s favorite D.C. restaurant.”
The Sept. 8 fundraiser for Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid — according to an invitation reviewed by The Mercury — billed former White House press secretary Sean Spicer and several current Qorvis executives, including Chief Executive Officer Matt Lauer, Chief Editorial Officer Samantha Sault and Managing Partner Grace Fenstermaker.
Tickets ranged from $35 for a happy hour to a $2,500 bundle with two dinner and four happy-hour admissions. The Washingtonian piece described Butterworth’s as a conservative social hub that opened just before the 2024 election, part of a shifting power-dining scene now that the old Trump Hotel is gone.

The setting and the hosts put a spotlight on a consequential line on Reid’s resume: his 2011–2014 stint as a partner — and registered foreign agent – at Qorvis, the Washington strategic communications shop whose client list has included foreign governments and politically connected figures abroad.
Qorvis in recent years has described itself as a global advisory firm “standing at the nexus of influence and capital,” with practice areas spanning “international communications,” “geopolitical intelligence & strategy,” and “public diplomacy,” and primary offices in Washington, Geneva and Dubai.
David Leblang, the Randolph Compton professor of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center of Public Affairs, said Qorvis has a history of representing foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 
“The firm has also worked for others, such as the governments of Libya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which have been criticized for human rights abuses,” he said. 
Reid’s campaign declined to answer nearly 30 detailed questions The Mercury sent about his duties, clients and any Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) filings during his Qorvis years.
Instead, the campaign supplied a written statement summarizing his tenure. 
“John Reid worked for Qorvis between 2011 and 2014. During that time, Reid worked on strategic communications for Qorvis clients,” the statement read. “Reid’s work at Qorvis consisted largely of public relations with foreign media, and no lobbying activity,” the campaign continued, saying that “as a former journalist,” his role “promoted transparency within the international press corps.”
The campaign also said Reid would, if elected, advocate that “all candidates for statewide office” disclose “their clients and foreign affiliations,” pointing specifically to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger’s past jobs “at the Islamic Saudi Academy in Northern Virginia and Royall and Company.”
Reid’s campaign did not respond to follow-up questions attempting to clarify some of his remarks.
Qorvis offered its own defense of its long-criticized foreign-influence work — and of Reid personally.
In an emailed statement, Sault, the company’s chief editorial officer, said that “John Reid was a respected, thoughtful leader during his tenure at Qorvis and has exemplified hard work and principled service throughout his career,” adding that “three Qorvis partners who have known John for more than a decade contributed personal funds to the September 8 fundraiser.”
The firm, Sault said, “is proud of its 25-year record of trusted client service and commitment to compliance and transparency.”
 Why Qorvis’s work draws scrutiny

Founded in 2000 and led by CEO Lauer after a management buyout in late 2022, Qorvis markets itself as a full-spectrum influence and advisory company. Its website further highlights capabilities in lobbying and government relations, as well as crisis and reputation management.
Public records, meanwhile, document substantial foreign-principal work by Qorvis over the years.
The Justice Department’s FARA e-filing system and OpenSecrets’ Foreign Lobby Watch show Qorvis repeatedly reporting representation of the government of Saudi Arabia, among others, with frequent informational materials and exhibit filings in 2018–2019 and beyond.
UVA’s Leblang said that voters concerned about human rights or U.S. complicity in authoritarian PR might see this as “a red flag, questioning if Reid’s experience normalized influence-peddling for repressive governments.” 
Seven years before Reid joined the firm, in December 2004, the FBI searched several Qorvis offices as part of a probe into the firm’s Saudi-related work — a memory that still colors coverage of the company.
The controversy intensified again in 2016–2017, when multiple outlets reported that Saudi-funded efforts — with Qorvis and a network of subcontractors in the mix — recruited U.S. military veterans to lobby against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), a law enabling 9/11 families to sue foreign governments.

In her statement, Sault tried to draw a bright line around compliance in this complex space.
“Qorvis complies fully with all Department of Justice requirements, including FARA,” she said. “All required information regarding past or present clients or employees is disclosed in public filings on the DOJ website, as required by law.”
That assertion aligns with the firm’s branded relaunch since the 2022 buyout, which emphasizes  transparency and market-intelligence offerings alongside traditional communications work.
 What Reid did — and didn’t do — at Qorvis

Pressed on his personal role, the statement from Reid’s campaign underscores what he says he didn’t do. “Neither Fiji nor Saudi Arabia were ever clients of Reid’s so he cannot speak to those projects.”
The campaign added that his portfolio “consisted largely of public relations with foreign media,” not lobbying.
But that narrow description contrasts with how Reid has characterized his work overseas. 
On a recent episode of The Jeff Katz Show, Reid said his background would help him “bring more business to Virginia,” adding: “Somebody like me who has been a partner in a major government relations firm and cut deals all around the world.”
Reid also addressed a specific allegation circulating that he was tied to Qorvis’s FARA-registered work for Fiji’s military-led government in the early 2010s.
“Out of an abundance of caution, Reid registered under FARA when he was being considered for a Fiji project,” the statement reads, “however, that contract ultimately went to others at the firm and Reid was not involved with the Fiji account in any shape or form.”
The documentary record confirms that Qorvis did FARA-registered work related to Fiji as a foreign principal in that era.
A Lowy Institute for International Policy analysis contemporaneous with Reid’s tenure reported that “the Fiji Government pays Qorvis Communications US$40,000 a month to provide ‘public relations services,’” as the Bainimarama administration attempted to recast its image following the 2006 coup and amid restrictions on civil liberties.
The U.S. Department of Justice’s public system also contains Qorvis supplemental statements and exhibits from the period. Reid’s assertion that he was “considered” but not ultimately assigned — and that he filed “out of an abundance of caution” — could be clarified by short-form filings, engagement letters or time logs, documents the campaign did not provide.
On other accounts, the record shows Qorvis connected to a French lawyer’s representation of Egyptian steel magnate Ahmed Ezz — a Mubarak-era power broker who faced a cascade of graft and money-laundering cases after the 2011 revolution.
Contemporary reporting chronicled Ezz’s prosecutions, including a seven-year sentence for money laundering in 2012.
The Mercury asked Reid whether he worked on any Egypt-related matter and what his tasks were if so; he did not respond to those specific questions.
But Reid has repeatedly described living in the region during and after his Qorvis years. 
On a 2017 episode of The Jeff Katz Show, he said, “for a couple of years I was living in Kuwait and in the Middle East.” And in 2018 remarks at a WRVA “Politics & Pints” event, he said he had “lived in the Middle East, in Kuwait and Dubai and Bahrain during the middle of the Arab Spring,” framing his views as informed by firsthand experience.
As recently as July 2025, while guesting on the John Fredericks Show, he prefaced commentary as “someone who has lived in the Middle East.” 
 The Khashoggi murder

The Saudi portfolio has been the most politically radioactive for Washington firms, especially after the Oct. 2, 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul — an assassination a U.N. special rapporteur later said the Saudi state bore responsibility for, citing “credible evidence” that warranted further investigation up the chain of command.
In the Oct. 18, 2018, WRVA segment reviewed by The Mercury, Reid urged “holding judgment” on Saudi Arabia as early reports emerged, while criticizing what he called “a very dishonest press corps.”
The Mercury asked Reid if his view changed as evidence mounted, but his campaign did not answer. Instead, Reid reiterated that neither Fiji nor Saudi Arabia were ever his clients, and that his Qorvis work was “public relations with foreign media” rather than lobbying.
“Reid’s role in a FARA-registered firm means he helped shape narratives for foreign interests in the U.S.,” UVA’s Leblang said.
He added that in  today’s climate of foreign election interference concerns — such as Russian or Chinese influence — this “could raise doubts about his judgment or potential conflicts in a high-profile state role like lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate and acts as a policy tiebreaker.”  
Leblang said that as a  conservative running on “restoring trust” and “defending values,” Reid’s early career, which includes interning for former President Ronald Reagan, “contrasts with mid-career work for regimes antithetical to those ideals.”
At the same time, Leblang cautioned that the Qorvis chapter “was over a decade ago, comprising just three years of Reid’s 30-plus year career,” noting that Reid left to work for the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and then moved into Virginia media.
“No scandals or violations are tied to Reid personally,” Leblang said, and “Qorvis’s FARA filings were standard for the industry; lobbying for foreign clients is legal and common in D.C.”

(Photo courtesy of A. Tate)Over 1,200 Northumberland County voters are trying to change how their school board is determined by shifting from an elected to an appointed system, continuing a trend of Virginians challenging the status quo of local school system oversight.
State law allows a locality to change how members are added to school boards via a ballot referendum. Since the pandemic, voters in some Virginia localities have called for boards to be selected by county leaders instead of elected by residents, linking school boards to controversial decisions about curriculum content, parental rights and control and transparency. Residents in the counties of Hanover, Southampton and the city of Franklin have expressed dissatisfaction with their school board’s actions and policy decisions.
Hanover School Board referendum measure likely defeated, school board to remain appointed

In Northumberland County, the attempt to change the school board membership determination system instead came down to money. Residents cited financial mismanagement, most notably the IRS slapping a $50,000 lien on school property for unpaid taxes, according to multiple reports. Others claimed property taxes increased because of the division’s mismanagement.
Patrick O’Brien, a county resident and one of the petitioners, said like other localities, the Northumberland County Board of Supervisors has “no role” in the management of the school system other than appropriating funds to the division. But “if the school board doesn’t control its spending and the Board of Supervisors finds out about (it), then there is nothing they can do except scold them for exceeding their budget,” he said.
“The school board has the Board of Supervisors over a barrel, and they know it, and they still spend money like it’s going out of style,” O’Brien said.
O’Brien, along with co-petitioner Jim Penney, successfully added the question to this year’s ballot by collecting 1,300 signatures from at least 10% of the registered electorate and presenting it to the circuit court.
Penney and O’Brien told the Mercury they filed their petition due to claims of significant financial woes and poor performance by the Northumberland County School Board. The two said the petition aimed to address overspending, lack of accountability, and declining school performance, which have overshadowed the dismissal of the superintendent and the resignation of the finance director.
“We’re all hoping and working towards changing this so that the Board of Supervisors will then be able to identify by way of public hearings and interviews and nominations from the public, to be able to identify people that they can appoint to a school board and hopefully put some stability back in this county,” Penney said.
Before 1992, nearly all of Virginia’s school boards were appointed by local governing bodies. That year, legislation carried by Del. Wendell Walker, R-Lynchburg, to change the law, passed, allowing local governments to hold a referendum on electing the boards.
The last effort to convert a Virginia school board from an appointed to an elected one was in Hanover County in 2023, and was unsuccessful. This year a proposal to require all school board candidates to be elected, not appointed, died in a Senate Education and Health subcommittee.
Currently, 11 school boards are appointed in Virginia: Franklin City, Galax City, Hanover County, Hopewell City, Lynchburg City, Manassas Park City, Martinsville City, Poquoson City, Richmond County, Roanoke City and Salem City. ​Williamsburg-James City County has a hybrid board, which has two appointed members from Williamsburg and five elected members from James City.
The Mercury contacted members of Northumberland’s school board for comment, but none of the five responded. 
 Concerns with the referendum

While a sufficient number of voters signed on the petition to launch the referendum, some residents, including military veteran Jim Henderickson, are concerned the change could take away voters’ right to choose their own candidate. 
The petitioners said that most school board races have gone unopposed for many years, calling voters’ right to choose “meaningless,” O’Brien added.
Hendrickson said while in military service he helped many countries around the world with voting and taught about representation in elections. The idea of taking away voters’ ability to select an elected body is surprising, he said. 
“I find it just absolutely unbelievable that I’m now in a community that’s trying to get people to vote, to take away their own vote,” Hendrickson said. “The whole idea of ‘please vote to take away your right to vote’ just seems so unpatriotic and un-American to me, and just antithetical to anything I thought was American.”
Other residents, including former educator Amy Lamb, said they are concerned the school board won’t be diverse enough.
Lamb’s concern comes after O’Brien wrote in an Aug. 15 op-ed titled “Fire The School Board” that with a vote of “yes,” the county can create a school board containing “finance and accounting experts” who can be recommended to the Board of Supervisors.
A school board should have diverse talents and interests, Lamb argued.
More districts leave Virginia School Board Association

“I don’t think these people realize that a school board does more than manage a budget,” Lamb said. “They make decisions about children’s futures and they make decisions about educational programming. So I think you need a variety of perspectives to bring to a school board.”
The Mercury reached out to a handful of localities that appoint school board members to learn more about the selection process, including Richmond County, the closest to Northumberland, and Hanover County, as well as the cities of Franklin and Roanoke.
Most processes involve submitting an application and a resume before a candidate is selected. 
Regardless of the outcome, Hendrickson said the county should hire a competent accountant to manage both the school and county budgets, thereby preventing any further issues. He said residents should also consider the Board of Supervisors’ competence because “they’re the ones that are supervising the school board and the superintendent of schools.”
 What’s next

No other locality in the commonwealth is holding a referendum on changing the determination of school boards in the 2025 General Election. An attempt to convert the Franklin City School Board to an elected board has been unsuccessful, so it failed to be included on the statewide list of referendums.
In Virginia, early in-person voting began on Sept. 19 and ends Nov. 1. The ballot will feature candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and the House of Delegates.
Austin Schmidt, vice president for the Northumberland County Electoral Board, said the office has processed around 700 ballots out of approximately 10,500 registered voters as of Tuesday afternoon. The number of mail-in ballots are unknown.
Schmidt said anecdotally the turnout is up “above average” compared to four years ago.
“We’re very pleasantly surprised people are taking advantage of the early voting opportunity,” Schmidt said. “The legislature mandated it and we’re going by the law.”

There’s still almost a month before voting concludes in Virginia’s gubernatorial election. That’s a lot of time in the fast-moving business of politics, and things often take unexpected turns.
Maybe Democrats and Republicans will have a divine pre-election breakthrough and resolve the seething dispute behind the government closure that feels more personal than political.
It’s not impossible, but I’m more likely to win the Nobel Prize, a best actor Oscar and “Dancing With the Stars” before you see that.
Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears had two strikes against her before she ever stepped into the batter’s box this year, and neither was of her making.
One is the fact that the party in charge of the White House has won the governorship of Virginia just once in the past 52 years (that happened in 2013, when Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected governor into President Barack Obama’s second term).
Another is the abysmal record Republicans have in Virginia statewide races when Trump is either president or on the ballot. He is winless in three races in the commonwealth, and the same is true for Republicans seeking statewide office during that time.
Coincidence? Hardly.
Consider how fast attitudes changed four years ago with Trump defeated and exiled to Mar-a-Lago — seemingly for good, many thought at the time. A year after Democrat Joe Biden beat Trump by 10 percentage points in Virginia, Republican gubernatorial candidate and political neophyte Glenn Youngkin upset McAuliffe, who wanted his old job back. In 2021, the GOP won all three statewide offices plus the House of Delegates.
In Trump’s second term, he has already left a redder welt on Virginia’s backside. About 300,000 Virginians owe their livelihoods to the U.S. government, so the state suffers more than most from cuts to federal employment, programs, projects and contracts by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. The Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia projects that Virginia will lose 32,000 jobs under those cuts alone.
Now comes the shutdown and warnings from the Trump administration that it will go beyond the employee furloughs customary in shutdowns and make permanent “reductions in force” — bureaucratic jargon for firings. That was clear in an Office of Management and Budget memo a week ago (first reported by Politico) and from Trump’s own threats hours before the shutdown began at midnight Oct. 1.

“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible and bad for them, like cutting vast numbers of people out,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday. “Cutting things they like, cutting programs they like.”
With the government shuttered and unable to pay bills for a protracted period, the administration can launch a firing spree resembling DOGE on meth and steroids. Two weeks into early voting in Virginia, that’s the last thing Republican candidates want voters to see.
“I see this as blame going right to the top, as it usually does,” said Mark Rozell, a political scientist and dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University.
“Leaving the merits aside of who’s at fault here, the plain fact is various (Trump) administration actions toward the federal government have set the framework for how Virginians think about the impact of Republican policies in the state,” he said.

The shutdown became inevitable after Democrats in the closely divided Senate on Tuesday evening denied the GOP majority the 60 votes needed to extend federal funding into November. They demanded Republicans drop provisions in Trump’s recently passed budget — the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates will strip 16 million Americans of health insurance coverage by 2034. Neither side is budging.
The GOP, however, has to make a more nuanced argument that’s difficult in the heat of a political campaign, Rozell said. Or, to borrow a shopworn bromide from longtime campaign pros, “If you’re explaining, you’re losing.”
And this explanation withers further because it involves depriving affordable medical coverage for the self-employed and others who lack employer-provided health insurance. Imagine peddling that position north of the Rappahannock — home to Virginia’s richest trove of moderate suburban voters, many of them federal workers facing job losses and unaffordable health coverage because of GOP-ordered layoffs and tax policy changes.
The timing of this crisis adds more difficulty for Earle-Sears and her ticketmates by forcing the GOP to do damage control on the fly while the shutdown worsens economic chaos through weeks of early voting.
Federal shutdowns are not new to Trump. He presided over American history’s longest — 35 days from December 2018 into January 2019, resulting in 320,000 furloughs as 420,000 “essential workers” labored unpaid for weeks, right through the holidays — after congressional Democrats denied him $5.7 billion for a border wall.
Ten months afterward, in General Assembly midterm elections, Virginians awarded both legislative chambers to the Democrats. It was the first time since 1968 that the party held unchallenged control of every statewide elective office or institution of government in Virginia, including both U.S. Senate seats and seven of its 11 U.S. House seats.
For some voters, especially in conservative-voting rural areas, this shutdown may be little more than an afterthought. That tracks with a fresh New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,313 registered voters nationwide in which 19% blamed Democrats, 26% faulted the GOP, but 33% held both parties equally liable.
Voters in Northern Virginia, however, recall the previous shutdown and this one, which is more acrimonious, likely to last longer and be more ruinous.
That won’t help Republicans shrug off culpability in Virginia, Rozell said.
“The existing framework in which most Virginians are blaming the Trump administration’s actions makes it really difficult to make the case that this shutdown is on the Democrats,” he said. “If it looks like Republicans can’t govern at the top, why are voters going to trust them in state or local elections?”
Neither Earle-Sears nor her ticketmates caused this shutdown. She has, however, dutifully genuflected to Trump policies throughout her campaign. She aligns herself with his One Big Beautiful Bill with its Medicaid restrictions and sharply higher costs for health insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — the reason Senate Democrats blocked the short-term spending bill.
Spanberger’s campaign, predictably, is exploiting that, tying it to Virginians’ rising costs and mounting economic pain — this election’s bedrock issue.
But was slighting the famously vindictive Trump ever an option for Earle-Sears?
In a once-grand old party that has become another Trump property, no Republican wants to be the next Bob Good.

(Photo by Tim Henderson/Stateline)Editor’s note: If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.
For Gen Z adults, the oldest of whom are now reaching their late 20s, suicide is taking more lives than 10 years ago when millennials were the same age, according to a Stateline analysis of federal death statistics.
The bulk of the increase, 85%, is among Black and Hispanic men, many in Southern and Midwestern states.
Experts disagree on the root causes of the growth in suicides, but they see a wave of untreated depression that can lead to suicidal thoughts, one that affected all age groups after the Great Recession but lingers on among young adults, especially non-white men.
Theories behind the increase range from bullying on social media, since Gen Z was the first generation to grow up with the internet, to economic despair, to cultural resistance to seeking help for depression.
Gen Z suicides have continued at a fast pace this year, with 1,148 in January and February, the latest months available from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about the same as in 2024. The CDC bases its data on death certificates.
Among those grappling with the crisis is Rodney Harris of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who has enlisted barbers and churches in his state to draw out stories of personal pain before they lead to a suicidal crisis. Harris is an associate professor in the school’s Suicide Prevention Institute.
He’s fighting a perception that you can shake off mental health issues on your own.
“The research tells us that we have got to find a live person to go to them, particularly Black and brown kids, because if we don’t, they’ll get lost,” said Harris. “There’s a perception that you’re going to be strong and not complain about things, and that can keep you away from treatment.”

Some visible signs of the crisis have shaken communities in recent weeks.
A bridge in majority-Hispanic Taos County, New Mexico, closed to pedestrians in September after a rash of suicides, including that of a teenager less than two weeks ago.
Also in September: A Black 21-year-old student hanged himself from a tree on a Mississippi university campus, authorities said, in a case that raised fears of lynching before his death was ruled a suicide.
For Julian “Wolf” Rivera, who died at 27 in 2019 in suburban Middletown, New York, there was a combination of issues, his mother said: pressure to support a growing family with a second child on the way, a night job in a warehouse that he found unfulfilling, discrimination he felt because of his Hispanic background despite being born and raised nearby by parents with a Puerto Rican heritage.
Rivera also struggled to accept and then to find help for his mental health issues, said his mother, Jessie Edmond.
“He was diagnosed with depression. He used to get angry. ‘Why? Why do I need medicine to be normal?’” Edmond said. “He would take medicine, go to therapy, feel better and say, ‘I don’t need medicine anymore.’ When he was in crisis he finally reached out, but nobody was taking patients. No one called him back.”
Overdose deaths are rising among Black and Indigenous Americans

Like many states, New York is facing the unexpected loss of millions of dollars for mental health programs as part of cutbacks by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency task force. Federal grants for mental health crisis teams and drug treatment were cut by $88 million in April, and more cuts are feared as President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes effect.
Among other things, the federal government in July ended an LGBTQ+-specific suicide helpline for people under 25.
A growing awareness of the suicide problem among young people led to federal responses, including a 2019 Congressional Black Caucus report on suicide among young Black people. But some of those programs are facing setbacks under the new Trump administration, and they could disappear or be forced to rely more on already stressed state funding.
More despair
Suicides increased among Asian, Black, Hispanic and Native young adults, according to the Stateline analysis, with Native people having the highest rate in both 2014 and 2024. The number of suicides dropped slightly for white people, but increased as a rate because population fell as Gen Z took over the age bracket from the more numerous millennial generation.
Suicide became the second-highest cause of death for young Hispanics, surpassing homicide, and became the No. 1 cause of death for young Asians, surpassing accidents. Men have the highest rates, especially Black and Hispanic men, who together account for 85% of the total increase in suicide, 822 of 965.
Young white adults had a higher suicide rate in 2014 than Black or African American people, but by 2024 the rate for young Black adults was higher. Men have the highest suicide rates but the rate for women is growing faster, from about one-fifth of the rate for men to one-fourth in 2024.
The largest increases in suicide rates for the age group were in Georgia (up 65%), North Carolina and Texas (up 41%), Alabama (up 39%) and Ohio (up 37%).
The highest rate is in Alaska, which was also highest in 2014, up 34% to a rate of 49 suicides per 100,000 population, followed by New Mexico and Montana. The lowest rate was in New Jersey, with a rate of 6.9, a decrease of 31% since 2014, when it was ranked No. 47 behind California, New York and Massachusetts.
Harris’ work in North Carolina was part of the federal Black Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative, under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The state, along with others, also used a one-year federal grant to enhance access to mental health services for young people.
North Carolina’s health department has pledged to continue the work, Harris said. The state “remains committed to providing resources to communities which have been marginalized and where mental health challenges persist,” a state health department spokesperson, James Werner, told Stateline in a statement.
The federal initiative was formed to reduce suicides among Black young people and children, with 15 states and the District of Columbia chosen to make state-specific policy plans: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
North Carolina and Minnesota have released action plans based on the program. And other states have also taken action: Louisiana created promotional campaigns to reach young people at a rivalry college football game, and Oregon developed a youth-led suicide prevention coalition with matching funds from the state health department.
Junk food and drug use cut into life expectancy gains for states

Georgia stands out for the biggest change in youth suicides; they rose 70% to 311 deaths in 2024. The state used two federal programs, the youth suicide prevention initiative and one from the U.S. Office of Minority Health to the medical school at Morehouse School of Medicine, to look for policy solutions to high suicide rates.
A report from the medical school outlining policy recommendations is nearing completion, said Susan McLaren, an assistant project director with the Georgia Health Policy Center at Georgia State University, which is evaluating the ideas.
The medical school is embracing the concept of “nothing about us without us” that brings in young people to lead decision-making about suicide prevention policies, McLaren said.
“The current crisis among our Black youth is a result of many things: stigma, lack of resources and treatment, and insufficient focus on creating safe spaces and dialogue to prevent and intervene in mental health challenges,” McLaren said.
McLaren declined comment on funding issues, but the staff at the Office of Minority Health, which provided the Morehouse grant, has reportedly been slashed in a Trump administration reorganization.
Another federal program at SAMHSA, the Garrett Lee Smith State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention and Early Intervention Program, gives grants of up to $735,000 to states and tribes to fight youth suicide. The program is named for the son of Republican U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon. The younger Smith died the day before his 22nd birthday in 2004.
‘No one magic answer’
The overall crisis in suicide among youth has long puzzled researchers, but it’s associated with an increase in untreated depression, said Dave Marcotte, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., who wrote about the crisis in 2023 for the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Suicide rates for all age groups fell for decades before rising again starting in 2000, Marcotte said, and getting worse in the Great Recession. Rates for middle-aged people fell back again, but for young people the crisis never abated, he said.
“There’s likely no one magic answer to this,” Marcotte said. “Future job prospects for this generation are not what they were for older generations. Today’s generation is not guaranteed a position in society that’s better than their parents. That’s one hypothesis.”











Today’s generation is not guaranteed a position in society that’s better than their parents.


– Dave Marcotte, American University professor



Another theory: Those born after 1995, including Gen Z adults, are the first to spend their entire adolescence with smartphones and social media. Substituting in-person socializing with bullying-prone online chatting is a prime cause of young depression, said Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University, who wrote an influential 2017 article in The Atlantic with the headline “Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?”
Heavy users of social media are more likely to be depressed, Twenge told Stateline, even among marginalized groups. And politics seems to play little part, she argues. In a post this May, Twenge noted that increases in Black and Hispanic depression began in 2012, as President Barack Obama was about to be elected to a second term, and well before Donald Trump was elected for the first time.
That same year, though, saw virulently racist memes and hate speech become increasingly widespread on Facebook and Twitter as Obama ran for reelection.
Researcher Jonathan Haidt added another reason why today’s youth might face more mental health challenges: When they were children, parents became more leery of letting them play unsupervised as fears of kidnapping and abuse increased. So they spent less time learning to interact face-to-face and more time in an adult online world they weren’t prepared to handle.
“These two trends — overprotection in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world — are the major reasons why children born after 1995 became the anxious generation,” wrote Haidt, a professor at New York University, in his 2024 book “The Anxious Generation.”

When he served as a Republican House lawmaker, he spearheaded the 2018 effort to insert a right to privacy in the state constitution. And he helped author the law keeping voter information confidential.
Now, Kurk has taken on a new cause: Defending New Hampshire from demands by the Trump administration to access that information. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice sued New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan to compel him to turn over the state’s voter registration file, which contains every voter’s name, address, voting history, and party affiliation. 
State officials have not yet responded to the lawsuit. But Kurk and three other New Hampshire residents are seeking to insert themselves into the lawsuit, arguing they have an interest in its outcome as registered voters concerned about their privacy. 
In a court motion filed Tuesday, Kurk, Portsmouth Attorney Christopher Cole, former Democratic state representative Bob Perry, and liberal activist Louise Spencer have asked to intervene in the litigation, which would allow the group to file its own motions asking the judge to strike down the lawsuit. 
“DOJ’s demands not only run roughshod over federalism principles and New Hampshire law — they spurn Proposed Intervenors’ privacy rights,” the motion, brought by Steven Dutton of McLane Middleton, attorney Paul Twomey, and the Elias Law Group reads. 
Late Tuesday, U.S Magistrate Judge Andrea Johnston granted a request by the federal government to pause the lawsuit until the end of the federal government shutdown; the case is expected to eventually resume.
The lawsuit against Scanlan came after he declined the Trump administration’s written requests to provide the voter information. 
The U.S. Department of Justice says it needs each state’s voter file to review whether those states are adequately removing voters not eligible to vote. In a letter sent to the Trump administration earlier this year, Scanlan said he is forbidden from doing so by state law, which stipulates that the voter file remain private except to political parties, political committees, or candidates for elected office who request it.
In its lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice argued it is empowered to request the voter files from states in order to enforce the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The government has also cited the Civil Rights Act of 1960 to claim the authority to demand the voter files.
But Cole, Kurk, Perry, and Spencer say those laws do not provide that authority, and argue there is no precedent to allow the government to require that the data be handed over.
The group of residents also argue their privacy could be violated if the court grants the federal government’s request. Some said they worried the Trump administration could use the records of New Hampshire party registrations to exact revenge against residents. 
In a written declaration, Spencer, who is the co-founder of the Kent Street Coalition, a liberal advocacy group, said she worried the group could find it harder to recruit voters who might fear they will be targeted. 
“… Many of our volunteers are alarmed and concerned by the prospect of an overbearing federal government gaining access to their personal information. I am concerned that Department of Justice’s effort at mass data collection from New Hampshire voters discourages Kent Street Coalition’s members from civic engagement for fear of retaliation or scrutiny,” she wrote. 
Kurk, meanwhile, said handing over the voter file would violate the privacy laws he had fought to pass. 
“The New Hampshire Constitution’s right to privacy was the culmination of years of work,” he wrote in his own declaration. “My constituents prized their privacy and shared my view that we should have control over our own personal, private information.”
He added that he worried that confidence in elections could be undermined if the federal government obtained the file. And he raised questions about whether the Trump administration would “adhere to proper privacy safeguards and laws if it does obtain New Hampshire’s voter registration list.”
Kurk, who led a three-decade legislative career, has challenged the Trump administration over privacy rights before. In 2017, during the first Trump administration, Kurk helped sue the state to stop then-Secretary of State Bill Gardner from giving the White House the voter file as part of Trump’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. After facing that lawsuit, Lasky v. Gardner, Gardner ultimately agreed to restrict the information passed on to that commission.
It is not clear when Johnston might rule on whether to add the four residents to the lawsuit as intervenors, given the current pause on the lawsuit during the shutdown. 
But in order to qualify as intervenors, they must show that they have an interest in the litigation, that that interest could be threatened by the litigation, and that no other party currently represents that interest. In their motion, they argue that the interests of registered voters in New Hampshire are not necessarily represented by the Secretary of State’s Office.
New Hampshire is not the only state not cooperating with the Trump administration’s requests for voter files. The agency has filed separate lawsuits against eight states that have refused to give that data, including California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.
But New Hampshire is the only state on that list with a Republican governor, Kelly Ayotte, and a Republican secretary of state. In their motion, the residents argued that the Ayotte administration could have a political incentive to strike a settlement with the Trump administration, which could put the secretary of state’s interest at odds with the residents’ interests.
Meanwhile, speaking on the Trump administration Scanlan told Stateline that he doesn’t “really have strong feelings about where this goes,” the motion notes. 
“The fact that the State’s chief election officer has already indicated that he does not perceive these rights as being as essential raises a strong risk that the existing Defendants will not litigate the case as vigorously as Proposed Intervenors,” the lawsuit states.
The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday about the motion to intervene.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/votinglistkurk-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-02 05:56:50.686552

A Republican lawmaker introduced a bill this week that would require Ohio public schools to show a video about fetal development to students starting in the third grade. 
State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland, introduced Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act.” The three-minute Meet Baby Olivia video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.

“This legislation does not deal with abortion at all,” claimed Miller, who also serves as the Ashland Pregnancy Care Center executive director. “This deals with the science of human development. … We’re hoping that we can change the culture to be celebrating life instead of destroying life.”
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
“Students should learn the science around human reproduction, but those lessons should also include medically accurate and comprehensive information that is proven to encourage teens to delay the start of sexual activity until later in life and give them the tools to prevent unintended pregnancy and plan how to start a family when they are ready to do so,” Abortion Forward Executive Director Kellie Copeland said in a statement.
“This propaganda video full of misinformation is the opposite of that.”
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. Ohio voters passed a ballot measure in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.
“I fully expect that those who will be in opposition to this bill will try to delegitimize it, and they will refer to it as propaganda, among other things,” said Right to Life Action Coalition of Ohio President Kate Makra. “The dehumanization of the unborn child must fail.”
The minimum the bill requires is showing either the Baby Olivia video or an ultrasound video at least three minutes long. A school district could choose to do something extensive, Miller said. 
“The video would feature detailed animations of ultrasound imagery showcasing the early stages of human development in the womb, including the formation of critical organs like the brain, the heart, and the limbs,” Miller said. 
“This visual resource is designed to be scientifically accurate, engaging and appropriate for classroom settings, fostering a deeper appreciation for the complexity of human life.”
The bill would require the video to be shown to students every year starting in third grade through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year. 
“As you get older, your questions may evolve and your understanding may evolve,” Miller said. “So why not (show the video each year)? What is the harm? Three minutes is not very long in health class.” 
The video would be mandated in any public school course covering human growth, development, or sexuality, Miller said. 
“The miracle of life is not something that can be easily explained,” she said. “So why don’t we provide a scientifically accurate depiction of the human development process so that our students have a fuller, more complete understanding?”
Similar bills have been introduced in more than 20 other states so far this session and Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, Tennessee, Iowa, and Indiana have enacted similar bills into law. 
The Ohio Department of Education and Workforce would conduct annual audits to verify the school district is meeting the bill’s requirements of showing the video.
Advance notification would be given to parents ahead of time before the video is shown in class so they would have the option to opt their student out of watching the video. 
Ohio does not have a comprehensive set of health education standards, but stresses abstinence-only sex education. 
“Abstinence is very important that we are educating in our schools,” Miller said.

MONTPELIER — A rambling Victorian house a few blocks south of downtown will soon become the Capital City’s first year-round shelter for people experiencing homelessness. 
The nonprofit Good Samaritan Haven had searched long and hard for the right property to establish a new Montpelier shelter. The site needed to be out of the floodplain, said Julie Bond, the organization’s executive director, so the nonprofit wouldn’t need to evacuate its guests when floodwaters rose — a frequent dilemma at Good Sam’s shelter in nearby Barre.

The organization has run a winter-only shelter for several years at the former Elks Club property in Montpelier, but the operation was difficult to access on foot and residents needed to leave during the day. And the need for shelter in town was evident beyond the coldest months of the year.
When the old Victorian came on the market in the spring, the organization leapt at the opportunity. But remodeling the building into a suitable home for 18 unhoused guests has proved its own saga. Bond estimated the renovations will be complete in January or February.
“We’re just truly hoping … that we don’t lose as much of the winter as, you know, is possible,” she said.
The new shelter beds can’t come quickly enough. Vermont’s rate of homelessness remains at a record high, and a greater share of people experiencing homelessness in the state now live outdoors. Encampments have cropped up in parks and in the woods from Burlington to Brattleboro, prompting clashes with neighbors. Montpelier has been no exception — city officials removed an encampment from a riverfront park in July after an assault occurred there.

Meanwhile, the long-running scale-back of the state’s motel voucher program places more pressure on local shelter providers to open up beds before temperatures begin to plummet.
Shelter plans span the state
A number of other shelter providers are hurrying to open their doors before snow begins to fall. 
In Burlington, the Committee on Temporary Shelter is wrapping up a shelter expansion project at a former federal building on Pearl Street. The organization ran the site as a seasonal shelter last winter, but has since renovated the building to add more beds and more privacy for guests, according to Jonathan Farrell, the organization’s executive director. 
COTS plans to relocate guests from a different shelter location to the Pearl Street site in early November, and aims to ramp up to full capacity — for 56 people — by early December, Farrell said.

In Rutland, BROC Community Action plans to open a new year-round shelter site by January, according to Eric Maguire, the social service organization’s director of shelter programming. (Maguire also represents Rutland City as a Republican in the Vermont House, and serves on the Human Services committee, which oversees homelessness policy. He said he does not see “any conflict of interest” between his roles.)
BROC is renovating a space at the back of its existing building near the Rutland Amtrak station to accommodate the new shelter, which will have 10 beds, Maguire said. Stays will be limited to three months — with possible extensions as guests search for long-term housing — and residents will need to meet a sobriety requirement, Maguire said. 
A shelter geared toward serving families with children will soon reopen at the Waterbury Armory, according to Lily Sojourner, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity within the Department for Children and Families. DCF had used the location as a family shelter — operated by an out-of-state contractor — following a round of evictions from the motel voucher program last fall. It ceased operations there in June.
The nonprofit Lamoille Community House will run the Armory shelter this winter, according to Sojourner. Another family shelter, in Brattleboro, aims to reopen this winter with the aid of a surprise donation.

State officials are also seeking to expand options for communities to open short-term shelters during extreme cold weather events, Sojourner said. Burlington has used this model in recent years, operating shelters for a couple days at a time when temperatures reach a certain threshold. 
Vermont Interfaith Action is administering about $1 million in state funds for the initiative, Sojourner said. State officials will work closely with the organization to determine subgrantees over the next few weeks. The goal is to have the capacity to run these extreme cold weather shelters in about six regions around the state, Sojourner said.
Number of beds versus number in need
The state has steadily increased shelter space in recent years, as officials and legislators have sparred over downsizing the motel program, which has sheltered the bulk of Vermont’s unhoused population since the pandemic. As of late August, the state’s shelter system had capacity for 585 households, according to a recent state report. New year-round expansions plus seasonal shelter beds mean that capacity should swell by about 100 beds in the coming months if projects proceed according to plan, said Sojourner.
Still, that leaves Vermont’s shelter beds numbering in the hundreds — while the state’s unhoused population registers at over 4,500 people, according to one tally in June.

In Montpelier, a local church began hosting a small encampment on its property this summer after city officials cleared tents from a park a few hundred yards away. Now, Christ Episcopal Church leaders are biding their time before Good Sam’s long-awaited shelter opens its doors after the turn of the year — and wondering what will happen to campers who haven’t found another option before then.
“If we get to the end of October, into the middle of November … there will be a challenge for whoever’s left here about where they will find housing,” said Rev. Walter Brownridge, the church’s priest. “It won’t be possible for us, beyond the first real snow … I don’t think it’s safe for them to be out in that cold weather.”

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). When Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine in March signed Ohio Senate Bill 1, some students and faculty members predicted the state’s colleges and universities would lose enrollment and prestige. And people have lost jobs and students have departed because it mandates an end to diversity programs and the termination of majors with few graduates.
But in a survey, a panel of Ohio economists was split on whether the law will reduce enrollment over the long run and whether it will leave us with a less-educated workforce.
While it avoids using the pejorative acronym “DEI,” S.B. 1 bans efforts to ensure that diverse groups have access to higher education. 
It also places new restrictions on faculty tenure, which protects faculty from termination without cause. The idea behind tenure is to protect professors’ right to say what they think — regardless whether it’s unpopular with certain groups.
The bill also requires students to take a civics course focused on capitalism.
Ohio Sen. Casey Weintstein, D-Hudson, said the bill undermines the academic freedom essential to top-level research and instruction. 
“Senate Bill 1… is a direct attack on the academic independence that has long been essential to the success of our state’s public higher education system,” Weinstein wrote in February. 
“This bill, which bans diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in higher education, along with curtailing tenure protections and collective bargaining power, sends a chilling message to students, faculty, and businesses that Ohio is not committed to fostering academic and institutional freedom.”

Students threatened to leave the state if S.B. 1 became law. Now that it has, Ohio University and Ohio State University have reported enrollment increases. 
However, Signal Cleveland in August reported that all colleges and universities could lose big numbers of international students due to the Trump administration’s harsh policies toward noncitizens.
When Scioto Analysis surveyed 18 economists on the matter, a good portion of them said that many factors other than Senate Bill 1 go into students’ enrollment decisions. 
Asked whether they agreed that, “The restrictions in SB 1 will reduce long-term enrollment in Ohio’s public universities,” eight agreed, six disagreed and four were uncertain.
Writing in the comments section of the survey, Kevin Egan of the University of Toledo seemed to speak for many of his colleagues.
“There are so many factors that determine college enrollment,” he said. “I don’t see SB 1 topping the list of factors. The usual factors: cost of tuition, state of the economy, and expected earnings returns from college.”
Similarly, Charles Kroncke of Mount St. Joseph University wrote, “Many choose public universities because of cost and major, not political ideology.”
However, Bill LaFayette of Regionomics said S.B. 1 could be seen as part of a pattern by the General Assembly, which has sometimes shown itself to be well to the right of Ohio voters. 
For example, it passed harsh abortion restrictions that, after they were briefly in force in 2022, voters shut down with a constitutional amendment that passed in 2023 by nearly 14 percentage points.
LaFayette said some of the legislature’s acts might repel people from coming.
“One of many initiatives of the General Assembly telegraphing that Ohio is an unwelcoming state,” he wrote of S.B. 1.
The economists were similarly mixed when asked if they agreed that, “The restrictions in SB 1 will lead to a less educated state workforce in the long-run.” 
Nine agreed, four disagreed, and four were uncertain. 
Jonathan Andreas of Bluffton University, wrote that S.B. 1 might not have very big consequential impacts, but it could leave a bad taste in the mouths of many.
“I doubt it will have a big effect, but it will be harder to attract talented faculty and students if this reduces free speech on campus and politicians start dictating what all students must be taught about the history of capitalism,” he said.

MARIETTA, Ohio — After issues with underground migration of toxic fracking waste, the state has established new rules to protect human health and the environment. Those rules haven’t been applied to multiple applications for new southeast Ohio injection wells from a company with ties to an Ohio senator.
The new rules followed a 2019 incident that upended the Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ assumptions about underground geology.  The underground migration of toxic fracking waste is especially pronounced throughout southeast Ohio.
Environmental activists in the region warned of the problem for years: Fracking waste injected underground at high pressures might eventually crack or otherwise find its way through the geologic formations meant to contain it, threatening water supplies, health, and the environment.
In 2019, fracking waste was found in oil and gas production wells that were more than five miles from a Washington County injection well.
Among other contaminants, this waste (known as brine) often contains PFAS – chemicals linked to birth defects and increased risk of cancer – as well as radioactive waste that can remain in the environment for thousands of years and cause bone, liver and breast cancers.

The ODNR Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management “did not [previously] contemplate that injected fluid could migrate in the manner described” by their investigation into the brine migration observed in 2019, according to a 2023 division order.
ODNR did not find evidence of drinking water contamination in that investigation, though the migration did disrupt oil and gas production wells. The company at issue modified its injection well and later resumed operations.
The division later suspended several other injection wells in southeast Ohio, including four in Athens County and two in Noble County. The division found that each of these wells posed a risk to human health and the environment, while also disrupting oil and gas production.
As a result of underground migration issues, ODNR stopped issuing permits for new injection wells into the Ohio Shale, the geologic layer into which all the problem wells injected waste.
The division also began considering additional regulatory action after the Washington County incident.
The division rewrote in full the administrative rules that govern the Class II injection wells used to store fracking waste underground. The new rules went into effect Jan. 13, 2022.
Since then, however, the division has approved permits for three new injection wells under the old rules, including one in Trumbull County that has since expired and two in Washington County. It’s using old rules for at least two additional wells under consideration in the region, too.
The division says the old rules apply because the initial applications for the wells were submitted prior to the rule change.
Four of the five wells approved or under consideration are located in southeast Ohio — and are owned by DeepRock Disposal Solutions, a company with ties to Ohio Senator Brian Chavez (R-30).
Until last year, Chavez served as DeepRock’s CEO. He still maintains ties to the company. Signal Ohio reported that Chavez’s spouse organized a DeepRock representative to appear at a Marietta City Council meeting.
In Washington County, new wells have been met with fierce opposition from a broad coalition of local governments, residents, oil and gas producers and state representatives. Former Democratic Athens County Commissioner and environmental activist Roxanne Groff described their fight as a “Washington County uprising.”
 Division says wells are safe, references rules that aren’t being followed

State Rep. Kevin Ritter (R-94) and ODNR Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management Chief Eric Vendel discussed concerns over new Washington County injection wells in a July email exchange that the Independent obtained through a public records request.
Assuring Ritter that the injection wells are safe, Vendel referenced the new rules, which he said have “strengthened permitting, construction, and operational requirements.”
However, the current rules in place to regulate Class II wells were not followed for the new wells that prompted concerns from Washington County residents.
The two injection wells approved this year in Washington County, both owned by DeepRock, could not have been approved under the current rules. They would have been considered too close to existing oil and gas production wells.
Specifically, the new injection wells operate in the same geologic layer as existing production wells, not owned by DeepRock, within a two-mile radius, according to the Independent’s review of available oil and gas well data.
In previous instances of brine migration, such production wells have been disrupted by nearby fracking waste injection wells and have provided pathways for fracking waste to travel upward, posing risk to human health and the environment.
DeepRock has had a history of issues with brine migration. Brine from one of its Noble County wells caused an environmental disaster in 2021, affecting multiple oil and gas production wells. DeepRock did not have to pay for the cleanup; the state initially paid the $1.3 million required and then sued the production company to recoup the cost.
Additionally, Washington County oil and gas producers allege that fracking waste stored by DeepRock is leaking underground and allege the brine is interfering with oil and gas production and poses a threat to drinking water.



ODNR issued a permit for DeepRock’s Stephan No. 1 well on Aug. 28. DeepRock submitted its application for a reissue permit to drill the well in December 2021, before the new rules regulating injection wells went into effect.
“The Stephan #1 well application to construct will be evaluated under the rules in effect at the time the application was submitted,” Karina Cheung, spokesperson for ODNR, told the Independent in an email. “Similarly, any future potential permit to inject would be evaluated under the rules in the Ohio Administrative Code during the time it was submitted.”
Activists, oil and gas companies and public officials alike decried the division’s decision to consider the well under the old permitting rules. Marietta City Council argued in a lengthy legal complaint to the division that its approach to permitting under outdated rules flies in the face of established case law.
Chueng said the division would “review Marietta City Council’s comments as part of the standard review process.” She also said the division had received feedback from the public regarding the well and that the division “read and considered each citizen’s concern.”
Those concerns evidently didn’t affect the division’s decision, however. It approved the Stephan No. 1 well under the old rules anyway.
Neither of the DeepRock wells permitted this year are yet operational, according to ODNR data. Meanwhile, the division is still weighing two additional DeepRock Disposal Solutions injection well applications under the old rules, one in Washington County and one in Noble County.
 DeepRock drags its feet

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nearly four years elapsed from DeepRock’s application for a reissue permit to drill the Stephan No. 1 well in 2021 and ODNR’s approval in August, an uncommonly long period.
The division has approved 18 new fracking waste injection well permits since 2021, according to ODNR data available online. On average, those permits were approved within 10 months of the application date. Some applications were approved in under a month.
Much of the approval timeline comes down to how quickly a company takes necessary steps to advance the process after it submits its initial permit application. For multiple DeepRock applications, ODNR extended deadlines for the company to meet necessary requirements.
In two cases, DeepRock’s initial permits to drill expired and the division considered reissue permits. It granted the Stephan No. 1 well’s reissue permit, and the other, for a Noble County well, remains pending.
DeepRock sent in the Noble County reissue application in January 2024 — well after the new rules were established. However, the division is continuing to evaluate it under the old rules. “Your original application was received prior to the new rules becoming effective,” the division told DeepRock in a May 6 email.
Groff said she thinks the company is receiving special treatment, perhaps due to its ties to Chavez, who represents Meigs, Athens, Morgan, Washington, Noble, Monroe, Belmont, Guernsey, Harrison and Jefferson counties in the Ohio Senate. Chavez chairs the Ohio Senate’s Energy Committee.
Chavez has used his platform as a state senator to speak against those targeting DeepRock, describing environmental nonprofit Buckeye Environmental Network as a “radical far left” and “California funded” organization.
Chavez did not respond to the Independent’s requests for comment for this story.
Chueng said the division notified DeepRock about its rule changes just as it notified all interested parties per Ohio law.
The fate of DeepRock’s pending Washington County application is unclear: DeepRock applied to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to inject non-hazardous waste into the well, and a DeepRock contractor told the Independent that the company no longer intends to use the well for fracking waste injection.
However, the division told the Independent that it was still evaluating DeepRock’s application to use the well for fracking waste, as of Aug. 21.
 Washington County governments react to well concerns

Putnam Community Water, which serves 950 households in Washington County, objected to the Stephan No. 1 well, expressing concerns about the water supply.
“We see a great potential in these injection wells causing significant harm to not only to our water supply but also the other community water systems that serve our Washington County Residents,” said Jay Huck, the Putnam Community Water manager, in an email to Chavez and ODNR representatives that the Independent obtained through a public records request.
Marietta City Council’s objection to the Stephan No. 1 well cited similar concerns about the numerous injection wells already operating and under consideration in Washington County.
“These wells, individually and as a group, create an unacceptable risk to the public health and safety of the 32,000 citizens served by four nearby and separately operated aquifers,” Marietta City Council wrote in its complaint to the division.
That complaint caused a conflict during a meeting of the Washington County Republican Party.
According to a report from Signal Ohio based on leaked audio also reviewed by the Independent, Marietta City Council President Susan Vessels got into an argument with Chavez about the danger posed by fracking waste.
During the argument, Chavez accused the Marietta City Council of “outrageous” behavior, claimed that Buckeye Environmental Network was hosting “fake town halls,” and said that Saudi Arabia and China are funding political opposition to natural gas.
In response, Vessels accused Chavez of a conflict of interest due to his connections to the oil and gas industry. Vessels also disputed Chavez’s claim that injection wells could safely contain brine.
Chavez and Vessels aren’t the only government figures having tense conversations over the new wells. In the July emails between Ritter and Vendel, Ritter expressed dissatisfaction with how Vendel and ODNR have been managing the proposed wells.
Ritter told Vendel that representatives of the Warren Community Water and Sewer Association reported to him that Vendel had expressed concern about the laws regulating wells. In response to this confusion, Ritter wrote:

“If you do have reservations with current safety law, someone with authority needs to know. The public and the people in the industry need to know. If you believe the public’s fears are unfounded then you need to say that publicly.
I am tired of getting thrown under the bus. For six years as County Commissioner I took calls from the public while ODNR sat in their offices. That is not a strategy designed to win public trust. Your agency is responsible for the oversight of these wells, not me.
I’d like to know if you believe the wells are safe, and if they are, what EXACTLY is your proactive plan to allay the fears of the public. My sole concern is the welfare of the residents of the 94th District. We all need to know whether your EXPERTS believe these wells are safe.”

In his emailed response to Ritter, Vendel denied telling the Warren Community Water and Sewer Association that he had concerns about the laws regulating wells and stated that the Division of Oil and Gas is “proactive in addressing potential issues with injection well operations.”
Vendel pointed to the current injection well rules as an example of the division’s work to ensure safety in his email to Ritter. He did not address the fact that those new rules were not applied to the most recent injection well approved in Washington County, and are not being applied to multiple pending DeepRock applications in the region.
Ritter later told the Independent in a phone interview that his frustration with ODNR’s communication around Washington County injection wells goes back to his time as a Washington County Commissioner.
“The board of commissioners made a formal request for a public meeting, and that was held at St. Ambrose church,” Ritter said. “I was deeply disappointed, because the first thing that came out in that meeting was a statement that said, ‘We’re not here to answer questions. We’re here to listen and we’ll answer those questions on our website at a later date.’ As you can imagine, that was very frustrating to the crowd.”
Ritter said ODNR has “experts that can take people’s questions, give them reliable information. Reliable information is the key to calming public fear, because ODNR has largely been absent on this issue. We do have significant public fear, and I lay that right at their feet.”
 Washington County residents and activists share their stories

Local residents gathered April 26 in the Warren High School auditorium for one of two town halls about new Washington County injection wells, organized by the Warren Community Water and Sewer Association. The town hall began with prepared remarks by local oil producers, retired scientists, environmental activists and community leaders.
Neither Chavez nor Ritter were present, although both were invited to attend. Warren Township Trustee Joe Vickers, who emceed the event, highlighted their absences with two empty chairs.

In his email to Vendel, Ritter said he had an unspecified prior commitment and that the organizers’ decision to highlight his absence with the chair caused him to decline future invites to the group’s town halls.
Both town halls featured a number of local figures who oppose how ODNR and the state government are managing fracking waste in the region.
Bob Wilson, a local natural gas professional who owns dozens of wells in Washington County, was among them. In 2022, he and local farmer and natural gas well owner Bob Lane filed suit against several injection well companies, including DeepRock. The case is currently under review by the Ohio Supreme Court.
At the first town hall April 26, Wilson said that ODNR and other state officials did not respond to his 2019 complaints until former state representative Jay Edwards contacted ODNR on his and Lane’s behalf. Edwards got Wilson and Lane a meeting, Wilson said, but ODNR continued to deny that fracking waste caused issues at his wells until its formal investigation of Washington County brine migration.
Lane and Wilson have continued to voice concerns about fracking waste contamination in the years since. Lane submitted an official complaint on behalf of numerous producers in 2024. The public records obtained by the Independent did not show any official follow-ups by the division on that complaint.
Wenda Sheard, an attorney and Ritter’s Democratic opponent in the last election, spoke at the April 26 town hall about the health risks posed by fracking waste. In an article published by the Yale School of Medicine, Nicole Deziel, a researcher on environmental contaminants, stated that numerous studies have linked fracking and fracking waste to “low birth weight, preterm births, congenital anomalies, asthma, and even childhood cancers.”
Residents at the April 26 town hall also noted increased seismic activity in the region. Earlier this year, Washington County experienced two earthquakes in one week, as reported by WOWK. Academic studies in Oklahoma and Texas have linked increased seismic activity to fracking and injection wells.
At another event hosted May 19 by the Warren Community Water and Sewer Association, water association trustee Steven Hutchinson said he was concerned about long-term damage to the aquifer. These concerns were shaped in part by the region’s experience with PFAS contamination of the Ohio River from DuPont’s Washington Works near Parkersburg, West Virginia.
“We have four wells that are in an aquifer along the Muskingum River not far from here, and could that brine water [in]filtrate them? Absolutely,” Hutchinson said. “That’s our biggest concern.”
State Rep. Tristan Rader (D-13) attended the May 19 meeting to hear from concerned residents about issues related to fracking waste, injection wells and carbon capture, after residents talked about their experiences with injection wells at a statehouse hearing on carbon capture.

Since his visit, Rader introduced House Bill 399, which would prohibit removal of oil and gas under Lake Erie or Ohio state parks. Rader also recently introduced House Bill 439 which, if passed, would prohibit the use of fracking waste on roads to melt ice and snow.
Ritter told the Independent that he would support HB 439, calling it “common sense legislation.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/KB5A8336-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-02 04:56:58.170055

Warning: It’s about to get messy. (Also, some of the statements have been edited for our collective sanity.)
 
U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, the 1st District congressman from Kansas, speaks to an audience last year. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
Rep. Tracey Mann on Twitter: “House Republicans passed a clean, non-partisan CR that keeps the government open so our service members can get paid and our most vulnerable communities can get the resources they depend on.
“The majority of Washington Democrats are happy to shut down the government to hold out for a partisan wish list that adds over $1.5 trillion in new spending on America Last programs.”
Let’s understand something right from the get go. Both parties spend a ton of money. The “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed this year will cost $3.4 trillion over a decade and $4 trillion if you include interest. Believe it or not, that’s the cheap version. GOP lawmakers reduced the cost by cutting nearly $1 trillion for Medicaid.
Democrats want to restore those cuts and keep paying for Affordable Care Act subsidies. Without that extra spending, health insurance plans for those in the ACA marketplace could nearly double in the new year.
If Republicans wanted to look out for rural hospitals and cancer patients receiving lifesaving health care, perhaps they would talk to Democrats rather than refusing to entertain their proposals. Just an idea.

Rep. Derek Schmidt: “Nearly two weeks ago, the House passed a bipartisan bill to keep the government funded through November 21, while work continues on the full-year appropriations bills. Regrettably, Senate Democrats are insisting on the inclusion of a $1.5 trillion wish list of additional reckless spending instead of passing the House’s continuing resolution. This shutdown is entirely the result of those unreasonable demands.




“We must get our fiscal house in order by restraining spending. We made a good start in the policies that were in the reconciliation bill passed this summer, which included $1.2 trillion in spending reductions over the next 10 years. The funding bills that have passed out of the House Appropriations Committee build on this effort by decreasing spending by an additional $30 billion. We can’t go back to business-as-usual and leave our children and grandchildren no path out of our country’s massive debts.”
Perhaps Schmidt shouldn’t have voted for the budget-busting reconciliation package earlier this year, then!

Sen. Jerry Moran, speaking on the Senate floor: “We are coming to the end of the fiscal year, and not all of the appropriations bills have been approved, although almost all of them have been approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations and several have been passed here in the United States Senate.
“Every city council or commission, every school board, every local government office in my state passes a budget and then lives within that budget every year. Every local unit of government at home can figure this out, and the U.S. Senate is failing one more time. A shutdown means uncertainty; a shutdown means dysfunction. The issue is the continuing resolution that would fund the federal government until November 21 and is designed to avoid that disfunction, avoid that uncertainty. All that’s required is that we pass the continuing resolution, 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, to keep government functioning, so that we can then pass the remaining appropriations bills.”
Nice words. But underneath, a deadly virus courses through our body politic.
Establishment Republicans like Moran want Kansans to see this situation as part of normal politics. That is, Democrats don’t want to negotiate in good faith and so they’re shutting down the government.
Anyone who has followed a scintilla of news out of Washington, D.C., since Jan. 20 knows that we are not living in an era of normal politics. The Trump administration has systematically withheld, denied or slowed funding for an array of congressionally mandated projects. Remember USAID? Remember widespread firings, seemingly at random, from government agencies? Remember attempts to shut down the Department of Education?
Congress appropriated money for all of these programs. Senators and representatives voted for them. The Trump administration — specifically Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought — has decided to flex its muscles and show that it can do whatever it wants.
Just look at a tweet he posted after the shutdown.

Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled. More info to come from @ENERGY.
The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA

If a Democratic administration were doing this, there’s no question that Republican elected officials would raise a furious stink. But because a Republican administration is doing it, we’ve heard only the tiniest of peeps.
If you want to know why Democrats have taken such an aggressive posture, it’s this. Their Republican colleagues have no way to ensure that any spending deal will be honored by Trump or Vought. Good faith has left the building. Say Democrats reach a deal to increase funding for an imaginary department of widows and orphans. Then the Trump administration decides that it’s going to abolish that imaginary department and spend the money on AI-guided drones meant to kill the homeless.
Who would agree to that deal?
If I were a Democratic legislator — which to be clear I am not and have no desire to be — I would not vote to keep the government open until the administration gave binding assurances that it would not rescind funding. There’s no way that Congress can function in a bipartisan fashion if the executive branch can simply cancel any funding it doesn’t like.
If this ultimately leads to the elimination of the filibuster in the Senate, all the better. We will see what Democrats pass the next time they run the chamber. (Which was the case just a year ago.)
 

U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kansas, talks to the audience at a Kansas forum last year. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
Rep. Ron Estes press release: Estes “announced his request to have his congressional salary withheld due to the government shutdown, caused by Senator Chuck Schumer (D-New York) and his Democrat colleagues. The announcement follows Democrats’ refusal to vote for the same clean funding bill they supported during the previous administration. During the last government shutdown in 2019, Representative Estes also requested his salary be withheld.”


That’s nice. He can’t call the Democratic Party by its proper name, but I appreciate the gesture.

U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, pours a serving of milk during a Senate committee hearing to demonstrate his desire to return whole and 2% milk to school cafeterias. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Marshall’s YouTube channel)
Sen. Roger Marshall: “They lost the election. That elections have consequences. All we’ve asked them to do is continue funding at the levels that they chose, and instead, they want one and a half trillion dollars more. So Chuck Schumer owns this. Their demands are just simply not even worth even considering yet.”
Gosh, this game sounds fun.
Did Marshall accept that elections had consequences during Joe Biden’s presidency? I seem to recall he tried to block Biden from taking office on Jan. 6, 2021, even after insurrectionists sent him scrambling for safety.
Maybe that’s why the prospect of town halls agitates him so much.
 
Rep. Sharice Davids appears in Kansas City, Kansas, on Feb. 28. She’s the lone Democratic member of the Kansas delegation. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)
Rep. Sharice Davids: “The avoidable government shutdown we’re facing is more than just a political standoff. It will have a severe impact on our economy and cause real harm to hardworking Kansans — delaying payments to our military and federal employees, interrupting Social Security benefits, and increasing hunger among women and children.
“As of now, we’ve seen no serious effort from Republican leadership in Washington to work across the aisle on funding the government. Kansans are already feeling the effects of the administration’s reckless policies — rising prices, lost jobs, and cuts to essential services like health care. A shutdown will only make those challenges worse.”
Of course, the Democratic Davids sounds eminently reasonable about the whole situation. This means Republicans will meet in a couple of months to gerrymander her out of her seat.
No shutdown can last long enough.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Portlanders will have the opportunity to vote to gradually raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 per hour by 2028, after the City Council voted to include the measure on this November’s ballot. Maine Center for Economic Policy analysis shows this step would raise wages for more than 15,000 workers — about one in five people working in the city — without posing significant risks to the overall local economy, though questions remain about certain sectors.
Portland’s minimum wage is currently $15.50 per hour, an amount which increases each year by the rate of inflation for the Northeastern states. This regularly scheduled increase will take the minimum wage to $16.00 per hour under current law. Under the proposal before voters, it would instead increase to $16.75 per hour on January 1, 2026, to $17.75 per hour in 2027 and $19 per hour in 2028, after which annual indexing to inflation would continue. Based on current inflation projections, this means the minimum wage would be approximately $2.45 per hour higher in 2028 than under the current schedule.
A sustainable increase
Economists often evaluate minimum wage proposals using the Kaitz index, which compares the minimum wage to the median hourly wage for a full-time, year-round worker in a geographic area. If the minimum wage is set too close to the median, it may carry unintended economic consequences such as job losses.
Portland’s current minimum wage of $15.50 per hour is equivalent to53% of the city’s $29.50 median hourly wage. By 2028, the city’s median hourly wage is projected to be $31.60. The proposed $19 minimum would equal 60% of that — well within the range economists consider sustainable. In fact, research shows even a minimum wage as high as 80% of the median can be absorbed without widespread job loss, especially when phased in over several years.
Who benefits?
By 2028, about 21% of Portland’s workforce — or roughly 15,000 people — would see a raise under the proposal. On average, these workers would see an annual increase of nearly $2,100 per worker, or a combined $32 million boost to paychecks across the city.
Three groups of workers are affected:

Around 1,500 tipped workers, such as servers and bartenders, whose base pay before tips is set at half the minimum wage, would see an increase from a projected $8.28 per hour to $9.50 per hour.
An estimated 8,000 directly impacted workers who are currently earning below the new minimum wage would see an increase of about $2.45 per hour.
A little under 6,000 indirectly impacted workers earning just above the new minimum would receive smaller raises to keep wages competitive.

The benefits will be felt most strongly among groups that have historically been underpaid or marginalized:

Women workers: 23% would benefit, compared to 18% of men
Workers of color: 27% would benefit, compared to 20% of white non-Hispanic workers
Young and older workers: 40% of those under 25 and 22% of those over 65 would see higher wages
Less formally educated workers: Nearly 30% of those with only a high school diploma would benefit, compared to just 6% of those with graduate degrees

Industries with high concentrations of low-wage work — food service, retail, arts and entertainment, and administrative support — would see the biggest gains. For example, nearly half of accommodation and food service workers would get a raise.
Challenges ahead
While the benefits to workers are clear, the proposal also poses some challenges for adult care and child care providers. Maine ties state reimbursement rates for direct care services to the statewide minimum wage, not local wages. That means if Portland adopts a higher minimum, local providers may face rising labor costs without additional state funding to cover them. A similar issue arises for child care providers who accept families with state subsidies, which will not increase to account for the increased cost of labor.
To prevent these unintended consequences, state lawmakers will need to increase investments in direct care and child care services. Without such action, some Portland providers may struggle to balance labor costs.
Raising Portland’s minimum wage to $19 by 2028 is well within the range of minimum wage increases which boost incomes without negatively impacting employment. It would lift incomes for thousands of workers, reduce inequality across race, gender, and age. To ensure the success of this proposal, the State should also step up its support for care workers and child care providers who form the backbone of Maine’s economy.

Ron DeSantis and the Cabinet approved spending $83 million for the 4-acre parcel in Destin at the center of this photo — one of the most expensive conservation land purchases in history — despite strong objections from environmental groups contending it's a waste of money. (Photo by NASA Earth Observatory)When you were in elementary school, did you ever have to deal with some rude student who tried skipping to the front of the line? Something like that just happened with Florida’s popular land preservation program.
Normally, land being considered for addition to our parks, forests, beaches, and springs goes through a long vetting process. Their value is appraised by independent experts to make sure the taxpayers won’t be gouged. Each parcel must pass muster at several stops before finally winning approval, a process that can take years.
But that’s not how a sliver of land in the Panhandle town of Destin suddenly hopscotched to the head of the queue to become one of the most expensive acquisitions in Florida history.
“State environmental officials are recommending the Cabinet buy nearly 4 acres of waterfront property in Destin for more than $80 million as part of a proposed deal inserted into the state budget,” Politico Florida reported last week.
A lot of Florida environmental activists — people normally in favor of saving every acre from our out-of-control sprawl machine — have objected to this purchase. Many waved a red flag because there are much more deserving parcels all over the state. Some questioned whether the Destin land is even worth preserving.
Eugene Kelly via subject
Florida Native Plant Society President Eugene Kelly, for instance, complained to state officials that “the lands in question have virtually NO actual conservation value.”
Yet I watched Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Cabinet ram this through Tuesday morning in just two minutes, without even a pause for public comment.
One Cabinet official, CFO Blaise Ingoglia, confessed to having some heartburn over the purchase. He wanted to vote no. DeSantis giggled at the notion.
DeSantis shut Ingoglia down. The governor pointed out that the Destin item had been bundled with other conservation purchases everyone supported. When Ingoglia held his tongue, DeSantis told him, “We’ll take that as a yes and your objection is noted on that one.”
Barbara Albrecht via UWF
There are a lot of things wrong with the way this all happened, but let’s start with what Barbara Albrecht with the Panhandle Watershed Alliance told me: “The price seems way over-inflated, and that’s a nice way of putting it.”
A profitable business model
Ingoglia has been running around the state bragging about cutting government waste. Yet when a wasteful project unfolded right in front of him, he balked.
What may have caused Ingoglia’s brief freakout is that the current landowner bought that property a decade ago for a mere $8 million.
“The land acquisition process laid out in the statutes prioritizes environmental resources,” former Florida State Parks director Eric Draper told me. “No one familiar with the legal appraisal process believes that this deal is clean.”  
Who’s making such an outsized profit? The landowners are two companies, Pointe Mezzanine LLC and Pointe Resort LLC, “both of which are registered in state corporate filings to Robert Guidry, a Louisiana business owner,” the Tampa Bay Times reported. “Guidry is a prominent donor to state politicians and local officials in the Panhandle county where his property is located.”
One of the politicians to benefit from Guidry’s generosity: DeSantis. The Louisiana man donated $250,000 to a DeSantis campaign committee.
By investing thousands in several Florida politicians, Guidry could count on them handing him millions in tax money.
How’s that for a profitable business model?
The Great Wall of Florida
My first newspaper job, around the Cretaceous Period, involved covering Destin. Back then, it was an unincorporated town in Okaloosa County that called itself “the World’s Luckiest Fishing Village.”
The founder probably didn’t feel all that lucky.
Capt. Leonard Destin from Connecticut began fishing in Gulf waters in the 1830s, but then, according to the city’s official history, “through a series of mishaps, permanently settled in Destin in about 1850-1852.”
Now Destin is better known as home to the Great Wall of Florida, aka the line of massive condominiums that have been built along this once-wild coastline.
Prebble Ramswell via Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office
Destin’s politics are still pretty wild, though. Just three years ago, a councilwoman with the mellifluous name of Prebble Ramswell scuffled at her house with deputies serving a search warrant.
“Efforts to detain Ramswell and place her in handcuffs would ultimately involve all three law officers at the scene,” the Northwest Florida Daily News reported, quoting the arrest report. “During the struggle, Ramswell was pinned against the stairs of the home and ‘used her right leg and foot to horse kick’ one of the investigators.”
Her arrest for failure to turn over public records grew out of a lawsuit filed by Guidry.
He was suing a local activist for slander because the man had criticized his plans to build a condo on the property that’s now slated for preservation. The lawsuit wound up being dismissed because of this odd thing called “the First Amendment,” which seems to be out of fashion in Florida these days.
The councilwoman ended up pleading guilty to a couple of misdemeanors and serving probation. Meanwhile, the person the other council members picked to replace her is now the mayor.
As far as I can tell, he’s one of the few Okaloosa County politicians who haven’t collected campaign contributions from Guidry. The ones who have include the sheriff, school board members, and county commissioners — all of whom seem very supportive of the state buying Guidry’s property.
Despite his criminal record.
Dirty money
Guidry first made a fortune ferrying goods to offshore oil rigs. What made major headlines in Louisiana was his work with another kind of boating — a riverboat gambling license.
Robert Guidry via his website
“Riverboat gambling” carries a romantic image, like you’re channeling Kenny Rogers crooning about when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em. But it’s got a seamy side, too. To get the license, Guidry bribed then-Gov. Edwin Edwards with $1.5 million, delivered in bags of cash that he dropped off in dumpsters.
The money was literally dirty!
Summoned to testify to a grand jury, Guidry at first denied he’d done anything wrong. Called a second time, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination (known in Florida as “the Rick Scott Defense”).
But federal wiretaps of Edwards’ phone provided prosecutors with beaucoup evidence of how Guidry obtained the license, which he then sold for $170 million.
Guidry became a star witness against Edwards, putting him in prison. In exchange, Guidry pleaded guilty to just one count of conspiracy to commit extortion and had to pay $3.5 million.
Despite the bribes and penalties, he still managed to make a profit on the riverboat deal.
But not nearly the astounding percentage of profit he’ll make on selling this Destin property to the taxpayers.
The buy-back
Nobody knows more about Florida environmental land preservation than Clay Henderson, a lawyer and former Florida Audubon president. He literally wrote the book on the subject. It’s called “Forces of Nature” and every politician in the state should read it.
Clay Henderson via subject
When I checked with Henderson about the Destin property, he pointed out how the land is even more overpriced than it seems.
“The initial appraisal in April came in at $55 million, but the appraiser supplemented that by $12 million to include the docks,” he told me. “What is unusual about that is the docks are a leasehold interest with the state because they are on sovereignty lands. The second appraisal also came in at $55 million with $13 million addition for the docks on sovereignty lands.”
“Sovereignty lands” mean submerged land that’s already owned by the state.
The governor and Cabinet voted to spend millions of dollars buying land the taxpayers already own.
It’s like a buy-back — except it didn’t really need to be bought.
Also, about those appraisals: They were not ordered by anyone with the state Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees state land purchases. They were done on behalf of Guidry, the owner.
That odd provision was the work of our fine Legislature, which passed the budget language that allowed Guidry to jump the line on everyone else. The money was supposed to be spent for the Florida Wildlife Corridor, which runs nowhere near Destin.
Based on the per acre values from recent Cabinet meetings, Henderson said, $83 million would have bought 60,000 acres of conservation easements or 25,000 acres of land sold outright — a lot more than the 4 acres we’re getting.
The people who engineered this purchase, Henderson said, did so “to the detriment of every other important conservation site in Florida endangered by development.” 
The second resignation
I tried several times to reach Guidry for comment, to no avail. As a result, I can’t say for sure why he changed his mind about adding another condo to the Great Wall of Florida.
My guess is that he noticed that Florida real estate seems to be headed for a slump, hurt by both climate-fueled hurricanes and hurricane-fueled insurance rates. Suppose he built his condo and nobody wanted to buy it?
Selling that land to the state would be a safer — and more profitable — option.
Jay Trumbull via Florida Senate
That’s why, late in this year’s legislative session, Panama City’s Republican Sen. Jay Trumbull slipped a requirement into the budget for the state to purchase Guidry’s property and use appraisals arranged by Guidry.
That was fine with the legislative leaders who cut the amount for total preservation purchases to just $18 million instead of the expected $100 million. But Trumbull omitted any mention of the amount, according to those leaders.
“Why are we spending $83 million on a raw piece of land [when] that could buy thousands of acres of pristine land that needs conservation today?” former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, now a GOP gubernatorial candidate, told the Times.
Trumbull tried to convince Politico Florida of the purity of his intentions. “This is a worthy and exciting project preserving public access that could otherwise be lost forever with the development of high-rise condos,” he said.
When he’s not legislating, Trumbull works at his family’s business, which owns seven Culligan dealerships in Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. But I think we all know who he was carrying water for on this piece of legislation.
The only person who appeared to be unwilling to go along with this bad deal for the taxpayers was the DEP’s interim manager of state lands, Andrew Fleener.
He just resigned — the second person in that slot to quit this year.
Getting DeSantis’ attention
DeSantis’ persistence in messing with the state’s preserved properties mystifies me.
You’d think he would have learned his lesson last year when his attempt to build golf courses at a state park led to statewide protests and a new law preventing him from ever trying such a thing again.
He sure could have handled this one differently. DeSantis could have vetoed this Destin line item from the state budget.
He could have ordered two new appraisals that would leave out the state-owned submerged land.
At the very least, he could have listened to Ingoglia’s objections and invited the public to comment. After all, it’s our money, not his.
Maybe someone should paint the crosswalks around the governor’s mansion with the words SEND DESTIN TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. That seems to be the only form of protest that grabs his attention.

That a country such as Israel can continue to kill and maim children, women and men while starving an entire population should give us all some pause. And let me be clear, calling out these callous and morally reprehensible actions and being in solidarity with Palestinian children, women, and men does not equal condoning the actions by Hamas.
A viewpoint published on September 3 rejected the claim that genocide was taking place in Gaza. Genocide and starvation are currently happening in Gaza. And I’m not the only one to say this. The United Nations, the International Association of Genocide Scholars, other organizations and scholars have also said it. 
As Judith Butler wrote in an article, “But what does it mean to speak up against genocide only to be censored? It means that only speech that defends injustice is defensible.” 
Palestinian people deserve more than this. It doesn’t really matter whether hundreds are being killed (or starved) or thousands. One child killed is too many. One journalist killed is too many. One medical doctor killed is too many. One child dying from starvation is too many. And the reality is that thousands of children have been killed, more than 184 journalists have been killed and who really knows how many medical doctors have been killed ––but far too many. And more will die.
There is also something deeply wrong when an ex-Israeli intelligence chief said that 50 Palestinians must die for every October 7 victim. The level of moral superiority and hubris among many Israeli politicians and military leaders is morally repugnant. It doesn’t end there. One could say the same about many politicians in the United States. It is no secret that the United States is Israel’s staunchest ally and has provided military and financial support unabatingly, for decades.
Resorting to one or two media reports that criticize other news reports does not really help in clarifying matters. Most mainstream media outlets and think tanks are biased making it very important to seek out other credible sources and not rely only on a single source.
For a more accurate version of how the Balfour Declaration came about I would encourage readers and critics to read Rashid Khalidi’s “The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine.” In this book, he carefully explains how the Balfour Declaration came about and how Palestinian people were never consulted about the decision. 
Khalidi writes that in a confidential note to the British cabinet Balfour said the following, “And Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long traditions, in present needs, in future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land.”  It is not a hidden fact that Arthur Balfour influenced by Zionist leaders also had British imperial interests in mind.
Interestingly enough, a current exhibition taking place in Paris explores the 5,000-year history of Gaza. The Gaza strip recognized as a Palestinian city has a long and culturally rich history living through several civilizations and influenced by Egyptian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Islamic, and other cultures. Palestinians have been living there for centuries.
Speaking for myself, but I know I am not alone; it is hard to read and witness what is currently going on without feeling a sense of frustration and powerlessness. Frustration due a to a weak international community that won’t stand up to the U.S. or Israel as well as the absence of more stringent international laws that could overrule impunity of this degree, and powerlessness because although there is a growing pro-Palestinian movement political leaders have a stronghold on the situation.
In the face of such violence and death I turn to the other side of the coin: peace, compassion, and non-violence. There is an urgent need to uphold these as an antidote to the bloodshed and undeserved suffering. In Genuine Compassion, the Dalai Lama discusses how genuine compassion is a sense of responsibility towards the suffering of others but also entails “a real sense of responsibility, a commitment to relieve their suffering and remove them from their undesirable circumstances.” Not an easy task but not an insurmountable one.
One final thing, the Dalai Lama also says that we should not feel anger towards those who do harm––rather we should feel compassionate towards them. Although they themselves might not realize it, but they are suffering too.

What can parents do?,"A new academic year is a marker of time and transitions, for young people and families.  Puberty, peer groups, achievement, anxiety —it’s a lot for adolescents in particular.
Consider a 10-year national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, funded by the federal National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners.

Josiah Brown Credit: PSW
My son is in his eighth year as a study participant.  Each year, from age 10 to 17 so far, he has completed interviews and surveys, sometimes accompanied by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) brain scans, along with cognitive tests.  There are gauges of screen time, drug use, mood, peer and family relations, along with physical growth and academic progress (through release of school grades).  Saliva, urine, hair, and blood may be monitored. Effects of, say, nutrition, physical activity, and concussions can be estimated.
For caregivers, too, come an array of questions —about employment, education, finances, time, conflict, mental health, drugs and alcohol. We offer our perspectives on our children, while both their and our own answers remain confidential.
The study follows “over 10,000 children from pre-adolescence into adulthood. Data gathered … will allow the creation of baseline standards for normal brain development (similar to those that currently exist for height, weight, and other physical characteristics).”  The engaged research institutes, hospitals, and universities span some 17 states —red and blue alike— with rural, urban, and suburban demographics.
Already by 2018, the New York Times  and “60 Minutes” were reporting on early results of the ABCD Study.  Years later, the results are more substantial, with events including a pandemic having intervened. More than 1,000 papers have been published based on the study.
One of those papers, as NPR reported in June following a JAMA article , links screen addiction to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  Now, schools including my son’s are banning cellphones, a policy change that may provide more data about students, time, and attention.
Social media— related threats, virtues, and unknowns —invite scrutiny, along with lamentations about youth reading time and skills, and socialization.
A spring 2025 Harvard poll  finds “Young people who became socially isolated during COVID report higher rates of depression, especially those who were entering high school or college during the pandemic” and concludes it’s a “generation that feels disconnected from institutions.”
In Connecticut, there is already a “spike” in mental health needs as the 2025-26 year begins.  A Harvard study suggests schools could provide additional screenings, though related resources would be required; schools are asked to do so much as it is.
Challenges go well beyond today’s teens and those in the United States. The Global Flourishing Study documents deficits worldwide—in happiness and health—for young adults ages 18-29.  Still, our focus here is the U.S.
There is “an epidemic of loneliness and isolation,” as a 2023 U.S. Surgeon General’s advisory termed it, in emphasizing “healing effects of social connection and community.”
Thomas Insel, M.D., former head of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), in his book Healing, cites a colleague’s admonition about “three Ps.  It’s people, place, and purpose.”  These are key not only to “recovery” but also to prevention of isolation and anguish.
Prevention, connection, and healthy “management of feelings”
In her book The Emotional Lives of Teenagers, Lisa Damour, Ph.D., notes that even before the pandemic: “serious mental health concerns [were] on the rise.  From 2009 to 2019, the percentage of high school students who reported feeling persistently sad or hopeless jumped from 26 percent to 37 percent…. In about the same time frame, the percentage of high school students reporting significant levels of anxiety rose from 34 percent to 44 percent.”  She points also to “evidence of … systemic racial disparities in health care.”  The “central premise” of her book is that “mental health is not about feeling good” but about healthy “management of feelings.”
My interest is not just that of a parent, or a long-ago adolescent myself.  My professional work involves children and youth who have experienced abuse and neglect.
These young people, whether in foster care or at a prior stage known as Protective Supervision, are at disproportionate risk for a range of factors. Their often high number of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) correlates with everything from chronic school absenteeism and dropout to bullying, mental health crises, substance use, trafficking, homelessness, and “crossover” from the child protection to the juvenile justice system(s).
So, lessons from the ABCD Study and similar endeavors may be valuable in helping social workers, attorneys, judges, educators, health professionals, families and young people themselves to remediate and ultimately prevent problems.
For example, I attended an informative September 8 webinar, “Inside Adolescence: Substance Use Patterns, Predictions, Risk, and Resilience in the ABCD Study,” with experts sharing findings on early substance use and “potential protective factors that could prevent or delay it.”
Much depends on accidents of birth —on inequalities of income and inheritance, neighborhood and schooling.  But we don’t have to accept such accidents passively, or allow them to become “social determinants” of health and wealth.
Study, learn, invest, act
Let’s continue to support research like the ABCD Study, learn from it, and back further exploration —by the NIH and other federal agencies —that benefits Americans, humans, of all backgrounds. Study, learn, invest—in children and youth, and in the institutions that increase possibilities and unlock potential for all.

Wes Moore (D) vowed Wednesday to continue funding some federal programs as a federal government shutdown began with no end in sight.
Day one of the shutdown also included the usual partisan finger-pointing and though talk. Moore, in a morning news conference that included state and federal officials, called the shutdown avoidable and unnecessary and said it will directly hurt Marylanders.
“The president of the United States, the chief executive of this country, has a simple responsibility to run a functioning government, not to shut it down,” Moore said. “We have seen that the president has failed in that responsibility and has abandoned his duty to the states and his duty to the people.
“Leaders at the highest levels of government and inside the White House itself are looking at each and every one of us, all 50 states, and saying, you’re now on your own,” he said.
In response, Moore said state agencies will “employ contingency plans to make sure that federal programs continue to operate” in Maryland.
“For now, we will ensure that state employees supported with federal funding continue to get paid for as long as possible,” Moore said. “Federal programs administered by the state will continue to support working families through Medicaid, SNAP [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] and TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families], we will also provide greater flexibility to Head Start programs and ensure that veterans maintain access to essential resources.”
Additionally, Moore said he would work to shield furloughed federal workers from evictions, foreclosure, and utility shutoffs. The governor sent letters to the judiciary and utility companies “reminding them of their statutory legal protections for federal, state and local government employees who are not receiving a paycheck or are at risk of eviction or foreclosure.”
Moore said he also asked banks and other financial institutions to work with Maryland residents affected by the shutdown.
Federal employment and contracting make up a sizable portion of the economy — and of tax revenue — in Maryland.
Federal lawmakers divided along party lines Tuesday: Republicans pushed for a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded through Nov. 21, while Democrats want to restore cuts to Medicaid and to insurance subsidies that are part of the Affordable Care Act. Those funds were cut in July as part of Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” tax-cut package.
“This is not normal,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore). “We cannot stand here and think that the norms and institutions that this country has been built on can be shattered by one administration. This is not normal.”
Nationally, and in Maryland, each side is blaming the other for the shutdown.
“Governor Moore would rather posture on cable news and tweet about partisan battles than deal with the reality that Maryland is uniquely vulnerable in a shutdown,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said in a statement Wednesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Every Continuing Resolution in modern history has required bipartisan cooperation to keep the government open,” Hershey said of the stopgap budget resolution often used to keep government open temporarily. “Instead, Democrats wanted to use this CR to jam through unrelated health care policy. That’s reckless.”
Hershey called on Moore to demand Democrats in Washington pass the continuing resolution passed in September by the House. That measure has stalled in the Senate.
“The truth is our economy is already lagging behind our neighbors, and Moore’s answer has been to double-down on our dependence on federal spending,” Hershey said. “That’s a dangerous strategy — and Marylanders are the ones who will pay the price when Washington stumbles.”
Maryland is home to five dozen federal facilities. About 260,000 residents are employed by the federal government and there are roughly 200,000 federal contractors in the state.
The governor and others expressed concerns about the loss of federal safety net programs.
“There is not a single state in the country that has the budget to be able to fully cover the supports that should be coming from the federal government, but Maryland is going to do its part and do everything in our power to be able to make sure that we are supporting programs like Medicaid,” Moore told reporters Wednesday.
Administration officials were unable to say Wednesday exactly where funding would come from to keep that pledge, and how long it might last.
Maryland Democrats in Washington urge talks to end government shutdown

“We’re not tapping into the rainy day fund to do so, but we are going to make sure we’re doing everything in our power, for as long as we can, to make up for the fact that the federal government has just left every single state on their own,” Moore said.
“We’re going to continually evaluate how long we can go,” he said.
The last shut down was in 2018, sparked by a dispute between Congress and President Donald Trump. The shutdown was the longest in history, lasting 35 days, ending in January of 2019.
When the government reopened, federal employees returned to work and received back pay. But this closure has the potential to be different from past shutdowns.
Trump is threatening to use the event to lay off federal workers en masse. And while the federal government reimbursed states for the costs of federal programs in the past, Moore administration officials cautioned that the federal government has not provided official guidance on reimbursement this time.
Those officials said if federal agencies advise the state that reimbursements will not be made, it “may impact the state’s posture” on continuing to fund programs during the shutdown.
In a call with reporters, administration officials said they were relying on “hope and trust” for those future reimbursements.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_3341-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-10-02 03:56:45.285920

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)How much time behind bars is too much time? How harsh should speeding penalties be? When should someone be charged for passing an infection to another, and how best to honor a slain parole officer?
And when will we finally have an officially state mineral?
The answers to those questions and more can be found among the more than 400 new laws that took effect Wednesday in Maryland, the biggest and last group of the 849 bills passed into law in the 2025 General Assembly. As usual, many were years in the making, some were somber and some were silly, and most will likely touch state residents’ lives in one way or another.
A second chance
One of the more emotionally debated bills of the session was the Second Look Act, which is just what its name implies: Under the law, people who have been incarcerated for at least 20 years will be able to petition the court that sentenced them for a reduction in that sentence.
House Bill 853 was sponsored for a second year by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County), and co-sponsored by 45 other House members. Opponents argued strongly that people who commit heinous crimes should not be given a second chance, and in a last-minute addition the bill was amended to make it unavailable to those convicted in the murder of a first-responder.
The bill appeared to be in trouble in the Senate,when Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) rose to talk about a cousin who was shot and killed in 1991. The victim’s brother, another of Sydnor’s cousins, suddenly died a few years ago, “of a broken heart,” according to family lore.
Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George’s), right, talks with Sen. Charles Sydnor III after his testimony in support of the Second Look Act. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)
Sydnor said that if that the man who killed his cousin “did what they needed to do to reenter society, I’d welcome them with open arms.” The bill was based on “grace,” he said.
There are a number of restrictions in the final version, besides the first-responder language. The inmate applying for a sentence had to have been younger than 25 when the crime was committed. The petition will not be available for sex offenders or people sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.
Inmates can only apply three times, and have to wait three years between each petition if they are turned down. A victim or a victim’s representatives may submit an impact statement to the court, which may impose certain conditions of release “to promote victim safety and peace of mind.”
Geriatric, medical parole also expanded
A related bill would require the Maryland Parole Commission to consider an incarcerated individual’s age or medical condition when weighing a parole request.
HB 1123 was sponsored by Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel) and SB 181 was sponsored by Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), who was credited with leading the effort to passage after sponsoring the measure for a fourth year.
During a Senate committee hearing in January, the Parole Commission chair said that only one person had been released on geriatric parole in the last 10 years under the current parole structure.
The new law lets Individuals be released on medical parole if a licensed physician makes certain determinations of a person’s health, such as being chronically debilitated or suffering from a terminal illness. Somone could quality for geriatric parole release if they were at least 65 years old and had served at least 20 years in prison. In addition, that person cannot be a sex offender and must be serving a sentence that comes with the possibility of parole.
The state’s Parole Commission must grant a meeting request for an incarcerated person or that person’s representative under certain circumstances, under the law, which also removes the governor from the medical parole process. Lawmakers removed the governor from the general parole process four years ago, but an oversight at the time allowed him to retain input on medical parole decisions. That authority now goes away.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Decriminalizing HIV
Advocates have been trying since 2013 to repeal what they called an “antiquated” and “discriminatory” law that made it a crime to knowingly pass the human immunodeficiency virus to another person. They finally won this year, when HB 39 and SB 356 passed by overwhelming margins.
The law dated back to 1989, at the outset of the AIDS crisis, when lawmakers said “an individual who has the human immunodeficiency virus may not knowingly transfer or attempt to transfer the … virus to another individual.” Doing so was classified as a misdemeanor offense, punishable by up to  $2,500 fine and up to three years in prison.
The bills’ sponsors, Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) and Sen. Will Smith (D-Montgomery), said the law may have been intended as a public health measure, but it did not do so in practice. The law was not only contrary to public health, by stigmatizing HIV, they said, but it could also be discriminatory against Black men.
A Williams Institute report last year found that Black men made up 68% of the cases for knowingly transmitting HIV. The charge had only been invoked 148 times in 104 cases since 1989, and only 10% resulted in a guilty verdict, the report said.
Honoring a slain parole officer
The Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety Act, which took effect Wednesday, is named in honor of the Maryland parole officer who was slain last year while checking in on a parolee in Montgomery County,  the first parole officer killed in the line of duty in the state.

His death inspired the law, which brings new protections for officers and will provide better oversight of state workplaces.
Martinez was making a routine check on a parolee in Silver Spring on the morning of May 31, 2024, when he was brutally slain in the parolee’s apartment. Martinez’s supervisors did not check on him until well into the evening, after coworkers noticed him missing and expressed concern for his well-being.
Police found Martinez dead with multiple stab wounds at the home of the parolee, Emanuel Edward Sewell, who was arrested a day later in West Virginia and has since been charged with first-degree murder in Martinez’s death.
The law, created under SB 26 and HB 176, sets up a new unit within the Division of Labor and Industry focused on public employee safety and healt,  and prompts labor officials to develop standards that address workplace violence. Under the law, the commissioner of Labor and Industry will release a report on the safety and health of employees in public bodies every July and will submit the report to the General Assembly.
Prescription drug board expands – kind of
The state board tasked with bringing down prescription drug costs got expanded authority Wednesday – but the board has to clear some hurdles before it can exercise that authority.
The Prescription Drug Affordability Board was created in 2019 to lower prescription drug costs for those who get health insurance from the state. It has yet to do so for a single drug – a fact that critics in the pharmaceutical industry frequently point out – but lawmakers this year decided to expand the board’s authority to include drugs covered by commercial plans, not just state health plans.
HB 424 and SB 357 require that PDAB expand its cost-saving efforts to the commercial market – but not until one year after the board has successfully brought down costs for two prescription drugs under its current authority.
In July, the board officially determined that two Type 2 diabetes drugs were likely unaffordable for Marylanders and it is currently determining ways to bring those costs down. One method could be through imposition of “upper payment limits,” which cap how much the state is willing to pay for those drugs.
County leaders urge prescription drug board to set ‘upper payment limits’

So while the law is on the books, PDAB won’t be able to expand its work into the commercial market for more than a year, as it works this fall on upper payment limits on the first two drugs.
Easing up on building emissions rules
Maryland’s Building Energy Performance Standards program, part of the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022, called for large buildings in the state to electrify over time, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, or pay fees. Until this year.
Lawmakers loosened the rules a bit in 2025, exempting hospitals and some manufacturing buildings from emission reduction requirements. The rules apply to buildings over 35,000 square feet, though some specific building types are exempt.
HB 49 also lets building owners take credit for any renewable energy that they generate on-site, such as with rooftop solar panels, and reduce their emissions reduction obligations under the law. It also clarifies that buildings could be exempt from the state rules and reporting requirements in counties that develop a state-approved building emissions program.
The new law also compels the Maryland Department of the Environment to study  other potential changes to the policy on large buildings, including setting rules not just for emissions but for energy consumption. That study is to be completed by the end of 2026.
Climate advocates had worried about the changes, but said the final result could have been worse:Broader changes to the rules, including exempting residential buildings, did not advance.
Buildings contributed 16% of Maryland’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, from gas furnaces, water heaters and more. By 2031, the state is committed by law to reducing its overall greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels, to reaching net-zero emissions by 2045.
Butterflies on IDs
Also on Wednesday, the Motor Vehicle Administration began issuing drivers licenses with a butterfly symbol above the words “hidden disability” for those with intellectual and development disabilities. The symbols will also be available for state-issued identification cards and even moped licenses.
“Eric’s ID Law” is named after Montgomery County resident Eric Carpenter-Grantham, who has high functioning autism. HB 707 and SB 618 also require the state to advertise the availability of the logo and to have the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission work with State Police and “other interested stakeholders” to develop law enforcement training on interacting with those who have an invisible disability notification.
Carpenter-Grantham and his mother, Linda, are constituents of bils’ lead sponsors, Montgomery County Democrats Sen. William C. Smith Jr. and Del. Jheanelle Wilkins. The Carpenter-Grantham family advocated for the bill that got nationwide attention with appearances last year on Fox’s “Sherri Shephard Show” and ABC’s “The View.” Del. Kym Taylor (D-Prince George’s), another House sponsor, was in the audience of “The View” for the family’s appearance.
Meanwhile, Eric’s ID Law has support from the Communication Workers of America, which is circulating a petition to encourage passage in other states.
Watch your speed
More speed cameras are coming to counties around the state as part of a tranche of bills passed earlier this year.
Baltimore County is authorized to place up to four cameras on the Beltway and another three cameras on Interstate 83. The Maryland Transportation Authority will be able to place the devices on the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County, with fines collected from the devices going to the authority.
Additional legislation allows Montgomery County to place the speed monitoring devices on highways deemed at high risk for motor vehicle crashes.
Those caught speeding by cameras on Indian Head Highway in Prince George’s County could pay more for putting the pedal to the metal. The tiered fines for the cameras along Route 210 will range from $40 for motorists clocked at 12 to 15 mph over the speed limit up to $425 for those caught driving 40 mph or more above the posted limit.
Among other 400 laws that took effect Wednesday:

Nearly two dozen bills related to veterans were part of a bipartisan package that was part of a veterans agenda largely pushed by Sen. Bryan Simonaire (R-Anne Arundel), which aim to ensure that veterans can access state health, education, transportation, and other benefits.
Future governors will be required to either divest themselves of financial interests that conflict with their official duties or put them in a blind trust.
HB 932, sponsored by Environment and Transportation Committee Chair Marc Korman (D-Montgomery), was passed this session following reports that alleged clients of former Gov. Larry Hogan’s real estate business were awarded lucrative state contracts during his eight years in office.
Another Korman bill, HB 411, takes effect, making chromite teh official state mineral. If that sounds familiar, it’s because SB 764 by Sen. Craig Zucker (D-Montgomery), took effect June 1, making chromite the state mineral but also making orange crush the official state cocktail. Orange crush was added to Zucker’s bill in the House on the last day of the session, after Korman’s bill had passed both chambers.
The 2026 gubernatorial primary will move from the last Tuesday of June to the fourth Tuesday of the month. SB 645, sponsored by Senate Education, Energy and Environment Committee Vice Chair Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery), and HB 411, sponsored by Wilkins, moved the date to prevent early voting from overlapping with the Juneteenth and Father’s Day observances.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSC_0653-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-02 00:57:26.545380

Ford/Maryland Matters)Several people showed up at Motor Vehicle Administration offices Wednesday to get new identification cards with a special butterfly logo, but it’s hardly surprising that the first one went to Montgomery County resident Eric Carpenter-Grantham.
After all, “Eric’s ID Law,” which allowed for the creation of the new cards, is named after Carpenter-Grantham.
The law requires that the MVA add the butterfly logo above the words “hidden disability” on cards for those who request it, like Carpenter-Grantham, who has high-functioning autism. The logo is meant to help police identify Marylanders with developmental or intellectual disabilities that are not immediately noticeable.
Dozens of elected officials, disability advocates and other supporters traveled to the MVA’s White Oak location to celebrate “Eric’s ID Law” that went into effect Tuesday.
“God has blessed me to create a special logo to be placed on the IDs for people like me and my friends who have invisible disabilities,” said the 20-year-old Montgomery College student. “If we [are] ever stopped by law enforcement, we can be safe. Eric’s ID law is to help police officers and the public better understand the needs of citizens with an invisible disability.”

The local can also be placed on MVA-issued identification cards, and even moped licenses.
One of those getting a new ID Wednesday was Addison Jawando, the 13-year-old daughter of Montgomery County Council Vice President Will Jawando (D-At-Large). His daughter is on the autism spectrum.
“It’s an exciting day,” Jawando said before taking a picture with his daughter and others. “It’s been an honor to have a personal connection with my own daughter, who’s on the spectrum, to be able to have this and share it with her friends. It’s kind of a form of advocacy for her, too.”
Jawando and other a few others acknowledged the law wasn’t easy to get approved.
Former Del. Rachel Jones (D-Calvert) sponsored legislation in 2022 that would have had the MVA include a notation that a person had a disability. The bill passed the House, but died in the Senate.
Jones, who now works as a government relations director with the state Department of Agriculture, said the inspiration to craft a bill began with her son, Aaron, now 16 and also diagnosed with high-functioning autism. She helped Carpenter-Grantham and his mother, Linda, get the measure passed, that included testifying in Annapolis.
“As mothers, we both understood we had that same desire. We wanted to do this for our sons,” Jones said in an interview after Wednesday’s event ended. “I knew that one day he [Aaron] would need some sort of protection, and so my desire came from wanting to protect him.
“It was just so wonderful to watch them carry the torch with the passion that they had, and to be able to work alongside them,” Jones said.

Besides the Carpenter-Grantham family, three other people received credit as sponsors of this year’s measures: Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) and Dels. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) and Kym Taylor (D-Prince George’s).
The Carpenter-Granthams are constituents in Smith and Wilkins’ legislative District 20. The law is personal for Taylor, whose 27-year-old son has an invisible disability.
“As a mother of a son on the spectrum, I know personally the fears and anxiety experienced when your child lives with nonapparent issues,” Taylor said. “It’s not just about policy. It’s about safety, compassion and justice for families like mine across the state.”
Public safety officials praised Eric Carpenter-Grantham for helping lead the effort to get measure passed.
“The fact that this young, 20-year-old man can actually galvanize and bring everybody together … says a lot,” said Prince George’s County Sheriff John Carr, as he stood next to Carpenter-Grantham.
“We just want to let you know we’re here to serve you and thank you for getting this across. We will always be here for you, those who have invisible disabilities, and all of our community,” Carr said.

On September 18, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy directed the MBTA to provide information, in two weeks, on its “actions and plans to reduce crime, vagrancy, and fare evasion on the transit system,” at what seems to be at the risk of losing federal funding.   
There are no data to suggest that the fifth-largest transit system in the country is unsafe or overtaken by crime or vagrancy. Over the past two years, the MBTA has not only addressed decades-old operational challenges by eliminating slow zones, it’s also shown how its leadership has regained public confidence, with the commuter rail enjoying the highest rate of ridership rebound post-pandemic in the country.  
About a month ago, as new Acela trains arrived in South Station, the US Department of Transportation deputy director suggested that the federal government could possibly take over South Station, as it did Union Station in Washington, DC. The rationale? To address crime and safety.  
However, the proposition that the MBTA is unsafe at a level that federal funding could justifiably be withheld is simply unsupported by facts. Despite the fact that South Station serves millions of passengers each year, 2023 and 2024 data from the Transit Police indicate that there were 30 or fewer incidents of property or violent crime each year at the station.  
The Trump administration’s continued reliance on a false narrative that a federal takeover is necessary to address safety and security concerns in cities like Boston, where city and state officials have challenged the rollbacks to funding, critical programs, and policies that make Boston more equitable and accessible is fear-mongering and punitive.  
Most recently, we’ve seen the cancellation of federal grants for Boston’s transportation projects simply because they included EV charging stations. For the last nine months, the rescission of federal funding has become so commonplace that it no longer makes for shocking headlines. And perhaps that is by design. What may potentially be the most insidious of all these assaults is one that relatively flew under the radar.   
On September 15, the Federal Transit Authority officially withdrew the Environmental Justice Circular — its commitment to ensure that transportation projects do not disproportionately cause adverse impacts on minority and low-income communities. One way that transit agencies do this is through an equity analysis of a project that identifies and addresses whether a particular program or policy has a disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations. 
Environmental justice is rooted in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Recipients of federal funding like the MBTA are subject to these requirements.  
In the 60 years since its passage, Title VI has been a critical tool for the federal government, lawyers, and community members. As a 1995 Fordham Environmental Law Review article put it, it allows them to address the fact that “[s]tate, local and private sector actors make decisions every day that create or exacerbate racial inequalities” in exposure to pollution from industrial infrastructure and in access to benefits and services, including the transportation sector.   
In recent years, the MBTA itself had to look into why a higher percentage of its bus routes that serve largely minority communities perform subpar compared to bus routes that serve mostly white riders. Meanwhile, fare evasion was decriminalized and policies were adjusted because most of the tickets Transit Police issued were to people of color, even though they account for a smaller percentage of subway riders.  
Environmental justice builds on Title VI. When implemented and enforced appropriately, Title VI enables the federal government and funding recipients to identify areas where individuals are not receiving equal treatment and create a process to cooperatively create solutions that improve service delivery and outcomes for all people. And the EJ analysis guarantees that appropriate mitigation measures and alternatives are put in place to reduce disparate impacts when they could not be averted.  
A recent project that exemplifies the importance of this analysis is the Green Line Extension, which was designed to mitigate the disparate impacts the Big Dig, and historically, the Central Artery, had on low-income and minority communities. 
Title VI and the EJ circular were designed to go hand in hand. To be sure, Title VI remains the law, but the withdrawal of the EJ circular signals a disturbing regression.  The guidance and analyses breathe life into the disparate impact standard, which was put in place to ensure that federal dollars are not spent to perpetuate discrimination and structural marginalization. 
With the federal government’s withdrawal of the circular, the defunding of critical programs that seek to rebalance who gets the benefits and who bears the burden, and the unjustified threats to public transit, we are witnessing an assured erosion of civil rights and guarantees. 
At a time when the federal government has upended the rule of law and policy norms that have been in place for decades, it is critical that Massachusetts walk the walk on environmental justice and civil rights. Massachusetts leaders must ensure that benefits and burdens are shared evenly without leaving anyone behind.  
The state does not have its own comprehensive protections against such discrimination. But legislators can do something about this this session, by enacting a bill that creates a state version of Title VI (H.1889/S.1064), ensuring against disparate impacts and safeguarding civil rights protections for the long term for Massachusetts residents . 
Environmental justice is based on civil rights principles. Put simply, we cannot achieve environmental justice without robust compliance with and enforcement of civil rights laws, including Title VI.  
Passage of this legislation will protect our most vulnerable residents from capricious and political decisions that Title VI was designed to eliminate. We cannot wait for more rational actors in Washington, DC, to protect our most vulnerable populations.

He said many families here no longer have the same kind of opportunities that his did.","THE FIELD OF REPUBLICANS vying to challenge Gov. Maura Healey next fall grew to three Wednesday with the addition of GOP booster and former medical device businessman Michael Minogue.
A Hamilton Republican who had been discussed as a potential entrant to the 2026 gubernatorial race, Minogue made his campaign official with a video on social media Wednesday morning, pledging that he would be a “new kind of governor.” He said many families here no longer have the same kind of opportunities that his did.
“They’re being squeezed by higher costs, ignored by politicians who care more about themselves than the citizens they serve. Working people have been left behind, and many are leaving. Our current one-party system isn’t working. What we need is a new kind of public servant,” he says in the video. “I’ve spent my life running towards problems and fixing them to make a big difference … I’m running to be a new kind of governor, one with the faith, the heart and the grit to serve for Massachusetts.”
Minogue graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1989 with a degree in engineering, and he went on to serve as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army during Operation Desert Storm, his campaign said. Following his military service, Minogue worked at General Electric HealthCare until he was tapped as chairman, president and CEO of Danvers-based Abiomed in April 2004.
He ran Abiomed until 2023. During that time, his campaign says, Minogue’s company “created the field of heart recovery through the development of Impella, the world’s smallest heart pump” and “treated more than 250,000 patients, grew to $1.2B in annual sales, and became one of the fastest growing, and most profitable, medical device companies in the nation.”
Minogue has also started two foundations: MedTechVets aims to help military veterans discover career opportunities in the medical device industry, and the Michael & Renee Minogue Foundation has donated more than $10 million since 2015 to support faith-based education, military veterans, health care innovation and causes for children, Minogue’s campaign said.
The candidate’s website says he would be guided by six principles: upholding the law and keeping communities safe; respecting taxpayers through transparency and audits; using common sense and compassion; avoiding overspending that leads to higher debt and increased taxes; putting America and Massachusetts before party politics; and listening, being kind and respectful to all. Having a sense of humor, the site says, is “extra credit.”
MassGOP Chair Amy Carnevale welcomed Minogue’s decision to jump into the Republican gubernatorial primary field, which already includes Baker administration officials Mike Kennealy and Brian Shortsleeve.
“His entrance gives Massachusetts voters yet another alternative to the failing policies and faltering economy of the Healey administration and one-party rule. Republicans are positioned to deliver what matters most to voters: a state government they can trust, one that priorities their families and not those in power,” Carnevale said.
Minogue has been a prolific donor for Republican candidates and causes over recent years. He was a supporter of Gov. Charlie Baker and U.S. Senate candidate John Deaton, and he’s donated thousands to the Republican State Committee, including a $5,000 donation this February, according to state campaign finance records. He’s also given large sums to national Republicans, including more than $440,000 to the Republican National Committee in February, according to the Federal Elections Commission.
The Mass. Democratic Party and the Democratic Governors Association whacked Minogue Wednesday morning for his ties to President Donald Trump’s administration. Both organizations pointed out that Minogue held a fundraiser in Gloucester last year for JD Vance and has donated nearly $1 million Republicans over the last year.
“We know Mike Minogue won’t stand up to Donald Trump because he supports what Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Robert Kennedy are doing to our state and our country,” Democratic Party Chair Steve Kerrigan said. “Minogue enabled Trump to take the White House and implement his agenda — increasing costs on everyone through tariffs, taking health care and food away from hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents, and denying people access to vaccines.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6282-edited-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-01 21:56:59.826646

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Arkansas will start accepting proposals from rural hospitals and medical providers to receive shares of the national $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, “a much-needed lifeline to rural health care,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.
The federal budget reconciliation law passed in July created the program, which will distribute $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their share of funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used. On Tuesday, Sanders notified the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that Arkansas plans to pursue this funding, her office announced in a Wednesday news release.
“I encourage providers, nonprofits, and every other stakeholder involved to submit their ideas through this portal so that our team has all the information we need to compete for this funding effectively,” Sanders said.
The state set a deadline of Oct. 10 for submitting funding requests to the portal so Arkansas officials can apply for the funding by the federal government’s deadline of Nov. 5. Submissions sent after Oct. 10 will be reviewed at the discretion of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration, the news release states.
The new budget reconciliation law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for low-income Americans, over the next decade to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Those cuts include $155 billion less in rural Medicaid spending over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers from both political parties fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see larger proportions of patients insured through Medicaid. This raises concerns that $50 billion for rural health aid might not be enough.
Hempstead County health care providers and law enforcement officers told Arkansas lawmakers in September that they need more money in order to meet Southwest Arkansas’ mental and physical health care needs.

(Screenshot)Federal prosecutors on Monday charged a man living in California with several drug-related crimes, alleging he was a key figure in an international drug smuggling ring that sent methamphetamine to New Zealand via several routes in the United States, including through Alaska.
In court documents, prosecutors say they arrested Zukai He after a monthslong investigation that began with a tip from a virtual-mailbox company in Wasilla.
Virtual mailboxes are like Post Office boxes in that they collect mail for a client and can forward it to a different address. The documents did not identify the company.
According to an affidavit filed by an agent of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the owner of the Wasilla business contacted the USPIS, concerned that one of their customers was being impersonated.
After an initial investigation, in January 2024 inspectors obtained a warrant and searched two packages that had arrived in Wasilla from California and were bound for New Zealand. The search uncovered “close to three kilograms of methamphetamine” (more than 6 pounds) concealed within two devices — some inside a heat transfer stamping machine, and some inside a 3D printer. 
In the affidavit, the inspector said that amount of meth was worth more than $1 million on the black market.
Further investigation uncovered more meth-laden packages in Arizona and Oregon, also bound for New Zealand.
Postal inspectors traced those packages to a store in California, then to He’s home in the city of Alhambra in Los Angeles County, where they searched the trash and discovered a small black bag that tested positive for meth.
Law enforcement obtained a warrant and raided the home, finding — among other things — more than 13 pounds of meth, worth several million dollars.
According to court records, federal officers arrested Zukai He on Tuesday and detained him in Tacoma, Washington. He is charged with one felony count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and if convicted faces up to 40 years of jail time.  
Prosecutors say He is a citizen of China and in the United States illegally.

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island CurrentGov. Dan McKee is urging legislative leaders to hold an oversight hearing on his administration’s handling of the Washington Bridge closure after a long-awaited forensic audit showed the state was partially to blame.
McKee on Wednesday evening sent a letter to House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson saying his office welcomed the opportunity to participate in such proceedings.
“Ensuring the safety of all Rhode Islanders must remain our top priority, and the ongoing issues surrounding the Washington Bridge demand thorough examination and accountability,” he wrote.
McKee faces backlash for keeping Washington Bridge forensic audit secret for over a year

Shekarchi and Lawson called for new oversight hearings Monday after Friday saw the release of a 64-page report by Illinois-based engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates Inc. (WJE) detailing what led to the Washington Bridge’s December 2023 closure.
In a joint statement issued Wednesday evening, Shekarchi and Lawson said they intend to meet Thursday to plan the schedule of the hearings and the format, “which may include putting state officials under oath.”
McKee in his letter defended the decision to WJE audit under wraps from the public as the state’s ongoing lawsuit against 13 of the vendors contracted to conduct maintenance on the Washington Bridge.
The draft audit dated April 5, 2024, was released Friday night by the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General after it learned an “unknown party” was releasing portions of it on Instagram.
McKee had first promised to make it public during a March 2024 press conference when he announced the bridge would need to be rebuilt. He wrote that his inclination was always to release it once completed but the state’s legal team advised against doing so  before the case went to trial to avoid jeopardizing the case.
“I was following a pathway to optimize recovery for the taxpayers of Rhode Island in the pending civil suit,” McKee wrote.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Emotional debate and rising tempers preceded a vote Wednesday on state House legislation to ban devices used to make semi-automatic handguns fire as quickly as machine guns.
The bill, which would add machine gun conversion devices, known as Glock switches, to Pennsylvania’s list of prohibited offensive weapons, was the fourth in a package of legislation aimed at toughening gun laws the House Judiciary Committee put up for floor votes last week. 
Action on the bills followed a series of high-profile shootings in September including the ambush killings of three York County police and the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk in Utah.
House Bill 1866 failed in a 101-102 vote when Rep. Frank Burns (D-Cambria) cast the only Democratic vote in opposition. As in the case of two gun-reform bills rejected Tuesday, Burns joined Republicans who voted unanimously against the conversion device ban. The House did pass a measure Tuesday with bipartisan support that would require background checks for shotguns and rifles, which is not currently required in Pennsylvania.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
During debate on the machine gun conversion device bill, a shouting match broke out between several lawmakers on opposite sides of the House after Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia) strayed into fiery rhetoric critical of gun rights advocates and their view of the Second Amendment as a bulwark against tyranny.
“Save me your self righteous speeches about standing up [to] tyranny when you do nothing to stand up [to] tyranny, consistently,” Kenyatta said.
The incident was not included in a livestream of the House floor and the only indication was Speaker Joanna McClinton calling for the House sergeant at arms to clear the aisle and for lawmakers to take their seats. She later delivered a stern admonition, saying she was disappointed by what occurred earlier. 
“I cannot hear what insults and slurs are said across the aisle to each other, but let me remind each of you, if you make threats, that could be a crime. That’s free legal advice,” adding that the sergeant at arms and Capitol police would conduct investigations.
“It’s one thing to give feedback after people speak or to joke and jest, but it is absolutely unacceptable and it will not be tolerated that any threats are made with the climate in which we’re blessed to be alive and serve, threats will be taken seriously,” McClinton said.
Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said in a statement that tensions are high in the Capitol for a number of reasons, but as elected officials, lawmakers must conduct themselves “in a manner that is reflective of this great institution and the fine communities we all represent.”

The bill’s prime sponsor Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny) said she advanced the measure in the memory of Brackenridge Police Chief Justin McIntire. He was murdered in 2023 by a suspect using a pistol that had been converted to fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds per minute.
“Chief McIntyre’s surviving family wants these senseless devices off the street, and so does every police chief that I represent,” Steele said, presenting a list of 16 municipalities where the top law enforcement officials back a state-level ban.
Also known as auto-sears or “Glock switches” for the popular handgun maker whose guns the devices are sometimes used to modify, machine gun conversion devices are small metal or plastic objects. They interfere with a gun’s firing mechanism, allowing the shooter to fire many shots with a single pull of the trigger, Steele said.
“This is not an infringement upon the Second Amendment. This is honoring the police that we have lost and stopping the heartache of losing one more to the insanity of 900 bullets a minute,” Steele said, noting that law enforcement officials in deeply conservative states have spoken in support of similar measures.
 “It would turn my stomach to see this body vote against our police by forcing them to have to continue to endure this madness because that is what a no vote is today,” Steele said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSC_0146-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 20:58:26.467063

Adepoju Salako signed a plea deal Sept. 24, according to documents filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska. As part of the plea deal, Salako will plead guilty to seven felony counts of wire fraud.
The Permanent Fund dividend is paid each year to eligible Alaskans from the Alaska Permanent Fund, the state’s trust fund. The 2022 PFD was $3,284; had the scheme succeeded, Salako would have received almost $23,000.
The maximum punishment is 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, plus probation, restitution and additional penalties.
Out-of-state PFD fraud is relatively unusual; most cases of PFD fraud involve Alaskans charged in state court for claiming or attempting to claim a PFD despite being ineligible.
According to federal prosecutors, Salako stole the identity of seven Alaskans and attempted to divert their dividends to a bank account in Salako’s name in Washington state. Salako had never lived or visited Alaska himself, according to court documents.
Prosecutors say Salako used a virtual private network to make it appear as if six of the seven the fraudulently filed dividends were being requested from within the state. In one case, the application showed Salako’s true location, in Philadelphia.
It was not immediately clear how state and federal officials detected Salako’s scheme. 
Aimee Bushnell, a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Revenue, said Salako was identified as a suspect by the department’s criminal investigations unit, which works with the FBI, U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General.
Speaking generally and not about Salako’s case in particular, Bushnell said it is common for the department’s criminal investigations unit to “initiate inquiries based on two primary patterns of fraud: applicants who fail to disclose relocation outside of Alaska, and individuals often operating from out-of-state or international locations, who attempt to defraud Alaskans through identity theft or other deceptive practices.”
Bushnell said that in addition to the PFD fraud, “Mr. Salako was further linked to a series of financial crimes occurring in multiple jurisdictions across the United States. The investigation remains ongoing, and authorities continue to pursue all leads to ensure accountability and protect public resources.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Even some anti-abortion advocates who are pushing for a stricter ban in South Carolina are opposed to a bill that advocates proclaim would be the strongest in the nation.
A Senate panel took no vote Wednesday after taking testimony for eight hours from nearly 80 people on both sides of the debate.
The bill, dubbed the Unborn Child Protection Act, would remove existing exceptions for victims of rape or incest, as well as fatal fetal anomalies. It would allow women to be prosecuted and sued for getting an abortion. It would become illegal to help a juvenile travel out of state for an abortion. Telling someone how to get an abortion would be criminal, as would ordering, making or possessing abortion-inducing medication.
Violators could face up to 30 years in prison. Doctors would also lose their license to practice.
Some people in the packed hearing room cursed at senators and speakers they disagreed with, both while testifying at the lectern and from the audience.
Multiple people were escorted out by Senate security. That included former GOP Sen. Penry Gustafson of Camden, who was briefly removed for refusing to give up the microphone when her five minutes to speak ran out.
At the meeting’s conclusion, Sen. Richard Cash of Anderson County, the bill’s sponsor and subcommittee chair, said he felt the bill needed more work. The one speaker he cited as convincing him to make a revision was a doctor who said the bill’s requirement to try to resuscitate prematurely born babies would be not only impossible but torturous.
Whether Senate Republicans, who gained a supermajority last year, have the votes to pass such a restrictive ban is unclear, though Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg, said he doesn’t believe enough senators support such a harsh measure.
Anti-abortion groups split
The proposal faces opposition even from groups that have been pushing for anti-abortion laws for decades.
They support a different bill that bans abortions from the onset of pregnancy, with exceptions. The law that took effect in 2023, which the state Supreme Court has upheld as a six-week ban, still allows too many abortions, they argue.
However, Cash’s bill goes too far, they contend.
The possibility of prosecuting women for having an abortion was the main reason for their opposition.
“Pro-lifers understand better than anyone else the desire to punish the purveyors of abortion who act callously and without regard to the dignity of human life,” Lisa Van Riper, president of South Carolina Citizens for Life, said in a statement. “But turning women who have abortions into criminals, as (the bill) does, is not the way.”
That group, which has worked to get anti-abortion laws passed at the Statehouse since 1990, also cited the bill’s provisions that force volunteers and workers at pregnancy care centers to testify against the women they help who go through with an abortion. That creates a chilling effect on the centers’ “life-saving work,” including on pastors, the group said in a release.
Only one sign could be seen on the South Carolina Statehouse grounds Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025, supporting legislation that imposes stricter bans on abortion in the state, including the repeal of exceptions for rape and incest, felony charges for abortion providers and the undoing of protections against criminal charges for women who receive an abortion. Hundreds of people gathered in protest of the bill. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)
The Palmetto Family Alliance agreed in a similar message: “For these reasons, we are unable to support this bill as proposed,” Steve Pettit, the group’s president, said in a statement.
Others argued the bill didn’t go far enough.
Some advocates asked senators to make abortions illegal from fertilization, as opposed to when a doctor can detect a pregnancy, and classify an abortion as a homicide.
“Failing to treat the murder of preborn children as homicide in the same way that we treat homicide of born persons violates God’s law, the U.S. and state constitutions,” said Mark Corral of Catawba, who leads Equal Protection South Carolina.
Questions over implementation
Whether the bill would limit in vitro fertilization and emergency contraception, often known as the “morning after pill,” came into question as legislators asked attorneys, activists and doctors for their opinions.
Cash insisted his bill would not affect access to emergency contraception or IVF, in which multiple eggs might be fertilized but not used.
An abortion, as defined in the law, happens when a woman’s hormonal levels have changed enough for a doctor to tell her she’s pregnant. He argued that comes after a morning-after pill would be effective or when a doctor would dispose of a fertilized egg used in IVF.
But that’s not how it might be interpreted in reality, argued doctors and Democratic senators, pointing to other definitions in the law. Doctors and lawyers wanting to be cautious might decide not to offer IVF or emergency contraception, they said.
Sister senators return
Sitting beside each other, in front and center for hours of testimony, were Gustafson and former Sen. Katrina Shealy, R-Lexington. The “sister senators” were among three Republican women to lose their re-election campaigns after working to block the 2023 six-week ban.

Shealy and Gustafson continued that opposition Wednesday.
Shealy called the bill “a dangerous piece of legislation that threatens the health and safety and fundamental rights of South Carolina’s women, girls and families.”
She specifically pointed to the removal of exceptions for victims of rape or incest.
“I want to remind each of you that y’all were elected to do what is right, not what will get you re-elected,” Shealy told her former colleagues, adding that she “did the right thing” with her “no” votes.
Gustafson said she knows some senators will vote “yes” even though they don’t support it. She asked them to have the nerve to vote “no,” regardless of what it might mean to their re-election bids.
She pointed out that the subcommittee consisted entirely of men. The 2024 elections left the Senate without a single female Republican. There are two female Democrats in the chamber, but neither was on the eight-member panel.
“Where are the women on this committee?” Gustafson asked, as Cash asked security to remove her for speaking after her time ran out.
“You got us pushed out so you could do this,” Gustafson said into the microphone, over Cash telling her that her time was up. “It is despicable, and you should all be ashamed.”

“Turn the microphone off, please,” Cash said.
“Vote no,” Gustafson said, as security officers placed a hand on her back and followed her out of the room. She returned to her seat a few minutes later.
Testimony
Outside the Statehouse, hundreds of people against the bill held signs and prayer vigils beneath a giant blow-up replica of an intrauterine device.
Opponents recounted terminating wanted pregnancies that went horribly wrong, with fetal anomalies that made them unable to survive. Some had to leave the state to get an abortion under existing law. The bill would have made care even more difficult, they said.
Even though Meg Southern Syms had an uncomplicated pregnancy, some of her friends did not, causing them to get abortions, she said. The bill, she said, would have endangered her friends’ lives by making them carry dangerous pregnancies to term, she said.

“When I think of the impact that this bill would have, I imagine my friends’ faces disappearing from Christmas cards and Thanksgiving tables,” she said.
Doctors worried about trying to parse what’s legal and what isn’t if the bill became law, including in emergencies. Some worried they might have to choose between the life of their patient and their own livelihood.
“I am faced with a legal minefield,” said Natalie Gregory, an OB-GYN in Mount Pleasant.
Supporters of the bill praised it for strengthening state law around abortions, often citing scripture and saying abortion goes against God’s will. In cases of rape and incest, the perpetrator should be punished, not the unborn child, supporters said.

In an email sent to members Tuesday night, the Utah Republican Party said “we urgently need you to submit comments supporting Map C,” which is one of five drawn by GOP legislative leaders’ retained redistricting expert, Sean Trende, that are currently being considered by lawmakers

“This is the only map proposed that contains the redistricting criteria and legislative boundaries needed to stop the Democrats,” said the party’s email, which also alleged “outside groups are seizing” Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process for a “‘blue takeover’ that would fundamentally change Utah’s voice in Washington.” 
The Utah GOP’s email warned that “the current push aims to give Democrats” two out of Utah’s four seats in the U.S. House, and that “if adopted, the Democrats could gain control of Congress.” 
Third District Judge Dianna Gibson will ultimately decide which congressional map will remedy the 2021 boundaries that she ruled last month were a product of an unconstitutional process after Utah lawmakers that year repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ voter-approved ballot initiative, known as Proposition 4, that sought to create an independent redistricting process. 
Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King criticized the Republican Party’s email in a post on X on Wednesday saying, “Appreciate your honesty @UtahGOP, surprising as it is, about putting in writing that Republicans are begging for the most rigged and the least competitive map. Embarrassing.” 
Compared to the 2021 congressional map that has since been voided by the courts, all of the maps currently being considered by the Utah Legislature would be more competitive for Democrats — but some would be more favorable to Utah’s dominant political party than others.

Map C would mix rural and urban parts of Utah, split three cities (Millcreek, North Salt Lake and Pleasant Grove) and split three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). 
A map drawn by Democrats’ hired redistricting expert Daniel Magleby and submitted by the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s only two Democrats — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, and Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek — would carve two concentrated districts around Utah’s most populated areas along the Wasatch Front and lump rural areas in two sprawling districts to the north and south. 
According to a news release issued Wednesday, the Utah Democratic Party “has not endorsed a specific map out of respect for the public process established by Proposition 4 and the court proceedings.”

“We’re encouraging Utahns to participate and share their voices, not coaching them on which map would advantage us,” King said in a prepared statement, which also criticized the Utah GOP for advising Republicans to support a specific map. 
“For weeks, Republican members of the redistricting committee have lectured Utahns about avoiding partisan commentary and keeping politics out of the process,” King said. “Meanwhile, their own party is flooding inboxes with instructions on which map to support — because it’s the least competitive — and how to defend it. The hypocrisy is stunning.”
King continued: “For them, this isn’t about fairness or following the law. This is about Republicans admitting they’re terrified of competitive districts where voters actually have a choice. They just admitted what we already knew, and they put it in writing.”
Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson told Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday that the Utah GOP is within its rights to advise donors and delegates as they weigh what maps to support and comment on. 
“There is no obligation for the Utah Republican Party to muzzle itself and not fight for what it believes in,” Axson said. 
He also noted the party’s efforts are separate from the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s work. 
“It’s ridiculous to conflate that,” he said. “The Legislature was told by the judge that they couldn’t (draw maps with) partisanship. And I’ll tell you, they haven’t consulted with me. I haven’t consulted with them. We’ve all abided by that process.”

Axson said the 10-day public comment period that ends Sunday — the day before the Legislature is expected to vote on a preferred map to submit to the court — is there for Utahns to weigh in. 
“It takes a special kind of arrogance to try to tell a million Utahns that they’re not allowed to engage in the process,” Axson said. “We are Republicans. We have every right to engage in the process. … Yes, the Republican Party is not going to just sit sheepishly on the sidelines waiting for Brian King’s permission to comment on things.” 
Axson said the party is encouraging Republicans to support Map C because it mixes urban and rural voices, which he argues is a better approach to get more holistic and nuanced representation in Congress. For example, he said school districts in Salt Lake County rely on funding from school trust land investments in rural areas, and issues like water and energy span across rural counties. 
“When you have an elected official who doesn’t have to be accountable to those other interests but still wants all the benefits that comes from that, I think Utah is at a significant disadvantage,” he said, adding that the state is already outnumbered when it comes to representation in Congress. “So to further limit our ability to have that unified voice of what Utah needs would be a detriment.”

While King said Map C would be the “least competitive” option, Axson argued that it would still be more competitive for Democrats. 
“Map C shows a couple of these districts drop from 70% Republican towards like 52%,” Axson said. “How much more of a thumb on the scale do they want?”
Axson also emphasized that his party is encouraging supporting Map C as “the best option among all bad options, frankly,” because they continue to disagree with the court’s ruling and would prefer that the 2021 boundaries stay in place. 
However, he also said that if Republican party members want to support other map options, “more power to them.” 
“We’re not the ones telling people they have to behave a certain way,” he said, while also adding, “the role of a political party is to promote and defend the principles that it believes in.”

The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is the latest in a growing list of incidents of political violence. There have been 150 politically motivated attacks just this year, and a 2000% increase in targeted violent plots over the past two decades.
What explains this surge in political violence?
Extremism expert Cynthia Miller-Idriss confirms that this is “the worst moment of political violence since the 1970s,” adding, “We are in an era of mass shootings.” 
She argues that rising polarization and “the common thread” of misogyny links many recent attacks. Miller-Idriss is the founding director of the Polarization and Extremism Research Innovation Lab at American University, where she is also a professor in the School of Public Affairs and the School of Education. Her latest book is “Man Up: The New Misogyny and the Rise of Violent Extremism.” She is an MSNBC columnist and regular commentator who appears frequently on CNN, PBS and other news outlets.
President Donald Trump has vowed to mount a government assault on “the left” in response to Kirk’s assassination. But a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies shows that despite a small uptick in “left-wing” violence this year, ”right-wing” terrorism has far exceeded all other forms of political violence in the number of fatalities and attacks in the past decade.
Miller-Idriss contends that most mass shooters, terrorists and violent extremists have two things in common: Nearly all are men, and they are almost always “virulent misogynists, homophobes or transphobes.” She says that the media — herself included — have long overlooked this link between political violence and misogyny.
The U.S. now averages more than one mass shooting per day. 
“Virtually every mass shooter in the U.S. has a history of gender-based violence in some way,” with 60% of them having documented histories of domestic violence or “stalking, harassment, rape threats, cyber porn, revenge porn, sexual assault, rape, anti-LGBTQ violence,” Miller-Idriss said. “Even when the targets are not very clearly women or the LGBTQ community … gender or homophobia really significantly play a role.”
Miller-Idriss highlighted two factors that make this era of political violence unique — the proliferation of guns and online communities that traffic in hate.
“We have a lot of shootings that don’t seem to have any ideological motivation at all but are really at the hands of extraordinarily online young people … who spend a lot of time in online spaces, in gaming spaces, in very meme-driven, irony laden spaces,” she said. Attackers “are kind of communicating, almost in a way that may be detached from reality, with online communities as part of the attack.” 
Shooters are “not just highly online but expressing a lot of online misogyny and gender-based harms or harassing teenage girls online,” she said.

Miller-Idriss said that even “everyday forms of misogyny” that she and other women face are linked to more extreme forms. She said she observed that in the hate mail that she receives that there was “a very clear pattern of containment, that what they wanted was for me to not be front and center.”
“There’s some sort of anger there about a person, a woman, being in a public space at all, and it makes you realize that phrases like ‘lock her up,’ ‘send them back,’ ‘get back in the closet,’ ‘get back in the kitchen’ (are) containment metaphors (that) are very, very common in everyday life directed toward women or LGBTQ folks who are seen as being too public or too flamboyant or too out,” she said.
Everyday misogyny “can evolve into a trajectory in which some young men are conditioned through online influencers to believe that they have lost their rightful place, that women belong in a more submissive role,” Miller-Idriss said.
“Some men are so easily mobilized to anger if they’re denied what they think they’re entitled to (and) that might escalate eventually into rage in a more public way,” she said.
Miller-Idriss and her colleagues at the Polarization and Extremism Research Innovation Lab work with young people to “off-ramp” violent online hate. 
“If you start to recognize that part of the problem of mass shootings and mass violence is rooted in very everyday harms, then you can take action on those everyday harms,” she said. “It should be an empowering message to say, ‘Let’s have a conversation about what this looks like, and let’s have a conversation about the experience of boys compared to girls.’”

(Getty Images)When a federal committee appointed by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voted to recommend that COVID-19 immunizations be determined based on individual decision-making with providers, it prompted immediate questions about whether people would need a doctor’s note to receive a vaccine against the virus.
However, a week after the announcement, Utah’s professional licensing division sent a letter to pharmacists on Friday clarifying that administering the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine is allowed without a prescription for eligible individuals over 6 months old — for now, and until federal agencies post their product-specific recommendations for the 2025-26 vaccine, which could say otherwise.

The state’s current vaccine administration guidance dates back to April 2024 and hasn’t been updated yet. The vote from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that individuals of most ages should do a risk-benefit evaluation with their physician, nurse or pharmacist before getting vaccinated.
“(Utah’s Division of Professional Licensing) is currently awaiting the CDC’s response regarding whether it will adopt, modify, or reject the ACIP recommendations,” the agency said in a news release. “The CDC’s decision could impact the future requirement for a COVID-19 vaccine prescription.”
Dr. Leisha Nolen, the Utah State Epidemiologist, said the letter confirms that pharmacists can administer the vaccine, which is currently available in many pharmacies across the state. 
“Most of our large pharmacies are giving out the vaccine. They’re full on,” she said on Wednesday. “But I would be a little hesitant to say that every place has it, because we know they didn’t know what to expect until Friday.”
Many local health departments are providing the vaccine, Nolen said. However, she advised calling beforehand to make sure it is available and check the necessary process to get it. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Nolen described the vaccine boosters as “really useful,” especially during the winter season, when COVID numbers tend to spike.
“We expect that to happen this year. So by getting this booster vaccine, your body just remembers again what it’s fighting off. So if you do get exposed, it’s able to fight it off a lot better and a lot faster,” Nolen said. 
Currently, an annual booster is recommended, she said. But that might shift as the virus changes.
“I think many people, many of our population, would benefit from this vaccine, and they should just talk to either the pharmacist when they go in to get the shot, or their doctor and make sure it’s the best choice for them,” Nolen said.
Those who contracted the virus recently can delay the booster, but four to six months after being sick, bodies start to forget how to fight the illness, Nolen said. That’s when it’s time to get a new vaccine.
As of Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified COVID-19 presence in Utah’s wastewater as “very high.” 
There was a “reasonable bump” in COVID-19 cases last month, Nolen said, but they are starting to come down.

Postal Service unveiled a new Forever stamp featuring former President Jimmy Carter’s portrait. Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderFormer President Jimmy Carter’s 77-year marriage with former first lady Rosalynn Carter was a defining feature of his life, spanning Carter’s career from a south Georgia peanut farmer to state senator, governor and president, as well as his post-presidency humanitarian work.
But, those who knew him say, there was another relationship that was just as enduring and central to his legacy: The one he had with the mail.
“It was postcards from his uncle that inspired a young Jimmy Carter to join the Navy and explore the world outside of rural Georgia,” said Beth Davis, the chief operating officer for the Carter Center who once worked as Carter’s scheduler. “It was love letters sent between a midshipman at the Naval Academy in Annapolis and the light of his life in Plains, Georgia that sustained the beginnings of the most enduring love story I have ever heard, and it was missives from his mother during her time with the Peace Corps in India after she retired as a nurse that set the example that a life of purpose and service doesn’t have to end because your career changes.”
Davis said Carter preferred mailed correspondence over phone calls and emails for almost every matter during the years she worked for him. 
Now, Americans will have a new way to commemorate his legacy. During a Wednesday event at the Carter Center, the U. S. Postal Service unveiled a new Forever stamp featuring Carter’s portrait. 
For many attendees, including Davis, a postage stamp is a fitting tribute to the former president, who died last December after spending over a year in hospice care. Wednesday would have been Carter’s 101st birthday. 
The art used in the stamp comes from an oil painting by Herbert E. Abrams, which was painted in 1982 in preparation for Carter’s official White House portrait. The Carter Center also released a new documentary Wednesday called “The President and The Dragon,” which chronicles the former president’s campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease.
Thomas Marshall, who serves as general counsel and executive vice president for the U.S. Postal Service, highlighted Carter’s political accomplishments, as well as his commitment to human rights and willingness to unite with those who were different from him, during a speech at the stamp’s unveiling ceremony.
“President Carter’s legacy challenges us to think differently about success and leadership in a world that often measures worth by wealth and power,” Marshall said. “He reminded us that true greatness lies in service to others.”
Jason Carter, the president’s grandson and board chair of the Carter Center, also celebrated his grandfather’s legacy of bridging divides with others during Wednesday’s event.
“My grandfather sought connection in places where you would think you could not find it,” he said. “His goal in life, almost, was to prevent this us-versus-them mentality.”
Federal government shutdown begins, with no easy exit in sight

But the celebration was not immune to the impact of present-day partisan politics. Carter’s birthday also marked the first day of the federal government shutdown that could furlough roughly 750,000 federal workers, and force others to continue working without pay. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, which sits next to the Carter Center and houses documents and other artifacts from Carter’s life, remained closed Wednesday due to the federal government shutdown. The former president’s childhood home and gravesite in Plains are also currently closed to the public.
“The situation that we have in our current politics is one of extreme division and extreme polarization,” Jason Carter said. “And I think part of celebrating my grandfather, I hope, is to celebrate the idea that it doesn’t have to be this way. We have the ability to elect leaders and to have leaders that can bring people together, and we just have to do it.”

This comes roughly six months after the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced an investigation into the University of Kentucky and 44 other institutions for “allegedly engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs” by participating in The Ph.D. Project. 
Capilouto said the organization “promotes networking among colleges and universities to create a pipeline for minority students into graduate business programs.” The Department of Education said in March, when it announced its investigation, that the Ph.D. Project “limits eligibility based on the race of participants.”

Capilouto also signed a resolution agreement on Wednesday that ends the investigation. As part of that, the university has 60 days to file a report identifying any other organizations that “restrict participation based on race” with which it has “agreement, membership or partnership.” 
Locating any other partnerships will “require a great deal of effort from a large number of people and units,” wrote Capilouto, who said he’s already asked “a team” of employees to begin the work of locating any similar partnerships. 
In a letter announcing the findings, the Department of Education wrote that even though UK no longer has a partnership with the Ph.D. Project, “the university endorsed, promoted, and benefited from a program that limited participation based on race through its payment of partnership fees and the support of travel for participants in the 2022-23 and 2023-24 academic year.” 
The Ph.D. Project has said it  helped more than 1,500 people earn doctoral degrees since its founding in 1994 as part of its mission to diversify workplaces and broaden the pipeline of business leaders.
“Title VI and its accompanying regulations forbid the University’s participation in programs designed to discriminate against individuals on the basis of their race or national origin,” that letter stated. 
“The federal government — in this letter of finding and in other policy directives — has made clear that it is closely scrutinizing what we and other institutions do with respect to our financial support of identity-based organizations — both on campus and through external agreements,” Capilouto wrote. “We must take that policy direction seriously. At the same time, we also must continue to take seriously our goal to be a community where different people and different perspectives can belong.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Capilouto.jpeg,,,2025-10-01 19:56:51.622752
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 23:41:09+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. John Larson: Being on GOP watch list is a badge of honor,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/ct-larson-homeland-security-watchlist-badge-of-honor/,U.S. Rep. John Larson said his inclusion on a Homeland Security 'watchlist' is a badge of honor that could help his reelection campaign.,"With one day to go until a crucial fundraising deadline, U.S. Rep. John Larson’s reelection campaign issued a warning in an email blast: The congressman had been added to a “Homeland Security Watchlist” and could use the support in the face of criticism from the Trump administration.
“We must support the members of Congress who have the courage to stand up to Trump and his authoritarian regime. John isn’t backing down, and neither can we,” Monday’s email read, with several links that redirect to a campaign donation page.
Connecticut Democrats in Washington have all been publicly outspoken since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has been one of the most visible, with repeated warnings about an eroding democracy, prompting the president himself to directly call him out on some occasions.
But Larson was the only member of Connecticut’s delegation who ended up on a list compiled earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It named Democrats and groups whom the agency characterized as having “hateful and violent” rhetoric, specifically in regards to immigration enforcement officials.
In recent weeks, his campaign has drawn a lot of attention to the department’s list in fundraising pleas, and Larson recently called it a “badge of honor.” It could prove to be beneficial — an inadvertent boost by DHS — as the 14-term congressman seeks to confront criticism from Democratic challengers that he and others in Congress need to do more to resist Trump.
Larson said he felt compelled to speak out because of raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that were happening in Connecticut’s 1st Congressional District — even as his office has experienced an increase in “threatening calls.”
“Based on what transpired in Newington, Connecticut, in my district, with mothers being snatched from their children, how could you be silenced? How can you not speak out on the behalf of those individuals? If [DHS] is offended with the analogy, where else have you seen in American history those that need to enforce the Constitution do so with black masks and weapons drawn,” Larson said in an interview.
The Department of Homeland Security compiled a list of more than 30 examples of what they characterize as incendiary remarks toward agents and personnel who work for ICE. The department called on those lawmakers and others listed to stop “demonizing” law enforcement. But the release didn’t issue any specific directives or actions beyond that.
Larson is the only person from Connecticut on the Homeland Security list. 
“Following the evil act of political violence in the country this week and two brutal assaults on our brave ICE law enforcement last week, we are once again calling on the media and the far left to stop the hateful rhetoric directed at President Trump, those who support him, and our brave DHS law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
“This demonization is inspiring violence across the country,” she continued. “We have to turn down the temperature before someone else is killed. This violence must end.”
DHS singled out Larson’s comments at an August press conference in Connecticut. In it, the visibly frustrated congressman shouted about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and compared masked ICE agents, who are conducting raids and arrests across the U.S., to the “SS” and “Gestapo.”
“This is not Germany. That is the SS and the Gestapo,” Larson said at the time. “This is the United States of America. Unmask yourselves.”
In response to DHS’ characterization of his remarks, Larson said Wednesday he didn’t see the remarks as hateful and said they were “intended to make a point.”
“If you’re not going to speak out about that, what are you going to speak out about? I wasn’t intimidated and won’t be,” he said. “If you’re offended by [the analogy], well then so be it.”
Larson took particular issue with masked ICE agents arresting multiple workers at separate car washes in Newington and Southington, which are both in his Hartford-based district. The congressman has co-sponsored federal legislation, called the “No Secret Police Act of 2025,” that seeks to bar ICE agents from wearing any kind of face covering and requires them to provide identification.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has called the DHS report “reckless.” And he called the Trump administration irresponsible for naming political opponents, which he warned could lead to more acts of violence.
Larson, 77, faces his first competitive primary since winning an open seat in 1998.
He has drawn several Democratic challengers, including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, 46, and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, 43, of West Hartford. They have called for generational change and questioned whether current members of Congress, especially those who have served for a while, are up for the task of standing up to the administration.
Larson’s challengers have called into question, both directly and indirectly, his ability to be an effective communicator and disruptor in this Trump era. 
“We can’t bring the change we need by doing the exact same things the exact same way,” Gilchrest said during her August campaign announcement. “I appreciate the work he has done, but I think we need elected officials who can work on multiple issues at the same time and can be out there pushing for change every single day, and I don’t see that happening currently.”
Without explicitly naming Larson, Bronin has also questioned how Congress currently operates and cited several lawmakers around the country, including Murphy, whose communication and messaging style should be replicated.
“They’re just communicating with a relentlessness and an energy that is different, and that’s what we need,” Bronin said during an interview with the Connecticut Mirror in early September. “I think we need to see that from every member of Congress. The job of being a member of Congress is different, and that’s what we need.”
But Larson has brushed off the criticism from his opponents, who, he quipped, were “the ones who nominated me for office” in previous years.
“I think the truth speaks for itself. And when you don’t have much to campaign on, when you say you agree with all the votes I’m taking and how I’ve conducted myself and what we’ve been able to do for the district, I think you gotta ask them,” Larson said.
Larson’s campaign has sent out a few emails in recent weeks with fundraising appeals highlighting the pushback he got for his comments and his promise that he “will not back down” to Trump. The most recent carried the subject line “Stop Trump’s Democratic Watch List,” with buttons to contribute money before the end of the fundraising deadline, which was Tuesday. 
One email linked to an article noting the same comments that landed him on the DHS list. The email said Fox News was “attacking me again for holding Donald Trump’s Administration accountable.” Another noted that Larson used to work as a high school history teacher and asked the reader to see if they could tell “if America were sliding toward dictatorship.”
The administration’s list isn’t the first time Larson has drawn national attention for his impassioned remarks about President Trump. He had a breakout moment in March where he complained that then-DOGE leader Elon Musk wouldn’t answer questions from Congress about Social Security and how federal cuts could affect the program.
While the primary is still in the early stages, the upcoming fundraising reports will offer a first snapshot of the financial health of each campaign.
Bronin raised over $800,000 in the two weeks after jumping into the race, according to figures provided by his campaign in August. Larson and the others will similarly need to post big numbers this month. All declared candidates will need to file the next quarterly fundraising numbers by Oct. 15.
The congressman’s most recent filing from July showed he had about $262,000 in his campaign account. (That report covered April through June, before anyone had jumped into the race.) That number is largely on track with quarterly fundraising hauls in recent election cycles, though he didn’t face primary challengers in those races.
Attention from the administration can be a double-edged sword. While it can help rally Democrats’ base and encourage fundraising, that scrutiny can also bring a groundswell of targeted pushback that can range from relatively harmless to credible threats of violence.
Debate over political rhetoric became magnified in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s fatal shooting earlier this month. And so have overall concerns on safety.
Lawmakers and political leaders are becoming increasingly worried about threats of political violence as both parties face more threats. Congress wants to beef up security funding with $30 million for congressional lawmakers and $58 million for the judicial and executive branches. They included that pot of money in short-term funding bills, but it has stalled indefinitely with the federal government in a shutdown.
Staff with Larson’s office said they receive an “uptick” in threats over the phone when the congressman calls out the administration like he has recently. They said they work closely with Capitol Police and local law enforcement to make sure the threat is handled properly.
“I worry about the people around me, about staff who are concerned, and I worry about my family,” Larson said. “But personally, no. Suffice it to say, when confronted with the right thing to do, you do the right thing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25273738975767-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 19:56:51.622752

Court sets Oct. 17 date for conference as Elk Mountain Ranch owner urges justices to take on “a 150-year conflict touching on the core of property law.”
The post Supreme Court to confer on whether to hear Wyoming corner-crossing appeal appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Supreme Court justices are scheduled to confer behind closed doors on Oct. 17 about whether to take up a Carbon County landowner’s lawsuit that challenges public access to public land at checkerboard corners in Wyoming.
The court listed the case Tuesday for its long conference later this month. Justices could decide within days of the conference whether to hear the appeal by Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman and his Iron Bar Holdings company. The court could alternatively push back its consideration to another conference or deny his petition.
Eshelman, owner of the 20,00-plus acre ranch, on Wednesday filed the last pleadings before the conference, urging the justices to take up the case and resolve “a 150-year conflict touching on the core of property law and, simultaneously, defining the American West.
“The question is whether the Unlawful Inclosures Act of 1885 implicitly preempts private landowners’ state-law property right to exclude. The answer affects property rights in 150 million acres of land in the Western United States.” Fred Eshelman’s attorneys
“The question is whether the Unlawful Inclosures Act of 1885 implicitly preempts private landowners’ state-law property right to exclude,” Eshelman’s attorneys wrote. “The answer affects property rights in 150 million acres of land in the Western United States.”
Eshelman sued Missouri hunter Brad Cape and three of his companions in 2022 for trespassing when they corner crossed to hunt on public land surrounded by his ranch. Wyoming’s Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl found that corner crossing in the checkerboard area of Wyoming is not trespassing and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver backed him up in March.
Eshelman wants the Supreme Court to reverse the 10th Circuit decision. Cape and his hunting companions say the appeals court was correct and that the Supreme Court does not need to take up the case. But if it does, they are prepared to fight.
Public land for himself?
Eshelman’s ranch enmeshes some 6,000 acres of public land on wildlife-rich Elk Mountain, land that can only be reached with his permission or by corner crossing. By blocking the public from corner crossing, Eshelman essentially reaps the bounty of the public property exclusively for himself.
The public and private property is arranged in a checkboard pattern of square-mile sections of alternating ownership. The hunters several times stepped from the corner of one public section to another, passing through the airspace above Eshelman’s property.
Eshelman, a wealthy North Carolina pharmaceutical magnate, sued the four for trespassing, even though they never set foot on his land. Wyoming Backcountry Hunters and Anglers aided the four hunters with fundraising drives to ensure they had the resources to be heard in court.
Wyoming’s checkerboard landscape runs along the southern third of the state in a 40-mile-wide band. The 10th Circuit decision applies to Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. 
About 2.4 million acres of public land in Wyoming and 8.3 million acres across the West are considered “corner locked” and inaccessible to the public if landowners can block corner crossing.
The 10th Circuit’s decision contravenes court precedent, “tramples state trespass law, and grants easements across thousands of checkerboard properties — without paying a dime of compensation,” Eshelman’s attorneys R. Reeves Anderson, Brian M. Williams and Samuel F. Callahan wrote. “[T]he Tenth Circuit’s interpretation ‘functionally’ granted respondents — and millions of others — a perpetual easement across private land.”
The hunters successfully argued that the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act prevents landowners in the checkerboard area from blocking public access to public land. Eshelman argues that the statute applies only to fences and unlawful acts.
“Iron Bar neither erected a fence- like barrier ‘inclosing’ public land nor used an unlawful means to obstruct access,” the latest filing reads. Suing the hunters is not an unlawful act, Eshelman contends.
Uncompensated taking?
The appeals court’s decision amounts to an unconstitutional taking of private property without compensation, Eshelman argues. “If a 140-year-old fence statute can be read to extinguish [state trespass laws], then no realm of traditional state property law is secure.”
The 10th Circuit wrongly “decreed that Congress in 1885 granted the public thousands of easements free of charge, abrogating ‘a cornerstone of the liberties enshrined in the Constitution,’” Eshelman’s attorneys wrote. That cornerstone is the property right to exclude others from one’s land.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) The committee handling the search for LSU’s next president has again accelerated the timeline for hiring someone for the job, with the goal of having someone picked by the end of the month. 
Christel Slaughter, chief executive of SSA Consultants, said her contracted firm will deliver the names of candidates Oct. 10 to the search committee, which will then conduct interviews through Oct. 20. By Oct. 21, the committee will recommend finalists to the LSU Board of Supervisors, Slaughter said. 
The board could then vote to hire a president at its Oct. 24 meeting. 
The university is filling its top job vacancy after William Tate left Baton Rouge to become president of Rutgers University.
Seven LSU students arrested at presidential search committee meeting

LSU Board chairman Scott Ballard initially said the committee aimed to hire a president by the end of the year, then modified the timeline to have a new leader chosen by Thanksgiving. Even if the next hire is made a full month earlier than that, the next president likely would not start until the spring semester begins in January. 
Slaughter said about 30 people applied for the position, with 20 meeting the qualifications and five to nine highly qualified. 
LSU can withhold the names of its presidential applicants until they become official candidates, who will then be made public after SSA Consultants whittles down its list to present to the search committee. 
Search committee member James Williams, a former LSU Board chair, pushed back on that process. He raised concerns about the search firm determining candidates’ qualifications without consulting the search committee. 
The committee intends to hold public interviews with the finalists. These interviews typically take place over two days, during which the candidates meet with various campus constituencies, such as students, faculty and alumni. The exact dates of the interviews have not yet been announced.

Activists who monitor Burlington’s airport believe that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are no longer moving people detained by federal immigration authorities through the facility.
“It appears that it’s an accurate statement,” said Nic Longo, aviation director of the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, of the activists’ observations. 
Longo said he has never been notified about ICE’s operations at the airport. But, he said, the airport would likely have had some indication of such movement, typically through activists who he said have been at the airport almost daily. 
“I can confirm that the advocates are here a lot, and I think they would see,” Longo said.
Activists noticed a change in August, they said, after they mounted a campaign documenting ICE agents moving detainees onto commercial flights through the airport. By mid-July, they told the Burlington airport commission that more than 450 people detained by ICE had been moved through the airport since January, and they claimed to have prevented ICE from flying three female detainees out of Vermont. 
On July 25 and 31, they recorded two instances of ICE agents moving people detained by ICE through nonpublic side doors of the airport. At a subsequent airport commission meeting on Aug. 6, about 40 Vermonters demanded the airport make it more difficult for ICE to transfer detainees.
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Longo has repeatedly said he has no communication with ICE over its transport of detainees on commercial flights. But because the airport receives federal grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration, he said, officials were obligated to cooperate with the federal government. Since the second Trump administration, language added to those grants states that airport officials cannot impede the efforts of federal deportations by ICE, Longo said. 
But communication with the activists has caused the airport to make some changes, including increasing signage related to human trafficking and posting signs on non-security doors noting that those doors are not accessible to the unauthorized public, which could include ICE officials, Longo said. 
“None of our security systems were ever breached,” Longo said. “The doors that I’m talking about are regular doors used for deliveries or employee access.”
The signage on those doors has changed to “authorized access only” or “no access,” Longo said, including a door that activists recorded ICE officials using to move people detained by ICE in July, he said. 
“We’re always improving our security, so these are all normal things we’d do to increase it, and in this particular case, it came from these positive conversations” with advocates, Longo said.

Activists say they did not witness ICE moving detainees through the Burlington airport after they recorded the ICE transfer on July 31. Instead, Burlington activists, who viewed photos and videos taken from activists in other states, believe detainees have been transported in unmarked vehicles to airports in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, activists told VTDigger. 
“But that doesn’t mean that they are gone for good,” said activist Leif Taranta, who collected Burlington airport data on the transfers. Across the region, they said, activists tracking flights at other airports had seen ICE withdraw when transports received scrutiny or pushback, only to return later. 
“This regional pattern of transfers is significant because it shows ICE’s determination to operate in the shadows,” Taranta said. “By moving people from Massachusetts to Vermont and then back to Massachusetts, ICE is attempting to separate folks from their loved ones and lawyers and make it increasingly difficult to find them.”
The type of pushback mounted in Burlington has spread across New England as ICE has ping-ponged between New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport and Massachusetts’ Laurence G. Hanscom Field, about 20 miles northwest of Boston. Activists allege that their work has complicated ICE’s work to move detainees, causing the agency to hopscotch across the region. 
“Whenever regular people simply shine a light on what they are doing, they shift,” said Julie Macuga, a Burlington activist who has helped Taranta track ICE flights. “If every airport in the region had a few advocates, we could really subdue the region’s deportation machine.”
Regional hubs
The two airports in New Hampshire and Massachusetts are by far the largest hubs for flights ICE operates both in and out of New England, according to a September report by ICE Flight Monitor, a data-driven project housed at Human Rights First that tracks such flights through publicly available aviation data.
Between Jan. 20 and Aug. 31, there were 269 outbound ICE flights from Bedford, Massachusetts, where the Hanscom airport is located, and 65 out of Portsmouth, according to the report. There were only six ICE flights among four other airports in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
There were no inbound or outbound ICE flights in Connecticut, Rhode Island or Vermont, according to the data. So far, ICE has moved detainees through the Burlington airport on commercial flights like American Airlines, according to activists and footage reviewed by VTDigger. According to an email from ICE Flight Monitor, the organization doesn’t have a method of tracking the movement of such flights.
The documented flights out of New England are part of 7,454 total U.S. immigration enforcement flights carried out so far under the second Trump administration, according to the September report. The flights include deportation flights and shuffling detainees domestically between detention centers and into deportation staging facilities such as those in Arizona, Louisiana and Texas.
The data has only been tracked since 2020. But the numbers indicate a 34 percent increase in ICE flights over the same time last year, according to the report. August had the highest monthly total ever recorded: 1,393 flights, or an average of 45 flights per day. At least 240, or about a fifth of those flights, were removal flights to Mexico.
“These findings make clear that the Trump administration’s current deportation campaign is both unprecedented and dangerous not only to the rights of those it targets, but also to our democracy,” the report reads.
Over the last two months, those flights likely included the removal of 69 people detained by ICE in Vermont, according to tracking by Burlington activists. Data they compiled through the Department of Correction’s jail tracker shows at least 37 people were removed from the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Swanton and the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington and transferred to flights out of Portsmouth between Aug. 16 and Sept. 2. 
Between Sept. 6 and 13, ICE removed 32 more detainees from both facilities and put them on flights out of Hanscom, according to the data collected by the activists and reviewed by VTDigger.
That coincides with ICE’s change in airport use. After a peak of 17 flights out of Hanscom in June, ICE chartered only four flights out of the airport in July and zero in August, according to data collected by ICE Flight Monitor and shared with VTDigger. 
Instead, ICE used the Portsmouth airport to move detained people out of New England. There were no flights there between March and June, but then ICE chartered eight flights out of Portsmouth in July and 13 in August before largely returning to Hanscom. In September, ICE hit its monthly record for 2025 in Hanscom, removing people on 25 flights by Sept. 29.

While the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission could not confirm why ICE shifted the flights, its members told WBUR it could have been related to publicity and protests about ICE transports there.
Then, activists showed up at Portsmouth too, according to reporting by New Hampshire Public Radio, tracking ICE flights outside the airfield’s chain-link fence since August. Volunteers counted 389 people who were boarded onto ICE flights at Portsmouth as of Sept. 4, according to the station.
Those flights ended on Sept. 5, according to an email from ICE Flight Monitor, when ICE’s hub apparently again became Hanscom. It was the day before the Trump administration launched Operation Patriot 2.0, an immigration crackdown in Massachusetts. That increase in enforcement was the reason ICE flights returned to Hanscom, an hour south of Portsmouth, according to reporting by The Concord Bridge.
“Massport is not notified if or when ICE flights operate at our airports, therefore we cannot confirm that any have taken place at Hanscom,” Jennifer Mehigan, a spokesperson at Massport, said in an email. Massport is an independent public agency that oversees Massachusetts’ three airports, including Hanscom, along with a shipping terminal and cruise port. 
Ripple effects of more ICE activity 
The return of ICE flights to Hanscom comes on the heels of a monthslong fight between Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and the federal government. In March, Wu was one of four Democratic mayors who testified before Congress in defense of city policies like the Trust Act, an ordinance approved by Boston’s City Council over a decade ago that limits the role city officials play in federal immigration enforcement.
In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to the city demanding it end the Trust Act. Weeks later, in early September, the Justice Department sued Boston over its sanctuary city policies, alleging they interfered with federal immigration enforcement. Bondi called the city and its mayor “among the worst sanctuary offenders in America.”
Half of New England was included on a Justice Department list published in August of states, cities and counties that allegedly impede federal immigration enforcement, including Vermont,  Connecticut and Rhode Island, along with Boston. New York State was also included, along with New York City and Rochester.
Data from Vermont’s Department of Corrections shows spikes in the number of people held by ICE in Vermont prisons for civil immigration proceedings during two immigration crackdowns by the Trump administration dubbed Operation Patriot. 
During the first crackdown in May, ICE arrested nearly 1,500 people in Massachusetts. While that operation didn’t include Vermont, the state’s prisons often serve as detention facilities for people detained by ICE in the region. In May, 79 people were held in Vermont, more than all those held between February and April. 
Then on Sept. 6, the Trump administration launched Operation Patriot 2.0, a second immigration crackdown in Massachusetts. By Sept. 17, 36 people were held by ICE in Vermont prisons, up from 30 in both June and July and 25 in August, according to state data.
‘Preventing the disappearance of our neighbors’
Now, the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission, a watchdog body with no real enforcement arm and that liaisons between the airfield and local communities, wants ICE out permanently. After ICE returned, commissioners drafted a letter to the leadership of ICE and Massport, along with legislators, town select boards and the Massport Community Advisory Commission demanding more information about ICE flights.
“It’s not just the ICE flights, but it’s the entire operation of ICE,” said commissioner Christopher Elliot during a Sept. 16 Zoom meeting. “It doesn’t make me feel safer. It makes me feel like this is an invasion.” 
“This whole thing is offensive to the majority of people in this region,” Elliot said.
Last Tuesday, the commission’s monthly Zoom meeting that usually lasts an hour went twice as long while commissioners and the public discussed the language of the letter. 
The letter sent on Sept. 17 and reviewed by VTDigger said that in order for the commission to carry out its charge of reviewing activities at Hanscom Field, they needed advance information on any and all ICE activity at the airfield, including the date, time and type of aircraft used to carry out ICE flights. The letter said they understood that ICE flights had departed from and landed at Hanscom for several months in 2025, but such activity had halted earlier this summer. 
However, commissioners came to understand, they wrote, “that ICE flights again resumed on September 5” and are “continuing daily,” the letter stated. 
But the commission’s oversight is limited. Airports like Burlington and Hanscom have repeatedly stated that because they receive federal funding they’re not allowed to discriminate against who uses their airport, including ICE officials and people detained by ICE. On the September Zoom call, Amber Goodspeed, manager of aviation administration for Hanscom, reminded commissioners that there wasn’t much she could do.
“ICE is not required to, and ICE does not tell us when they’re coming,” Goodspeed said. “We’re happy to get your opinion and appreciate it, but we’re not allowed to discriminate.”

Longo said the same about his role in Burlington. He disputed a notion raised by critics who described airports as “complacent” for allowing ICE to move detainees through their public terminals.
“We’re not complacent, we’re following the law,” Longo said. “In my professional capacity there’s nothing that I can do but follow the law.”
A response from Christopher Willenborg, director of Hanscom under Massport, on September 24, reiterated Goodspeed’s statement that Massport did not receive advance notice of ICE flights and asked the commission to reach out to ICE directly. 
Such a letter has been drafted, said Margaret Coppe, chair of the commission, and will go before the commission for approval during its Oct. 21 meeting. Coppe said that letter will be sent directly to James Covington, the spokesperson for ICE in Boston. She’s hoping that shedding light on the issue through meetings and letters will help inform the public. 
“I don’t know if (the commission) would say that (ICE activities) are illegal or immoral, but I personally feel that way,” Coppe said. She said their work was keeping up the pressure on the airport and ICE.
Burlington activists say the pushback by people like airport commissioners, while largely toothless when it comes to legal enforcement, can make a tangible difference.
“The fact that ICE keeps changing their flight patterns in response to public scrutiny and outcry shows that everyday civilians can actually make a huge difference in preventing the disappearance of our neighbors,” said Taranta, the Burlington activist.

But in arguments Wednesday to the Montana Supreme Court, the Attorney General’s Office on behalf of the city of Kalispell said even the right to record police comes with limitations, and the man interfered with the stop.
In February, the American Civil Liberties Union filed an amicus brief on behalf of Sean Doman, the appellate in City of Kalispell v. S. Doman, seeking to reverse his conviction on the basis his speech was protected and that he was not creating a problem for the officer conducting the stop.
Doman was later found guilty of obstructing a peace officer, with the Eleventh District Court affirming the conviction.
The amicus brief states Doman was riding his bicycle on July 17, 2022, saw a Kalispell police officer make a traffic stop, and decided to record while standing on a public sidewalk. A second officer, Officer George Minaglia, was called to the scene, and Minaglia told Doman to back up from the traffic stop. The stop was described as routine both in court documents and by attorneys representing Doman on Wednesday. Documents also state Minaglia was only called to the scene as backup because someone was filming the interaction.
Doman did move backwards, following Minaglia’s initial commands, and the officer agreed he had the right to record the interaction, according to court documents. The officer then asked Doman to move even further back. Court documents state Doman told Minaglia he wanted to record audio and was on public property.
Doman then said he wasn’t going to move again, and following that exchange, Minaglia knocked the phone out of his hand, and it fell to the ground, according to court records. Doman picked up his phone, kept filming and was again told to move further back by Minaglia.
Doman did move back, calling Minaglia a “tyrant” as he did so. The officer then knocked his phone out of his hand again, and Doman was arrested by Minaglia, court documents stated. 
On behalf of Doman, attorney Carrie Gibadlo and Matthew Segal, co-director of the ACLU’s State Supreme Court Initiative, argued Doman’s actions are protected under both the U.S and Montana constitutions.
“By commanding Mr. Doman to obey a no recording zone that was so large that it would have prevented him from hearing an event that he had a constitutional right to record, the City imposed upon Mr. Doman an infringement of his constitutional rights that weren’t strict scrutiny, both under the Montana Constitution because it impermissibly interfered with a fundamental right, and under the First Amendment because it was a content based restriction,” Segal told the Court.
Strict scrutiny basically means that if the state infringes on a constitutional right, it needs to meet the highest justification to do so.
Chief Justice Cory Swanson then asked Segal where the limit is for recording law enforcement activities.
“Where’s the line here? Because the officers are saying we’re uncomfortable with him being this close, distracting us, or whatever,” Swanson said. “Where’s that line? How do we figure that out?”
Segal argued there were circumstances where law enforcement would need to stop a significant distraction to their work, but Doman’s actions did not rise to that level. He also later pointed out that had Doman been photographing birds in the same location, additional law enforcement would never have been called.
“If they’re getting in the way, if they’re literally screaming in the ear of a police officer, those would all be circumstances in which sort of this kind of ad hoc police tape command could maybe be set up,” Segal said. “But here on this record, the court doesn’t have to confront those difficult questions, really, because there was nothing that Mr. Doman was doing that even arguably brought him close.”
Assistant state attorney general Thad Tudor argued there was sufficient evidence “any rational juror” could conclude the state had proven its case. He also added that Doman tried to communicate with the driver of the car as well and that his close proximity and distraction to the traffic stop were the crux of the issue.
“The testimony evidence establishes that that’s what Officer Minaglia encountered when he arrived at this stop,” Tudor said. “He sees a guy that, in his experienced opinion, is too close to the traffic stop.”
He also outlined the stop, saying the officer conducting the traffic stop left his car to assist Minaglia.
Tudor also added Doman’s “claim of wanting to record audio was nothing more than a pretext to be able to explain to the officer his knowledge of First Amendment rights.”
He went on to say Doman’s interference was shown “by engaging in a loud, verbal, profane fight with an officer who’s merely trying to ask you to back up, and doing so in a manner that requires other officers to come and take their focus completely off of the occupants of the stopped vehicle, to focus on this individual who has no legitimate basis for being there at that point,” Tudor said.
Swanson pointed out that filming was a legitimate reason, which Tudor agreed with.
“It is not a violation of the law to film a peace officer conducting official duties while enforcing the law,” Tudor said. “However, the right to record police activity is not without limitations.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HS1A0060-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 19:56:51.622752

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
On Wednesday, lawmakers introduced 11 bills for the ongoing special legislative session.
Some of the bills are the product of weeks of negotiations between Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate and represent their consensus on how the state can use record savings to prevent immediate harm from federal spending cuts. Those bills will likely pass. 
Republicans introduced the rest of the bills. Those are related to other issues, like ongoing troubles at the state child welfare agency, medical malpractice reform and harsher penalties for parents whose children are exposed to drugs. Those bills likely won’t get a hearing.
Any legislation outside the narrow focus of the proclamation will not be considered in the special session, said Senate Majority Floor Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe)
“Any attempt to hear it would be unconstitutional,” Wirth said in a news conference before the noon start. 
Below is more information about each of the bills introduced during the session, which Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth hopes will wrap up by the end of the day Thursday. 
If the bills below have been referred to the Senate Committees Committee, whether they are outside the scope of the session remains an open question. 
House Bill 1: General appropriations
Sponsors: Democrats
Current committee: House Appropriations and Finance Committee
House Bill 1 spends the money called for in other pieces of legislation. If lawmakers approve it, the bill authorizes the spending of nearly $162 million in spending over the next two fiscal years.
The money will go toward rural hospitals, tax credits for health insurance, food stamps for seniors and other areas. 
While costs add up to $161.9 million, according to a Source New Mexico analysis, lawmakers said that taxpayers won’t end up paying that full tab. That’s because much of the bill is funded by a $120 million transfer from a Health Care Authority fund for federal compliance. That fund, which has gone unspent for about a decade, is being transferred early. 
House Bill 2: Health care coverage changes
Sponsors: Democrats
Current committee: House Health and Human Services Committee
This bill seeks to give the Health Care Authority all the flexibility it needs to ensure New Mexicans who acquire health insurance via New Mexico’s exchange will avoid huge premium increases when tax credits expire later this year. 
Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) said at a news conference Wednesday that the creation of Enhanced Premium Tax Credits in 2021 made health care affordable for working families across the state. 
Without the state’s intervention, premiums could double next year for some New Mexico families. About 75,000 people buy healthcare from BeWell, New Mexico’s health insurance marketplace. Most of them receive some form of state or federal subsidy. 
“Imagine your monthly insurance payment doubling at the same time that economic chaos is causing other prices to keep rising,” she said. “For some low-income families, this drastic increase may need less money to put food on the table or even forgoing health insurance in order to pay rent.”
According to a fiscal impact report from the nonpartisan Legislative Finance Committee, the cost to taxpayers of paying for these expiring credits would be about $87 million over the next three years, as $17.3 million cost will double over the next two years. 
Senate Bill 1: Health care grants & stabilization
Sponsors: Democrats
Current Committee: Senate Floor, after passing Senate Finance
This bill transfers $50 million from the state general fund to the rural health care delivery fund. Various cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” mean that between six and eight rural hospitals in New Mexico could be on the brink of closure, according to warnings from New Mexico’s congressional delegation. 
Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), the Senate Pro Tem, said at a news conference Wednesday the closure would mean the loss of 1,300 jobs statewide as well as large swaths of the state without access to health care. 
In addition to the funding, the bill expands definitions of rural hospitals and gives the Health Care Authority flexibility to “stabilize the provision of existing health care services,” according to the bill.
“We want our small communities to have access to this critical funding,” Stewart said. “Access to health care shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code.”
The bill passed the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday afternoon.
Senate Bill 2: Criminal competency
Sponsors: Democrats
Current Committee: Senate Judiciary
This bill would allow the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court to determine competency. 
A fiscal impact report for the bill says it undoes a change the Legislature made in the session earlier this year when lawmakers required the Metro court to transfer misdemeanor cases in which a defendant’s competency to stand trial was an open question to district court. 
Senate Bill 3: Immunization rules and recommendations
Sponsors: Democrats
Current Location: Senate Floor for final vote, passed committee 6-3 along party lines
The bill expands vaccine requirements that apply to children in public schools to extend to childcare programs. The bill also allows the New Mexico Department of Health to create its own recommendations for childhood vaccines, instead of being required to follow federal guidance on the issues, which is the current law. 
Advocates for the bill pointed to the recent issues with attempting to purchase and to prescribe vaccines for COVID-19, following inaction and delays by a vaccine advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
New Mexico Department of Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie said current laws reference the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which limits the department’s ability to advance its own recommendations based on scientific standards set by professional organizations. 
She also said the current law prevents the purchasing of COVID-19 vaccines for insured children — which is the responsibility of the health department — because the acting director of the CDC has still not signed off on approval of the vaccine. 
NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham, said the state has never hit this “roadblock” before and is trying to get a work-around. 
“This bill will ensure that all New Mexicans will have access to vaccinations in a timely manner,” bill sponsor Linda López (D-Albuquerque) told Source NM. “We don’t want to be waiting and waiting on a decision from Washington D.C. — we can make our own decision.” 
New Mexico health official hopes special session will help ‘bulletproof’ vaccine policy

Senate Bill 4: Child best interests standard
Sponsors: Republicans
Current Committee: Senate Committees Committee
This bill would add a new section to the state’s Abuse and Neglect Act in the Children’s Code that spells out what must be considered when determining what is in a “child’s best interest” for the purposes of terminating parental rights or establishing permanent guardianship. 
According to a 2023 analysis of a similar bill, adopting those provisions would ensure New Mexico would join 22 other states that spell out lists of factors to be considered, while other states just offer general guidance. 
The analysis also cites an opinion from the New Mexico Attorney General, however, that some of the factors to be considered weigh against “families living with limited resources.”
Senate Bill 5: CYFD Secretary Nominating Commission
Sponsors: Republicans
Current Committee: Senate Committees Committee
This bill would create a new commission to nominate a secretary for the Children, Youth and Family Department. 
Several secretaries have left CYFD after short tenures at the beleaguered department, including as recently as last month. 
The bill would impose hiring standards on any aspiring secretary. It would also create a commission made up of those with master’s degrees or higher with at least 10 years of managerial experience and task them with submitting a list of nominees to the governor. 
Senate Bill 6: Exposure of children to drugs
Sponsored by: Republicans
Current Committee: Committees Committee
This bill would make empower police to charge people who expose a child to certain illicit drugs with child abuse. 
It would also allow authorities to take newborns into temporary protective custody if they are born with physical drug withdrawal symptoms or if the infant would be exposed to a laboratory where drugs are manufactured. 
Senate Bill 7: Child Delinquency changes 
Sponsors: Republicans
Current Committee: Committees Committee
This bill would make significant changes to the state Youthful Offender Act, aimed at cracking down on what Republicans are calling a wave of unchecked juvenile crime.
It would lower the age at which a juvenile charged with serious crimes could be tried as an adult from 15 to 14, among other changes. 
Republicans have repeatedly called on their Democratic colleagues to crack down more harshly on young people accused of violent crime, writing in March, for example, that, “Our juvenile justice system is broken.” 
Senate Bill 8: Medical Malpractice Changes
Sponsors: Republicans
Current Committee: Senate Committees Committee
The bill makes a series of changes to the laws around medical malpractice litigation, which advocates have said is one of the driving issues around a medical provider shortage in the state. Some of the changes include: limiting medical malpractice lawsuits to trials within the county the treatment occurred; removing lump-sum payments to patients; and adding a superintendent to approve settlements from the state’s Patient Compensation fund. 
Senate Bill 9: Interstate Medical Licensure
Sponsors: Republicans
Current Committee: Senate Committees Committee
The bill would enter the state into interstate compacts to “create another pathway for licensure,” for out-of-state doctors, advocates say would address the state’s shortage of medical professionals. 
New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House, but all stalled in the state Senate.
Lujan Grisham and Republicans repeatedly called for Democratic leadership to address compacts in the special session. Wirth said that the Legislature would make compacts a priority in January. 
While the medical compact bill will not advance in the special session, lawmakers have put aside $100,000 for the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department to study implementing future rules for joining an interstate compact.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1032-e1759359429280-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-10-01 19:56:51.622752

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)While some Kentuckians in Congress accuse Democrats of shutting down the government to get “free health care for illegal aliens,” advocates are warning that thousands of U.S. citizens in Kentucky will be unable to afford health insurance next year.
Democrats in D.C. are pushing Republicans to take action now to ease premium spikes that stem in part from policies signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this year. Republicans insist the health care issues should be negotiated after Congress passes a funding bill to reopen the government. 
In Kentucky, health insurance premiums on the kynect marketplace are set to increase by as much as 37% for individuals and 18% for small group plans, according to data from the state Insurance Department.
Open enrollment begins Nov. 1. Almost 100,000 Kentuckians get their health coverage through kynect, created in 2014 as part of the Affordable Care Act.
Health insurance premiums are expected to skyrocket across the country, in part because of rising medical costs but also because enhanced tax credits that have made the policies more affordable since the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire.
Insurers expect the higher premiums will reduce enrollment  — especially among the young and healthy — which will destabilize the market and raise premiums for the shrunken pool of remaining customers.
Insurers and hospitals also are bracing to pay for more uncompensated care in the future because of cuts to Medicaid the Republican Congress approved this summer.
Democrats want the funding deal to include renewing the health insurance subsidies.
Dishonest debate?
Kentucky U.S. Reps. Hal Rogers and Andy Barr are joining other Republicans in mischaracterizing the Democrats’ demands as free health care for non-citizens.
U.S. Rep. Andy Barr (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)
Rogers, who represents Eastern Kentucky, issued a press release saying Senate Democrats rejected the continuing resolution because they were “demanding nearly $1.5 trillion in reckless spending and free healthcare for illegal immigrants.”
Barr, who represents Central Kentucky and is running for U.S. Senate in 2026, also echoed the party line that Democrats are seeking “taxpayer-funded health care for illegal aliens” in an interview on Fox News earlier this week. 
U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie said in a Tuesday press release that Democrats should “stand up to radicals in their party and vote to keep the government open.”
Rogers’ claim drew a rebuke from one of his constituents, Christian Matson, who accused the congressman of lying about Democrats’ demands. Matson said he emailed Rogers Wednesday to let him know that he was offended by the congressman’s mischaracterization and worried about his own health care.
Matson, a self-employed resident of Pikeville who serves as a diocesan hermit of the Catholic Diocese of Lexington, gets health insurance through the kynect marketplace. He said covering the increased premium costs is “not in the budget right now” and could mean cutting other expenses including groceries and visits to the doctor.
He said he found it offensive and dishonest for Rogers to “lie to his constituents” by singling out immigrants.
Matson, who said he’s not a registered voter with either major political party, told the Lantern he reaches out to Rogers’ office regularly to voice his concerns on a number of issues. “If we’re going to have debates about how to solve issues in our country, we have to do them honestly,”  he said. “We need to do better.”
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible in Kentucky for coverage through Medicaid, the free federal-state program that pays for 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care, although there are exceptions for emergencies and pregnant women. “There’s no proposal to expand eligibility,” said Emily Beauregard, executive director of  Kentucky Voices for Health.
“Lawfully present immigrants” can buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
“We’re going to see a lot of people who just have no options for affordable health insurance,” Beauregard said Wednesday. “And I think that’s going to be a big problem for all of us.”  
Premium increases reflect several factors
Jason Bailey, the executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, told the Lantern that a wide swath of Kentuckians who utilize the health care subsidies could face “sticker shock” when open enrollment begins in November. 
He said Kentuckians who choose to go uninsured will still need health care and the costs of caring for more uninsured people would fall on hospitals or taxpayers.  
“The cost will have to be picked up somewhere as a result of people then becoming uninsured,” Bailey said. “I think it’s right to demand that these health costs aren’t allowed to spike.” Bailey said the Republican rhetoric about free health care for non-citizens is “completely false”  
A spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in Kentucky said the upcoming  premium increases on kynect reflect cost of care and the loss of subsidies. People insured through the Affordable Care Act marketplace have higher rates of accessing care and higher complexity of care, he said. “As an example, these members are utilizing the emergency room at nearly two times the level of our members with employer sponsored plans. Additionally, the enhanced premium tax credits — which will expire this year unless extended by Congress — have been critical to improving affordability for our members.”
Anthem has approved to increase premiums for individual plans by 24% and for small group plans by 18%.
Rogers, the Republican congressman, said he voted for the extension “on behalf of our military servicemembers who will not be paid until the shutdown ends.” 
“Political games have no place when it comes to taking care of our American heroes. Washington Democrats voted for the same short-term extension 13 times during the Biden Administration, but now they want to trade it for free healthcare for illegal aliens and nearly $1.5 trillion in reckless spending,” Rogers said. “Their vote to shut down the government is absurd. The American people deserve better.”

 One Kentucky Republican said, “Both parties are ridiculous!” 
U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, who has long had vocal concerns about the increasing national debt, said on X Tuesday evening that Republicans have “passed a line-by-line continuation of Biden’s last budget, including Doge-identified waste” while Democrats “refused to vote for Biden’s last budget, thereby shutting down the government.” 
“I voted Nay when it was for Biden and I’m Nay now,” Massie said. 
Kentucky’s lone Democratic congressman, U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, of Louisville, joined other members of his party in blaming Republicans for the shutdown. In a Tuesday statement he said the GOP controls the White House and Congress but “they would rather shut the entire government down than pass a budget that actually gives families a fair shake.” 
“I’m here in Washington to pass a budget that addresses rising costs like health insurance, but House Republicans are nowhere to be found,” McGarvey said. “They need to get back to Washington to work with us on lowering costs and opening the government back up.”
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear issued a statement saying, “The federal government is shut down because the President refuses to keep his campaign promises to preserve affordable health care for millions of Americans. I hope folks in D.C. will put American families first and reopen our federal government while also taking the necessary steps to preserve affordable health-care coverage.”

(Photo by BetterPhoto/iStock/Getty Images)As a shutdown of the federal government sends shockwaves through the states, Iowa’s colleges and universities are starting to brace for an impact that may not hit right away. 
Ag advocates also said the shutdown, coming in the middle of harvest season, posed a “major concern” to farmers. In the meantime, Iowa lawmakers and party officials traded statements assigning blame for the congressional gridlock that has prevented approval of stopgap spending measures to keep the government running.
Iowa colleges, universities see future fallout
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said higher education institutions in Iowa won’t take immediate hits in the form of layoffs or the like, but the move is leaving college officials worried about their programs, funding and getting the financial aid help students need. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the U.S. Department of Education’s contingency plan for the shutdown, disbursements from Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans will continue without interruption, as well as Title I and IDEA grant funding. “Any new grantmaking activities” have halted with the shutdown, the plan stated, and the Office for Civil Rights is stopping all investigation or review into civil rights complaints. 
Shields called the plan “pretty positive,” but added there are still things up in the air, like cases of colleges appealing canceled funding and grants from the U.S. Department of Labor. Staffing at the federal level is also a concern, as Shields said with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, students and families starting to fill out the form who have questions might have a harder time getting them answered.
“While the payments will continue, whether there’s going to be staff to answer questions or work through issues is a big question mark,” Shields said. 
This could be even more of an issue for state universities than it could be for community colleges, Shields said, as students applying to four-year colleges tend to get their FAFSA forms filed earlier than students planning to attend community college. 
The University of Iowa Office of Student Financial Aid posted a message online Wednesday stating that student financial aid will not be affected by the shutdown, and students making payments on existing student loans should continue to do so. 
The university’s federal updates webpage stated the shutdown will impact “several aspects of the University of Iowa research enterprise,” with delays in proposal reviews and grant award announcements and harder communication with federal grant sponsors expected. 
“Rhetoric” has circled the possibility of just-awarded grants being canceled, Shields said, and the shutdown has made colleges worried that the grants they received award notices for at the end of September might not actually come through. 
Some federal rulemaking processes have also been disrupted by the shutdown, Shields said, putting meetings on workforce Pell Grant rules and new gainful employment regulations. Both of those topics will have big future impacts on colleges, she said, and “a lot of eyes” are on the meetings in the hope that decisions won’t be delayed. 
“We’re hoping a lot of the things that impact our students the most are going to continue without issue, but there are several things where we interact with the federal government where it’s sort of unclear what that might look like, and there will undoubtedly be delays,” Shields said.
Ag and food impacts expected
County-level U.S. Department of Agriculture service offices will be closed during the shutdown, according to the department’s contingency plan.
Grain inspection and various farm grading services will continue to be available during the shutdown.
Iowa Corn Growers Association President Mark Mueller said the shutdown is a “major concern” to farmers who are in the midst of harvest season.
“Although the USDA has issued guidance to keep some critical functions operational, the closure of many local Farm Service Agency offices and the suspension of crucial market and crop reports are creating significant uncertainty,” Mueller said in a statement. “The Iowa Corn Growers Association is urging a prompt resolution to preserve vital programs necessary for feeding and fueling the world.”
The USDA plan also shows that animal and plant disease testing and research will be limited to those that have emergency status, like highly pathogenic avian influenza and new world screwworm.
A spokesperson with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said the department is still gathering “operational guidance” from its federal partners.
Iowa State Climatologist Justin Glisan said in an episode of Iowa Press, that he and other state climatologists would step in during the shutdown to help with the National Weather Service.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has funding for the month of October and benefits should not be disrupted by the shutdown for the month. SNAP could explore contingency funding options if the shutdown persists into November.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, does not have dedicated funding for October, but it can pull from unspent funds from past grant funding. According to the National WIC Association, the program has enough funds to run for one to two weeks.
Impact on federally funded Iowa workers unclear as Democrats, GOP debate responsibility
The employment status of Iowa public workers who are funded through federal dollars is unclear. The governor’s office and the Iowa Department of Administrative Services did not respond to requests for comment on whether Iowa would pursue furloughs for state employees in positions that are partially or fully funded through federal money during the shutdown – a response that other states, like Arkansas, have prepared for as the shutdown approached.
According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, there were 9,930 federal civilian employees in Iowa at the end of September 2024. This figure excludes employees in departments and agencies such as the U.S. Postal Service, as well as staff in the legislative and judicial branches.
In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democrats for allowing a shutdown to occur. Ernst said she was awarding Schumer the title of “non-essential government employee of the year” in 2025 for his “rudderless leadership, his petty partisanship, and his silly shut down shenanigans,” which she said will lead to thousands of federal employees being furloughed.
Ernst obtained a copy of a Congressional Budget Office report that found 750,000 federal employees are likely to be furloughed Wednesday.
“Instead of paying these bureaucrats for not working, the Trump administration may eliminate many of these non-essential positions altogether,” Ernst said. “Of course, our brave men and women in uniform will continue answering the call to duty without pay if there is a shutdown, as will other essential employees. But you know who will still get paid? The politicians who failed to do their jobs and caused the shutdown, namely Senator Schumer and the Democrats in Congress.”
All four of Iowa’s Republican representatives said they will forgo pay if the federal government shuts down. Most members of Congress receive a $174,000 annual salary, with the last paycheck issued on the final day of the month – in this case, Sept. 30.
Iowa’s all-GOP federal delegation has responded to the shutdown with calls for Democrats to end the shutdown by conceding on points like extending the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. But Democrats, including candidates running against Iowa’s GOP incumbents, said the Republicans’ refusal to negotiate on ACA premium tax credits will lead to increased health care costs for Iowans.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra voted for a “bad spending bill that includes the largest price hike of health insurance premiums in 15 years” and had “fled” Washington.
“Republicans are the party in power,” Hart said in a statement. “It is their job to negotiate with the minority party in order to pass bipartisan legislation and keep the government open. Why aren’t Iowa’s representatives in D.C. working to fix this? And why aren’t they standing up for Iowans?”
But Republicans have responded by saying Democrats are responsible for the shutdown, with the National Republican Congressional Committee launching a paid advertising campaign supporting the Iowa Republicans. The narrator in the ad states Democrats pursued a shutdown “in order to give illegal immigrants free health care,” and should be held responsible for the shutdown’s impacts on military troops, police and Border Control paychecks, as well as on funding going to farmers, veterans and disaster relief.
“While Democrats shut down our government to bankroll handouts for illegal immigrants and appease their radical base, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Zach Nunn, and Republicans are focused on keeping the government working for Iowans,” NRCC Spokeswoman Emily Tuttle said in a statement. “The contrast couldn’t be clearer, and Iowans know they have a fighter with Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn.”
There are also certain services provided through federal funding in Iowa that advocates  say will be impacted. The United Way of Central Iowa called for Iowans to use the number 211 for help in accessing support that is usually provided through federal services and assistance programs that will be paused during the shutdown.
“This moment calls for a united response, and we’re here to provide the guidance and resources our community can count on,” Mary Sellers, president of United Way of Central Iowa said in a statement.

Eagleton U.S. Courthouse in St. Louis, home of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Missouri (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).A federal case challenging the safety of mifepristone, used to treat miscarriages and to induce abortions early in pregnancy, is being transferred out of Texas to a federal court in Missouri.
The lawsuit demands the federal government restore its previous restrictions on mifepristone by requiring three in-person doctor visits, reducing the gestational period during which the medication can be taken from 10 weeks to seven and rolling back recent federal policy that allowed for the mailing of mifepristone and allowed for prescriptions to be made online or through pharmacies.
“This case has always been about ideology, not patient safety,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains said in a statement Wednesday, “It’s no surprise it has now been transferred to a district where nearly half the bench was elevated to the judiciary after undermining abortion rights at the Missouri attorney general’s office.”
Four of the court’s nine judges were appointed in May by President Donald Trump. Two, Josh Divine and Maria Lanahan, worked on the mifepristone case before their appointments.
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The initial lawsuit was filed in Texas by a group of anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the original lawsuit after concluding the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue because they couldn’t show they had been harmed. Erin Morrow Hawley argued the case in front of the nation’s highest court on behalf of the initial plaintiffs. She is the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.
Soon after, the attorneys general from Missouri, Kansas and Idaho refiled the litigation. The defendants in the case — the FDA and mifepristone’s manufacturer — asked that the latest case be thrown out. 
On Tuesday, Texas federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk declined that request and transferred the case to the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis. Kacsmaryk wrote that he had no jurisdiction over the remaining plaintiffs.
“Instead of returning this years-long case to square one,” Kacsmaryk wrote that it made sense to transfer the case to “avoid the costs and delay” that would surely come from dismissing the case only to have a plaintiff re-file it in another jurisdiction. 
Kacsmaryk said he chose Missouri among the states suing because “the Eastern District of Missouri is an accessible district with a major city.”
In his ruling, Kacsmaryk seemed reluctant to give up the case. He wrote that precedent “led every jurist who assessed this case to conclude that the original plaintiffs had a jurisdictionally valid case.”
But the Supreme Court didn’t agree, he noted, and “it is not the province of lower courts to defy the Supreme Court.”
Had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sought to intervene earlier, Kacsmaryk noted, he could have kept the case in his court as jurisdictional issues “would have easily been satisfied.”
Missouri judge says new ballot language again fails to mention repeal of abortion rights

Right now, medication abortion is inaccessible through Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri. 
Last November, voters codified the right to abortion in the state constitution. Now, a Jackson County judge is weighing whether to keep in place two state regulations that Planned Parenthood says are preventing its providers from performing medication abortions in Missouri. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office has argued in court filings that the lawsuit was filed to re-establish “long-standing safety requirements” for mifepristone. In ongoing court cases surrounding regulations around abortion in Missouri, the attorney general’s office has repeatedly painted mifepristone as a dangerous medication.
“The FDA has enabled online abortion providers to mail FDA-approved abortion drugs to women in states that regulate abortion — dispensing abortion drugs with no doctor care, no exam and no in-person follow-up care,” the attorneys general wrote in the amended lawsuit last year. “These dangerous drugs are now flooding states like Missouri and Idaho and sending women in these states to the emergency room.”  
They also argued that current regulations around mifepristone make it impossible to track and prevent medication abortions. 
“All of this makes it difficult for state law enforcement to detect and deter state law violations and to give effect to state abortion laws,” the attorneys general wrote. 
According to the FDA, mifepristone is safe to use if taken as directed. 
Cramping and bleeding are common side effects of the medication. Those prescribed mifepristone are urged to call their doctor if they experience heavy bleeding, abdominal pain or a fever. The same guidance applies to those who recently underwent surgical abortions, experienced miscarriages or delivered a baby.
Since the medication was approved for use 28 years ago, 32 deaths have been reported associated with mifepristone, according to the FDA. The report evaluates data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Last year, while arguing in court records that mifepristone harms Missouri and therefore the state has the standing to sue, former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey contended access to mifepristone lowered “birth rates for teenaged mothers,” contributing to a population loss along with “diminishment of political representation and loss of federal funds.”
“Younger women are more likely to navigate online abortion finders or websites ordering mail-order medication to self-manage abortions,” the filing reads.
Abortion rights advocates and medical professionals continue to argue that mifepristone is safe. 
“In Missouri, we are all too familiar with the attacks on medication abortion not grounded in science,” Margot Riphagen, president and CEO, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said in a statement Wednesday. “And continue to witness the detrimental public health outcomes as a result of politically motivated lawsuits, misinformation, and restrictions.”

BURLINGTON — A judge said he wants more information before agreeing to a resolution to the drunken driving case against Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos. The resolution could allow for the conviction to eventually be erased from her record.  
Superior Court Judge John Pacht said Wednesday that he was considering accepting a possible resolution to the case that would allow Vekos to plead no contest to the misdemeanor DUI charge against her in Chittenden County Superior criminal court. 
Pacht said Vekos’ sentence would be deferred for 90 days and she would be placed on probation. If after those 90 days, Vekos did not violate her probation, her conviction on the drunken driving charge would be cleared from her record, the judge said.

The judge said he would wait until he received the results of a presentencing investigation by the probation department before deciding whether to accept that resolution. 
He added that the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which is prosecuting the case, opposed that possible resolution, and he would consider their arguments at a future hearing before deciding whether to accept it. 
A date for that hearing was not immediately decided Wednesday.
The attorneys met for several sessions with the judge in his chambers Wednesday before ultimately emerging in open court during what was scheduled to be a hearing on a defense motion to dismiss the case. 
Pacht, speaking from the bench, told the courtroom what the parties had been talking about behind closed doors. He also offered a glimpse at why he may consider the proposal to be an “appropriate resolution.” 
The case has already been pending for a considerable amount of time and a trial wouldn’t be straightforward, he said. 
Pacht’s contemplation comes after Vekos’s attorney filed a motion to dismiss her drunk driving charge at the end of August. Vekos, who has served as the elected Addison County state’s attorney since 2023, was arrested on the night of Jan. 25, 2024, after she allegedly drove impaired to the scene of a suspicious death investigation in Bridport, according to the charging documents. 
It’s been over a year and a half since she was charged with driving under the influence, and Pacht estimated the case probably wouldn’t reach trial until early 2026. And even if it did, the trial wouldn’t be simple, he said.
“My understanding from both parties is that this is clearly not a slam dunk if it went to trial,” Pacht said. 
In the time since the charge, Vekos has had her driver’s license suspended for six months as a civil penalty. She has also completed a course on drinking and driving and engaged in counseling to get her driver’s license back, Pacht said, and followed all of her conditions of release while the case remains open.
“Typically a DUI is resolved within six months. This case is pending for going on two years,” Pacht said. 
Neither Vekos nor David Sleigh, her attorney, would comment following Wednesday’s hearing. Assistant Attorney General Rosemary Kennedy, a prosecutor, also declined comment. 
Vekos, 55, has continued to serve as the Addison County state’s attorney as the criminal case against her has been pending. And during that time, the consequences of her impaired driving charge appear to have directly impacted her office’s work. 
Since Vekos’s arrest, detectives with the New Haven barracks have sent all the cases they investigate to the Vermont Attorney General’s office, rather than Vekos’s office, to avoid a conflict of interest, said Vermont State Police Maj. Steven Coote in an email earlier this week in response to questions from VTDigger. 
Among the cases taken over by the attorney general’s office is the Bristol homicide where Vekos allegedly appeared impaired at the scene. 
The decision to move those cases stemmed from Vekos’ pending criminal case, which involves state police detectives from that barracks serving as potential witnesses, Coote added.
Vekos also had her law license suspended by the Vermont Supreme Court in March 2024 for about three weeks after she was accused of failing to cooperate with an investigation into her paid medical leave following her arrest on the DUI charge. 
During the time her law license was suspended, Vekos was able to remain in office, but she was barred from trying cases in court. Vekos subsequently faced criticism from local lawmakers who publicly called for her resignation, according to the Addison County Independent. 
Sleigh, in his motion to dismiss, wrote that the night Vekos was arrested, she had been at home.  For dinner, he wrote, she ate a hamburger and drank “most of one gin and tonic.”
Before finishing the meal, her attorney wrote, Vekos was called to meet with investigators at the scene in Bridport in a case that was later determined to be a homicide. 
After finishing up at the scene, troopers prevented her from driving her car home “based upon their purported observations of breath odor and slurred speech,” Sleigh wrote. He added that Vekos was eventually taken to the New Haven state police barracks for processing where she declined to take a breath test. She was then issued a citation for drunken driving. 
However, Sleigh wrote, body and cruiser dash camera footage from the scene did not “capture any such speech symptoms.” 
“The only evidence regarding alcohol consumption is Ms. Vekos’ admission to having consumed most of a single gin and tonic,” Sleigh wrote.
Kennedy, the prosecutor, in a written response to Sleigh’s motion to dismiss, pointed to charging affidavits from police who had reported smelling alcohol from Vekos’ breath.
At one point, Kennedy wrote, Detective Trooper Ryan Normile asked Vekos how much she had to drink that night and she reportedly replied she had one gin and tonic with a burger for dinner about an hour earlier.
Kennedy wrote that after Vekos declined to do field sobriety tests, she stated: “Are you serious Ryan, can’t you just have a friend come and get me.”
After Vekos was taken to the New Haven barracks for processing, Kennedy wrote, Vekos “encouraged” Vermont State Police Sgt. Eden Neary to use his “discretion” and allow her to leave. Then Vekos told the sergeant if he arrested her, it “was going to damage” her office’s relationship with law enforcement, Kennedy wrote. 
Kennedy also wrote in her filing that there is no evidence of how much alcohol Vekos consumed that night, beside her own “self-serving statement” claiming to have had one gin and tonic with dinner.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent)  Joshua Arnold bounced his young daughter on his shoulders, as he and a crowd of Boeing Defense workers yelled, “Stand together, fight together, win together” at a union rally Wednesday in St. Louis.
Arnold and about 3,200 Boeing machinists in the St. Louis area have now been on strike for more than eight weeks, demanding better pay and retirement benefits.
As a strike captain, Arnold works a 12-hour shift on the strike line, and he talks to the people coming in and off their four-hour shifts. 
“There are some folks that are hurting, and there are some folks who found other work,” Arnold said. “But most of the people that I talk to are still fired up, and they’re angry at the way the company is bargaining with us, too. It’s just been blatantly disrespectful.”
That anger was apparent among the crowd of more than 200 people at the Wednesday rally, held at the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 Union Hall in Hazelwood, Mo.
On Monday, Boeing and union representatives met with a federal mediator, in an effort to find a path to end the strike. 
But both parties issued statements Monday that the negotiations failed. The union said Boeing refused to budge, and the company said union reps came to the table with “unrealistic” expectations. 
“As we have said multiple times, we are open to constructive feedback from the union within the overall economics of our offer, which is at the top of the market for Midwest manufacturing,” according to a statement Boeing issued Monday.
The union said, “The way to end this strike continues to be the sensible pre-ratified offer that was approved by our membership. We are available when the company has an improved offer. Continue to stand strong!”
Last month, workers voted to approve a union-proposed contract, a four-year contract proposal that includes a $10,000 ratification bonus instead of the $4,000 bonus Boeing proposed. It also addresses one of the workers’ biggest concerns of pay raises for top-of-scale members and 401(k) benefits, union leaders said. 
On Monday, the union offered a modified version of the contract, but didn’t give specifics.
Democratic Missouri Sen. Doug Beck of Affton, who attended the rally, said he believes the union’s demands are feasible for Boeing.

“If you see what Boeing does and if you see what these folks do, especially keeping our country safe, you have to put a high priority on that,” Beck said. “A lot of these folks are the highest trained in the country.”
According to a union statement announcing the strike on Aug. 4, its members “assemble and maintain advanced aircraft and weapons systems, including the F-15, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies.”
Arnold and several workers said Boeing continues to send the message that their employees are expendable. 
“That’s how they view us,” Arnold said. “We’re just a factor of production, no more than a piece of wood or a wrench, and their sole focus is the bottom line, trying to get their product produced for as little as possible.”
After members voted down Boeing’s second offer, the company announced its plan to hire replacement workers. Boeing assembly mechanic Rodney Herd thought people would get scared, but they’re still there. 
“My personal feeling is that the company doesn’t care about us,” he said. “They just want to replace us, even though it takes a long time to acquire the skills we have. It’s a slap in the face to us.”
Now some employees believe the company will try to push strike out into the holidays. 
“They can provide for their families for the holidays, but our health care is gone,” Herd said. “Everything’s gone now.”
Many workers, Herd said, have started to look for permanent work somewhere else. Others have found temporary jobs while the strike continues. 
“The offer we gave them is pretty fair,” Herd said. “They just want to keep saying we’re not worth it.”

Hosemann sets sights on Jackson economic development and housing,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/01/lt-gov-hosemann-sets-sights-on-jackson-economic-development-and-housing/,"Exactly three months after Jackson Mayor John Horhn took office, his former colleagues in the state Senate are announcing a new emphasis on boosting the capital city’s economy.","Exactly three months after Jackson Mayor John Horhn took office, his former colleagues in the state Senate are announcing a new emphasis on boosting the capital city’s economy. 
Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann’s announcement did not detail any proposed policy changes — such as new criminal laws Horhn has floated to hold absent landlords accountable or quick-take blighted property — but the formation and membership of a new study committee on Jackson.
“With the city entering a new chapter, the time is now to pursue opportunities that will increase tourism, attract investment, enhance downtown, and promote future growth,” Hosemann, a northeast Jackson resident, said in the Wednesday press release.
The Jackson study committee in the Senate echoes work of a similar body on the House side, House Speaker Jason White’s Select Committee on Capital and Metro Revitalization formed last year. That committee’s work led to the passage of laws banning public camping, strengthening enforcement against squatting, requiring panhandlers to secure government permits and introducing incentives for developers to improve blighted property in the state.

A second new Senate study committee announced Wednesday will look at the shortage of attainable housing and increasing accessibility for first-time homebuyers statewide.
A Republican from Ridgeland and operator of a commercial real estate firm in Jackson, Sen. Walter Michel, will chair the Jackson study committee. Michel did not return a request for comment by press time. 
Sen. David Blount, a Democrat who represents a district covering downtown and central Jackson, will serve as vice chair.
Blount said he’s repeatedly supported legislation, which has passed the Senate before dying in the House, to move state agency offices currently leasing space in the metro to downtown. The proposal saves the state money with cheaper leases, Blount said, plus it helps revitalize an area currently working to reverse a decades-long hollowing out.
“I believe that’s a win-win for the state,” Blount said.
Blount hopes leaders on each committee will get on the same page about legislation to benefit Jackson before the 2026 session begins.
Committee hearings will take place in coming months.
The Senate Study Committee on Jackson members are Sen. Walter Michel, R-Ridgeland (chair), Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson (vice chair), Sen. Sollie Norwood, D-Jackson (vice chair), Sen. Hillman Frazier, D-Jackson, Sen. Dean Kirby, R-Pearl, Sen. Brian Rhodes, R-Pelahatchie, and Sen. Andy Berry, R-Magee.

(Photo via Google Maps)The Iowa Department of Natural Resources finalized a discharge permit for the Ottumwa Generating Station, a coal-fired power station, after months of opposition from members of the public and environmental groups. 
The final permit amends discharge limits for a wastewater outfall at the plant, but opponents alleged the permit amendments allowed the coal plant to skirt federal regulations on discharging leachate, wastewater that has mixed with the byproducts of burning coal. 
At a public hearing Sept. 3 on the permit, DNR staff said the permit did not allow leachate to be discharged from the facility and that no leachate is discharged from the generating station.

In the department’s responsiveness summary, published Monday in response to the public hearing and other submitted comments, the department noted “there were no comments received that were germane to the proposed amendment.” Most of the comments related to leachate or underdrain, another byproduct of coal ash waste.
The nearby Ottumwa Midland Landfill, which like the generating station is owned by Alliant Energy’s Interstate Power and Light Company, does produce leachate but trucks the majority of this leachate to the city’s wastewater treatment facility. The discharge of this treated leachate is under the city’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permit. 
Representatives from environmental groups at the hearing said IPL’s decision to transport leachate to the city could not be a long-term solution as changes to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s effluent limitation guidelines meant coal burning facilities could not discharge leachate through municipal waste stations by 2027. 
DNR staff agreed. In the department’s responsiveness summary DNR said it had since worked to revise the permit between IPL and the City of Ottumwa, to include a provision that “there shall be no discharge of coal combustion residual leachate generated on and after May 9, 2027.” 
Michael Schmidt, general counsel for the Iowa Environmental Council, said “pushing” the EPA requirements to the city “is not what the rules intend.” 
“This is not a step toward protecting human and ecosystem health,” Schmidt said in a statement about DNR’s approval of the permit. 
Schmidt said while federal deadlines create compliance, they don’t require a company to “develop a plan for its discharge.”
DNR holds in its responsiveness summary that since the generating station does not discharge leachate through its NPDES permit, the department has “no authority to include ELG limits applicable to leachate in the proposed amendment.”
EPA announced Monday a proposal to extend compliance deadlines for the effluent limitation guidelines as they apply to coal-fired power plants. According to EPA this decision “will allow facilities to respond to increases in demand and provide energy reliability for Americans” while the agency gathers more information on feasibility of the guidelines.
According to the Sierra Club, this delay could result in “more than two million pounds of toxic and heavy metal coal ash pollution in Iowa’s waterways every year.” 
“Every day that the EPA allows coal companies to skirt the guidelines and evade these critical updates to the Effluent Limitation Guidelines, Americans will be exposed to higher levels of toxic pollution,” Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Director Laurie Williams said in a statement. “Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food.” 
Sierra Club has also been opposed to the amended permit for the plant in Ottumwa that regulates the plant’s discharges into the Des Moines River. 
Josh Smith, senior attorney for Sierra Club, said the environmental group is “incredibly disappointed” by the DNR’s approval of the permit, which he said allows the plant to “continue polluting” the Des Moines River, which serves as a drinking water source for communities downstream.
“Ottumwa and the surrounding communities should not be burdened with protecting themselves from the coal plant’s toxic discharge and pollution, especially when the utilities could transition to safe, clean energy sources instead,” Smith said in an emailed statement. “We are exploring next steps and will continue to work in front of the DNR to fight for Iowa’s right to clean water.”
Several public comments about the permit were related to the presence of heavy metals and radionuclides and their impact on the people of Ottumwa as downstream users. 
DNR said in its response that pollutant limits in the NPDES permit are set to protect drinking water, recreation and aquatic life. It said drinking water distributed by the city must also meet safe drinking water standards for the pollutants mentioned. 
The finalized permit from DNR is valid for the Ottumwa Generating Station through May 31, 2029.

(Photo by Allison Joyce/Getty Images)Former North Carolina Congressman Madison Cawthorn announced on Wednesday his bid to return to Congress – this time, representing the state of Florida.
Cawthorn said he had been pondering a return to politics for some time, but the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk helped him make the decision.
“There is only one course of action for those of us who want to live in a free, prosperous, and safe land to do: Be extremely shrewd, fearless in the face of backlash and resistance, and to stand up and fight for our country,” Cawthorn wrote Wednesday on social media. “The left here and abroad knew they could never beat Charlie in a debate so they shot him. Well in his place 10,000 more will rise. This is what I am capable of doing, I hope you have the courage to do what you’re capable of doing.”
Cawthorn, now 30, was the youngest member of Congress when he was elected to North Carolina’s 11th congressional district in 2020.
He lost his Republican primary in 2022 to current Rep. Chuck Edwards, who went on to win the general election.
Cawthorn hopes voters in Florida’s 19th congressional district, represented by Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, will return him to the U.S. House of Representatives. Donalds opted to run for governor in 2026 rather than run for reelection.
A one-time rising star in North Carolina Republican politics, Cawthorn notably appeared at the Jan. 6th rally ahead of the Capitol riot, questioning the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. He used his extensive social media following to falsely claim the election was stolen from Donald Trump.
But he drew Republican backlash with claims that his colleagues on the Hill used cocaine and invited him to an orgy.
After those comments, photos leaked of Cawthorn wearing women’s lingerie.
U.S. Senator Thom Tillis called on the House Ethics Committee to investigate Cawthorn in April 2022 for possible insider trading.
Leading up to his North Carolina primary, a political opposition group leaked a sexually suggestive video of Cawthorn, who described it as “crass” and said it was made years before with a friend.
“Blackmail won’t win. We will,” said Cawthorn at the time.
Other run-ins with the law include citations for speeding and driving with a revoked license. In 2023, he pleaded guilty to carrying a loaded handgun through a checkpoint at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
In a video released Wednesday announcing his Florida campaign, Cawthorn said that he is running for Congress to stand with President Trump and “defeat the radical left every single time.”
Western Carolina University political scientist Chris Cooper tells NC Newsline it’s going to be tough for Cawthorn to find electoral success in Florida’s 19th congressional district.
“His past behavior and dalliances with the law are certain to be brought up in what was already a crowded primary field. He can’t even argue that these indiscretions are all dated — he was charged with failure to appear in court just three weeks ago,” Cooper said. “If he can make it out of the primary, of course, his odds will increase considerably as Donald Trump won the district by more than 20 percentage points in 2024.”
Cawthorn’s campaign ad features him speaking at a Turning Point USA event, along with a 2020 tweet with an endorsement by Kirk.
Cooper said he expects to see a spate of candidates in 2026 cite Kirk’s death as a factor in their decision to run for Congress. With Cawthorn, though, Cooper said it is worth noting that he was rumored to be planning his return to Congress a week before Kirk’s assassination.
Cawthorn has said he will focus his Florida campaign on fighting insurance costs, crime, and illegal immigration.

The Michigan Legislature, after going all night on Tuesday to pass a continuation budget to avoid a government shutdown, spent Wednesday hashing out further details of the state’s K-12 schools budget for the current fiscal year.
A much discussed deal on school funding still needs to be hashed out in a joint House and Senate conference, but Republican lawmakers in the House gave reporters at least some indication Wednesday on what per-pupil funding might look like, as well as other areas of the full budget deal.
Schools are without state funding due to the long budget impasse that has yet to be fully resolved, despite the Republican-controlled House, the Democratic-led Senate and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s budget team coming to a final agreement on how to fund the government.
Lawmakers on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning reached that deal but failed to get a budget in place before the new 2025-26 fiscal year, which began at 12:01 a.m.. A shutdown lasted for just one hour due to the respective sides agreeing to take up the House’s shutdown prevention plan passed in March.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Still, several school districts have said they were foregoing offering free school meals and have laid off staff in the wake of the uncertainty over the lack of funding from the state and when they might receive their first school aid payments, which typically go out in late October.
Whitmer and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Michael Rice urged schools to keep funding school meals because the money was coming, insinuating that free breakfast and lunch were going to be a big part of the final budget when it finally gets to the governor’s desk.
Both the House and Senate held session on Wednesday, in which the House took up the Senate’s education budget bill passed earlier this year – Senate Bill 166 – with a few changes. When it was kicked back to the Senate, the upper chamber rejected the House’s changes and sent the bill to the conference committee. That will give the committee a chance to hammer out further details.
State Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters after the House session that the deal on funding the whole of state government is pretty much settled, and the next step in the process was to sort out the school aid budget.
“The [education budget] bill continues to be written, and in the face of time, we had a … continuation. Both of these [government funding and education] bills will go to conference,” Bollin said.

A large unknown was how much per-pupil funding schools would receive in the final budget.
Bollin finally broke through the noise on Wednesday and told reporters that it would be record funding at $10,050 per student. The budget would also provide for school meals, potentially as its own line item – a win for the Senate and Democrats writ large who fought for that funding to remain in the budget.
Higher education will still be potentially funded by taking dollars away from the school aid fund that provides dollars to K-12 education, but Bollin said they were working to make the school aid fund whole. Additional funding for K-12 schools could come in the form of supplemental budgets passed later in the year or in the next session of the Legislature, which begins in January.
Bollin did say that universities would see increased funding across the board. 
The House appropriations chair also said that there will be money for northern Michigan emergency relief following the late season ice storm that rocked communities in the early spring, as well as support for public safety. The budget would also provide Medicaid funding, although the exact numbers have yet to be revealed.
On the total number of the state government budget, Bollin said it is likely closer to the House’s spending proposal of $78.5 billion than the Senate’s $86 billion plan.
Road funding is one of the biggest pieces of the budget, which has been said to be coming in at just under $2 billion, but it would also require new revenue. One area of funding that has drawn concern is a proposed wholesale 24% tax on marijuana products sold at dispensaries across Michigan. Industry leaders and consumers have expressed outright opposition to the new tax and have threatened lawsuits if it passes.
Lawmakers said they were working to reduce that number on Tuesday before much of the budget action occurred later in the evening. It’s unclear what progress has been made toward that goal, if any.
Bollin was asked if she was confident about the new tax passing in the respective chambers. She said she was confident, but it remains to be seen if the Senate has the votes to push it through.
The Senate is also now publicly posting its proposed earmarks online, a change of pace that the House instituted for this year’s cycle and made it a point to impress upon the Senate a necessity for reform in the process. The Senate budging on that was a part of the negotiating process and GOP leaders in the House marked that as a win.
A hearing is planned for noon on Thursday before the Senate Appropriations Committee. The joint legislative conference committee on the final budget deal is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. or whenever committees are given leave to meet Thursday.
Bollin also discussed the continuation budget and what it meant for state workers.
“We don’t miss a beat, so the place we were at on 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 30, we were at the same place at 12:05 a.m. [Oct. 1],” Bollin said. “It will be seamless. Business will go on as usual for all state employees, and that also means for all our constituent taxpayers that are seeking out state services.”

“We'll have to see how long this shutdown continues,” Gov. Phil Scott said. He said the state government will be doing all it can to mitigate the effects.

As lawmakers in Washington appear far from reaching a deal to reopen the federal government, leaders in Vermont are monitoring what the shutdown could mean for the Green Mountain State. On Wednesday, many said it all depends on the length of the stalemate.
“I’m not aware of any immediate impacts of any significance,” Gov. Phil Scott said at his weekly press conference Wednesday. “We’ll have to see how long this shutdown continues.”
His administration had previously directed state government leaders to draw down as much federal funding as possible in preparation, Scott said. But the governor acknowledged Vermonters’ concerns regarding what a shutdown could mean for them.

“They hear the government’s going to shut down, ‘We may lose this benefit or that benefit,’ and they wonder, ‘How can I survive?” he said. “So from our perspective, we want them to know we will do everything we can to protect Vermonters during this trying time.”
Starting Oct. 1, with lawmakers unable to reach a deal, the federal government has ceased nonessential functions. About 6,600 federal employees live in Vermont, as of August, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Many of those workers will not receive their regular paychecks, and local businesses with federal contracts may also stop receiving money while the shutdown continues. 
Furloughed federal employees in Vermont can apply for unemployment insurance as of Wednesday, according to the Vermont Department of Labor.
“Our goal is to ensure that those who have been impacted understand their options, know what documentation will be required, and feel prepared to access unemployment benefits if eligible,” Kendal Smith, the department’s commissioner, said in a press release.
Furloughed workers have two weeks to apply and will need to repay benefits to the state if the federal government eventually approves backpay, the department said. 
In a separate press conference Wednesday, Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or 3SquaresVT — benefits for Vermonters should remain stable for the time being, given preparations program administrators have made in advance of the shutdown. But he cautioned that current available funds won’t last forever.
“It all is a matter of how long the shutdown lasts for,” Pieciak said, adding that the state’s communication with the federal government as new SNAP policies are implemented may become “quite challenging.” A Republican-led bill approved in July makes a number of significant changes to the program’s administration and eligibility that began to take effect Wednesday. 
Anore Horton, the executive director of Hunger Free Vermont, said 3SquaresVT participants would receive uninterrupted benefits unless the shutdown continues into November. Application processing for newcomers to the program will “continue as usual” for the time being at the state level, she said.
At Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, there has been no immediate impact of the shutdown, according to Jeff Bartley, the airport’s director of innovation and marketing.
Three different federal partners work at the airport, including air traffic control, the Transportation Security Administration and the National Weather Service, Bartley said, and those employees remain at work.
While operations are steady for now, Bartley said the shutdown takes a toll on staff, and the airport’s management team is looking to support federal workers however possible. 
“We’re constantly trying to ask questions of what we can do to make this process easier for them, because they’re just so hugely valuable to us, to the region,” he said. “We’re truly thankful for their dedication to the mission of the airport.”
The Vermont National Guard is also impacted by the federal freeze. While the Guard “remains ready to respond to emergencies and to fulfill essential missions despite a government shutdown,” a spokesperson wrote in an email, “some administrative and training activities may be delayed.”
Active-duty Guard members and other employees deemed necessary for daily operations will remain at work. But others will be furloughed, impacting administrative tasks like responding to general inquiries and records requests.
Support for Vermont’s small businesses and nonprofit organizations interactions with the federal government, including help with applying for grants and bidding on contracts, may be similarly affected.
The Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development referred questions about impacts on businesses to the U.S. Small Business Administration, which has an office in Williston.
An email to the SBA’s Vermont deputy director prompted an automated reply, indicating the employee had been furloughed.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The federal government shutdown that began Wednesday created confusion for South Dakotans as communication about affected departments and services was inconsistent, with some agencies posting messages blaming the “radical left” and saying their websites won’t be updated until Congress approves additional funding.
The U.S. Senate was unable to advance two short-term government funding bills on Tuesday before the beginning of the new fiscal year, resulting in a shutdown beginning Wednesday morning.
About 750,000 federal workers are expected to be furloughed, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
Across South Dakota, federal offices provided uneven communication Wednesday.
Park Service, other impacts
Spokespeople for several National Park Service sites in the state declined to comment, referring inquiries to national or regional offices that didn’t respond to South Dakota Searchlight’s messages.
The state Department of Tourism ultimately provided information on the national park sites, saying Mount Rushmore National Memorial — which was first dedicated 100 years ago today — and Badlands National Park remain open with some limitations, including temporarily closed visitor centers at both locations. Only the above ground portion of Wind Cave National Park was open Wednesday, while Jewel Cave National Monument and Minuteman Missile National Historic Site both closed temporarily.
The National Park Service planned to furlough 9,300 of its 14,500 workers, according to its published contingency plan.
Shutdown standoff in US Senate extends as thousands of federal workers are sent home

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said its recreation areas on the Missouri River will remain open “contingent on available funding and staffing,” with critical operations such as dam maintenance and hydropower production continuing. 
“If or when appropriated funds are no longer available, USACE will execute orderly closures of USACE-owned and -operated campgrounds and other facilities,” the agency said in an emailed statement.
In federal court, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for South Dakota said in a written motion Wednesday that “the appropriation that had been funding the Department of Justice expired and the appropriations to the Department lapsed. The government was shut down, and the Department of Justice does not know when funding will be restored by Congress.
“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, ‘except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.'”
The National Weather Service said critical forecasting will continue uninterrupted, but all public outreach has been suspended.
“The NWS will continue to provide critical forecast, watch, and warning information to protect life and property throughout the shutdown,” the service said on its website. 
The Department of the Interior, which includes the National Park Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, among other agencies, shared that its website “is not being updated and will not be able to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted.” 
Amid concerns about impacts to Native American tribes, which rely on treaties with the federal government for much of their revenue, KFF Health News reported that operations at the Indian Health Service would continue.
Troy Heinert, bison management chief with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, said he and many others have been furloughed. 
“It’s hitting a lot of people and hitting a lot of programs,” said Heinert, a Democratic former state legislator from Mission.
Some agencies politicize messaging
Meanwhile, some federal websites took a political tone in describing the shutdown.
“The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need,” read a statement posted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The website of the Natural Resources Conservation Service displays a message on Oct. 1, 2025, the first day of a federal government shutdown.

The website of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, displayed a similar message: “Due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
Nearly half of all U.S. Department of Agriculture employees will be furloughed during the federal government shutdown, according to the department’s contingency plan, though key programs that support nutrition, forest preservation and wildfire prevention, the most pressing plant and animal diseases, and agricultural commodity assessments will continue.
Congressional delegates react; health care debate continues
South Dakota’s all-Republican congressional delegation took to social media Wednesday morning, posting messages that included criticism of Democrats. 
Rep. Dusty Johnson called shutdowns “stupid,” adding Senate Democrats were responsible for the funding lapse. Sen. Mike Rounds said a Republican bill to keep the government open failed because “Democrat colleagues did not join us,” and he called the situation “unacceptable and fully avoidable.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said “Democrats have bowed to the far left.”
Yet GOP lawmakers wrote their short-term funding bill behind closed doors and then expected Democrats to help advance it in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major legislation.
Democratic leaders have raised concerns for weeks about the end-of-year sunset of enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, arguing a solution is needed now ahead of the open enrollment period starting on Nov. 1.
According to a national analysis from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, the top marketplace insurer in South Dakota, Avera Health Plans, would increase premiums by 9%.
The last government shutdown that began in December 2018 and lasted until January 2019 led to a loss of about $3 billion in gross domestic product that couldn’t be recovered, according to a CBO analysis.

,DC,2025-10-01 22:06:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,White House warns of ‘imminent’ mass layoffs in government shutdown,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-warns-imminent-mass-layoffs-government-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday the administration is looking for ways to get a handful of additional U.S. Senate Democrats to vote for Republicans’ stopgap spending bill to reopen government. But, in the meantime, White House officials plan to lay off federal workers en masse, a dramatic and unsettling step that’s not traditionally been taken during past shutdowns. “We’re going to have to take extraordinary measures to ensure the people’s government operates — again not perfectly because it’s not going to operate perfectly in the midst of a shutdown — but operates as well as it possibly can,” Vance said.Any Democrats concerned about the impacts of layoffs on federal programs or people’s lives, Vance said, should vote to advance a seven-week stopgap spending bill that has stalled in the Senate.  Senate and House Democrats say they will not support a GOP path to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to negotiate on rising health care costs. Typically during a shutdown, some federal employees are categorized as exempt, meaning they work throughout the funding lapse. Others are furloughed. All receive back pay once Congress funds the government, under a 2019 law.  Widescale layoffs were not part of the 2013 shutdown or the 2018-2019 shutdown that took place during the first Trump administration.

Vance during the White House briefing placed blame for the shutdown on Democrats, as the Trump administration ramped up similar rhetoric, including on government agency websites that said the “radical left in Congress” is at fault.“Three moderate Democrats joined 52 Republicans last night. We need five more in order to reopen the government and that’s really where we’re going to focus, is how to get those five additional Democrats,” Vance said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during the same briefing that layoffs for federal employees are “imminent” but declined to say what percentage of workers would be let go or share any other details. Leavitt indicated that White House budget director Russ Vought would release those details “soon,” saying she didn’t want to get ahead of that office.  “These (Reductions in Force) are unfortunately going to have to happen very soon,” Leavitt said. Effects on key programsThe administration expects several programs will be impacted by the shutdown, including new enrollees in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC. Leavitt said the funding lapse means “1.3 million active duty troops will work now without pay; critical food assistance for low-income women, infants and children will now lapse, no new mothers or children are allowed to join this critical program because of the Democrats’ decision to shut down the government; telehealth services for seniors and in-home treatment options for Medicare patients will now come to an end; nearly 50,000 members of the United States Coast Guard are going to have to work unpaid; over 13,000 air traffic controllers will work without pay as well as TSA agents, which will very likely create flight disruptions; and pay will now stop for over 150,000 federal law enforcement officers. “These are not just numbers and statistics, these are real Americans who have families at home. And I saw some Democrat members today saying they’re still going to accept their paychecks because they have three kids at home and they have mouths to feed. Well, so do these federal workers.”Members of Congress, the president and federal judges must receive their salary under various provisions in the Constitution. While some lawmakers have publicly asked for their paychecks to be withheld until the government reopens, that’s not a legal option. They could, however, donate their salaries to charity, which they can do regardless of whether the government is shut down.  ‘Mafia-style threat’The threat to fire federal workers en masse has already prompted a lawsuit in a Northern California district court, arguing the executive branch has no statutory authority to fire federal workers during a government shutdown.There were roughly 2.2 million federal workers throughout the country as of July 1, with large portions of them living in California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Texas and Virginia. Roughly 30% of the workforce is made up of veterans. Maryland’s Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen told States Newsroom on Wednesday morning that his office has not heard of any federal workers in his state being fired, and even if it were the case, “it’s illegal.” “The president has no additional authority, in a shutdown, to fire people,” Van Hollen said. “This is just a mafia-style threat and blackmail.”He didn’t detail what plans Democrats have to prevent those potential firings, but called them unlawful and pointed to the lawsuit filed in California by labor unions representing more than 1 million federal employees. Those unions are the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner made similar remarks, saying “the president has no enhanced powers during the shutdown so his ability to randomly and arbitrarily fire is not enhanced.”

North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer said Democrats ""don't have the high ground in this situation"" and need to pass the GOP stopgap bill so that the government can reopen. But Cramer said he’s concerned the White House budget office will go too far in implementing a shutdown, including mass layoffs, and could create challenges for Republican lawmakers. “I worry a little bit that they could be counterproductive for us politically in the long run, because other things are going to require 60 votes again,” Cramer said.Legislation needs the support of at least 60 senators to advance toward final passage, a rule that typically leads to compromise and bipartisanship in that chamber. Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said he hopes lawmakers can strike a deal to prevent the Trump administration from firing more federal workers. He said Congress has specifically carved out protections for federal workers, such as in 2019 when lawmakers included a provision to give back pay to furloughed federal workers.  “So it used to be we had to fight about back pay after the shutdown,” he said. “Now everybody's guaranteed back pay, so they have that as a backstop that they can count (on).”House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a press conference Wednesday President Donald Trump’s administration “has been engaging in” the mass firings of federal workers since Trump took office on Jan 20.“The Trump administration has been killing jobs,” the New York Democrat said. “This is a job-killing administration. Job creation is down, but you know what’s up? Costs. They promised to lower costs on day one. Costs aren’t going down. Costs are going up.” Here are department shutdown plansThe Trump administration has been steadily posting its plans for how many federal workers in each department will keep working without pay during a shutdown and which employees will be furloughed. The plans, listed below, also detail which programs the Trump administration believes it can legally continue during a funding lapse without violating federal law. They do not explain how many federal workers could be laid off and the White House declined to provide additional details about those plans or whether they’ll be posted publicly following the briefing, Agriculture Department contingency planCommerce Department contingency planDefense Department contingency planEducation Department contingency planEnergy Department contingency planHealth and Human Services contingency planHomeland Security Department contingency planHousing and Urban Development contingency planInterior Department contingency planLabor Department contingency planJustice Department contingency planState Department contingency planSocial Security Administration contingency planTransportation Department contingency planTreasury Department contingency planVeterans Affairs Department contingency planAttack bannersThe Trump administration has taken a new approach to letting people visiting their websites know about the shutdown, adding banners laying the blame at Democrats’ feet. The Agriculture Department's website states that “(d)ue to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”The website for the Department of Housing and Urban Development includes a pop-up and a banner on the homepage that reads, “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.”The Defense Department had a more measured message: “The most recent appropriations for the Department of War expired at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Sept. 30, 2025. Military personnel will continue in a normal duty status, without pay, until such time as a continuing resolution or appropriations are passed by Congress and signed into law. Civilian personnel not engaged in excepted activities will be placed in a non-work, non-pay status.”The message posted by the Department of Health and Human Services was similar. “Mission-critical activities of HHS will continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Please use this site as a resource as the Trump Administration works to reopen the government for the American people.”The messages could be in violation of a longstanding rider in federal spending law that states “(n)o part of any funds appropriated in this or any other Act shall be used by an agency of the executive branch … to support or defeat legislation pending before the Congress, except in presentation to the Congress itself.” Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-01 18:57:59.452078

Jared Polis wants to keep national parks in the state open amid a federal government shutdown despite concerns from conservation groups about risks of damage. 
The federal government shut down Wednesday after Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure. That means many operations of the federal government are limited or stopped entirely. 
The Interior Department, which includes the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, posted updated contingency plans late Tuesday. The National Park Service plans to furlough 9,300 of its 14,500 workers.

The contingency plan says that “roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” but it adds that if “access becomes a safety, health or resource protection issue … the area must be closed.”
Colorado’s members of Congress point fingers over government shutdown

Tracy Coppola, Colorado senior program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, said attractions like Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado that see “record-breaking visitation nearly every year” were left “extremely vulnerable” during prior government shutdowns. The damage the park saw following the 2018-2019 shutdown took months to recover from, and some of it was irreparable. She said the ecosystem in the park is already fragile and needs “constant protection” from park staff.
“If the federal government shuts down, unfortunately our parks should too — until a funding deal is reached and our parks can be staffed and protected,” Coppola said in a statement.
Polis, a Democrat, said keeping Rocky Mountain National Park open is his “top priority” in the event of a shutdown because it is a popular attraction for visitors and a major economic driver for rural communities. He issued an executive order in 2023 ahead of an anticipated shutdown directing state agencies to plan for continued operations at national parks and other federal lands in Colorado.
The federal government should keep national parks open and staffed or allow states to support keeping parks opened and protected, Polis said. He said the state would be “a willing partner if needed” and would “use limited State funds to keep our biggest park fully operational if necessary.”










If the federal government shuts down, unfortunately our parks should too — until a funding deal is reached and our parks can be staffed and protected.


– Tracy Coppola, Colorado senior program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association


“I agree that keeping the parks open without any staffing is not as good as having staff, which is why the federal government needs to either find ways to staff the parks or give the state and local governments the options needed to support our parks responsibly so that people can continue to enjoy the great outdoors,” Polis said in a statement. 
It’s understandable that Polis wants to keep parks open because of how important they are to the state’s economy and local communities, Coppola said, but funding them is the federal government’s responsibility. 
“It’s also an impossible position to put states in, especially given the deficits they’re facing,” Coppola said. “Instead, states now have to scramble to use limited funds needed for other critical priorities.”
In a press conference Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, said he is glad that national parks will stay open during the shutdown. He said Polis is aware of how parks were damaged during previous shutdowns and wants to mitigate any future risks of damage or disruptions.
“We cannot allow there to be the kind of harm there was last time,” Bennet said.   
The Trump administration already drastically reduced staffing within the National Park Service by about 24%, according to Coppola. She said parks “barely held it together” this summer and that additional terminations would make it “nearly impossible for those who remain to protect our parks.” 
A group of former National Park superintendents — none of whom led parks in Colorado —  wrote to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum asking him to keep national parks and public lands closed during a government shutdown. They said the difficulties parks have already had with limited staffing and would only get worse if they are kept open. 
“Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks: Iconic symbols cut down and vandalized, trash piled up, habitats destroyed, and visitor safety jeopardized,” the letter says. “If you don’t act now, history is not just doomed to repeat itself, the damage could in fact be much worse.”
“To visitors, everything might look fine,” Coppola said. “But behind the scenes, the National Park Service has been gutted and the remaining staff are overwhelmed.”
Colorado is home to four national parks: Rocky Mountain National Park, Mesa Verde National Park, Great Sand Dune National Park and Preserve, and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Rocky Mountain National Park is by far the most visited in the state.

Pictured above, left to right: U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich, as well as U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, during a news conference at the New Mexico Legislature in January, 2025. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)New Mexico’s five-member Congressional delegation on Wednesday during a virtual news conference described the federal government shutdown as “entirely preventable,” an “elaborate smokescreen” and proof of Congressional Republicans’ “failure to govern.”
All five members — all Democrats — said they remained in Washington, D.C., prepared to find a bipartisan agreement that would allow the government to operate. The federal government started shutting down early Wednesday after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the new fiscal year began.
Shutdown standoff in US Senate extends as thousands of federal workers are sent home

Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at the end of the year without congressional intervention, became a sticking point in negotiations. New Mexico lawmakers intend to address that issue during a special legislation session that also kicked off Wednesday. The session also will focus on shoring up Medicaid and federal food assistance due to cuts made to both in the Republican federal budget bill.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich called the impasse and shutdown “entirely preventable” during Wednesday’s news conference.
“Republicans obviously are in control of the House,” Heinrich said. “They’re in control of the Senate, and they hold the White House. They had every single lever that they needed to negotiate a deal, and all Democrats have asked for was to protect New Mexicans and Americans across the country from higher health care costs.”
Heinrich noted that during events in Las Cruces last week he heard “from doctors and community leaders and parents…that if we don’t do something right now, hard working New Mexicans will be forced to choose between paying rent, paying utility bills, paying their car payment, or paying for their health care.
In other words, “hardworking people are going to suffer,” he said. “It’s irresponsible…Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress have spent the last nine months driving up health care costs and fueling inflation, and now they’ve manufactured a new crisis, the shutdown of our federal government, and the effects will be devastating.”
U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján emphasized that Trump is “making a choice to fire hard working employees and make this as painful as possible for the American people. It’s his choice. The president could choose not to do the things that he’s doing today, or he can choose to inflict pain, and he’s been clear that he’s going to choose to inflict pain on the American people.”
U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, noted the contrast between Washington, D.C. and New Mexico.
“New Mexico is really a split screen right now,” she said. “In Washington, D.C., you have a Republican-controlled Congress and White House that is refusing to negotiate, to keep the government open, to keep our federal workers employed, and refusing to fix the health care of millions of Americans who will lose health care in the coming weeks if they don’t act. Meanwhile [in New Mexico], you have a Democratic-led state Legislature and governor who have called a special session today to try to fix what Republicans broke at the federal level.”
White House warns of ‘imminent’ mass layoffs in government shutdown

As for the shutdown, Stansbury, added, Republicans “wanted” it to happen. “They have been planning for this for months,” she said, “but they are trying to create an elaborate smoke screen that makes the American people think that they’re trying to act when everything that they’ve done has set the mechanics up for a shutdown so that they can carry out their policies that they laid out in Project 2025 — that is what is actually happening here.”
Project 2025 refers to a conservative roadmap to Trump’s second term that U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought played a key role in creating.
“Part of what the OMB director is doing is using this as an opportunity to shut down work in offices that they don’t support,” Stansbury said.
All five members said New Mexico will feel the impacts of the federal shutdown.
“Almost 18,000 service members in New Mexico are at risk of not getting paid on time,” Heinrich said. “The same goes for our nearly 30,000 government employees who are at risk of not being paid until the shutdown is over and we don’t know how long this is going to be. Farmers won’t be able to access new loans. Families living in rural communities will not be able to get loans either. During hunting season, when many of you have already planned your annual fall harvest to fill your freezer, our public lands employees will be limited in the services that they can provide, or even the maintenance that they can complete. For most people, these are scary prospects. That’s part of the point: They want to sow fear and confusion, but the bottom line is that people are going to get hurt.”
All the members reiterated their commitment to finding common ground with their Republican counterparts, but “I’m not going to bend the knee or sell our New Mexicans,” U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who represents the southern part of the state in Congressional District 2, said.
Bottom line, U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, of the 3rd Congressional District, said: “Republicans control the government…their failure to pass a funding bill is the Republicans’ failure to govern. I know people keep asking: Who will be blamed for the shutdown? I think that’s the wrong question. I think the real question is: Who feels the pain? And who will feel the pain if we don’t address the healthcare crisis?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HK7A0914-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 18:57:59.452078

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A Circuit Court judge refused Wednesday to temporarily block the South Carolina Election Commission from sharing information with the Department of Justice.
But Judge Daniel Coble’s ruling doesn’t mean the transfer is imminent. State and federal officials are still working out the details for security safeguards and how the data will be transmitted, according to the agency.

In his conclusion, Judge Daniel Coble noted he has “grave concerns about federal overreach and encroachment over this State’s sovereignty.”
However, he wrote, that’s not the issue at hand. He laid out several reasons for denying the motion to temporarily block the release of data.
First, he said, Calhoun County voter Anne Crook has failed to prove she’ll suffer harm without an injunction. Her motion sought to block any exchange of data until there’s a memorandum of understanding between the election agency and U.S. Department of Justice.
As Coble noted, Election Commission officials testified in court last Friday that won’t happen anyway.
“They have stated point-blank that they will not release the data to the DOJ without an MOU,” the judge wrote. Additionally, he noted, attorneys promised that the agency’s governing board would discuss and vote on the agreement in public before any transfer.
And any agreement is likely weeks away, testified acting director Jennifer Wooten.

Coble ruling Oct. 1 
The U.S. Department of Justice asked for the information — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — in August as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.
Crook, a former president of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, filed the lawsuit in response, citing privacy concerns.
The final reason Coble gave in denying the motion is that Crook is unlikely to win her challenge.
State law gives the commission authority to enter data sharing agreements for voter registration data. Federal law likely requires the commission to provide the requested information. And the state isn’t challenging the request, he wrote.
“Federal law likely preempts state law in this area,” Coble wrote in his conclusion. “The State at this point has interpreted the law as requiring compliance.”
He postponed deciding on Gov. Henry McMaster’s request to dismiss the case.
But the governor called it a win.
“Today’s victory will help maintain the public’s confidence in the security and integrity of our state’s voter rolls and elections,” spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.
The election agency already shares its information with 32 states and Washington, D.C., spokesman John Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette last week.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFour Democrats, a Republican and an independent have all thrown their hats into the ring to represent a metro Atlanta district in the state Senate.
Senate District 35, which includes parts of Cobb and Fulton counties, was vacated after former Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, stepped down to focus on his run for governor.
Gov. Brian Kemp set the election for Nov. 18 – just two weeks after voters statewide will head to the polls for a pair of Georgia Public Service Commission races.
The district was drawn to favor a Democrat, and the party establishment has coalesced behind former state Rep. Roger Bruce. Bruce formally announced his candidacy Tuesday at the law offices of former Gov. Roy Barnes, the last Democrat to occupy Georgia’s governor’s mansion.
Bruce, who was first elected to the House in 2003 and served until retiring in 2024, touted Barnes’ endorsement along with support from a slew of other Democratic leaders. Bruce said he was inspired to return to politics in large part because of the political climate coming from Washington.
“I just feel like I can either sit around and hope that it goes away or I can become the hope that people are looking for and go out there and do my part to make sure the state does not go down the path of Washington DC,” he said in a phone call. “I’ve got a granddaughter that’s three years old. I kept thinking about what kind of world am I going to leave for her?”
But Bruce is not the only former elected Democrat eyeing the open seat.
Former Cobb County School Board member Jaha Howard qualified to run Tuesday. Howard is a dentist by profession and served on the school board between 2019 and 2022.
He ran unsuccessfully for state Senate in 2017 and has also been a candidate for state school superintendent and county commissioner.
Fulton County consultant and former Atlanta journalist Erica-Denise Solomon and John Daryl Williams of Cobb County qualified to run for the seat Wednesday.
In a statement, Solomon pledged to prioritize legislation including to boost affordable housing, education and infrastructure.
“Throughout my career, I have told the stories of communities that are too often overlooked or misrepresented,” she said. “This campaign is about honoring our story, protecting our history, and building the future our families deserve.”
Republican Joshua Tolbert, a professional engineer from Cobb County, is the only Republican candidate seeking election in the seat. No GOP candidate attempted to compete for the seat last year.
Corenza Morris, a business owner and Georgia Army National Guard veteran, qualified to run as an independent, pledging on his campaign website to prioritize improving the economy and reducing crime.
Attempts to reach the other candidates for comment by phone or email were not immediately successful Wednesday, which was the final day of qualifying for the special election.
The election is set for Nov. 18 with a runoff scheduled for Dec. 16 if no candidate wins the majority of the vote. Early voting begins Oct. 27, and the last day to register to vote in this election is Oct. 20.
Some local officials have expressed worry that turnout could be lowered because the special election dates come alongside the statewide election for the Georgia Public Service Commission.
The Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration requested the date for the special election be moved to coincide with the PSC election, but Kemp in a Sept. 26 letter denied the request, arguing that doing so would shorten the time for candidates to campaign.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Do Utahns value meritocracy? If congressional district maps are truly fair, then candidates will win on their policy ideas and effort, not only on voter turnout. If we want fair representation, voters must choose the candidates, not maps. I, along with other Utah voters, prefer to elect candidates on their own merits instead of relying on a map skewed in one party’s favor. What Utah voters want is a good-faith effort on the part of their legislators to try. And it’s become apparent that in these meetings that there seems to be very little effort happening.
I attended the first committee hearing on redistricting on Sept. 22, 2025, after Proposition 4 was revived. The first line of the meeting by Sen. Scott Sandall set the tone: “We want to make sure that you understand that we are doing this in compliance with the court orders, and under protest.” This stuck in my mind throughout the rest of the day. Why admit publicly that you don’t care about the will of Utah voters? Utah voters made clear back in 2018 their thoughts regarding redistricting and congressional maps when Proposition 4 was passed. Why protest what the people voted into law — that maps must be drawn without partisan bias? I was and still am highly offended by Sen. Sandall’s comments.
In the second committee hearing on Sept. 24, I was appalled by how quickly questions and answers devolved into personal and partisan attacks. When Rep. Doug Owens called the current congressional map gerrymandered, Sen. Sandall immediately retorted with a point of order and rebutted, “That’s just your opinion.” Yes, it’s my opinion too. But the fact is rulings from both 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson and the Utah Supreme Court found that the process that led to the 2021 maps was unconstitutional, and now the Legislature has the opportunity to submit a new map that aligns with the spirit of Proposition 4. The final selection will be made by Gibson.
Utahns now have options for fairer voting districts. There is no need to limit ourselves to only one method to bring this about, as Sen. Brady Brammer’s bill and his proposed partisan bias test suggest. We can focus on the ideal hypothetical maps and data models all we want, but life does not happen on a spreadsheet. It happens outside, where, instead of voting with people I worked and shopped with before fair redistricting, I voted with a different community three hundred miles away whose needs differ from mine.
I feel fortunate to have lived in many different parts of Utah, including Davis County, Iron County, Utah County, and now working in Salt Lake County. With these experiences, my perspective is unique in the discussion about redistricting voter boundaries. I have learned that each county varies in its diversity of needs and experiences. With this in mind, how could we say, for example, that someone living in Provo could adequately represent Cedar City?
Our lawmakers should listen to their constituents. The gerrymandered map currently in place has been declared illegal. Sen. Brammer’s bill is yet another way to manipulate the map to ensure the majority party retains power.
While discussing different methods of evaluating partisan symmetry, elections analyst Sean Trende explained that one way to evaluate maps is simply the “eye test”: someone can make an intuitive, non-data-based assumption on a map just by looking at it. My “eye test” of the Legislature’s actions and attitude tells me that they are not making a good faith effort to abide by the will of the people. It took the people six years to achieve this ruling that requires the Legislature to act. In 2021, the Legislature had the chance to comply with Proposition 4 and passed a compromise bill that was tossed out by the courts in 2025. Only now must the Legislature be compelled to do what voters asked for in 2018. Let us not revert to an unfair map or erase all of the work done towards fair redistricting. It is time to do right by Utah and pass a map that represents all of our voices.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/0710_Capitol-Summer_SH_06-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:57:56.092276

“We have to draw a line in the sand and say, ‘no,’” Rep. Becca Balint said.

Vermont’s three members of Congress are casting the federal government shutdown that started Wednesday as a result of their Republican colleagues’ failure to come to the negotiating table to address looming funding cuts that are expected to raise health care costs for thousands of people in Vermont and millions more around the country. 
The government shut down at midnight Wednesday after lawmakers missed the deadline to come to a spending deal ahead of a new federal fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. As a result, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to be furloughed, which could hamstring government services nationally and in Vermont. President Donald Trump’s administration, meanwhile, has threatened to use the dispute to permanently eliminate some federal workers’ jobs entirely.
“Nobody likes a shutdown. And, I’m among them. But we’ve got a real threat — ongoing threat — to the health care of Vermonters and Americans,” said U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., in an interview Wednesday afternoon after stepping off the Senate floor.
After votes that could have averted a shutdown failed in the Senate on Tuesday, the chamber again did not come to a consensus in another vote Wednesday. It’s not clear yet when a deal might be reached, or what that agreement would look like.
In the leadup to the impasse, the Republican-controlled House passed a bill that would keep the government funded at its current levels through Nov. 21. Senate Democrats refused to support that bill, however, in an effort to force Republicans to negotiate over Affordable Care Act subsidies that are slated to expire at the end of the year.
Vermonters stand to lose a collective $65 million if Congress does not extend those expanded tax credits, per a report submitted to the state Legislature earlier this year.
Democrats have also staked their support on Republicans rolling back cuts included in President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill, which passed over the summer. About 15 million people nationwide are set to lose health coverage in the next decade due to the GOP-led law’s cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, among other measures, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
Senate Democrats introduced their own short-term measure that proposed funding the government through October and extending the expiring health care subsidies, but Senate Republicans blocked it. Republican leaders have continued to insist they won’t negotiate over the Obamacare credits until after the government has reopened.
Vermont’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Becca Balint and Sen. Welch, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, charged in interviews and statements that Republicans, who control the White House and both houses of Congress, were at fault for the shutdown.
They pointed to comments Trump made in a TV interview last month that his GOP allies should not “even bother dealing with” Democrats’ demands ahead of a shutdown.
“Square that circle for me — how exactly is it the Democrats’ fault when Republicans have said, openly, ‘we’re not going to work with Democrats?’” Balint said in an interview  Wednesday afternoon. 
For her caucus to continue to “give and give and give is hurtful to Americans,” Balint added. “We have to draw a line in the sand and say, ‘no.’”
Balint joined all but one other House Democrat in voting against the House’s short-term spending plan in mid-September. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Welch and Sanders joined most of the Senate’s Democratic caucus in rejecting the House’s proposal.
Welch said in an interview Wednesday afternoon that he sees no other choice than shutting down the government in order to prevent, or at least attempt to prevent, people from losing key health coverage. 
He said that “a relentless attack by President Trump on the rule of law” in recent months was the difference that prompted more of his Democratic colleagues to hold the line against a GOP-led spending package ahead of a looming shutdown. In March, 10 members of the caucus — not including Welch or Sanders — joined Republicans to pass a stopgap funding measure effective through the end of September. 
Sanders, in a video posted to his social media feeds just hours before the shutdown went into effect, said that in addition to addressing his concerns about looming cuts to people’s health care, congressional Republicans would also need to reverse the tax breaks included in Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that are estimated to benefit the country’s wealthiest households, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
“At a time of such massive and growing inequality, it is insane, in my view, to be giving a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1%,” Sanders said. “If President Trump and Republicans want my vote, they will have to rescind that tax break for their oligarchic friends.”

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)Members of the advisory board that oversees state prison operations want to meet more often, tour facilities and keep a closer eye on inmate work and rehabilitation programs.
The Corrections Commission met virtually a week and a day after lawmakers voted during a special legislative session to build a $650 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls.
By law, the commission must approve any spending on prison industry programming. It’s also meant to assist the Department of Corrections “in examining criminal justice issues and developing initiatives to address problems in corrections and the criminal justice system.”
The group’s scope of inquiry has narrowed considerably in recent years, however. The commission had no formal role in planning for the new men’s prison, and corrections officials told its members and lawmakers in 2023 and 2024 that the body’s only job was to approve prison industry spending.
Rep. Ernie Otten, R-Tea, who left the group earlier this year, said during a 2024 commission meeting that it’s “the biggest waste of time I’ve ever had to endure.”
Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko did not take part in Wednesday’s meeting. Wasko tendered her resignation to Gov. Larry Rhoden at the start of September, and will step down Oct. 20.
New members, new focus
Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, and Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, were each appointed to the commission this year. Wittman was elected to lead the group at its May meeting. 
On Wednesday, both new members said the group needs to meet more than twice a year so it can dig deeper and keep a closer eye on operations.

“There’s a lot of moving parts with the recent funding of the new prison,” said Wittman, who noted Gov. Rhoden’s intent to appoint a rehabilitation task force in the coming months. “Knowing that the next few years are going to be really focused on policy, this could be a great working group for us to keep our finger on the pulse of that conversation.”
Wittman and Hughes both said they’d like to serve on the rehabilitation task force. 
Rebranded prison industries
They also had operational questions for Rene Stolsmark, head of the prison system’s in-house employer, Pheasantland Industries.
A year ago, Pheasantland took over commissary operations from Summit, a company founded in Sioux Falls, in a new contract with Union Supply of Texas. Commissary is the prison store, through which inmates can order snacks, toiletries, televisions and other consumer goods.
Head of state prison system wants to ‘close the doors’ to public scrutiny of security incidents

Inmates now manage the commissary inventory, packaging products that are shipped to the penitentiary warehouse from Union Supply into individual order bundles for delivery. Summit had previously done all that work with its own employees. 
Hughes said he didn’t understand the move to an out-of-state vendor and asked if there’s a way to use local vendors for products in the commissary catalog. He also questioned the wisdom of generating income from the sale of “junk food.”
Stolsmark explained that the new setup allows inmates to learn the kinds of skills they might be able to use upon release at an Amazon warehouse or similar distribution facility. Department of Corrections Finance Director Brittni Skipper said the state’s director of clinical services reviews all commissary items for nutritional value, and that some high-sodium items have been removed.
Wittman asked about the price differences between Summit and Union Supply, noting that inmates and their families have lodged complaints. Stolsmark said the commissary price hikes square with the increase in food prices outside the walls.
Stolsmark also told the commission about a November rebranding for Pheasantland. Too many people think it has something to do with hunting, she said. Inmates and staff worked together on a new name and logo for what will be called “DakotaCORE,” which she said stands for Dakota Correctional Opportunities for Rehabilitation and Employment.”
“We wanted a recommitment to everything that we’re doing and who we are, why we were created,” Stolsmark said.
Vocational programming
Angela Smith, the Department of Corrections’ director of programs, told commissioners that the state’s seventh cohort of inmates in a Southeast Technical College welding program recently started attending classes at the Sioux Falls facility.
Inmate training program shelved while prison construction talks continue

The program is currently grant funded, Smith said, but that money will run out in September 2026. The state is preparing an application to the U.S. Department of Education in hopes of funding the coursework through Pell grants, Smith said. Those grants, typically associated with low-income students outside of prison, were made available for qualifying prison training programs during the Biden administration.
It will take at least a year to get through the process, Smith said. The state still hopes to start a diesel mechanics program in a now-empty prison shop in Sioux Falls, for which it’s been unable to secure funding so far. The Pell grant program would be the mechanism for that.
“We’re looking for about 12 months from now before we get full approval on either of those, and that is if nothing changes at the federal level,” Smith told the commission.
Before adjourning, Wittman said she plans to call a commission meeting once more this year, in December. The group did not vote on how many more annual meetings it would hold in its normal course of business. Wittman asked that members “noodle on” the options and decide what might be feasible at the next meeting.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Premiums for most health insurance plans purchased on the individual market will increase by 22% on average when open enrollment for 2026 begins Nov. 1. 
The Minnesota Department of Commerce, which regulates the insurance industry, released the average rate changes from 2025 to 2026, ranging 7% to 31%. The specific plan, location and recipient’s age can also factor into the cost. 
Rates for small group plans — those purchased by small businesses — will also increase, but not as much as individual plans: 14% on average. 
Together, individual and small group plans insure around 391,000 Minnesotans. 
For many Minnesotans, however, the situation will be worse than what’s reflected in the Department of Commerce figures. 
That’s because the increases don’t account for the impact of the expiration of a federal enhanced tax credit that has been driving down prices since 2021.
The enhanced credits give more money to a wider range of households to pay for individual marketplace plans compared to the baseline Affordable Care Act tax credits. But the enhanced credits were not renewed as part of the Republicans’ giant law passed in July, and are set to expire at the end of 2025, driving costs up even higher. 
Extending the enhanced ACA tax credit is the issue driving the government shutdown that began Wednesday. Republicans, who control the Senate, need several Democratic votes to reopen the government, and congressional Democrats want the tax credits continued as part of a spending bill. Republicans have refused.
If Congress fails to renew the enhanced tax credit, around 4 million Americans are expected to lose health insurance coverage, and prices could go up another 50% for those still on individual marketplace plans. 
“Farmers, small business owners, older adults and families in rural communities will be hit the hardest. That is unconscionable,” said Rep. Robert Bierman, DFL-Apple Valley, in a statement criticizing Republicans’ refusal to extend the enhanced tax credits.
This isn’t the first time rates have jumped sharply. In 2016, then-DFL Gov. Mark Dayton said “the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people” after significant rate increases were announced that year. Republicans hammered Democrats on the issue in the weeks leading up to the election and wound up adding to their state House majority and scoring a surprise upset to take the Senate majority. 
In 2017, the Republican-controlled Legislature introduced a system of reinsurance, whereby the state pays a portion of the most expensive health insurance claims, keeping rates down for everyone. 
The Department of Commerce says that without the recent extension of reinsurance, premiums would have risen 47% more in 2026.
The enhanced federal tax credit was passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress in 2021 and extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, with the goal of expanding assistance for low-income people and making plans more affordable for the middle-class.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/health-care-1024x716-1.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:57:56.092276

It’s not yet clear how many national park workers based in Utah could be furloughed, with uncertainty surrounding how long the funding lapse will last. But according to an updated National Park Service contingency plan, for now federal dollars will fund “health and safety” operations, including fire suppression, drinking water and sewage, and other essential services.
“Our priority has been and continues to be preserving our parks, maintaining the visitor experience, and ensuring Utah communities and businesses that rely on national park visitation are supported,” Natalie Randall, managing director of the Utah Office of Tourism and Film, said in a prepared statement. “We are engaged in proactive conversations with public and private partners at all levels, offering strategic support to ensure the parks remain open with necessary resources.” 
About 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed in shutdown, nonpartisan CBO projects

Utah Rep. Mike Kennedy, who spoke to reporters at the Utah State Capitol on Wednesday, praised efforts to keep the parks open, albeit with some reduced services, by both federal and Utah agencies, for the time being. 
A former state legislator, he recalled Utah’s past commitments to keep the parks operating during previous “nonsensical government shutdowns.”
“When government shuts down, I know the state legislative leadership, as well as our governor, are motivated and incentivized to make sure that those national parks continue to stay open — and that’s a backstop that shouldn’t have to be used. The federal government should fund those programs,” Kennedy said, among his comments that laid blame for the shutdown on U.S. Senate Democrats. 
Utah’s national parks are an important economic driver, especially in rural and southern parts of Utah. In 2024, national park visitor spending contributed an estimated $3.1 billion to the state’s economy, according to state tourism officials. 
Utah’s five national parks — Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion — are still open to the public, the Utah Office of Tourism said in a news release Wednesday, while also directing Utahns and visitors to VisitUtah.com for more information about how the federal shutdown is impacting Utah’s parks. 
While the parks will remain open, “visitors should expect reduced services and reduced staffing” during the shutdown, state tourism officials said. 
State tourism officials also pointed out that Utah’s 46 state parks will remain open and unaffected by the shutdown. 
“They are fully staffed and ready to welcome visitors,” they said. 



Here’s a breakdown of what to know before visiting each park, as of Wednesday:

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa DOGE task force has submitted a list of recommendations to Gov. Kim Reynolds on how to make Iowa’s state and local government more efficient, including suggestions to change the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System, and teachers’ compensation.
The task force, modeled after the federal Department of Government Efficiency program formerly led by billionaire Elon Musk in the Trump administration, was created in February 2025. The group of business leaders on the task force, led by Emily Schmitt, general counsel for Sukup Manufacturing Co., were tasked with submitting a report to Reynolds and state lawmakers on how to improve government efficiency in Iowa. The report was due Monday, as the body was given a 180-day timeline from their first public meeting to finalize recommendations.
The governor’s office confirmed Wednesday the report has been submitted. However, the final recommendations made by the DOGE task force are not yet publicly available. A spokesperson for the governor’s office said in an email Reynolds is now reviewing the report, and that it will be made public soon after the governor completes her review.
Though the report has not yet been published, task force members presented their planned recommendations during meetings in August and September. Some of the most high-profile recommendations included the suggestion of tying extra compensation for K-12 public school teacher and administrators to student achievement benchmarks, as well as IPERS changes for all public employees.
At the September meeting, Terry Lutz, chairman of McClure Engineering Co. and former mayor of Fort Dodge, said his comments on the school staff “pay-for-performance” model had been misrepresented by opponents and some reports as taking away teacher pay. He said the proposal suggests raising teacher pay by up to 10% of base pay through bonuses for educators based on student outcomes.
There was also significant pushback to the task force’s proposal on moving from a defined benefits program to a defined contribution program for future employees that was introduced at an earlier meeting. Lutz said in September the recommendation was updated to suggest the state conducts an ongoing study on public employees’ benefits, including consideration of the viability of a defined contribution plan for the state, where both the employee and employer contributes to a retirement benefit plan. If the state determines this changed system could be implemented, the task force said it would recommend “giving employees a choice” to stay on IPERS or join a defined contribution plan.
This recommendation has been criticized by many public sector worker organizations, who say the changes discussed by the task force could make IPERS insolvent. Several state lawmakers, including many Republicans, have said they are unlikely to consider changes to IPERS brought up by the task force.
The DOGE task force’s submitted recommendations are not necessarily set to become law. It will be up to Reynolds and state lawmakers to decide whether they want to implement any of the proposed changes through legislation in future legislative sessions. Schmitt suggested Iowans contact the governor and their elected officials if they want to provide feedback on the proposals moving forward.
“It’s up to the elected officials and the governor to take these and put together what they think is right for Iowa and what’s right now,” Schmitt said at the September meeting.

Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock (John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ governor certified a vacancy in House District 70 on Wednesday and asked the state’s two major political parties to let her office know within 10 days how they’d prefer to select candidates.
State Rep. Carlton Wing, a Republican from North Little Rock, resigned his seat on Tuesday to become Arkansas PBS’s new CEO and executive director. The PBS board appointed him on Sept. 17, and he had to resign from the Legislature to accept the appointment. The five-term representative has a background in broadcasting and owns a production company.
In a letter to Republican Party of Arkansas Chair Joseph Wood and Democratic Party of Arkansas Chair Col. Marcus Jones, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the party leaders to decide whether they want to select candidates to replace Wing via a special primary election or a convention of delegates. District 70 covers part of Pulaski County.
The political parties had to make a similar decision last month after the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch, and they decided to hold primary elections. Four Republicans so far have indicated their intent to run for the seat: businessmen Brad Simon and Ted Tritt, both of Paris, former Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark and Logan County Justice of the Peace Brenda Brewer. Brewer, however, may be ineligible to run, according to the Arkansas Times.
Sanders sparked bipartisan criticism last week by setting primary elections to fill Stubblefield’s seat in March and a general election in June, leaving District 26 without representation through the legislature’s fiscal session next spring. Stubblefield’s daughter also spoke out against the election dates at a Tuesday press conference called by Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest.
District 26 encompasses parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. Franklin County contains the 815-acre property the state purchased last year for the site of a proposed 3,000-bed penitentiary that has been met by opposition from local residents and lawmakers, including King and the late Stubblefield.
Arkansas law requires governors to call a special election to fill a vacant legislative seat within 150 days, unless they find it impractical or too burdensome to do so. Jan. 30 would be 150 days from Stubblefield’s death; Feb. 12 would be 150 days from Sanders’ declaration of a vacancy.
Sanders set the primary election date for District 26 for March 3, which is also the date for all 2026 primaries in Arkansas. The general election will be June 9. The legislative fiscal session starts in April and is scheduled to end in May.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Two Nebraska lawmakers on the Legislature’s budget-setting committee requested that their panel schedule a public briefing to better understand the planned conversion of a McCook-based state prison into an ICE detention hub.

State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh and Ashlei Spivey, both of Omaha, addressed their letter Wednesday to State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee.
The request comes after the chair of the Judiciary Committee declined to hold a public briefing on the McCook project. The Urban Affairs Committee did hold a public hearing, but Gov. Jim Pillen’s staff declined to attend.
 Public records denied, redacted

Cavanaugh and Spivey said Pillen’s decision to repurpose the McCook Work Ethic Camp into a facility that holds migrant detainees for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement “implicates not only significant state resources but also the long-term financial obligations of Nebraska taxpayers.”
They said state lawmakers and the public have received little information on the conversion, which requires the relocation of more than 180 state inmates elsewhere in an already crowded state prison system. The letter noted that public records requested under state statutes have been denied or redacted.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“It is the clear duty of the Appropriations Committee to ensure that such a project is transparently handled,” Cavanaugh and Spivey wrote. They wrote that  a public briefing was warranted before committing further public dollars.
Clements told the Nebraska Examiner, however, that he has no plans to grant the request for a public briefing.
“The budget is already set,” Clements said. “We have a two-year budget. Next January we will start mid biennium budget hearings. There’ll be an opportunity then to discuss this with the executive branch.”
Clements said the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services is expected to operate within its budget and that he has been told the federal government will reimburse Nebraska for the costs of detaining people for immigration-related offenses, and that reimbursement rates could exceed daily costs.
He previously has said he supports President Donald Trump “enforcing the law” and that he was pleased that residents of McCook would not be exposed to a higher level of security than before.
Clements told the Examiner Wednesday that questions regarding inmates are within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. 
 Fiscal responsibility

Spivey and Cavanaugh said they are seeking information related to fiscal responsibility and legislative oversight. They requested that the public briefing include officials from the Departments of Administrative Services, Health and Human Services and Correctional Services.
Nebraska lawmaker’s unannounced visit to McCook prison morphing into ICE jail sparks more questions

Among data they seek: a comprehensive estimate of state costs for the conversion, operations and healthcare; daily reimbursement fees to be paid by the feds and how that income will be accounted for in the state budget.
Other questions included status of contracts with the federal government; legal authority under which the state may repurpose a prison for federal use; staffing plans and demands and key milestones for conversion and operation, including when expenses will be tracked within existing appropriations.
The two lawmakers said many questions remain unanswered “despite repeated requests.” 
“The Nebraska Legislature has a constitutional obligation to guard the state’s fiscal integrity and ensure public resources are managed responsibly,” the letter said. 
They wrote that a public briefing by the Appropriations Committee would “provide clarity on the financial impact of this project and allow the Legislature to exercise informed oversight before any further commitments are made.”
 Disappointed 

Spivey told the Examiner Wednesday that she had not heard back yet from Clements, but that she was disappointed to learn he rejected a request by two of his committee members to better understand financial obligations of the state.
“It is our duty,” Spivey said, adding that Clements does not have to agree with her and Cavanaugh, but should allow for discussion.
She said there is a reason for having different government branches, to check and balance each other for the common good. 
“What we’re seeing now is the dismantling of that, of the state Legislature and our power,” Spivey said.

No commissioners from Districts 1 and 2, which cover most of the town of Boone, currently serve on the board. (Screenshot from complaint)A federal lawsuit brought by voters Wednesday accuses the North Carolina legislature of forcing unconstitutional voting maps on Watauga County to help more Republican candidates win local elections.
The challenge, filed in the Western District of North Carolina by seven Watauga County voters and joined by voting rights advocacy groups, argues that Senate Bill 759, passed in 2023, imposes “unconstitutional, malapportioned electoral districts with large population deviations,” violating the legal principle of one person, one vote.
“The Plan dilutes the votes of Democratic voters by systematically overpopulating the districts in which Democrats have the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice and systematically underpopulating the districts in which Republicans have the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice,” the complaint states.
Spokespeople for Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) and the Watauga Board of Elections did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit names the Watauga County Board of Elections and its members as defendants. Advocacy organizations Common Cause North Carolina and the Watauga County Voting Rights Task Force are also plaintiffs in the suit.
Under the previous election system, county commissioners were elected to five residential districts — meaning candidates must live in the district they represent, but the county’s residents vote in all five elections — yielding three Democratic commissioners and two Republicans.
After the new map, made up of electoral districts — where only residents of the district vote on that district’s commissioner — the board is made up of five Republicans. Two districts encompassing most of Boone will not elect commissioners until 2026 under S.B. 759, leaving the majority of the town’s residents with no representation, according to the lawsuit.
Following the election, the three Republicans elected to the commission appointed two Republicans to the remaining vacancies, seats held by Republicans that were vacated to run in the new election.
While the initial law applied the districts only to the Watauga Board of Commissioners, a subsequent bill passed in 2024, Senate Bill 912, extended them to the Watauga Board of Education. The lawsuit also challenges that piece of legislation.
The U.S. Supreme Court decided in a 2019 ruling on North Carolina maps that “partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts.” The North Carolina Supreme Court also views such claims as “nonjusticiable under the North Carolina Constitution,” upholding Republican-leaning maps in 2023.
The Watauga complaint centers its legal claims on nonpartisan classes of voters instead, including location and perceived duration of residence. The complaint alleges that Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) sought to dilute the votes of urban students to boost the voting power of rural residents of the county.
Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) sponsored the bills making changes to Watauga County’s voting maps at the center of the lawsuit. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
Hise, a Republican whose district includes Watauga, was the lone sponsor of both bills. He said on the state Senate floor in 2023 that he was motivated to counteract “the predominance of [Appalachian State University] and others in the electoral process.” The complaint quotes him pointing to “a longtime standing conflict between the influence of the university and others within the county.”
These remarks, the plaintiffs argue, are an admission of two unconstitutional criteria for the maps: geographic favoritism and discrimination against perceived temporary residents.
Hise did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
When the Watauga Board of Commissioners voted to hold a local referendum proposing new maps without those discrepancies, the General Assembly added to S.B. 912 a provision barring any referendum enacted by Watauga County voters impacting the county commission from taking effect until after the 2032 elections.
Despite the referendum’s passage by a 71% to 29% margin in 2024, it will not take effect for nearly a decade. This violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection, the complaint alleges.
“??The voters of Watauga County will be stuck with unconstitutional districts for their County Commission and Board of Education, unless this Court intervenes,” the lawsuit states. “Fundamentally, the people of Watauga County have no choice but to petition this Court for urgently needed relief from Defendants’ ongoing violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.”
The individual plaintiffs include six Democratic voters and one unaffiliated voter. Three are former members of the Watauga County Board of Commissioners, including Larry Turnbow and Charlie Wallin, who served as chair and vice-chair prior to the 2024 election.
“Watauga County residents voted to adopt fair districts while rejecting the gerrymandered maps imposed on us by the legislature,” said Ray Russell, the other former commissioner joining the lawsuit. “We’re filing this lawsuit to protect our mountain community against the unconstitutional overreach by politicians in Raleigh.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Watauga-District-Map-1024x711.png,,,2025-10-01 17:57:56.092276

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Three Democratic members of Congress from North Carolina held a virtual press conference Wednesday, condemning their Republican colleagues for the government shutdown’s harmful impacts on their constituents.
The federal shutdown started early Wednesday as Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the start of the new fiscal year, leaving at least 200 federally-funded state employees in North Carolina, NC Newsline previously reported.
Reps. Deborah Ross (D-02), Alma Adams (D-12) and Valerie Foushee (D-04) joined the call.
“Since day one, this corrupt administration and the Republicans have refused to negotiate with Democrats on funding the government,” Ross said. “Now, they have plunged our country into a shutdown that will actually wreak havoc on many North Carolinians.”
The shutdown means delays for hungry mothers and kids relying on food assistance, Ross said. TSA employees will be unpaid, potentially leading to longer wait times at the airport — including Charlotte Douglas International Airport, which is one of the busiest in the country.
More than 1 million North Carolinians rely on nutrition assistance, according to Ross, and children across the state will lose access to Head Start programs.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in western North Carolina will be impacted as well. Some facilities will close, with the National Park Service expected to furlough about 9,200 employees, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel.
North Carolina has the fourth largest active military population in the country, with Fort Bragg near Fayetteville, Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, as well as smaller operations throughout the state. Active-duty personnel must carry out their assignments without pay until after the shutdown is over.
Defense Department civilian employees and defense contractors also will not be paid during the shutdown unless Congress passes separate legislation to do so. The loss of those paychecks is likely to have a significant impact on local economies.
Additionally, veterans may no longer have access to some VA benefits and services such as career counseling, transition assistance, and their emergency hotline, Adams said.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency could delay reimbursements to state and local governments, which is especially devastating as western North Carolina continues to recover from Hurricane Helene a year later, Adams said.
“Republicans refuse to meet Democrats at the bargaining table because we want to find a bipartisan solution that could have prevented this shutdown,” Adams said. “Republicans would rather shut down the government than protect the health care of the American people, extending affordable health care tax credits.”
The shutdown occurred in part due to disagreements over health care, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.
Without an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, 22 million Americans will see their premiums soar and 4 million could lose their coverage entirely, according to Foushee.
“These are working families, teachers, nurses, small business owners, and parents trying to afford a doctor’s visit for their children,” Foushee said. “They should not be collateral damage in this Republican-manufactured health care crisis.”
Republicans in North Carolina’s congressional delegation took to social media to blame Democrats for the shutdown.
Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-11) said it’s a myth that Republicans are solely responsible because they control all three branches of government.
“Passing a budget requires 60 votes in the Senate — there are only 53 Republicans in the Senate,” Edwards wrote on X. “Republicans brought a clean continuing resolution (CR) to the floor to keep the government open — Democrats have rejected it.”
Rep. Greg Murphy (R-03) shared a letter he wrote requesting his pay be withheld for the duration of the shutdown.
“No member of Congress should be paid while the American people are forced to endure the serious consequences of the Democrats’ willful negligence and political games,” he wrote.
Notably, Rep. Don Davis (D-01) was the lone Democratic member of North Carolina’s congressional delegation who was not part of the press conference. He holds the state’s most competitive House seat, which Cook Political Report ranked as a Democratic leaning toss-up.

Forests, national parks to stay open during government shutdown, but services may be limited 

Federal agencies and programs in most cases are not allowed to spend money without authorization from Congress. As the federal fiscal year expired at midnight Tuesday, the U.S. Senate Democrats and Republicans remained deadlocked on two dueling proposals that would have extended funding, the States Newsroom reported. 
As a result, many federal workers and programs will be suspended until a funding plan is approved, with exceptions for the military, the Department of Homeland Security, and Transportation Security Administration and air traffic controllers — although these employees will be working without pay. Mail services and Social Security checks will continue, because they do not require annual funding.
There are around 14,387 civilian federal workers in Idaho, with the highest number in the southwestern region of the state, according to the Idaho Department of Labor. Across the nation, the Congressional Budget Office estimated 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed without pay. President Donald Trump and a top official have signaled some of the furloughs may become permanent mass layoffs. 
 How will health care and other public assistance be affected? 

Medicaid and Medicare payments should continue, although a mass furlough of staff may cause delays, CBS news reported. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services officials wrote in its contingency plan it has sufficient funding to last until the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which in total runs Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, 2026. 
More than 300,000 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s budget request form this year.

Food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,Infants and Children, known as WIC, are also expected to continue, at least in the short-term. There are more than 130,000 Idahoans using SNAP benefits. There were more than 30,000 Idaho women and children using WIC services as of information shared by the department in March 2024. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs both food benefit programs. The agency’s contingency plan said that SNAP has enough funds to run through October. The National WIC Association told NBC News that the program has enough funding to continue for another week, after which the program would likely be suspended without more funding from the agriculture department. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which administers these programs to Idaho residents, could not immediately be reached for comment on how services would be impacted. 
 How will the Boise Airport operations be affected?

A spokesperson for Idaho’s largest airport, the Boise Airport, said the shutdown is not expected to have an immediate impact on its day-to-day operations. 
Federal airport personnel are considered essential and will be expected to continue working without pay. During the last government shutdown, which lasted more than a month from December 2018 to January 2019, TSA personnel called out of work at an increased rate, ABC news reported at the time.  
“We are working closely with our federal partners to maintain smooth operations and support the travel experience,” Boise Airport spokesperson Jennifer Kronberg said in an email. “The airport recommends arriving earlier than usual to give yourself enough time to go through the TSA security checkpoint in the event of staffing shortages.”

 Will Head Start early learning programs be affected? 

The federally funded Head Start school readiness program will still receive grants, and programs should continue, Idaho Head Start Association Executive Director Megan Woller told the Sun. 
The staff running Idaho’s programs are not federal employees, she noted. 
Head Start provides preschool services to children aged 3 to 5 and their families, and Early Head Start works with families with children from birth to 3 years old. 
“Assuming the shutdown doesn’t last too long, we are hopeful that programs themselves will not be too badly impacted if federal Office of Head Start employees are unavailable,” Woller said. “Fiscal Specialists and Grantee Specialists are federal employees assigned to the Head Start programs and at times, they assist the programs with very critical, time-sensitive business … If anything changes, families and staff will be made aware of their program.” 
 Idaho Republicans and Democrats blame the opposing party for shutdown 

As of Wednesday afternoon, Congress remained deadlocked among a deep partisan divide between stopgap funding proposals. Idaho’s Republican delegation largely blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

“Senate Democrats have rejected a clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government open to provide breathing room to make bipartisan progress on advancing regular appropriations bills,” Idaho U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo said in an emailed statement to the Idaho Capital Sun.  
“Instead, they are demanding an unserious proposal that would increase government spending by a staggering $1 trillion and wipe out a vast majority of the savings Republicans have worked diligently to pass since the start of the Congress.  The Senate will keep voting to try to keep the government open–Democrats have the choice either to support a CR (Continuing Resolution) as they did 13 times under the previous Administration and keep the federal government fully operational, or pursue unreasonable political objectives.” 
The U.S. Senate voted late Tuesday night and Wednesday morning on a House Republican-supported stopgap funding proposal that would have kept the government running for seven weeks. 
The House proposal advanced Sept. 19 in a 217-212 vote, nearly along party lines. The Senate, which needed at least 60 votes to pass, voted 55-45 late Tuesday on the House Republican funding proposal, also nearly along party lines, with three Democrats joining Republicans in support. 
Senators also voted 47-53 Tuesday on a Democratic proposal that would have extended funding for a month, renew health care premium subsidies, and restore Medicaid cuts approved in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Congressional democratic leaders have said they won’t support a plan that doesn’t extend the health care premium tax credit subsidies, which are set to expire and go toward lowering premiums on health insurance purchased through state marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. 
The health policy organization KFF estimated Idaho has roughly 100,600 enrollees in the health care premium tax credits, receiving an average credit of $407.

Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson also placed blame on Senate Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Democrat Chuck Schumer. 
“Shutting down the government is bad politics and policy. Unfortunately, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats are holding the funding hostage and pushed us into a government shutdown due to their far-left, unreasonable policy demands,” Simpson said in an emailed statement. 
“Idahoans, like the majority of Americans, do not support their tax dollars paying for free health care to illegal aliens, stripping rural hospital funding, or increasing spending by nearly $1.5 trillion. The impacts of government shutdowns are extremely harmful, which is why I supported the clean CR to keep our government open, but the Democrats’ counterdemands would be much more harmful to our nation.”
The law prohibits federal health care — through Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, called CHIP — from being provided to immigrants in the country illegally. The Democrats’ funding proposal wouldn’t have changed that law, but would have restored benefits to noncitizens who had legal permission to be in the U.S., such as refugees, those under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and asylum seekers going through the legal process.

Idaho U.S. Sen. Jim Risch said on the social media platform X, “My offices are open, staffed, and working for Idahoans during the shutdown. While Chuck Schumer placates the far left, my staff and I are staying on the clock to put Idaho first. If you are in need of assistance with a federal agency, contact my office: https://risch.senate.gov/public/” 
His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Sun, other than to highlight the X posts, which include posts that say the blame for the shutdown “is squarely in the hands of the Democrats.” 
Idaho Rep. Russ Fulcher’s office could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The Idaho Democratic Party said in an emailed statement that while Republicans control the House, Senate and White House, the blame lay with the GOP. 
“With all that power, they showed they can’t lead and don’t care to. Democrats fought to protect your health care, keep premiums from doubling for more than 100,000 Idahoans, and save our rural hospitals from devastating cuts,” Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea said in the statement. “Democrats fought to protect your health care, keep premiums from doubling for more than 100,000 Idahoans, and save our rural hospitals from devastating cuts. But Mike Simpson, Russ Fulcher, Jim Risch, and Mike Crapo stood with their party and turned their backs on Idaho families. Because of their choice, thousands of Idahoans will go without pay.”

Gretchen Whitmer advised Wednesday.
Whitmer’s call for schools to continue feeding kids was joined by State Superintendent of Public Instruction Michael Rice and came on the same day that the governor signed a continuation budget with just a fraction of the previous fiscal year’s spending to hold the state over while the Legislature finishes drafting a final budget bill for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
“Two summers ago, I was proud to deliver free school meals to all 1.4 million public-school students, saving parents around $1,000 a year per kid and time each morning,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Since then, we have consistently funded free school meals, saving Michigan families time, money, and worry. As we continue pushing the Michigan Legislature to finalize a balanced budget that feeds our kids, as they’ve said they would, I am calling on our school districts to do what it takes to feed every student today, tomorrow, and every single school day after that too.”
Legislators worked into early Wednesday morning to hash out a final deal after last week’s budget framework came to the fore, and then lapsed into a one-hour government shutdown before both chambers voted on a House plan to keep the government open for the next eight days. That should give legislative staff some cover to produce a final budget bill, which is expected to be approved Thursday and then signed swiftly by the governor.
Despite that work, schools are still without a state budget allocating money to K-12 instruction, leaving many districts in a tough spot as their funding status remains unclear.
Rice said students have been healthier as a result of the last two years of free school meals being a separate line item in the past two previous fiscal year budgets.
“The Michigan Department of Education is appreciative of the support of the state legislature and Governor Whitmer for the Michigan School Meals Program and of the opportunity to partner with local food service staff, directors, and educators to ensure that all children can eat free at school. Let’s keep feeding our kids,” Rice said in a statement.
Public school districts in Michigan receive their state funding in 11 monthly payments, with the last payment being made Sept. 20, which would cover expenses through Oct. 20.
However, K-12 Alliance of Michigan Executive Director Robert McCann released a statement late Wednesday afternoon, urging the administration to provide “actual guidance to help districts navigate this self-created budget crisis,” and calling on Whitmer to release details on the proposed budget and road funding plans that heretofore have been discussed only behind closed doors.
“Pressing schools to spend money when lawmakers have failed to deliver a budget for more than three months now continues to show a total lack of awareness about the chaos and uncertainty Lansing has created that has led to schools discontinuing services such as these. Until there is an actual budget signed into law that includes funding for school meals, which lawmakers have yet to produce, districts cannot simply trust that the funding will be there when the budget is now more than three months overdue,” McCann said.

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., speaks at a news conference with Senate Republicans on Wednesday morning, Oct. 1, 2025, regarding the ongoing government shutdown. (U.S. Senate GOP X screenshot)The federal government began a shutdown early Wednesday morning after the deadlocked U.S. Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year to keep services running.
The shutdown comes as Republicans and Democrats stand at odds over federal funding priorities. Democrats want to see enhanced health care subsidies included in the spending bill. Republicans do not. Without the 60 votes needed in the U.S. Senate for any bill to advance, the body remained at a standstill Wednesday afternoon.
The enhanced subsidies — for plans purchased on the Health Insurance Marketplace — are set to expire at the end of the year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the subsidies expiring is projected to cause 4.2 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2034.
It’s unclear how long this shutdown will last; Thursday marks the Jewish holiday Yom Kipper, which the Senate will take off from work. Lawmakers will likely reconvene for further votes on the competing Republican and Democratic spending bills on Friday and Saturday.
Meanwhile, members of President Donald Trump’s administration have threatened that the shutdown will lead to permanent layoffs and firings for certain federal workers. On Wednesday, the federal Office of Management and Budget told some GOP lawmakers privately that firings could start in “one to two days.” 
Those firings were threatened last week before the shutdown occurred when OMB chief Russ Vought issued a memo telling agency heads to consider giving reduction in force (RIF) notices to employees in programs or working on projects where funding ended on Wednesday due to the shutdown. Those RIFs, per the memo, should occur in programs that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” but few other details have been released regarding who exactly would be affected.
On Tuesday, unions representing federal employees filed a lawsuit against the threats from Vought and the Trump Administration. They called the threats an “unlawful abuse of power” in a news release that day and alleged it was a “misuse” of the shutdown process, which has occurred for decades when funding decisions could not be made.
“Announcing plans to fire potentially tens of thousands of federal employees simply because Congress and the administration are at odds on funding the government past the end of the fiscal year is not only illegal — it’s immoral and unconscionable,” said American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley in a news release. “Federal employees dedicate their careers to public service — more than a third are military veterans — and the contempt being shown to them by this administration is appalling.”
West Virginia leaders react, lob blame at Democrats
Reacting to the shutdown Wednesday, West Virginia Sens. Jim Justice and Shelley Moore Capito, both Republicans, pushed blame on Democrats, who they and their colleagues say are unwilling to compromise despite the potential ramifications for regular workers and people.
Justice, in an emailed news release, said that funding government services “shouldn’t be a food fight.” He said the “clean bill” put forward by Republicans is similar to that voted on by Democrats previously. He said that it was “time for Democrats to stop the games and work with [Republicans] to reopen the government.”
Capito, in a news conference hosted by the Senate GOP on Wednesday, reiterated comments by other Republican leaders in the Senate regarding how “nonpartisan” and “clean” their proposed spending bill is. Democrats, she said, are “hijacking” the process and holding American people “hostage” in the meantime.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, she said the lack of passage on a spending bill is robbing Americans and West Virginians of vital representation from the people they elected to office. 
“[Democrats have] hijacked a process that we need to have in order to demonstrate to the American people what we promised them in this election and what President Trump promised them,” Capito said. “… We’re not going to ride on some continuing resolution that spends like President Biden wanted to spend. We’re going to put our own imprint on this for the American people. That’s what they wanted when they voted us in, and that’s what we want to give them.”
Thousands of West Virginians in particular will be impacted if the health care subsidies at the heart of this fight expire at the end of this year. About 67,000 West Virginians buy their health care on the marketplace. 
The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy said that West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace will see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually. About 15,000 West Virginians will lose health care altogether because they cannot afford it any more, according to the center. 
In a statement Wednesday, West Virginia Democratic Party Chairman Mike Pushkin said it’s clear — given the stakes for low- and middle-income people — that this shutdown is a “Trump shutdown” and largely the work of Republicans.
“While Republicans refuse to even show up to work, Democrats stand united: cancel the cuts, lower costs, and save health care for hard-working West Virginians,” Pushkin said. “Trump is playing politics with West Virginian’s livelihoods. Democrats won’t stop fighting to lower costs and save health care.”
An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll from Tuesday shows that more Americans are holding Republicans responsible than Democrats for the current shutdown.
How services will be affected in the Mountain State
The impacts of the shutdown are wide reaching, with thousands of federal employees in various agencies furloughed and others being forced to work without pay to keep vital services operational. In the past, unpaid workers have received backpay for their service once the government is operational again.
Though most day-to-day services are likely to continue, the consequences and impact on those services could grow the longer the shutdown goes on. In previous shutdowns, workers who were forced to go without pay stopped going to work at a certain point, leading to delays in travel, paperwork processing and more.
The overall impact — both economically and otherwise — of this shutdown will likely depend on how long it lasts. While services with already-appropriated funding will likely remain in operation until funds expire, others could be impacted more immediately. More information will become available on these effects in the coming days.
For now, here’s some information on how certain services could be affected in the Mountain State:
Safety net services
Funding for WIC — a food assistance program for women, infants and children — could run out of remaining funding relatively quickly, leaving thousands of West Virginians in need and out of services. The National WIC Association said Wednesday that while the program has enough on hand to run “temporarily,” Congress should act sooner rather than later to prevent a full shutdown of the vital program.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — which serves as a lifeline for thousands of struggling West Virginians — could also face challenges if the shutdown continued.
Those who rely on SNAP should receive their monthly October EBT payments without issue since those funds were already allocated. However, according to the Food Research and Action Center, if the shutdown continues later into the month, November payouts could be impacted depending on how much money the U.S. Department of Agriculture has in its contingency reserve funds to cover SNAP costs.
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid services will continue throughout the shutdown, but agencies and representatives for them may be difficult to reach or coordinate with due to staffing and other challenges.
Travel and National Parks
Workers for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as well as air traffic controllers are deemed to be essential workers, meaning flights should be able to continue as scheduled as long as individuals continue to show up to work.
A spokesperson for Yeager International Airport, in Charleston, said Wednesday that the airport “expects regular operations to continue throughout the government shutdown.” 
“We remain in close coordination with our federal partners to ensure a safe, secure, and efficient travel experience for all passengers,” they said.
Amtrak trains are also expected to continue running. Per a statement from Amtrak, the railway company expects to “remain open for business.” However previously, when shutdowns have loomed, the Rail Passengers Association has warned that services could become strained the longer a shutdown goes on.
National parks, scenic areas, reserves and more will remain “as accessible as possible during the federal government shutdown,” according to the National Parks Service. The shutdown, however, will likely cost millions in tourism dollars lost nationwide as people question how open they are or opt not to visit. 
Trails and most open-air memorials will remain accessible, but as nearly half the national parks’ staff have been furloughed, not all services will be available. Park visitor centers and other facilities — including some bathrooms, indoor museums and exhibits and more — will likely not be open. Those that are open will not be subject to maintenance while employees are furloughed.
Courthouses and law enforcement
Most law enforcement activities are deemed to be critical services, meaning they will continue working though, in some regards, without pay.
In West Virginia, the federal court system has enough money to likely keep operations running seamlessly. 
The state’s federal penitentiaries — one of the largest federal employers in West Virginia — will continue operations, though again, likely some staff will be unpaid while the shutdown persists.
All essential military personnel deployed during the shutdown will continue working. Some administrative roles and other responsibilities may face furloughs.
Education
Any grant funds not already appropriated to extend past Oct. 1 will likely be put on hold until the government is fully functioning. Other programs that already have funding on hand will likely continue.
The Federal Department of Education will see more than 80% of its staff furloughed during the shutdown. Per The Associated Press, the largest activity that will be paused throughout this time is the investigation of civil rights violations.
Federal student loan programs will continue allocating money until funds are depleted. All loan and Pell Grant borrowers must continue making their payments throughout the shutdown. The department will continue to process the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
Colleges themselves will likely not be immediately impacted, but research activities — which could affect students in certain study programs — could be put on hold. If the shutdown persists, colleges may see more impacts.

At Wednesday’s State Board of Education meeting, Dan Tetreault, assistant director of early learning at the state Department of Public Instruction, presented the annual Read to Achieve report, which will be submitted to the General Assembly.
The report shows that 70% of first-graders and 66% of second-graders reached grade-level reading benchmarks in 2024-25, compared with 39% and 43% just four years ago.
Third-grade scores saw a slight decline. Just 47% of students demonstrated proficiency on the state reading test this year, down from 49% last year.
The data also showed gaps among student groups. Only 21% of English learners scored proficient in third-grade reading, and just 17% of students with disabilities met that standard. By comparison, 59% of white students and 69% of Asian students did so.
Board members questioned Tetreault on why the early-grade gains don’t translate into higher third-grade scores. He explained that the gap stems from the different skills measured.
“For grades one and two, students are assessed with the DIBELS 8 assessment, which looks at foundational skills,” Tetreault said. “By third grade, they have to show proficiency on the end-of-grade reading test. What we see in the DIBELS data is strength in the acquisition of foundational skills, but we see opportunities for growth in areas of language comprehension.”
Several members echoed those concerns, saying the state may need to examine more closely what “proficient” means, with some noting that DIBELS 8 measures different skills than the end-of-grade exam and questioned whether the state is measuring what matters most for reading.
“We want to be sure we’re measuring the right things at the right time so families and communities get a clear picture of progress,” said board member Beckie Spears. 
State law requires students who don’t meet third-grade reading standards to attend summer reading camps or be retained, with some exceptions. About 9,300 third-graders attended reading camps this summer — roughly 35% of those eligible — and 23% of them became proficient afterward.
The report also shows thousands of students promoted through “good cause” exemptions, such as passing an alternative test or having documented disabilities. This year, about one-third of students who initially failed state exams advanced under those provisions.
The Read to Achieve program was launched in 2012 to improve early literacy and ensure students are reading on grade level by the end of third grade. Since then, lawmakers have revised the law several times, adding summer reading camps, reading portfolios and alternative assessments.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Childresn-reading-1.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)On the first day of the federal government shutdown, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and 20 other Democratic AGs are challenging new Trump administration rules that will restrict federal aid for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence if they are undocumented immigrants.
The 54-page complaint filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island seeks to block the new “Legal Services Condition” by the U.S. Department of Justice for programs scheduled to take effect on Oct. 31 including the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (JAG).
States were notified of the rules on Aug. 18 via what the complaint called “surprise notices” informing them they could no longer provide legal services to undocumented immigrants with funding allotted to them through the VOCA, VAWA, and JAG grants.
That was the same day the same coalition of AGs filed a separate suit against the DOJ and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop the withholding of VOCA funds to states where officials refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement. That case remains ongoing.
Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

But even as the Democratic states challenged the administration, the DOJ continued to formalize “improperly ambiguous” rules with “no explanation,” the complaint argued.
“The condition is unclear as to what constitutes ‘legal services’ and which groups of victims and other individuals are to be excluded from those services, including how state agencies (and subgrantees) are to identify which victims and individuals to exclude,” the lawsuit alleges.
The suit argues that the new restrictions would strain victim services programs by forcing states to screen immigration status. The coalition also warned legal residents and U.S. citizens could also be denied help.
“When a victim of sexual assault or domestic violence seeks help, the first question we ask should not be about their immigration status,” Neronha said in a statement. “These restrictions are unreasonable, unlawful, and we will fight to make sure they are blocked.”
Attorneys general involved in the latest lawsuit are from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
Neronha and the coalition argue that DOJ’s new restrictions violate the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause, along with the Administrative Procedure Act.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the DOJ, declined to comment citing the federal government shutdown which began midnight Wednesday after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year. 
“During the current lapse in appropriations, DOJ operations are directed toward national security, violations of federal law, and essential public safety functions,” she said in an emailed statement. “Inquiries outside of these functions will be considered when the lapse in appropriations ends.” 
But the shutdown will not have any effect on federal court operations in Rhode Island.
“All hearings and trials will proceed without interruption, and matters may continue to be scheduled with the Court in the ordinary course,” states a notice on the federal court’s website. “Public access to the court — both in person and through the court’s electronic filing system — will remain unaffected.”

Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, along with independent Angus King of Maine, again joined Republicans in the 55-45 vote for the House-passed stopgap spending bill. GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted no.Democrats also failed to find support to move forward their bill to fund the government through Oct. 31, roll back GOP cuts on Medicaid and permanently extend subsidies that tie the cost of Affordable  Care Act health insurance premiums to an enrollee’s income level. The Democrats failed to advance their plan in a party-line 47-53 vote. King, who caucuses with Democrats, voted in favor.Shutdown tied to health care tax creditsSenate and House Democrats say they will not support a GOP path to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to negotiate on rising health care costs. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a press conference that Democrats are “ready to sit down with anyone at any time and at any place in order now to reopen the government, to enact a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people and to address the devastating Republican health care crisis that has caused extraordinary harm on people all across the country.”The New York Democrat pointed to harms in “rural America, working class America, urban America, small-town America, the heartland of America and Black and brown communities throughout America.” Democratic leaders blitzed Capitol Hill with their message on health care, holding press conferences and attending an evening rally Tuesday on the lawn outside the U.S. House.

They pointed to new data published this week showing annual insurance premiums could double on average in 2026 if the subsidies expire at year’s end, according to an analysis from the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. Open enrollment for next year’s ACA health insurance plans opens Nov. 1 in most states, and Oct. 15 in Idaho.Uptake of ACA health insurance plans has more than doubled to over 24 million, up from 11 million, since the introduction of the subsidies in 2021, according to KFF. During their own budget reconciliation deal in 2022, Democrats extended the insurance premium tax credits until the end of 2025. The majority of ACA enrollees currently rely on the credits.Democrats also want assurances that the White House and Senate Republicans will not cancel any more funds that have already been approved by Congress, as was the case this year when the administration and GOP lawmakers stripped funding for medical research, foreign aid and public broadcasting, among other areas.‘This can all end today’GOP leaders in the House and Senate continued to blame Senate Democrats for the government shutdown at the expense of furloughed federal workers and Americans who rely on their services. At a Wednesday morning press conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson said “troops and border patrol agents will have to go to work, but they'll be working without pay.”Johnson also claimed at the press conference that veterans benefits would stop. The claim is false, as Veterans Administration medical care will continue uninterrupted and vets will also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing.

“As we speak here this morning, there are hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are getting their furlough notices. Nearly half of our civilian workforce is being sent home — these are hard-working Americans who work for our federal government,” the Louisiana Republican said, flanked by fellow GOP leaders on the Upper West Terrace of the U.S. Capitol overlooking the National Mall. Johnson decided in late September the House will be out until Oct. 6, canceling this week’s votes. The speaker said he will bring House members back next week, even if the government is still shut down.“They would be here this week, except that we did our work — we passed the bill almost two weeks ago out of the House, sent it to the Senate,” Johnson said. “The ball is literally in (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer’s court, so he determines that.” Thune said “this can all end today” and “needs to end today.”The South Dakota Republican said the funding lapse can cease when Senate Democrats vote for the GOP’s “clean” short-term funding bill. “We will continue to work together with our House counterparts, with the president of the United States, to get this government open again on behalf of the American people,” Thune said. Bipartisan deal and TrumpVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said later in the day that a bipartisan group huddled on the floor during votes to talk about a possible path forward on “health care fixes” and ensuring that if a bipartisan deal is brokered, the Trump administration will stick to it. Republican senators, he said, could give Democrats assurances they won’t vote for any more rescissions requests from the White House, which ask Congress to cancel already approved government spending. But other issues, like laying off federal workers by the hundreds or thousands, have to be a promise from the president. “If I find a deal, should Congress have to follow it? Yes. Should the president have to follow it? Yes. Well, what if the president won't follow it? Oh, yeah, you got a problem,” Kaine said. “So you know, rescission, impoundment, those are Senate words. But a deal is a deal — people get that.”Kaine also emphasized that it’s not a “clean” stopgap funding bill if the Trump administration unilaterally cancels some of the spending. “In the past, we voted for clean (continuing resolutions), but the president has shown that he'll take the money back,” Kaine said, referring to the technical name for a short-term funding bill. “I mean, just in Virginia, canceling $400 million to our public health, $40 million economic projects just pulled off the table, firing more Virginians than any president. “So we just want you to agree, if we do a deal, then you'll honor the deal,” Kaine said. “It's not that much to ask.”‘People are suffering’North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said he doesn’t expect the shutdown will have long-term ramifications for senators’ ability to negotiate bipartisan deals — a necessity in the upper chamber, which has a 60-vote threshold to advance legislation. “It's all transactional,” Tillis said. “I think there's going to be opportunities for some bipartisan work, but none of that happens, you can't even really consider it when you're in a shutdown posture.”Cortez Masto, who voted to advance Republicans’ seven-week stopgap bill, said the GOP “created this crisis” on health care and “need to address it.”“They have no moral standing — no moral standing —- to say that this is all on the Democrats. They are in control. They've created this crisis,” Cortez Masto said. “People are suffering and they need to come to the table.” Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who was sworn in for the first time during the last shutdown, said he worries about longer-term effects. ""My concern is it's going to poison the well on negotiations going forward on a lot of things,” Hawley said. “I can't speak for anybody but myself, but I would just say that these tactics are very destructive. And it's destructive, not just for relationships, but for real people.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

“Without an extension of the enhanced credits in September, insurers and marketplaces will begin to notify over 20 million consumers in all 50 states of major premium increases in a matter of weeks,” states the letter submitted by The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators in all 50 states, D.C. and five territories.
The expiring subsidies have been a key issue in the halls of Congress this week that led to the federal government shutdown.
Although Brown was at odds with Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana on the issue as recently as Sept. 16, he declined Tuesday and Wednesday to comment to the Daily Montanan.
In the nation’s capital, the debate splits along party lines. In votes on Tuesday, Republicans opposed a Democratic stopgap proposal on Tuesday to fund the government for a month that included several health care provisions, while all but three Democrats opposed a Republican measure to fund the government for seven weeks. A continuing resolution to fund the government needs 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass.
The Affordable Care Act Marketplace allows individuals who do not receive health insurance from employers and do not qualify for Medicaid to shop for coverage from private insurance companies.
Open enrollment for people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace starts Nov. 1, and premiums could double in 2026 if enhanced tax credits in the ACA expire at the end of this year as scheduled, as States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau reported, citing an analysis by health policy research organization KFF.
In Montana, more than 77,000 individuals selected insurance through the ACA Marketplace in 2025, according to KFF. That is up from 42,822 in 2020, before the expanded credits took effect.
All the growth in Marketplace enrollment in the last four years is among people receiving an advanced payment of the premium tax credit, according to a KFF report, nearly doubling from 2020.
In 2024, more than 58,000 Montanans received more than $63.5 million in expanded ACA subsidies from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which extended the subsidies through 2025.
In an interview with the Montana State News Bureau, Brown said he was trying to do the “job that has been tasked to me by the Legislature to protect the consumer and provide regulatory certainty to insurance companies that provide ACA plans in Montana.”
A KFF state-by-state analysis shows that Montanans’ with the tax credits pay an average monthly premium of $112, compared to $203 without the credit — an 81% difference.
In a statement issued in August, Brown warned Montanans about rate hikes from major insurance providers in the state, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana, PacificSource, Mountain Health Co-op, and UnitedHealthcare, which he attributed to several factors including drug and medical inflation, and the uncertainty over federal subsidies.
Heathcare.gov, the federal government’s website for the ACA marketplace, shows that PacificSource is requesting an 11% rate increase, while Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana is requesting a nearly 25% hike.
Brown has been vocal over the ACA’s flaws in interviews with other outlets.
“Until Congress repeals and replaces the failed law that has driven rates higher for years on the American people, we are calling on the federal government to restore the ACA subsidies that help keep insurance within reach for Montana families,” Brown said in a statement to the News Bureau.
Ten House Republicans earlier this year proposed legislation to extend the tax credits.
No members of Montana’s federal delegation, including Rep. Troy Downing, former state Auditor, responded to requests for comment on the debate over subsidies fueling the shutdown, or whether they would support standalone bills to extend the credits.
But speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, said the enhanced premium tax credits were always intended as a temporary, COVID-era subsidy and would carry a $350 billion price tag over a decade.
“It is not a good idea to extend it. We don’t deny the fact there are increases coming in health care costs and insurance premiums, but it’s not because of the loss of this subsidy. That’s a very, very small percentage. The overall health care costs are going up because of inflation, because of some new expensive drugs that are being more utilized,” he said. “These subsidies are not a hill worth dying for the Democrats, and certainly we’re going to oppose it.”
“There’s no reason we should be in a shutdown. It costs taxpayers money. It disrupts government services. And at the end of the day, it doesn’t really deliver any political or policy objective. So, let’s end the shutdown and get both sides back to the negotiating table, get the appropriations through and move forward. That’s the right answer, it’s the best answer as well,” Daines added.
In press statements, Daines and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy both blamed the “Schumer shutdown” on Democrats playing political games.
“Chuck Schumer and the Democrats put partisan games over the best interests of the American people and shut down the government. Democrats are holding critical resources for our military, veterans, and hardworking Montana families hostage to appease their radical, far-left base,” Sheehy said.
Rep. Ryan Zinke posted on social media that Democrats shut down the government because, “they want billions of dollars for illegal immigrants to receive taxpayer funded welfare benefits,” echoing a talking point put out by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The New York Times dove into that claim, while Newsweek and CNN fact checked it as false.
Zinke’s office sent out a survey to Montanans on Wednesday asking whether they “support shutting down the federal government to provide illegal immigrants taxpayer-subsidized health care and eliminatev (sic) the $50 billion rural health fund?”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/capitolnight-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Immigrant advocates staged a small demonstration Wednesday morning at the New Mexico Roundhouse, criticizing legislative leaders and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham for not including in the special session legislation banning immigrant detention centers from operating in the state.
Amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push, three New Mexico detention centers are facing increasing scrutiny for contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees. The number of detainees has steadily increased in the facilities in Torrance, Cibola and Otero counties since Trump’s second term began, according to the latest data. 
NM committee chair who once stymied ICE detention center ban says he’s reconsidering

A measure to prohibit ICE from holding detainees at New Mexico detention centers failed during the session early this year after passing the state House but not the Senate. Last month, Lujan Grisham excluded it from the agenda for the session beginning Wednesday, saying through a spokesperson that she left it out after Democratic leaders requested a “scaled-back session agenda that did not include the immigration detention center bill.”
That said, the governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman said in prior statements the governor is “committed” to legislation banning  ICE detention centers in the state, and “hopes that lawmakers will pass the strongest bill possible.”
Fernanda Banda, one of more than a dozen advocates who gathered in front of the Roundhouse on Wednesday morning, told Source New Mexico that potentially waiting until January is “not good enough,” with people being detained in New Mexico and across the country “left and right. “
“If the governor doesn’t want to put us on the agenda, we’ll bring detention to her,” she said. 
The protest featured a handful of demonstrators sitting in a makeshift jail cell. They read statements they had collected from ICE detainees held in the Torrance County Detention Center, most of them during Trump’s second term, which described being separated from their families and held in poor conditions, including dealing with a sewage backup and water shortage earlier this year. 
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source New Mexico after a news conference Wednesday morning that he and other lawmakers have already committed to making ICE detention a piece of priority legislation that the Legislature takes up during the first half of the session. 
But he said he’s still not sure whether it will pass the Senate. “I don’t know yet,” he said. “That’s why we need the time to get it right.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Protest-over-Immigration-detention-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Bureau of Investigation director Tony Mattivi and Attorney General Kris Kobach announced a crackdown Wednesday on “brazen” sales of marijuana and THC products as law enforcement raided 10 shops in six cities across the state.
The two spoke to reporters at a news conference in Topeka while the raids were underway, and they said additional stores would be targeted later Wednesday and again on Thursday.
Mattivi said the KBI was targeting illegal retail drug sales because teenagers were suffering dire health consequences from consuming products with high concentrations of THC.
“I was at one of these locations earlier today,” Mattivi said. “The violations of the Kansas Controlled Substances Act are brazen. These places are selling pre-rolled marijuana cigarettes. They’re selling marijuana bud. They’re selling marijuana flower in canisters and cigarette by cigarette.
“The places that we’ve identified today are nothing but weed dealers in strip malls, and we cannot continue to not enforce our controlled substance laws when we have these substances causing bad effects on Kansas kids.”
Mattivi said a Kansas child would face less resistance buying marijuana than tobacco cigarettes.
“That has to come to an end, and that’s what we did today,” he said.
The KBI and local law enforcement spent weeks planning the raids in locations where local prosecutors had agreed to bring charges, Mattivi said. The initial wave of targets included smoke and vape shots in Concordia, McPherson, Pratt, Salina, Topeka and Wichita. The seized products would be sent to KBI or private labs for testing, Mattivi said.
While Kansas is surrounded by states that have legalized marijuana to some extent, the drug remains illegal here. Kansas lawmakers have considered bills in recent years that would legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes, and the House passed legislation in 2021, but Senate leadership has stonewalled various proposals. The issue is expected to resurface in the next year’s legislative session, ahead of election season.
For now, Kobach said, the laws have to be enforced. And, he said, there are many illegal products available at stores in Kansas, including THC vapes and THC teas.
“In recent years, enforcement of our laws against marijuana and THC in Kansas have been intermittently or, in some jurisdictions, not enforced at all,” Kobach said. “And so this is an announcement that that period of lax enforcement is ending, and the KBI has taken the lead in identifying places that have become particularly brazen in their selling of marijuana products.”
Kobach and Mattivi traced the rise in illegal sales to the 2018 Farm Bill passed by Congress that legalized some hemp products.
“Since the Farm Bill passed, there’s been a growing acceptance of some of these products, whether they’re CBD or or THC,” Mattivi said. “Over time, these shops, I think, have pushed the envelope and pushed the envelope and pushed the envelope.”
Some of the products, Mattivi said, contain 75-95% pure THC.
“Part of the problem that we’re dealing with when it comes to THC and marijuana is that there has been a continuous rise in the concentration, or the level of purity, the level of THC, that’s present in these products,” Mattivi said. “This isn’t the 6 or 7% THC ditch weed that a lot of people in this state are familiar with.”
The KBI said the following stores were raided midday Wednesday: Two EZ Smoke and Vape locations in Wichita, Whiskey River Trading in Pratt, Cigarette Outlet in Pratt, Pratt Tobacco and Vape in Pratt, Space Out Smoke Vapor & Tobacco in Salina, Vapor 100 in Salina, Mountain Gypsy Vape Shop in Concordia, The Hanging Leaf in McPherson, and Sacred Leaf in Topeka.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010165-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Screenshot)Fred Clark, a former Democratic state legislator and executive director of Wisconsin Green Fire, announced Wednesday he’s running for Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District
The 7th District covers much of northern and central Wisconsin. It is currently held by Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany, who recently announced he is running for governor. Clark served in the Legislature from 2008 to 2015. After leaving the Legislature, he worked for Green Fire, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting Wisconsin’s environment. 
In a video announcing his run, Clark complained that Congress is allowing President Donald Trump to institute tariffs that are harming the northern Wisconsin economy while cutting federal benefits and failing to keep the government funded. 
“We’re all starting to pay more for the things we need because this Congress refused to stop an insane tariff war against our best trading partners,” Clark said.  “And unbelievably, they just voted for a massive handout to billionaires that will add $3.4 trillion to our national debt while taking health care away from 270,000 Wisconsinites who need it the most, leaving the rest of us to pay more for health care that’s just getting worse.” 
On his campaign website, Clark says his priorities are rebuilding rural economies, maintaining secure borders while providing a pathway for immigrants to live and work in the country, expanding health care coverage and responsibly managing the state’s farms and forests. 
Jessi Ebben, a Republican from Stanley had filed to run for the seat before Tiffany announced his gubernatorial campaign. Republican state lawmakers from the area, including Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) could also get in the race.

Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, held a press conference on Oct. 1, 2025 to address the government shutdown that leaves many employees at the Portland International Jetport and airports across the country working without pay. (Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Fresh off a plane from Washington, D.C., U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to address the government shutdown that leaves many employees at the Portland International Jetport and airports across the country working without pay.
“I’m so sorry that this is the first day of a government shutdown,” Pingree said at the start of the conference. With Republicans in control of the White House and both branches of Congress, she said, “this is their shutdown.”
Pingree — who was the only member of Maine’s delegation to reject the resolution that would have kept the government funded — said this is the most unusual shutdown she’s experienced in her time in Congress and highlighted its potential to affect health care for many Americans. The issue has been at the crux of Democratic resistance to Republicans’ short-term plan to fund the government while budget negotiations continue.
Federal government shutdown begins, with no easy exit in sight

Pingree said she’s heard from small business owners and self-employed Mainers who fear that the proposed changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act currently dividing Congress could increase their health care costs at a time when cost of living already feels burdensome.
As the chair of a U.S. House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee, Pingree said she has spent many hours trying to negotiate with her colleagues on both sides of the aisle. She said there are people across the political spectrum that don’t want to see health care costs go up for their constituents, calling it a “universal issue.” 
Rural hospitals in her Republican colleagues’ districts will be hurt just as much as those in Democratic districts, she added. 
Hours before, the U.S. Senate again rejected the House-passed Republican bill that would fund the government for seven weeks without any of the health care provisions requested by Democrats — with Maine independent Sen. Angus King again breaking with Democrats to back the GOP measure.
Hoping to eventually win more Democratic support, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he plans to keep the Senate in session over the weekend to vote again and again on the Republican funding bill.
There are roughly 12,000 federal workers who live in Maine and could either be furloughed or asked to work with deferred pay. Mainers will also be impacted in other ways, for example 179,000 households receive federal nutrition benefits each month, funding for which could run out if the shutdown is prolonged. Those receiving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will continue to receive payments, though call and wait times for those programs are likely to be impacted.
Acadia National Park will remain mostly accessible to visitors, Sen. Susan Collins’ office announced Wednesday, and essential visitor services will continue as the region prepares for the busy autumn tourist season.
More power to the president?
In a statement posted after the initial vote Tuesday evening, King said it was one of the most difficult decisions he’s faced during his time in the Senate but that he was motivated by limiting the power of the Trump administration.
Although many Democrats saw that vote as an opportunity to stand up to President Donald Trump, King said voting against it would have actually given more power to Trump and members of his administration, including Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, and Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
“The irony, the paradox is, by shutting the government we’re actually giving Donald Trump more power,” King said in a social media video Tuesday night. 
He went on to quote Trump, who said he could “do things during a shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them,” referring to Democrats. King said those actions would not be good for American people, so his decision was “a vote of conscience on behalf of the state of Maine and the people of the United States.”

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who was the only House Democrat to back the Republican spending bill, agreed with King’s reasoning. In a statement Wednesday, Golden said he opposed cuts to Medicaid and would like to see certain health care tax credits extended, but the shutdown hurts Americans, the economy and “the irony is it has only handed more power to the president.”
Golden argued there is time to negotiate, but “this government shutdown is the result of hardball politics driven by the demands far-left groups are making for Democratic Party leaders to put on a show of their opposition to President Trump.”
While Pingree agrees the shutdown will give Trump “too much power,” she said, “this president has taken that power for the last nine months.” She pointed to the Trump administration’s comments about potentially firing federal employees during the shutdown rather than the usual practice of furloughing them, adding that it has been firing federal employees since day one.
Pingree said she could see a viable path forward if Republicans are willing to negotiate and that House members could be back by the end of the week to start working on a deal. 
However, her work on appropriations has left her with little trust that the other side will budge. Pingree also said the continuing resolution presented by Republicans is atypical because it includes cuts and funding changes — that Pingree described as “illegal and unconstitutional” — precipitated by the executive branch, rather than continuing the existing baseline budget. 
Health care costs on the line
The main issue Democrats tried to leverage ahead of the shutdown was extending health insurance subsidies.
Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidies lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs.
Last week, Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star that she supports extending the credit but believed it should be addressed outside a must-pass spending bill. The Republican noted that, unlike funding the government, the subsidies didn’t have a Sept. 30 deadline. They expire at the end of the calendar year, though open enrollment begins Nov. 1 and the Maine Bureau of Insurance already announced higher insurance rates.  
Groups pressure Collins to extend health care subsidies. Collins says not yet.

Pingree said Congress can’t wait seven weeks — the length of time funded by the Republican proposal — to sort out the tax credits because many Americans will be forced to make decisions about their health care before then.
In a statement on Wednesday, Gov. Janet Mills blasted Republicans’ refusal to negotiate with Democratic lawmakers over including health care provisions in the must-pass bill.
“It’s entirely irresponsible that the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have shut down the federal government simply because they don’t want people across Maine and America to have access to health care and are unwilling to prevent health care costs from skyrocketing further,” Mills said. “Now, in addition to denying people vital care, Republicans are pushing our economy closer to the brink, putting critical services at risk, and requiring TSA workers, prison guards and members of the military to work without pay.”
Last month, Mills sent a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation warning that thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the subsidies are not extended. 
Democrats had also been pushing for a continuing resolution that reversed the Medicaid cuts made in the GOP’s sweeping budget reconciliation bill signed in July. 
Democrats are also growing increasingly frustrated with the Trump administration’s unilateral actions on spending, arguing it has significantly eroded Congress’ constitutional power of the purse.
Since Trump resumed office, his administration has rescinded and withheld numerous congressionally appropriated funds. 
Ahead of the government shutdown on Tuesday, Collins said the Government Accountability Office should sue the Trump administration over its efforts to freeze or unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress. The GAO has cited the Trump administration for illegally impounding funding for electric vehicle charging, museums and libraries, Head Start, energy efficiency upgrades in K-12 schools, funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On Wednesday, the top Democratic Senate Super PAC Majority Forward released ads in Maine blaming Collins for the government shutdown.

The federal government shut down Wednesday after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year, States Newsroom and the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Idaho is home to numerous national forests, national monuments and even a section of Yellowstone National Park. 
For now, national forests and national parks remain open to visitors, officials said Wednesday. 
“Currently, the National Forests and Grasslands will remain open to visitors and wildland firefighting and disaster response will continue,” a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson who did not give their name said in a written message to the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday. 
“This may change due to length of the shutdown.”

Jessica Maddock, a public affairs officer for the Sawtooth National Forest in Idaho, referred all questions from the Idaho Capital Sun about how the shutdown would affect national forests in Idaho to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s press office. 
In addition to providing the statement saying forests and grasslands remain open, the U.S. Department of Agriculture also provided a written statement in support of U.S. President Donald Trump that blamed Democrats for the shutdown. 
“The Democrat shutdown will cause real harm to American farmers, ranchers, and rural communities,” the unidentified U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson wrote. “President Trump has made it clear through his support of H.R. 5371 that he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
Republicans control majorities in both chambers of Congress, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, and control the White House. 
Websites for several national forests were updated Wednesday with similar political messages in support of Trump.
For example, the Sawtooth National Forest’s alerts website now features a banner that states, “The Radical Left Democrats shutdown the government. This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”
Yellowstone National Park’s website was also updated Wednesday to indicate it will remain open but services will be limited. 
“National parks remain as accessible as possible during the federal government shutdown. However, some services may be limited or unavailable,” the statement read. 
 Shutdown will harm wildlife habitat, animal welfare advocacy group says

On Wednesday, an organization called Humane World for Animals, which was formerly known as the Humane Society of the United States, expressed concern about how the government shutdown would affect wildlife, research animals, farm animals and companion animals.
The organization noted that while national parks remain open, trash collection will stop, which harms animals and their habitats.
“The federal government plays a significant role in upholding animal welfare, so there can be wide impacts on animals during a shutdown,” Humane World for Animals President and CEO Kitty Block and Humane World Action Fund President Sara Amundson said in a written statement. “Any cuts in staffing can leave animals — wild, farmed and companion — more vulnerable to harm.”
Efforts to reach Yellowstone National Park officials to discuss specific effects of the shutdown were not immediately successful Wednesday.
Most of Yellowstone is located in Wyoming and Montana, but a small 50-square mile roadless section is located in Idaho. 
Although officials controlling the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s press office placed the blame for the shutdown on Democrats, Democrats in Idaho disagreed, saying Democrats were willing to negotiate.
“Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House,” Idaho Democratic Party Chairwoman Lauren Necochea said in a written statement. “With all that power, they showed they can’t lead and don’t care to. Democrats fought to protect your health care, keep premiums from doubling for more than 100,000 Idahoans, and save our rural hospitals from devastating cuts. But Mike Simpson, Russ Fulcher, Jim Risch, and Mike Crapo stood with their party and turned their backs on Idaho families. Because of their choice, thousands of Idahoans will go without pay. That includes Forest Service firefighters, Mountain Home Air Force Base personnel, and BLM staff who manage our public lands. Farmers are waiting on $29 million in payments they are owed. Veterans will face delays in care, small businesses will lose access to critical loans, and Women, Infants and Children benefits, including food and formula, will run out. Republicans in Congress believe they are above accountability, and they proved it by forcing this shutdown.”

Appointed as Idaho’s top federal prosecutor by former President Joe Biden in 2022, Hurwit served in the role until shortly after President Donald Trump took office in 2025. He had worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Idaho since 2012 as an assistant U.S. attorney.
Hurwit said he resigned at the request of the president, who re-appointed Bart Davis, an attorney who held the role during the first Trump administration and had long served as an Idaho state lawmaker. Davis’ appointment is still pending confirmation by the U.S. Senate. 
After stepping down as Idaho’s top federal prosecutor, Hurwit told the Sun he hoped to take a few months to rest before figuring out his next job. But he soon joined the team prosecuting Bryan Kohberger, who later pleaded guilty to a quadruple homicide near University of Idaho’s campus in Moscow. 
“I love that process of learning and getting to know clients, to help them through really, really tough times, or to seek justice — if they have to either take action against the government or against another private party. So the pursuit of justice will continue, just in a different format,” Hurwit said. 
In a statement, Matt Smith, who leads Holland & Hart’s commercial litigation practice group, called Hurwit “exactly the caliber of seasoned trial attorney who enhances our litigation capabilities not just in Idaho, but for clients nationwide.”

Home sales dropped 16% in the area in August, and plunging sales have led to unemployment claims by construction workers. (Photo by Tim Henderson/Stateline)Home sales closings dropped in August and remain well below pre-pandemic levels as high prices and interest rates weighed on the market, according to an analysis this week by the Calculated Risk blog.
Home sales are on track for the worst year in decades, matching the 4 million annual sales in 1995, according to a separate realtor.com report Sept. 25.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Closed sales were down 1.8% nationally compared with August 2024, with the largest decreases in Las Vegas (down 16%), San Diego, California (down 10%), Grand Rapids, Michigan (down 9.5%), and Jacksonville, Florida (down 9.4%). Nationally, closed sales are down 27% since 2019.
Nevada is seeing more unemployment claims by construction laborers, carpenters and electricians in the Las Vegas area as home sales drop.
Bucking the trend were cities including Houston (up 12%); Des Moines, Iowa (up 9%), and Phoenix (up 4%), as well as the states of Indiana (up 7%) and Louisiana (up 5%).
September sales should be up from 2024 because interest rates declined slightly, according to a statement from the Calculated Risk blog. August prices rose 2% compared with 2024. Home sales for September are scheduled for release Oct. 23 by the National Association of Realtors.

(Michael M.

Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a construction worker in Baldwin County, alleges in the lawsuit that he was detained twice by ICE officers in May and June because of his appearance.
“When he goes to work on private property, Leo expects the freedom, as an American, to work in peace,” the complaint reads. “Yet, twice, Leo got the opposite: Immigration officers, wielding an overly broad grant of authority but no warrant, raided the private construction sites where Leo was working and rounded up all the workers who looked Latino—even citizens, like Leo, who had done nothing wrong.”

 The lawsuit filed on Tuesday in the Alabama Southern District Court names as defendants the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS); the U.S. Department of Justice and multiple government officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; White House Border Czar Tom Homan and U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi.
According to the lawsuit, Venegas is an American citizen who was born in Florida. He moved to Alabama at age 14 and has lived in the state since then. 
Venegas was detained once on May 21 and again on June 12 while working on private construction sites. The complaint said during the first arrest on May 21, Venegas was arrested while recording his brother who was also being detained by ICE.
“Leo continued walking, but Officer Doe 1 suddenly sped up and grabbed Leo by the arm, causing Leo to exclaim, ‘Don’t touch me! I’m a citizen,’” the complaint said. “Without asking any questions, Officer Doe 1 forced Leo’s arm behind his back and began to push him to the ground.”
After being pushed to the ground, the lawsuit alleges, ICE agents took Venegas’ STAR  ID, a form of identification requiring significant documentation to obtain. However, the complaint says that officers still arrested him and accused him of having a fake identification. He was released after officers verified his Social Security number.
Local law enforcement agencies in Alabama partner with ICE, sparking concerns

The lawsuit alleges that white and Black workers were also on the site that was raided on May 21, but only Latino workers were targeted by ICE.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a press release Wednesday that Venegas was detained because he was obstructing an arrest.
“He physically got in between agents and the subject [ICE] were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands. Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest,” the department said.
During the second raid on June 12, the lawsuit said, Venegas was alone on a construction site he was working on when ICE officers approached and instructed him to exit the building to have his immigration status checked.
When Venegas presented his STAR ID, he was told it could be fake and he was then walked to an unmarked vehicle where his immigration status was checked and he was released along with two other workers the lawsuit claims were also unlawfully detained.
Attorneys for Venegas allege that the raids that led to Venegas’ detainments violate the Fourth Amendment.
“Immigration officers need a warrant, consent, or an emergency to enter the non-public areas of private construction sites (e.g., areas posted with no trespassing signs, fenced in, or enclosed). And they must have an objective factual basis for suspecting that the particular workers on that site are violating immigration laws,” the complaint said.
Venegas’ attorneys also allege that unconstitutional policies of DHS have allowed ICE officers to unlawfully search workers at construction sites.
“Under the administration’s policy, immigration officers can raid construction sites without a warrant and without any reason to believe the employers or employees on a particular site are violating immigration laws. Once on the property, officers can arrest anyone they think fits the profile of an undocumented worker and detain them until the worker proves their legal status,” Institute for Justice, the non-profit organization representing Venegas said.
Venegas said he feels like he’s unsafe going to work.
“It feels like there is nothing I can do to stop immigration agents from arresting me whenever they want,” he said in a press release Wednesday. “I just want to work in peace. The Constitution protects my ability to do that.”
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement in response to a New York Times article Wednesday that ICE “does not arrest or deport U.S. citizens” and that “Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.”
Jarred McClain, the lead attorney for the lawsuit, said in a phone interview Wednesday this case was filed to protect constitutional rights. 
“Our case is fundamentally about the rule of law, however people feel about immigration or law enforcement or ICE’s policies, our structure of government can’t survive unless we stand up and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution,” McClain said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

He said school choice has led to closures and consolidations of public schools. (Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia School Board President Paul Hardesty said Wednesday that lawmakers — not education officials — are responsible for addressing the school closures and consolidations that are increasing across the state. School choice, he said, has led to tens of thousands of students leaving public schools over the past decade. 
“Where does that relief need to and have to come from? Right across the way,” Hardesty said. “There’s 134 members of the Legislature. They have the oversight. They have the ability to change the school aid formula, to recognize these rurally challenged, geographically challenged areas that we speak of. They have that ability. I and this board and this department do not.”
Hardesty’s comments came during the regular board of education meeting Wednesday morning. 
School closures have become more common as the state’s population declines and more students leave public schools for private and home schools. 
According to the state Department of Education, 16 public schools closed in 2024, up from 9 in 2023 and five in 2022. The 2025 numbers have not been finalized, but five public schools have closed so far, said Christy Day, director of the West Virginia Department of Education Office of Communication
Hardesty said the public has a “severe” misconception about who sets the state’s laws and rules concerning the state’s education system. He said he decided to make the comments after reading an opinion column about a school closure in Randolph County. The board of education can offer limited relief when it comes to school closures and consolidation, he said. 
Hardesty said he’s seen a “fundamental change” in the legislative process over the past decade – all in the name of school choice. He attributed the change to the influence of the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators that have advocated for expanding school choice. 
“They are the ones that proposed the school choice model and playbook for West Virginia and other states throughout the land, and they make no bones about what they’re trying to accomplish,” Hardesty said. “…on public education, I think they played a little heavy handed, and they’ve got some unintended consequences from their actions.”
Hardesty said the public school system has lost more than 35,000 students over the past decade “in the name of school choice.” While the Legislature has changed school law to incorporate school choice, it’s made no changes to the funding model, he said.
“The financial instability of the system continues to grow and continues to grow and gets worse and worse,” Hardesty said. 
Under the current school funding formula, counties receive state funding based on the number of students.  
The state’s Hope Scholarship gives families around $5,200 per student to use for private school or  homeschooling.The state’s school voucher program will need around $245 million next year, an increase of $144 million from the current year’s funding, according to the West Virginia treasurer’s office. 
Del. Joe Ellington, R-Mercer, chairman of the House Education committee, said through a House spokeswoman Wednesday that “it’s too early to say” if lawmakers will address the school funding formula during the next legislative session.
“But we have spent a good deal of time looking at the formula, and it’s possible the Public Education Subcommittee may have some discussions about it before the regular legislative session,” Ellington said. 
Because private schools can’t often accommodate students with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), Hardesty said the Hope Scholarship has taken the state’s “best and brightest” and left the public schools with the responsibility of educating children with social, developmental and economic challenges.
“It’s left us the toughest to try to educate,” Hardesty said. “And we’ll take that challenge head on, but it’s hard. It’s very expensive to provide the services for those children.”

(Photo via Google Earth)A Bremer County hospital is being sued by a fired surgeon who alleges the hospital has put patients at risk.
Dr. John Matthew Glascock, a bariatric surgeon, is suing the Waverly Health Center and its CEO, Jodi Geerts, in Bremer County District Court. Court records indicate Glascock was employed by the hospital from July 2018 to Dec. 22, 2024, when he was fired.
According to the lawsuit, Glascock specializes in advanced laparoscopic surgery and bariatric surgery.
Prior to joining Waverly Health Center, he worked at Waterloo’s Covenant Medical Center from October 2002 through June 2018. Covenant hired Glascock to establish a surgical weight loss program, which later became known as the Midwest Institute of Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery. The lawsuit claims the program “was very profitable and generated millions of dollars in revenue for Covenant.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2017, the lawsuit claims, the Waverly Health Center began recruiting Glascock and encouraging him to leave Covenant. In July 2018, Waverly Health Center hired Glascock to conduct advanced laparoscopic and bariatric surgery, to be marketed under the brand name “Healthy You.” The lawsuit alleges the program grew each year and represented “a new and profitable service line” for the Waverly hospital, with Glascock performing “about 1,000 surgical cases that generated millions of dollars in additional revenue” for the hospital.
In January 2023, Geerts was named CEO of the hospital. In August 2024, Glascock’s first assistant for his surgeries, Jason Jampoler, accepted a traveling-nurse position and gave the hospital two weeks’ notice of his departure.
The lawsuit alleges Glascock then met with Geerts to impress upon her the importance of retaining Jampoler. Geerts allegedly responded by indicating the hospital would not try to prevent Jampoler’s departure and Glascock would have to use whomever the hospital chose for him to assist with surgeries.
Surgery halted due to ‘patient safety’ concerns
According to the lawsuit, shortly after Jampoler left, Glascock attempted to perform a weight-loss operation known as a sleeve gastrectomy. The nurse selected to assist with the operation was, the lawsuit claims, unfamiliar with Glascock and had never participated in a bariatric surgical case.
“It was clear from the start of the procedure that the nurse WHC selected lacked the skill, ability, and experience to be Dr. Glascock’s first assistant,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Glascock soon stopped the surgery. “In Dr. Glascock’s medical judgment, continuing the surgery without a qualified and competent first assistant put the patient’s safety at risk,” the lawsuit alleges.
Glascock alleges he then met again with Geerts and “stressed that the lack of a competent first assistant to work with him was, first and foremost, a patient safety issue, and that the issue had to be resolved before he conducted, or attempted to conduct, another bariatric surgery.”
Geerts, the lawsuit claims, again told Glascock he “would work with whomever WHC assigned him.” Glascock allegedly told Geerts he intended to raise the issue with the hospital’s board of trustees at its upcoming Sept. 23, 2024, meeting, but a few hours before that meeting was to begin, Geerts handed him a “termination notice,” indicating he was being fired without cause and was relieved of his duties, effective immediately.
By firing him “for no reason, Geerts and the Board of Trustees jeopardized the health, safety, and well-being of WHC’s ‘Healthy You’ patients, a significant number of whom were scheduled for surgical procedures or were involved in complex post-operative management and care,” the lawsuit claims. “While his former colleagues watched in horror, Dr. Glascock cleaned out his office and left the building.”
The lawsuit claims Glascock’s firing was in violation of public policy and constitutes wrongful termination and breach of contract. The lawsuit also seeks damages due to Geerts’ alleged intentional interference with his contract.
Waverly Health Center has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the hospital declined to comment on the case.
Glascock’s previous employer alleged fraud
The lawsuit against Waverly Health Center isn’t the first time Glascock has sued a former employer.
Court records show Glascock’s employment agreement with Covenant had contained a noncompete clause that restricted him from engaging in a medical practice in his area of specialty for a period of 18 months. The agreement included a buyout provision that could have relieved Glascock of the noncompete restriction in exchange for one year’s compensation, according to court records.
When Glascock quit in 2018, he asked that Covenant release him from the noncompete clause, but was unwilling to pay the buyout fee. Covenant refused the request, and Glascock then went to work at Waverly, less than 25 miles from Covenant. Covenant eventually hired a bariatric surgeon to replace Glascock, but according to subsequent court rulings, that surgeon worked at Covenant for less than two months before being fired for misconduct.
Covenant’s bariatric surgery clinic closed and lost its accreditation about one year after Glascock left. Glascock filed two lawsuits against Covenant, one alleging he was not awarded agreed-upon incentive payments, and one which sought to have the noncompete clause declared unenforceable.
Covenant then filed a counterclaim for damages resulting from Glascock’s alleged violation of the terms of his contract. In 2021, a judge ruled in favor of Covenant in the amount of almost $1.2 million — $507,000 plus $660,517 in interest and attorney fees.
Glascock appealed, but the Iowa Court of Appeals upheld the judgment and also awarded Covenant $82,330 in additional attorney fees tied to the appeal.
Covenant then sued Glascock again, alleging that despite his “substantial income and significant assets,” Glascock had refused to pay the judgment against him, forcing Covenant to go after his assets, which reportedly included more than $1 million worth of California real estate and an assortment of vintage motorcycles.
Covenant alleged Glascock committed fraud by transferring ownership of the motorcycles and other assets to his mother, Dorothy K. Glascock, and by working with an “asset-hiding firm” that openly promoted its ability to help people hide their assets from creditors.
“Glascock is a wealthy doctor, with millions of dollars in mansions and real estate who won’t to pay his debts and enlists his family to help hide his assets to avoid collection,” attorneys for Covenant alleged in court filings.
The lawsuit was dismissed shortly after attorneys for Glascock and Covenant informed the court a settlement had been reached.
Malpractice claims filed by patients 
In 2020, Glascock and Waverly Health Center were sued by the family of the late Byron Hesse, who had died hours after bariatric surgery at the hospital. The lawsuit alleged that during the operation, Glascock nicked Hesse’s spleen, then attempted a repair. During an autopsy, 3,850 milliliters, or roughly 130 ounces, of “liquid and clotted blood” were allegedly found in Hesse’s abdominal cavity and Hesse’s death was allegedly attributed to a surgical complication of the surgery performed by Glascock.
Glascock and the hospital denied any wrongdoing and the case was later dismissed with no public disclosure of any settlement.
In 2023, Glascock and Wavery Health Center were sued by another patient, Erin Barker of Oelwein, who claimed her botched bariatric surgery and Glascock’s subsequent alleged negligence left her “starving” and close to death.
In her lawsuit, she claimed that after her vision began to fail and her body began to shut down in the wake of her surgery, she was taken to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics where she underwent immediate surgery. “The doctors at UIHC told Erin that her body, specifically her organs, were 24 hours away from completely failing and she could have died within 48 hours,” the lawsuit alleged.
Glascock and Waverly denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit was dismissed after a judge ruled that the certificate of merit that must accompany such lawsuits had been filed improperly as it was not in the form of a sworn affidavit.

Ron DeSantis is threatening to put lawmakers on the spot about property taxes during the heat of their reelection campaigns.
The governor, during a news conference at Jacksonville International Airport Wednesday, reiterated that he believes voters should decide the fate of the property tax in the state come the November 2026 election.

Lawmakers could “potentially have a special session on property tax right in the middle of the Republican primary season in July or August,” DeSantis said, although “I’m not saying we’re going to wait that long.”
He continued: “I don’t think a lot of these guys would want to vote the wrong way then. It’s interesting, when they know the voters are watching, they tend to govern themselves accordingly.”
The 2026 primary elections are set for Aug. 18.
The governor’s office is researching how the tax can be eliminated, in what he says is possibly the only state in the nation that could eliminate such a tax. In August, he said the structure of the state’s economy, enhanced by tourism, gives Florida the edge most states don’t. 
“I want to see something big enacted, that’s the whole goal. So, we’re doing that, we’ve got numbers, we’ve got language, we’re doing that. So, that will happen, you guys will see that in due time,” DeSantis said. 
“Nobody that I’ve talked to is really complaining about taxes at the state level. They appreciate the tax relief, they appreciate no income tax. What they’re being squeezed by are taxes at the local level, with the property taxes,” DeSantis said. 
DeSantis appeared with Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia. The stage was positioned next to what Ingoglia calls a “Donna Deegan Hologram,” a video board at JAX that plays an image of the mayor welcoming travelers to the city. 
On social media, Ingoglia has taken a particular interest in the cost of the display to taxpayers, reportedly $75,000. During the news conference, Ingoglia called the presentation “a stark example of tone deafness.”
The Florida House last month convened its Select Committee on Property Taxes in advance of the 2026 legislative session. That committee is digging into the matter, while the Senate remains without any counterpart.
As part of the state’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” efforts and in a push to prod lawmakers into eliminating property taxes, DeSantis and Ingoglia have been touring around the state, criticizing some local governments for spending practices. They’ve alleged overspending in several jurisdictions but few specifics of what they consider wasteful spending.
DeSantis promised more findings, including for universities and state agencies. 
The governor said the state may highlight cities that are, in his eyes, doing “a good job.” 
“It could be a blue city,” DeSantis said. “We’ll give you credit. And I know that there are red areas that have spent way too much.”

Affordable Housing Conference in Raleigh.
Jenny Schuetz (Photo: Greg Childress)
Schuetz, vice president of infrastructure and housing at Houston-based Arnold Ventures, was the keynote speaker at the event, which was attended by more than 1,500 affordable housing advocates, developers, policymakers and others. She leads the organization’s efforts to find evidence-based solutions to address critical housing issues.
“We haven’t been building enough homes to keep up with demand created by population growth and job growth for more than 15 years now,” Schuetz said. “Going back to the great financial crisis, we just stopped building housing altogether for about four or five years. It took a long time for industry to start digging itself out of a hole.”
Arnold Ventures is a philanthropic organization that focuses on evidence-based solutions to problems in the criminal justice system, education, health and public finance. It was founded by billionaire John Arnold and his wife Laura.
Schuetz is author of Fixer Upper: How to Repair America’s Broken Housing System, which assess how local state and national housing policies affect people and communities.
The housing shortage, Schuetz said, is more acute in areas with the best job markets, productive companies and great public schools.
“The Research Triangle area has a lot really well-paid jobs and a lot of great opportunities for people,” Schuetz said. “Places like coastal California, D.C. [District of Columbia], where I live, New York, Boston — many or those areas haven’t been building enough homes for 30 or 40 years, so we’ve got a lot of building to do to dig ourselves out of a hole.”
The top states for the housing shortage are large one like California and Texas, but North Carolina and others also have not built enough housing to keep up with demand, Schuetz said.
A recent study commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS® found that the state needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties.
Schuetz believes fixing the nation’s housing crisis will require bold policy changes from local, state and federal governments. She said states and local governments have adopted “a whole lot of rules that may be coming from a good place” but make it tougher for developers to build housing.
Schuetz supports revisions to zoning laws to allow more diverse housing types such as accessory dwellings, townhouses, duplexes and apartments. The rezoning process for rental housing also needs to be shorter, simpler and more transparent to help low- to moderate-income households, she said.
It’s also much harder to build starter homes for first-time homeowners, she said. “Part of the problem we have now is that the people who would have been homeowners probably 20 years ago are still in the rental market.”
Schuetz would like to see zoning reforms to encourage the building of more row houses, popular in cities such as the District of Columbia, Baltimore and Philadelphia, rather than the single-family detached homes that tend to dominate zoning in many areas.
She noted that existing homeowners are a formidable force when they go before local governments to protest development proposals, often complaining that projects are too big, out of scale and will put enrollment pressures on school districts.
“This is worse actually in a lot of communities that think of themselves as progressive, care about diversity but they really don’t want diversity in their own neighborhood,” she said.
Schuetz said she gave a talk in Chapel Hill last year where she heard Habitat for Humanity fought residents who professed to care about affordable housing for 15 years to get a project approved to provide such housing.
She said there has been a shift over the last several years with many more people showing up at local government meetings to support affordable housing and apartment complexes.
Schuetz advised developers to avoid “grand general statements” when trying to win over existing homeowners anxious about new projects and policy reforms. She said the quickest way to shut down a conversation about policy reform is to walk into a room and declare an end to single-family homes.
“Stay away from scary terms,” Schuetz said. “We want to talk about things in a way that is positive so we can make it easier to build homes of all shapes and sizes.”
Nate Blanton, a former Democratic candidate for the NC House, organized a successful fight against a large housing project in Garner, contending such developments can diminish the quality of life for existing residents. Blanton did not win the House race.
Blanton said the development of 300 single-family homes, 500 multi-family residential units and commerce space was not right for the area. It was too big and would have a negative impact on traffic, he said.
“We got the outcome we desired and the development was stopped,” Blanton said. “That’s virtually unheard of in North Carolina.”
Blanton acknowledged that some neighbors opposed the development because the mostly white community of homeowners didn’t want to see renters move nearby.
“When you say affordable housing, I can tell you what pops up in a lot of people’s minds,” Blanton said, acknowledging a legacy of racism that fuels distrust among some whites.

Scott Farmer, executive director of the N.C. Housing Finance Agency, said state and federal funding is essential to increase the state’s housing supply. But removing barriers through regulatory reforms would also help developers to quickly add more homes, he said.
“A lot of that has to do with local governments and some of their staffing capacities as well, which we recognize, but the biggest hurdle is financing and regulatory reform to speed up the construction process,” Farmer said.

Republicans need a handful of Democratic votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to overcome a filibuster and pass a spending bill to keep the lights on. Democrats, spurred on by a restive grassroots base, want concessions on the massive health care cuts Republicans passed in July. Republicans have refused. 
For now, that means all but the most essential services — airport security, food inspection, weather alerts, law enforcement — have been shuttered. 
The shutdown comes after months of attacks on federal workers by President Donald Trump and allies including Elon Musk, who ordered the termination of thousands of government employees and offered buyouts to 2 million workers. (Litigation is ongoing over the legality of the firings; many workers have been hired back.)
The constant denigration of the federal workforce had already lowered morale; now, a shutdown is making things worse — and federal employees are afraid to speak out, said Ruark Hotopp, national vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees for the district including Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. 
Federal workers in Minnesota do everything from data collection and processing of funding applications to park maintenance and management of the electrical grid.
Don’t expect to hear too much from them, however: Directives from federal agency leaders say workers are subject to discipline for speaking with the press or posting about their jobs on personal social media accounts, Hotopp said. Even the union is having some difficulty understanding what’s happening at various agencies. 
“Getting accurate information out of agencies is really difficult at the moment, because they’ve put gag orders and they’ve terrified everybody — so it’s kind of a hostage situation,” Hotopp said.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March instructing agencies to terminate their union contracts. Unions immediately sued, and a district judge on Tuesday ruled the president overstepped his authority. While the lawsuit is underway, agencies have decided to unilaterally cancel collective bargaining agreements.
At the same time, agencies are icing out union representatives, Hotopp said, making gathering data on furloughs, reassignments and firings more difficult. 
Some agencies still have some leftover funding available from the last stopgap funding bill, so some federal workers are working with pay for the time being. 
Others, like the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, where Hotopp works, are reassigning workers from positions that are funded through congressional appropriations to jobs that are funded by uninterrupted sources of funding, like the fees people pay on citizenship and visa applications. In some cases, Hotopp said, that means placing people in jobs that they didn’t agree to, and aren’t trained for. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Education, Commerce, Labor and Housing and Urban Development have all furloughed more than 70% of their workers, according to a New York Times tracker.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/edemployee-1024x750.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

Maggie Goodlander speaks at an event at Waypoint in Manchester on July 8. The congresswoman said Republicans are to blame for the government shutdown that began Wednesday. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Amid finger-pointing over the government shutdown that began on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander said she saw only one Republican in the Capitol and congressional offices the day before.
She slammed it as a “stunning dereliction of duty.”
“The idea that they’re not showing up at all and that they’re not working in good faith is the reason why we are in this predicament, why we are on the cusp of a completely senseless and utterly preventable shutdown,” Goodlander said in a phone interview with the Bulletin Tuesday. “That’s the most stunning part of all of it.”
On Tuesday, the Senate failed to come up with a plan that would’ve funded the government for the short term at the start of the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Republicans proposed keeping the government open for the next seven weeks using mostly current levels of spending. Democrats called for roughly $1 trillion in additional funding to extend a series of Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire in December and reverse health care cuts made in July through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Senate Republicans — who hold a 53-47 majority — rejected the Democrats’ proposal and refused to budge on the health care requests, so all but two Democrats (and one independent who caucuses with the Democrats) in the Senate rejected the GOP spending plan Tuesday, leading the government to shut down at midnight.
Both parties, including Democrats like Goodlander, have pinned the shutdown on the other side of the aisle.
“No one who’s coming at this in good faith wants to see the government shut down,” Goodlander said. “This is a crisis of the Republican Party’s creation, and I’m sorry to say, but that is the truth. We’ve got a Republican-controlled White House, a Republican-controlled Senate, and a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.”
Meanwhile, Republicans — including President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson — have argued that by voting down the proposal that mostly maintains current levels of spending, Democrats are responsible for the shutdown.
In a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday ahead of the shutdown, 33% of respondents said both parties are equally to blame while 26% blamed Republicans more and 19% blamed Democrats more.
Before arriving in the Senate, the Republican spending plan passed the House (where no filibuster rule exists and only a simple majority was necessary) with only one Democratic vote. Goodlander, who voted no, wouldn’t say what concessions Republicans would’ve needed to make in that spending plan or a future alternative plan for her to vote for it.
Still, she bashed Republicans for not extending the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits set to expire at the end of the year.
“We know that if these tax credits are not extended, it’s going to spark what one of my Republican colleagues called a death spiral,” Goodlander said. “It’s going to put us in a place where people will not be able to get the care that they need.”
Republicans have alleged Democrats are trying to extend free health care to immigrants who aren’t authorized to be in the country. Goodlander called this “a bald-faced lie” and “completely at odds with what our laws actually say.” Indeed, undocumented immigrants aren’t legally eligible for the programs Democrats are seeking funding for and their proposal doesn’t give them eligibility.
As the country braces for a lengthy shutdown, Goodlander emphasized her support for a series of bills that would’ve ensured military service members, civilian defense workers, military contractors, TSA agents, and air traffic controllers are paid during shutdowns as well as a bill to revoke the pay of Congress members during shutdowns. However, none of those have advanced out of committee, and they’re all far from becoming law. Essential government employees reporting to work Wednesday are doing so without pay. Goodlander also sent a letter to the House administrator requesting her House salary be withheld during the shutdown.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/goodlandershutdown-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)First, you tap into racism.
Several decades ago, Republican campaign consultant Lee Atwater described how, as The Nation put it, “Republicans can win the vote of racists without sounding racist themselves.” Atwater outlined the “Southern Strategy” in a 1981 interview, but its roots stretch out much deeper into America’s political past and wrap around its present.
If you care to listen, it’s not difficult to hear how state and federal Republican policies on immigration, crime, and diversity initiatives, among other areas, rely on the predictability of America’s entrenched racism. In New Hampshire, there are echoes of the strategy in the way House leaders antithetically defend their crusade against DEI as the restoration of the “principle of equal treatment under the law.” Too many Republicans, it seems, desire equity only insofar as the nation’s long practice of systemic discrimination is preserved, even as they deny that those discriminatory practices exist. 
New Hampshire’s push for a ban on the teaching of “divisive concepts” — essentially a statutorily mandated American history puff piece — was born of this preservation effort, too. As far as the anti-DEI gang is concerned, this country was progressing just fine before the pesky Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts came along and mucked up the works. 
The Southern Strategy also provides the foundation for the way state Republicans talk about immigration, particularly sanctuary cities and the concept of “illegal” human beings. They’ve banned those sanctuaries now, freeing the Granite State from an imagined scourge that would rank toward the very bottom of voter concerns had a cluster of ambitious Republicans not recognized it as a right-wing layup. And, if there was any doubt about just how blatant the national party has become in its approach, here are a couple of recent headlines: “US Supreme Court OKs racial profiling in Los Angeles immigration enforcement” and “Trump’s DC rhetoric echoes history of racist narratives about urban crime.”
The right can’t even talk about the cause of this week’s shutdown — ultimately a divide over whether the federal government should help poor people receive health care — without whipping up bigotry. The accusation that Democrats want to give free care to unauthorized immigrants is inaccurate, as the Trump administration and members of Congress no doubt know, but from the Republican perspective the facts don’t matter even a little bit. Their base hears “money for illegals” and that ensures that the truth of it, which is that Democrats are pushing for the extension of subsidies and the restoration of Medicaid funding so poor Americans don’t fall through the health care cracks, is washed away in a false fury.     
What we’re witnessing in New Hampshire and the nation right now is a lot of things, but progress is not one of them.
From there, you create moral panic.
One of the defining characteristics of this Republican moment is its inseparability from a strain of Christian nationalism that is much more interested in stonings than the benevolence it professes to embrace. While the true aims of the movement are clearly evident in the label, the policies are marketed as protections for the American family. Protect them from what? Anything and everything deemed by Christian nationalists to be unchristian, which tags an ever-expanding list of out-groups for persecution and eviction.  
To that end, New Hampshire lawmakers have pursued book bans and pro-discrimination bathroom bills, while hijacking reproductive health care decisions from women and their doctors, outlawing gender-affirming care, and adopting “parental rights” measures that create a framework in which adults can leverage their own moral panic to dictate school curriculum.
Taken together, the policies deliver a hard fact: There’s a selective and diminishing guest list for the great society as envisioned by American conservatives.
Finally, you keep corporations, the wealthy, and their media-savvy champions happy enough so they’ll accept all the crimes and immorality that in other eras would have ended a presidency and a movement.
The same week that The Wall Street Journal dropped that bombshell about President Donald Trump’s gross contribution to Jeffrey Epstein’s birthday book and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of racial profiling, The New York Times published a story that flew under the radar.
“The Trump administration is quietly dismantling efforts by the Internal Revenue Service to shut down a slew of aggressive tax shelters used by America’s biggest multinational companies and wealthiest people,” read the lead of that story from reporter Jesse Drucker.
Despite its small splash, what the story describes is part of the main event for the large swath of American conservatives who hate taxes even more than they love Christian nationalism or translating racism into policy. When considered along with the administration’s giant tax cut law and the ongoing gutting of the IRS — and the ever-expanding $1 trillion tax gap — it’s clear that Republicans don’t see economic inequality as the problem. In fact, they see it as the answer.
In New Hampshire, that means business tax cuts, tax repeals that largely benefit corporations and the wealthy, universal school vouchers — all while services for lower-income families are being cut or defunded. Amid all of this, overstressed homeowners and renters are running out of ways to make their household numbers work as the cost of everything from groceries to auto repairs to child care eliminates options and opportunities. 
Alleviating those burdens — and for as many people as humanly possible — should be job one for any politician, but that’s not how politics works.
The architects of this modern Republican tent have worked long and hard to achieve the level of power they now hold. And nothing is more frightening to the powerful than ceding even an ounce of it. So now they are prioritizing their continued majorities through gerrymandering, which disempowers individual voters and should be reprehensible to anyone who claims to be a public servant, whatever political party they call home. They are also, under the banner of “voting integrity,” making it so some of the people most likely to vote against them will never get the chance. 
But “voting integrity” is a lie born of an even bigger lie from Trump and the bulk of his party: that the 2020 election was stolen. Do you know how many cases of election fraud there were that year, collectively, in the six battleground states targeted by Trump’s wrath? Fewer than 475 — “a number that would have made no difference in the 2020 presidential election,” the Associated Press reported.
Of course, so loud and persistent are the echoes of Trump’s lie that the facts about “voting integrity” did nothing to stop New Hampshire (which has seen fewer than 20 convictions for voter fraud in total over the past decade) from enacting one of the most restrictive voter ID laws in the country last year.
That’s not integrity; it’s just disenfranchisement. As the Brennan Center for Justice reported in 2023, “There is a growing mountain of evidence that strict voter ID laws disproportionately impact voters of color.”
Even amid this swell of bigotry, hypocrisy, and orchestrated chaos, in many ways the America of 2025 resembles the America that I was born into more than a half-century ago. Trump is racing with the same baton that President Ronald Reagan once clutched.
But what does feel new is that the Republicans are succeeding at pulling off maybe their greatest con of all: convincing a not insignificant number of Americans that the primary instruments of general public well-being are actually the “enemy within.” Public education is the enemy. Affordable and accessible health care is the enemy. Scientific research is the enemy. Environmental protections are the enemy. Clean energy is the enemy. Voting rights are the enemy. Civil rights are the enemy. Progress, in all its forms, is the enemy.
America is actively choosing racism, Christian nationalism, and economic policies that favor the wealthy over systems designed, however imperfectly, to give more people a better chance at a good and decent life. That is what passes as Republican populism.  
I know that not every conservative can recognize themself in what I’ve just described, that there are many who envision more light than darkness at their desired end. But what they should know, too, is that they own the means all the same.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/statehousecloudydome-1024x652.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

The Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, has about two weeks’ worth of funding to keep feeding low-income Washingtonians, according to the state Department of Health. But if participation rises beyond current levels, that could be more like one week. 
Nicole Flateboe, executive director of Nutrition First, the state’s WIC association, pegged the available contingency funding on Tuesday as lasting one week. 
She called money running out a “disaster.” 
“We will have babies being born to low-income women who will not have any breastfeeding support, and they will have no way to get infant formula if they’re not breastfeeding,” Flateboe said.
The program’s plight is one of the clearest examples of how a shutdown could affect everyday Washingtonians who aren’t federal employees at risk of furlough. Unlike entitlement programs like food stamps, WIC is subject to the annual federal appropriations in Congress, making it susceptible to a shutdown.
The White House has also signalled there would be no money to accept new WIC applicants starting immediately, meaning no new babies getting fed under the program.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Tuesday that WIC would continue during the shutdown “subject to the availability of funding.”
The federal government shutdown began at midnight Tuesday, as Republicans and Democrats in Congress couldn’t find agreement on short-term funding to keep the government open. Most Democrats refuse to support a stopgap funding bill that doesn’t extend subsidies that help people afford health insurance, and Republicans haven’t budged on this issue.
This is the first federal government shutdown in almost seven years.
In Washington, over 200 clinics serve over 212,000 women and their children under 5 years old annually under the WIC program, according to the state. WIC helps nearly one-third of all newborn babies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds the program, while the state Department of Health administers it. 
Nationally, the program serves nearly 7 million Americans.
WIC helps mothers with access to healthy food, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and health screenings. Research has shown participation in the program helps limit low birth weights and reduce maternal mortality.
“The services that WIC provides reduce infant deaths, improve the growth of infants and children, increase immunization rates, increase access to community supports, and help ensure early prenatal care for pregnant participants,” Brittany Tybo, director of the Department of Health’s Office of Nutrition Services, said in a press release. “All of these benefits are at risk for WIC families, and the risk increases the longer the shutdown continues.”
The agency advises families on WIC to keep using their benefits as usual. 
A shutdown at the start of the federal fiscal year like this one is particularly challenging, as states have little funding left over and haven’t received funding for the new fiscal year. The week’s worth of contingency is made up of WIC money not yet used.
The state Department of Health said a shutdown would result in temporary layoffs or work hour reductions starting Oct. 6 for about 50 employees whose jobs are tied to federal dollars. Most are in the division that manages WIC.
Flateboe thinks this will result in confusion for enrollees, as they seek help from staff unfamiliar with the program. And the Trump administration’s staffing cuts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service have already hampered its ability to help, she said.
“It’s a big mess,” Flateboe said. “We don’t have a lot of trust that the USDA is going to handle this real seamlessly.”
In Colorado, state lawmakers on Tuesday approved millions in funding to backfill WIC assistance due to the shutdown.

Every day seems like a new crisis: vaccines, Tylenol, turning off environmental monitoring, curtailing food stamps and then not reporting on hunger. All of this is shocking, but not unexpected. It’s the natural outcome of all of us retreating into our echo chambers and only listening to information from people we like and agree with. 
This is true on both the right and the left. Everyone everywhere feels the system is stacked against them; the government isn’t listening to them. We are in a place where information has overloaded our circuits, and we are just going with what is safe and comfortable.
Science is truth. And truth makes people uncomfortable. So instead of embracing the truth, we are figuratively and literally shooting the messengers. 
Yet, science makes America – and Georgia – great. 
Science and technology support over 60% of the jobs in Georgia. And over half of those jobs don’t require a college degree. These are the jobs that fuel Georgia’s economy and make us a great place to do business. Georgia has over 50 public universities and technical schools, an enviable start-up community, and a booming agricultural sector. 
Ironically, science is also the reason we can all use our phones to spread misinformation and convince people to shoot at federal workers. 
So how did we get here?
For too long, scientists have been hiding in their ivory towers, tossing truth bombs over the walls, and not bothering to explain themselves. They have been taking data and doing research but not ensuring the fruits of their labors benefit all. The academic system does not reward community interaction, and at times, it belittles it. 
And when people started questioning science results – scientists fought back with data! And pie charts! And the most obtuse language possible! Because, we naively believe the facts speak for themselves. 
So when people decided to look for someone to blame, there was a vacuum of information, and a lack of trust – and bam – here we are. On the precipice of our own Cultural Revolution – which by the way – China is just now recovering from 50 years later. 
Don’t take this as me placing all the blame on scientists – throughout history those speaking “for the people” attempt to silence those with inconvenient facts as “elitists.”
The bad news is that our amazing system has already been burned to the ground. How do we avoid sinking into 50 years of poverty, disease, and starvation? 
All of us must take a cue from those around us who are marching on the streets, who are giving aid to kids whose parents have been deported, who are cobbling together resilient communities. Those who, despite their fear, are standing up for what is right.
We speak up and proclaim: “We need science. We need scientists.”
The key to a vibrant democracy, and functioning scientific community, is meaningful, open, dialogue. It’s time for us – all of us – to put down our ire. Let’s get uncomfortable. Let’s talk to our neighbors. 
Scientists can do more to reward those who do community outreach and learn to communicate in a trustworthy way. 
Georgia policymakers could create a science and technology policy office to facilitate smooth integration of science and breakthroughs from universities to businesses, to public policy, to government offices, to the Georgians who need it. 
Businesses could program loudly and proudly how they need trained workers (who don’t have the measles) and a thriving science and technology ecosystem in order for Georgia to be open for business. 
Atlanta rose out of the ashes once before. And now we are the place to be in the Southeast. It’s time for all of Georgia to be the shining example of what the next-generation science and technology ecosystem can be. How things learned at the University of Georgia can help our farmers and our biotech companies. How a public health initiative from Georgia State University can increase the health of all Georgians (because, let’s face it, if people aren’t healthy, they can’t work, and if they can’t work, they cannot afford to get healthy). How a teacher trained at Valdosta State University can inspire kids to be the next innovators. 
Let’s focus our efforts on making all of Georgia the place to be in the Southeast. Let’s stop shooting at our scientists and instead let’s embrace that science makes America great.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2228550624-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 17:00:24.701051

The impasse currently centers on the U.S. Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance the legislation. Washington’s two senators, both Democrats, voted against a Republican-backed seven-week funding patch that fell short Tuesday on a 55-45 vote. They supported a Democratic counterproposal that failed 47-53.
A major sticking point for Democrats is that they want to see the extension of expiring tax credits for people who purchase health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Republicans want to negotiate on that issue separately.
Below is a roundup of statements that members of Washington’s congressional delegation have issued so far.
The Senators
Sen. Patty Murray
We have been calling for Republicans to work with us to keep the government funded, to address the health care crisis they created, and to stop people’s premiums from skyrocketing. Republicans haven’t just stuck their heads in the sand, they’ve outright refused to get serious about a solution.
Full remarks
Sen. Maria Cantwell
I heard Speaker Johnson on the television this morning saying that extending the ACA credits is a December issue. Well, it’s not really a December issue if people start in October and November making decisions and locking themselves into higher health insurance rates.
Floor remarks on Tuesday, via X
House Republicans
Rep. Dan Newhouse
The blame for the impending shutdown lies squarely on the shoulders of Senate Democrats. Their refusal to keep the government open will have devastating impacts on our farmers, veterans, and small business owners. Enough of the partisan games.
Statement via X, on Tuesday
Rep. Michael Baumgartner 
The Democrats should step back from their short-sighted plan to use a government shutdown to placate their base and attempt to expand Obamacare. It won’t work. Important Federal employees and tax-paying citizens will suffer as a result.
Statement via X, on Tuesday
House Democrats
Rep. Suzan DelBene 
Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House, and have led the country into a government shutdown. Families have been struggling to make ends meet as a direct result of Trump and Republican policies that have raised prices on everyday goods and slashed health care for millions. 
There is a clear path forward out of this crisis – stop the health care cuts and extend the Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies. 
Full statement
Rep. Pramila Jayapal
Democrats have been in Washington, D.C., ready to negotiate a bill that cancels the horrific Republican cuts, lowers costs, and saves health care. Meanwhile, Speaker Johnson sent his Members home to do fancy fundraisers with billionaires and refused to negotiate.
Once again, Republicans are choosing chaos over governing.
Full statement
Rep. Adam Smith
Instead of working across the aisle to keep the government open and protect the services Americans rely on, Donald Trump and House Republicans forced a reckless government shutdown.
My Democratic colleagues and I remain ready to work today to reopen the government with a bipartisan agreement that protects health care and delivers real solutions for the American people.
Full statement
Rep. Marilyn Strickland
Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. They fully own 100% of the shutdown.
Statement via X, on Wednesday
Rep. Kim Schrier
I know that a prolonged shutdown hurts all of us, especially working families, seniors, and our brave service members here in the Eighth District. I also cannot vote for a funding bill that is harmful to the people I represent.

Phil Murphy and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul with then-U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at a Jan. 31, 2023, event in New York commemorating new funding for the Gateway rail project. The Trump administration this week ordered a delay to the tunnel plan, citing the federal government shutdown. (Edwin J. Torres/NJ Governor’s Office)The Trump administration froze billions in funding for New York infrastructure projects this week, including money paying for new trans-Hudson River tunnels carrying New Jersey’s rail traffic into New York City.
Russel Vought, director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, said on social media that the projects are being delayed “to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”
The cuts would affect the $16 billion Hudson Tunnel project, known as Gateway, and New York City’s expansion of the 2nd Avenue subway, Vought said.
The tunnel project is critical to mass transit between New York and New Jersey. NJ Transit’s northeast corridor line — the busiest commuter rail line in the nation — runs through aging tunnels that the project would replace.
Those tunnels were severely damaged during Hurricane Sandy, and failures there could snarl commutes within a region that accounts for 10% of the nation’s economic output.
Here’s how our next governor says they’ll make NJ more affordable

The U.S. Department of Transportation in a statement said it had chosen to pause funding for the projects because of their size, calling them “arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the Western Hemisphere” but nodded to political motivations by attacking Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats.
“Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jefferies (sic) shutdown, however, USDOT’s review of New York’s unconstitutional practices will take more time. Without a budget, the Department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,” the department said in an unattributed statement.
The attack is a reference to the ongoing federal government shutdown, which began Wednesday after Republicans who hold majorities in both chambers of Congress failed to reach an agreement with Democrats on government funding amid an impasse over Affordable Care Act subsidies that help low-income Americans pay for health insurance.
Those subsidies would expire at the start of 2026 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the GOP bill that extended tax cuts enacted in Trump’s first term.
The department said the shutdown would extend its review of the projects but did not provide a timeline, adding the funding was frozen under a yet-to-be-enacted rule that bars race and sex-based contracting requirements in federal grants.
The development led to some sniping in New Jersey’s governor’s race, with Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill criticizing Trump for “targeting New Jersey by gutting this funding” and claiming GOP opponent Jack Ciattarelli will not fight to make sure the tunnel project is completed. Ciattarelli campaign spokesman Eric Arpert said Sherrill “owns this shutdown and is responsible for any negative impacts on Gateway tunnel project and other NJ priorities.”
Thomas Prendergast, CEO of the Gateway Development Commission, a bistate body tasked with overseeing construction of the tunnels and other Gateway projects, in a statement said the commission “complies with all federal laws and regulations” and would continue to do so.
“We remain focused on keeping the project on scope, schedule, and budget,” Prendergast said.
Top officials at NJ Transit and the New Jersey Department of Transportation said they were not warned of the funding freeze ahead of time, but appeared unworried about its impact on the new trans-Hudson tunnels.
“As you know, the project is scheduled for completion in 2035. That’s a long time away, and this is a temporary issue. I’m sure it’ll work out,” said NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri, a former Gateway Commission CEO. “I think everybody on our side of the river wants to ensure there’s compliance, and I’m sure they will.”
New Jersey Transportation Commissioner Fran O’Connor noted the freeze did not impact other projects in Gateway’s portfolio, including the Portal North Bridge, which would replace a 115-year-old bridge that takes trains across the Hackensack River and risks snarling train traffic outside of New York City.
But he added it is unclear when federal funding for new tunnels crossing the Hudson River might resume.
“We’re going to have to wait and see,” O’Connor said following an unrelated event in Vineland. “I don’t have a crystal ball on that.”
The immediate impact of the freeze is unclear, though the U.S. Department of Transportation said it would block a pending $300 million reimbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who said he was proud to work with Trump’s first administration on the Portal North Bridge, appeared hopeful the pause would be short-lived.
“With millions of commuters depending on the Hudson Tunnel Project and tens of thousands of jobs on the line, I’m confident that we’ll be able to work with the Trump Administration to keep Gateway moving forward,” Murphy said in a statement. “A project of this importance should be above politics.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)After Congress missed its deadline to fund the federal government by the start of October, local impacts on Michiganders are already starting to be felt, according to three University of Michigan faculty members. 
Many questions about those impacts, however, are hard to answer without knowing how long the shutdown will last — most shutdowns in the past have lasted less than a week. 
But as Stephanie Leiser, a lecturer at the Ford School of Public Policy, said, this shutdown may be different. 
“In these sorts of budget crises, it’s often historically been some sort of recession or major economic shock that’s precipitating the crisis,” she said. “But in this case, it’s really just politics. And so it’s who’s going to blink and who’s going to dig in.”
Some of the impacts of this shutdown will be felt in the immediate future — for average Michiganders, that might look like an inability to make an appointment with a government office or get help with services. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dr. Christopher Friese, a professor in the School of Nursing, said that in Michigan, this would be one of the more notable impacts. “We’re one of the older states in the nation,” he said. “And Medicare beneficiaries won’t be able to get questions answered from Medicare.”
Friese added that in cases of food recalls — including a current recall of packaged meals tied to a listeria outbreak — support to county health authorities from the CDC would be impaired. 
Not all federal support will disappear right away. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, has already sent out its checks for October, meaning that those who rely on this assistance will have money through the month. But if the shutdown becomes lengthy, Dr. Jennifer Garner, a professor of nutritional sciences, said, “if those October pavements for November are delayed, then really the impacts on SNAP would be seen in November, and that’s where there would be a very large impact on the population of Michiganders who use that program.”
It is not just food assistance programs at risk with a shutdown, Garner warned, but food systems more broadly — including Michigan’s agricultural economy. Because the current federal farm bill is seven years old, farm bill-authorized programs and expenses are dependent on a federal budget. 
“Agricultural activities will feel the effects of the shutdown,” Garner added. 
And in many ways, Friese noted, the longer the shutdown, the more intense the effects will be. Grant approvals, for example, are largely halted during a government shutdown. 

“What we’ve experienced in the past in Michigan, when we’ve had shutdowns or we’ve had employees who can’t process grants before, is a huge backlog,” he said.
President Donald Trump has also said that he intends to permanently lay off federal government employees who are deemed non-essential under the shutdown, as opposed to temporary furloughs. 
Friese warned that this could exacerbate existing issues caused by federal workforce layoffs earlier this year — for example, he said, the National Cancer Institute had lost 10% of its staff prior to the shutdown, which had essentially stopped communications of messages about cancer prevention and cancer screening.
“If you were to shut down and the administration moves for more layoffs within HHS or other agencies, what you’ll see is just a continued erosion of public health work,” he added.
The federal government shutdown came as state legislators in Lansing were able to pass a continuation budget to fund the state for the next eight days — but if both the state and federal governments were to be shut down at the same time, Michigan would find itself in an unprecedented situation of how to fund essential services, Leiser said. 
“Does the state actually have cash reserves that it could survive on?” she said. “I think the money is there, but I don’t know if legally that scenario has ever really been played out.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/capitolnight-1-1024x769.jpeg,,,2025-10-01 15:57:52.669947

Test prep, mentorship opportunities and professional development will also be available.
As long as resident teachers commit to teaching in a “critical shortage area,” Elementary Education and Special Education students can also expect mentoring sessions, professional development opportunities and licensure testing support.
During the 2025 session the Legislature made $2,968,855 available to the Mississippi Department of Education to bolster its residency program. The Mississippi Teacher Residency, a program meant to help staff school districts struggling with teacher retention and recruitment, drew its initial funds in 2019 from the W. Kellogg Foundation and then also from American Rescue Plan Act dollars. 
Capacity for the program can now increase from serving 35 to 236 resident teachers each year.
Eligibility is now open to prospective teachers, teachers seeking additional endorsements or licensure help, and currently enrolled education students. The former version of the program only offered tuition waivers and stipends to bachelor’s degree holders looking to get a masters’ in education. Applicants also now apply through their universities as opposed to through MDE.
The Mississippi Delta region and southwest Mississippi have the most teacher vacancies, according to a survey conducted by the Mississippi Department of Education. On July 7, Clarksdale Municipal School District and Vicksburg-Warren School District posted the most full-time certified teaching vacancies to their sites with 40 and 59 jobs posted respectively.
A majority of Mississippi school districts are categorized as “critical shortage areas,” with 56% claiming the title. Nearly every school district in the Delta region is considered a ‘critical shortage area.’ These districts also received failing or near failing scores in the accountability ratings.
In a recent Mississippi Today story, Delta area teachers-in-training expressed frustration with the lack of preparation they received for licensure, particularly with the PRAXIS licensure exams.
“It left me feeling overwhelmed as I tried to catch up, and it significantly impacted my confidence, academic performance and health,” Timolin Howard told Mississippi Today.
The nine Mississippi universities and the breakdown of funds is as follows:

Delta State University – $280,000
Jackson State University – $272,417
Mississippi College – $119,684
Mississippi State University – $1,298,981
Mississippi University for Women – $140,000

Reena Szczepanski and Sen. Peter Wirth meet before the beginning of the Oct. 1, 2025 special session in the Roundhouse. In September, both members were targeted by bomb threats. Police later determined there were no explosives, but investigations are ongoing. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Republican and Democratic members in both chambers of New Mexico Legislature began the 2025 special legislative session Wednesday with bipartisan condemnation of political violence, which they described as a growing and worrying trend.
They had many recent examples to point to: the recent killing of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk in Utah; arson at the New Mexico Republican headquarters; the shooting death of a Minnesota House Leader, Democrat Melissa Hortman; bomb threats at the homes of Sen. Peter Wirth and Rep. Reena Szczepanski in Santa Fe; and the sentencing in August of Solomon Peña, convicted of orchestrating shootings at the homes of prominent elected Democrats. 
“Why would someone fire bullets at home to the members of this chamber? Why would someone fire bomb the Republican headquarters?” said Wirth, the Senate majority leader. “It just makes no sense.”
After Kirk’s killing, NM and Utah governors discuss disagreeing without violence

Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington), the Senate minority leader, spoke after Wirth, saying political violence must cease “unequivocally, undeniably and immediately.”
“Disagreements are no longer just debates. They’ve become battlegrounds. When someone holds a different view, they aren’t just opposed, they’re vilified and dehumanized, or worse, silenced through fear or violence,” he said. “This is not who we are.”
In the House, Szczepanski, Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena) and Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) all took a few minutes to decry political violence. Martinez said he recently held his wife as she tearfully testified about the trauma she and her children still face from Peña shooting up their home. He was sentenced to 80 years in prison last month.
In the Senate, lawmakers bowed their heads for a moment of silence for Kirk and Melissa Hortman, the Minnesota Democrat killed along with her husband in July. 
The House held a similar moment of silence, where Martinez called on his peers to “show how a civil functional government can work, to deliver for its people.” 
Then he added:

Boone argued the school district, its superintendent and assistant superintendent, library media director and the principal and assistant principals of Lowell High School and Lowell Middle School had violated her civil rights by implementing policies to prevent her from contacting Lowell Area Schools staff, and from posting references to Lowell Area Schools employees on social media.
Boone is also embroiled in a separate civil suit filed by Lowell Area Schools Library Media Director Christine Beachler who argued Boone had waged a yearslong “smear campaign” against her, falsely accusing Beachler of providing pornography to children. 
Boone has countersued, accusing Beachler of defamation, arguing Beachler “used offensive and inappropriate language regarding Boone in her interviews, documentaries, and podcasts.”
Boone’s children attend Lowell area schools. She has opposed library books with LGBTQ+ themes and according to court documents, has criticized the school district arguing it is promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, social and emotional learning, “alternate sex and gender ideologies, and other liberal political ideology” making several posts to social media criticizing the district and specific officials and employees. 
After criticizing a Lowell High School teacher on social media, Boone was sent a letter from Principal Steve Gough requesting she “cease and desist from any reference to any Lowell Area Schools employee on social media and/or other public communication platforms,” and asking that she have no contact with staff without permission from the building principal or superintendent. 
Boone argued these policies violated her First Amendment right to free speech, and that the policies are unconstitutionally vague. 
However Judge Paul Maloney of the U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan Southern Division, granted the defense’s motion to dismiss Boone’s case, concluding that her complaint failed to state a claim for which relief can be provided.

“Boone fails to allege that the School violated her First Amendment rights by requiring her to contact a principal or superintendent before directly contacting School employees. Members of the public ‘have no constitutional right to force the government to listen to their views,” Maloney wrote in his opinion. “It follows, then, ‘that it is not a constitutional violation to require that parents, if they wish to be heard, communicate only with particular staff members or do so only at a specified time and place.’”
Boone case dismissed
These policies only regulate whom Boone can communicate with, not the content of her messages, Maloney wrote, emphasizing that Boone was not prohibited from communicating concerns about her children’s education or treatment. 
“Such a restriction is not a First Amendment violation and a far cry from a ‘ban’ or ‘restraint’ on her speech,” Maloney wrote, later noting that Boone also failed to show that she had been prevented from continuing to post on social media. 
Maloney also dismissed Boone’s claim of a Title IX violation for lack of standing and claims tied to state-law for a lack of jurisdiction. Boone retains the right to appeal the decision.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 15:57:52.669947

(The URI Good 5 Cent Cigar File Photo)After a four-year review process, the University of Rhode Island’s (URI) 27-member police department is now accredited by the state’s premier law enforcement standards organization for the first time in its history, the university announced Tuesday.
Accreditation awarded Sept. 24 by the Rhode Island Police Accreditation Commission (RIPAC) allows URI to join 45 other law enforcement organizations across the state that have met such standards — including Rhode Island’s other public colleges.
The Community College of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College were both accredited by RIPAC in 2021. That same year, URI started its road to accreditation after Michael Jagoda, the university’s assistant vice president of public safety, became the department’s chief of police.
“Accreditation is the gold standard for making sure we’re providing superior services to our community,” Jagoda said in a statement. “We’re making sure our policies and procedures are constitutional, they’re fair and nondiscriminatory, that our training is superior, that our officers are confident in their skillset and they’re going out there in partnership with the community.”
URI needed to meet over 200 standards including training, relationships with other agencies, community relations, and internal oversight, Deputy Police Chief Paul Ricci, the department’s accreditation manager, said in an emailed statement to Rhode Island Current.
Part of the procedure required all university officers to wear body cameras, which URI Police purchased in 2022 with a five-year, $288,750 U.S. Department of Justice grant. The funding came through a $16.1 million statewide program to equip Rhode Island law enforcement with body-worn cameras.
Ricci said that by gaining official accreditation, it shows that URI’s police department is “committed to maintaining the highest standards of professional law enforcement.”
URI also intends to seek accreditation through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.
Ricci said all URI police officers already meet the Rhode Island Police Officers Commission on Standards and Training’s rules and  regulations. Officers attend the Rhode Island Municipal Police Training Academy and, as fully sworn law enforcement, have the same powers and authority as municipal police statewide
URI’s accreditation from RIPCA is valid through September 2028.

The reality, however, is that this tax expenditure is an expensive, inefficient and inequitable subsidy that does little to help those who need it most. 
For the nearly $100 million it costs Minnesota taxpayers each year, we could be making transformative investments that create real pathways to homeownership. It is time to eliminate the state’s MID and reinvest those funds directly into down payment assistance and the production of affordable homes.
The problem with the MID is its deeply regressive design. The deduction overwhelmingly benefits high-income households with larger mortgages. According to estimates from the Tax Policy Center, the current structure is so skewed that 8% of taxpayers — with annual incomes of $200,000 or more — receive about 63% of the total benefit. 
Meanwhile, the policy fails to address the primary barrier for most aspiring homeowners: the down payment and closing costs. 
So, the MID offers a subsidy to those who would likely own a home anyway, while doing nothing for the working-class Minnesotans or renters struggling to save.
The MID is a also inefficient and distorting force in the housing market. Economists argue that it encourages the construction of bigger, more expensive homes than people might otherwise choose, contributing to higher energy costs and urban sprawl. Worse, by making mortgage interest deductible, it incentivizes households to take on larger mortgages and more debt, increasing the risk of defaults during economic downturns.
Most damningly, the MID appears to fail at its intended purpose of increasing homeownership.  Research published in the American Economic Review found that the tax benefits of the MID are “capitalized” into house prices, pushing them higher than they otherwise would be. This inflation makes homes less attainable for many. In fact, the study concluded that the version of the MID before 2019 reduced the national homeownership rate by about 5%.
Imagine, then, what could happen if this tax deduction were eliminated or phased out. The same research estimates that doing so would cause the homeownership rate to increase by 5 percentage points, while average home prices would dip by approximately 4% and the average mortgage balance would decline by more than 30%. 
Instead of subsidizing debt, we could directly attack the real barriers to homeownership. Reinvesting the funds from the MID into a more robust down payment assistance program would create greater pathways to help thousands of working class Minnesotans and build generational wealth.
Simultaneously, this proposal establishes a dedicated and recurring funding stream for homeownership production. By converting the annual cost of the MID — projected to cost $107 million in 2025 — into a consistent investment, Minnesota can finance the construction and rehabilitation of homes year after year. This addresses the supply side of the equation with the long-term commitment necessary to create a stable and accessible housing market.
Minnesota should eliminate this outdated tax break and redirect the savings into proven solutions. This can be accomplished through an immediate repeal or a five-year phased elimination, where the deduction is reduced by 20% each year and the corresponding funds are transferred directly into dedicated accounts for down payment assistance and homeownership production. 
Continuing the MID is a choice to maintain a policy that is ineffective, inequitable and actively harms its stated goal of increasing homeownership and making it more affordable. By eliminating the MID, we are freeing up resources and creating a dedicated, ongoing source of investment to build a future where the dream of homeownership is an achievable reality for everyone in our state.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/new-home-construction-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-02 09:57:47.091001
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 18:51:18+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT will keep programs hurt by federal shutdown afloat, for now",Keith M. Phaneuf and Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/ct-federal-shutdown-programs-afloat/,Gov. Ned Lamont said it’s premature to commit any of last year’s $2.5 billion surplus to plug holes in federal funding over the long term.,"Connecticut will continue nutrition, winter heating relief, Medicaid and other community assistance programs over the next month or longer, despite Wednesday’s federal government shutdown that interrupts funds for these programs, Gov. Ned Lamont announced.
But the Democratic governor said it’s still premature to commit any of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus to plug holes in federal funding over the long term.
“A lot of families out there are probably pretty worried about their health care and whether they’d be able to take care of their kid if there was a real emergency, worried about food and how they’re going to put a meal on the table,” Lamont said during a late-morning press conference Wednesday in his Capitol office.
“These guys in Washington [have] got to get their act together,” he added.
The White House announced a partial shutdown just after midnight Wednesday as Congress remained gridlocked over a new federal budget.
That translates into immediate challenges for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — commonly known as WIC — and a clock ticking down to more complications for several other federal assistance programs, Lamont said.
But WIC, which serves 52,000 infants, older children and women here, will immediately need an infusion of state cash to keep operating, about $6 million per month, Lamont said, adding that Connecticut will plug the gap for now.
“I want those young families, those moms, to know that your WIC card will continue to be good, you know, for the foreseeable future,” the governor said. “We’re making sure that the [federal] government does not take that away from you.”
But Connecticut will not tap the $2.5 billion from last fiscal year, which closed June 30, to deal with that problem. Instead, it will support WIC from the current $27.2 billion state budget, which is running more than $300 million in the black. Administration officials said Connecticut would seek federal reimbursement after the shutdown for all state funds added to the WIC program.
Clock is ticking on SNAP and winter heating assistance
The shutdown, if it persists, also would create problems for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, and on the winter heating assistance program that Connecticut runs chiefly through federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance grants.
SNAP provides about $72 million in nutrition assistance to more than 391,000 Connecticut residents monthly. But despite the shutdown closing off any new federal funding temporarily, the program has enough reserves to continue operating through October, said Lamont’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham.
Similarly, the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program has more than $7 million in heating assistance funds left unspent from last winter. That’s enough to keep that program afloat as well until November, Beckham said.
The Lamont administration projects more than 100,375 households will need heating assistance this winter, up more than 12% from one year ago. The program serves households earning 60% or less of the statewide median income, which is $91,854 for a family of four.
Lamont’s social services commissioner, Andrea Barton Reeves, said a shutdown also will stall funds tied to Medicaid, a massive program that pumped almost $7 billion in federal funding last year into nursing homes, at-home care services, hospitals, federally qualified health clinics and health insurance for low-income households in Connecticut.
But reserves within the Connecticut’s Medicaid program should keep it functioning well into February or March of 2026, Reeves estimated. She added that federal block grants that Connecticut uses to support community action agencies — regional nonprofits that link vulnerable households with housing, energy, employment, child care and other human services — also face a funding crunch in early 2026.
Lamont: It’s too early to crack open CT’s piggy bank
The General Assembly last spring anticipated federal fiscal chaos when the GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump collaborated on a massive array of cutbacks in federal assistance to states to help finance the extension of major federal tax cuts.
One of those cutbacks, involving subsidies to low-income households that buy health insurance on state exchanges — like Access Health CT here — has sparked outrage from congressional Democrats and has been one of the driving factors leading to the current budget gridlock and federal government shutdown.
The General Assembly created a special account to receive a portion of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus — the second-largest in state history — that could be used to supplant vanishing federal funds and blunt some of the pain of program cutbacks.
State legislative leaders have said they would like to see about $500 million of that surplus used for that purpose. Another $300 million would support a new program to expand affordable child care in Connecticut. And the remaining $1.7 billion would bolster the state’s rainy day fund and reduce pension debt.
But state Treasurer Erick Russell needs to inform pension analysts, who must perform periodic valuations of the program, by early November how much surplus will be deposited into retirement benefit programs.
And once surplus dollars go into Connecticut’s pension funds for state workers and municipal teachers, they cannot easily be withdrawn for other purposes.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has been reluctant to commit those funds to any response to federal cutbacks, preferring as much as possible to reduce the state’s considerable pension debt, which exceeded $35 billion last fiscal year.
And the governor, who will meet Friday with Democratic state legislative leaders, said it’s still too early to commit tapping last year’s huge surplus, though he didn’t rule it out.
“We’re going to know so much more in the next couple of weeks,” he said.
But labor leaders, faith groups and some of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the General Assembly said Wednesday that it’s time for Connecticut to tap its piggy bank to help those left behind by Washington.
Leslie Blatteau, president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers and steering committee chair of CT for All, said during a late morning press conference in the Legislative Office Building that state revenue programs have surged dramatically just since last June.
“We all know that those funds that have been found belong to the working people of this state, and there is no question from anybody here today what Gov. Lamont and our legislators should do with those funds,” she said.
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, chair of the General Assembly’s Human Services Committee, said that the changes to health insurance approved by the federal government would mean that a family of four with an annual income of $128,000 could see their monthly premiums increase from $925 a month to over $4,000 a month.
“Almost 60% of your income would be going for health insurance, and there is not one family in the state that can afford that,” said Lesser.
Lesser noted that the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation bill signed on July 4, would reduce Connecticut’s Medicaid funding by $13 billion over the next 10 years. He said the change would disproportionately affect low-income people and people in nursing homes. In Connecticut, 1 in 3 children are on HUSKY, the state’s Medicaid program.
Lesser also said changes to the SNAP program will make about 42,000 Connecticut residents ineligible for the program — 39,000 are citizens or permanent residents and 3,000 are legal immigrants.
“It is particularly concerning for low-income communities around the state because, when you lose SNAP benefits in your neighborhood, the people who are losing out aren’t just the recipients themselves and their family,” Lesser added. “It’s also every neighborhood grocery store, and we already have food deserts in the state, in communities across the state, and we’re going to see a lot more hunger.”
But minority Republicans in the General Assembly have opposed any effort to slow Connecticut’s efforts to shrink pension debt.
And House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, urged Lamont Wednesday to keep Connecticut’s focus on curbing debt that otherwise will burden future generations of taxpayers.
“The question is whether the governor will stand up to his own party and prevent this raid on funds that symbolize fiscal responsibility,” Candelora said. “Democrats claim this money belongs to the people, yet they want to funnel it into growing government instead of returning it to taxpayers.”
State House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who will meet Friday with Lamont and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, to discuss response efforts, said Democrats still want to put more than $1 billion from last year’s surplus into the pension funds.
But “it’s irresponsible for state government to not be prepared [when] the drastic and unnecessary federal cuts come to fruition,” Ritter added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1001_SR_LamontGovShutdown_124-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 14:58:50.639040

Mike Braun talks at an Indiana State Police outpost in Indianapolis on Oct. 1, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hours after Congress failed to advance a stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown, Gov. Mike Braun minimized the potential impact on Hoosiers, saying Indiana “isn’t as dependent on federal government largess.”
“We will get through it,” said Braun at a public safety event Wednesday. “If Indiana does lose some benefits in the short run, if it’s essential, we would look at maybe doing something to keep (them) in place.”
Indiana is the third-most reliant state when it comes to federal dollars. 
The former, one-term U.S. senator harped on congressional budgeting — specifically, the nation’s level of debt.
“We’re spending 30% more than we’re taking in at the federal level,” said Braun, noting that the nation’s interest payments exceed annual spending on Medicare or defense. “… that explodes geometrically each year going forward. So they are going to have to figure out how they’re going to start living within their means so that we’re not putting that burden on future generations.” 
Budget panel approves $15.79M for immigration detention upgrades at Miami Correctional Facility

A short-lived shutdown will likely have a minimal impact on the day-to-day lives of Hoosiers, with the exception of Indiana’s 24,000 federal employees. Some of those will stop being paid or could even be laid off following threats from President Donald Trump. The last partial government shutdown in 2018 lasted 35 days.
However, as detailed by the IndyStar, lengthy shutdowns can hurt Hoosiers accessing government services, including food benefits, national parks or passport applications.
On Wednesday afternoon, White House officials indicated a nutrition program for women, infants and children could “lapse.”
Indiana Congressman Jefferson Shreve, R-6th, said he will donate the equivalent of his shutdown pay to the Johnson County Boys and Girls Club.
“Hoosiers deserve a government that works for them — not political games,” he said.
One federal agency that won’t be impacted is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. That includes the millions slated to come to Indiana following a recent agreement to use empty prison bed space to house federal immigrant detainees at a profit.
“From the beginning, I said Indiana is going to be a state that’s going to cooperate with ICE. We’re not going to be a sanctuary state; we don’t have sanctuary cities,” said Braun. “We still, though, suffer from the consequences of four years of open borders.” 
He again emphasized his personal policy of “worst first,” meaning that immigration officials should prioritize removing criminal offenders. Early figures indicate that many of those arrested by ICE have no criminal background. 
WTHR reported that the Miami Correctional Facility is set to start receiving detainees, with less than 100 scheduled to arrive this week as clergy continue to protest. The state agreed to appropriate nearly $16 million for facility upgrades last month.
 Other news

Though Republicans are still drumming up support for mid-decade redistricting in a special session, Braun said that such a session wouldn’t include a legislative follow-up to Senate Enrolled Act 1. The priority bill limited how much local government units could collect in property taxes, shifting some of the taxing burden to local income taxes.
But those local income taxes need to be approved annually, threatening the credit ratings of some municipalities. Braun said he didn’t think it would be dealt with because “generally, taxpayers are happy with the results of it.”
In contrast, legislative leaders said last month that changes to the law would be a top priority, such as delaying certain deadlines to better assess the bill’s impact. Many governments, public schools and libraries have cut services in response to the funding cuts. 
Despite nearly two months of constant pressure from the White House, including private meetings with Vice President JD Vance and Trump himself, no special session on redistricting has been scheduled. Previously, Braun floated the possibility of an early November special session.
When asked, Braun said redistricting was a daily topic among lawmakers and “evolving.” 
“We’ve got time, and if we get there to where they want to do it, we’ll probably have a special session,” he said. “At this stage they’re still moving, I think, in that direction.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 18:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Bridgeport farmers markets: How to save, where they’re located",Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/bridgeport-farmers-markets/,"The Bridgeport Farmers Market Collaborative offers ways for residents to save money at the markets, including programs like SNAP matching.","For many Bridgeport residents, accessing fresh, locally grown produce is not always simple. Neighborhoods across the city face nutrition insecurity, limited access to grocery stores and rising food costs. The Bridgeport Farmers Market Collaborative was formed in 2014 to address these challenges, and over the past decade, it has grown into more than just a place to shop for fruits and vegetables. It has become a hub where residents can save money, learn how to cook with fresh ingredients and connect with neighbors.
The collaborative began with a simple mission: to make Connecticut-grown produce accessible and affordable while supporting local farmers and strengthening community ties. Today, it operates multiple farmers markets across Bridgeport, offering three primary programs that help residents stretch their grocery budgets. These programs are: Bridgeport Bucks, SNAP matching and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program. They work in tandem to ensure that families of all income levels can access healthy food.
Here’s more information on the markets and the programs the collaborative offers.
Bridgeport Bucks
Bridgeport Bucks is the flagship program of the collaborative. The initiative provides $5 vouchers that any shopper can use to purchase farm-produced items such as fresh produce, honey and jams. Unlike many assistance programs, Bridgeport Bucks are available to anyone, including people who do not qualify for SNAP benefits.
“People are like, ‘For real? You don’t need anything else?'” said Takina Pollock Shafer, director of the Bridgeport Farmers Market Collaborative.
The vouchers are so popular that they often run out within 15 to 20 minutes of a market opening. The program is made possible through sponsorships from local businesses, organizations and individuals who want to help lower the cost of fresh food in the community. By providing immediate financial relief, Bridgeport Bucks allow families to buy more fruits and vegetables than they might otherwise afford, helping residents make healthier choices while supporting local farmers.

Doubling SNAP Benefits
For families who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the collaborative offers a dollar-for-dollar matching program through a partnership with End Hunger CT. The program, known as CT Fresh Match, allows SNAP customers to double the value of their benefits when shopping at any participating farmers market in the network. For example, a $10 SNAP purchase earns $10 in matching tokens that can be spent on additional farm-produced items.
“We want to give people a dignified experience. You don’t want to make it feel like something complicated,” Shafer said.
The SNAP matching program not only increases purchasing power for families but also encourages people to try new fruits and vegetables. Customers can use their tokens across multiple markets in the network, providing flexibility and choice. This system allows shoppers to access produce at different market locations and times, accommodating work schedules and transportation limitations.
Farmers Market Nutrition Program
The collaborative also participates in the Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which provides additional support for seniors and WIC recipients. Seniors are eligible to receive $40 vouchers, while WIC participants receive varying amounts depending on household size and eligibility. To extend support further, bonus vouchers are also available, allowing recipients to stretch their benefits even further.
Shafer said the program has a noticeable impact on seniors. “The seniors, they don’t mess around. They’re spending those bucks because we get everything back,” she said. 
Cooking Demonstrations
Beyond financial assistance, the collaborative emphasizes education and engagement through cooking demonstrations led by Chef Raquel Rivera of A Pinch of Salt. In these demonstrations, residents are taught how to prepare seasonal produce in simple and approachable ways. Participants can taste the finished dishes, take home recipes and even earn Bridgeport Bucks for attending.
“It teaches people what to do with produce, and that it doesn’t have to be complicated,” Shafer said. Cooking demonstrations encourage residents to try new ingredients and recipes, build confidence in the kitchen and develop healthy eating habits.

Impact and funding
The collaborative operates markets across nearly every Bridgeport neighborhood. Multiple markets run on different days to prevent competition while maximizing accessibility for residents. 
Consistency is a key element in building trust, Shafer said. Residents know when and where markets will take place, and regular attendance creates a sense of community among shoppers and vendors alike. “Repetition is what builds community for people. There are just places where people know they can go and get what they need,” Shafer said.
The programs offered through the collaborative also have a measurable impact. Last year, the organization distributed approximately $80,000 in benefits, an increase from $50,000 the previous year. 
The collaborative’s programs are supported by a variety of local sponsors, including M&T Bank, Hartford HealthCare, St. Vincent’s Hospital, and Yale New Haven Health. The collaborative also works with other organizations to extend its reach. Partnerships with groups such as the Green Village Initiative are being explored, with the goal of creating a regional food hub that could provide a consistent, accessible market space and long-term sustainability for the programs.
Despite the successes, the collaborative faces challenges. Funding can be inconsistent, and SNAP matching funds are potentially at risk for 2026. The organization remains fiscally sponsored rather than operating as a fully independent nonprofit, which can limit long-term planning.
“Our SNAP matching funds are in jeopardy for 2026. We’ve been doing great and responding to the need that just seems to be growing year after year. So I’m hoping the money grows in the same direction,” Shafer said.

India supplies nearly half of all generic prescription drugs used in the United States, making it the largest single source. 
In 2022, Indian pharmaceutical companies provided 47% of generic prescriptions filled in U.S. pharmacies, far more than domestic producers or suppliers from Europe and the Middle East. These medicines addressed common needs like those related to mental health, high blood pressure, cholesterol and nervous system disorders. Because of India’s exports, Americans saved an estimated $219 billion on prescriptions in 2022, and $1.3 trillion over the past decade. 
India produces about 35% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, for generics in the entire world. Despite this, most Indian drugmakers rely on China for about 70% of the raw ingredients needed to manufacture these medicines. That dependency leaves the U.S. vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, a vulnerability highlighted by ongoing cancer treatment shortages.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico legislative Democrats on Wednesday opened a special legislative session by making their case for why they need to meet now, when the state has not yet felt the full brunt of federal cuts enacted in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
At a news conference with leaders from the New Mexico House and Senate, Democrats said the special session is expected to last two days and will be targeted on what they identified as the most pressing needs.
“There is nothing on this special session agenda that is not urgent,” House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) said at a news conference at the Roundhouse Wednesday. “I agree with my Republican colleagues: There’s a lot more nasty stuff coming from the federal government that doesn’t take place for another year or two, and we’ll have to deal with that in the 30-day and in the next legislative session.”
Martínez was referencing criticism from Republicans, who have a minority in both chambers, that the session is wrongly focused on faraway federal cuts when other issues like crime, child welfare or medical malpractice are more pressing. 
The Democrats provided more details about how bills they’ve drafted will address imminent threats the cuts pose. Specifically, they said they’ll direct millions of dollars toward the Health Care Authority to shore up cuts to food stamps and Medicaid; provide emergency funding to rural hospitals; and ensure New Mexicans who get their healthcare from the state’s exchange won’t face huge premium increases due to expiring tax credits. 
So far, five bills have been drafted. They address vaccine access, criminal competency, enhanced premium tax credits and rural hospitals. A fifth makes an appropriation to pay for those changes. 
Martínez said the Democrats have reached consensus on each. Republicans intend to introduce their own legislation this session, Democratic leaders said, but whether they’re heard and considered depends on whether they are deemed “germane,” or in-line with the topic areas Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham laid out in her proclamation yesterday. 
NM Gov: ‘This special session is about protecting the people who need help most’

Acknowledging that they cannot fully address or “backfill” all the looming federal cuts over the day or two, Democratic leaders described the session beginning Wednesday as “step one” in counteracting federal cuts, an effort they said would likely take several years and multiple legislative sessions. 
“What’s coming at the state of New Mexico is frightening,” said Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe), describing the full brunt of the federal cuts.
The session begins on the same day a federal shutdown begins in earnest. Martínez pointed to the shutdown to contrast gridlock in Washington with the work Democrats in the majority expect to do during the special session. 
“While dysfunction in Washington DC drives the federal government to a complete halt, we are here today to step up for our friends and our neighbors all across the state,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Martinez-2-1-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-10-01 14:58:50.639040

Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, said the launch of Guardian 2.0 will take place “very soon” and an official date for the site to go live will be confirmed in the “near future.” 
The system, which provides public access to candidate expenditures and contributors, was set to be offline beginning Sept. 19 and launch by Wednesday, but more time was needed for “final adjustments” and to ensure data was accurately converted between the old and new software systems. 
Bruce Boone said fewer than 25 people have filings due in mid-October, and her agency will work with each of them to make certain they’re able to file on time. The site also provides information about which candidates have filed ethics paperwork to run for public office and political action committees that have formed.
“As with any new system, we expect there may be minor issues at first, but our team is fully prepared to respond quickly and provide direct support,” she said.
Guardian 2.0 will make filing and public access to campaign finance information “easier, faster and more transparent,” she said. 
The new system will have a new login, “modernized” visuals and a more intuitive filing experience, according to the Ethics Commission’s website. 
The change in the software system is a result of the current vendor no longer supporting the old system. Guardian 2.0 will be owned by the Ethics Commission and they will no longer be “dependent” on a single vendor, Bruce Boone said. 
While there may be temporary technical issues at launch, Bruce Boone said a support team will be available to assist the public and candidates filing paperwork.

(U.S. Defense Department)TOPEKA — Fort Riley announced Wednesday that many civilian employees are furloughed as a result of the federal government shutdown that went into effect at midnight Tuesday.
In a social media post, Fort Riley said email messages and phone calls to affected civilian staff will not be answered and many social media channeled will not be monitored.
More than 15 departments were closed, according to the post, including Public Affairs, Soldier and Family Assistance Center, some child care services, the Recycling Center and the Military Personnel Division administration.
Other departments are scheduling work by appointment only.

“Those who still report to work are classified as exempt and are generally in the life/health/safety fields,” Fort Riley’s social media posted in response to a question about who is affected. “Those who are not exempt do not report to work until funding is restored.”
A separate social media post referred people to the U.S. Defense Department’s website, which reads: “Military personnel will continue in a normal duty status, without pay, until such time as a continuing resolution or appropriations are passed by Congress and signed into law. Civilian personnel not engaged in excepted activities will be placed in a non-work, non-pay status.”

Fort Riley also postponed its Retiree Appreciation Day scheduled for Saturday.

The Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence, a nonprofit that runs two domestic violence shelters and provides a range of services, began this month offering no-cost medical examinations and forensic evidence collection at its new Waypoint Forensic Clinic. 
“Waypoint represents guidance, safety, and hope,” Lillian Lizana, director of the center’s forensic program, said in a statement. “Our goal is to provide compassionate, trauma-informed care that supports survivors and strengthens pathways to justice.”
The clinic is the first in the state to have a CortexFlo camera system, whose enhanced imaging can help see evidence of bruising and other injuries that may not be visible to the eye or by a basic camera, said Rene’ Davis, the center’s communications director. 
She said the technology can help provide evidence that can be used in prosecution of sexual assault and strangulation cases. 
Waypoint will also contract with certified Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners, who collect evidence in kits that can be used in court. The nurses, who are trained to provide trauma-informed care, are able to see survivors at the clinic or an area hospital. 
Davis said the clinic is an integral part of the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence’s 
Family Justice Center, which brings together under one roof help for survivors through counseling, legal aid, law enforcement, prosecutors and other services. Stakeholders from across Harrison County have been working together for several years to establish the center, she said. 
This is the first family justice center in Mississippi, and Davis said the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence is hopeful it will be replicated across the state. 
The family justice center, located in Gulfport at 47 Maples Drive, offers services that include the Northcutt Legal Clinic, which provides free legal services such as filing for domestic abuse protection orders, divorce and child custody, and a domestic violence intervention program geared to abusers that teaches accountability and respect. 
Renderings for the family justice center project imagine spaces for community services such as childcare and pre-school, offices for other departments and agencies and administrative space. 
Nearly 20 years ago, the first family justice center opened in San Diego, California, and now there are more than 300 centers around the country,  according to the Alliance for Hope International. 
A report by the alliance has found that family justice centers help survivors feel safe and empowered and it cites research documenting how they reduce domestic violence homicides.

Wayne Niederhauser, the state’s homelessness coordinator, sat in front of an often rowdy crowd at the North Salt Lake City Hall Tuesday evening to answer questions about the project, which represents a major move for the Utah Office of Homeless Services and the Utah Homeless Board, tasked with increasing the state’s emergency homeless shelter capacity in a campus-like setting with support and treatment to help people moving out of homelessness.

Some residents walked around the room asking for signatures opposing the development. And, while North Salt Lake Mayor Brian Horrocks asked attendees to refrain from yelling or clapping during the meeting, few complied.
“They don’t care about us,” a resident yelled while Niederhauser answered a public safety question. “Put it in your backyard,” others shouted at different points of the meeting. 
Utah officials unveil site for 1,300-bed homeless campus after long, secretive search

The state entered a contract to purchase a Salt Lake City parcel to build the 15.85-acre campus at a site in the Northpointe neighborhood, roughly a mile from North Salt Lake’s boundaries, raising many eyebrows from residents in the surrounding communities. The purchase closing date will be sometime after the legislative session, Niederhauser said.
“The legislature will need to weigh in on some things before we move ahead with any construction or proceed with any development of that property, we want to engage the public,” he added.
Niederhauser spoke about the need for such a campus in the state, where homelessness increased 18% last year — Utahns experiencing homelessness are in need of resources and mental health and addiction support, and a centralized campus would offer an all-day, all-year operation for those needs, he said. 
The state has proposed a $4 million budget for public safety around the campus, conducted a wetland study of the property and is contemplating how to best work to mitigate the notorious mosquito issue in the area, and how to best transport people in and out of the campus that is far from any public transit.  
But, neighbors remained skeptical and deeply frustrated with the plans.

Neighbors ask for another site 
Brittney Souther, who lives near the proposed site, said she worries about North Salt Lake’s Foxboro neighborhood. 
“The nearest grocery store, the nearest bus stop, are not in Salt Lake City. They’re here in Foxboro,” Souther said. “Without reliable public transportation to take people back into the city, they will absolutely end up walking this way into our neighborhoods, towards our businesses and our schools.”
In her view, the campus should not move forward without strong safeguards for the surrounding community and without independent oversight to ensure the area’s safety. 
“You mentioned putting aside $4 million towards security, but you don’t even have enough money to build what you want, much less run it. Where will you even get the funds for that?” she asked Niederhauser.

But mostly, she wanted to know why a site west of the Salt Lake City airport was not under consideration for the project instead. 
“We looked at property there, similar to this property,” Niederhauser said. “This is the one that works for us.”
Shane Moser, a fire captain with the Salt Lake City Fire Department, speaking as a resident, also worried about public safety. His team, he said, responds to two or three calls a day at the Gail Miller Resource Center, a homeless shelter in Salt Lake City with a 200-bed capacity. Given the new campus’ 1,300-bed capacity, he expects the site to have an impact on the South Davis Metro Fire Department as well as the North Salt Lake Police Department, he said.



Let us know what you think...


 


But, Moser said, some solutions could decrease those concerns. 
“I would recommend that you guys look at a gate in, gate out, controlled access,” Moser said. “At the other resource centers, that is not the case. They’re allowed to freely roam the neighborhoods, and that has a significant drain on resources, as well as impacts crime levels.”
An emotional response
Mayor Horrocks said he wasn’t surprised by the highly emotional response of the community. 
For those who live on Salt Lake City’s west side, the project “is a disaster,” he said. But, in North Salt Lake, there may be ways to protect the city by controlling its access through the bridge over the Jordan River. 
“Obviously just to take the bridge out would be perfect,” Horrocks said. “If that’s not an option, then we maybe make it a toll bridge, and nobody comes or goes without someone checking in with someone.”
While he supports helping people who are going through rough patches to get back on their feet, he said it gets harder when those dealing with addictions don’t want to receive help. So, he’s unsure on how the campus will succeed. But, for now, he’s focusing on what can be done to protect his city.
“I think the decision’s been made. And when people say, ‘well, I’ll call my legislator,’ the legislature was the one that told Wayne to go make a recommendation, and he’s done that,” Horrocks. “So unless something changes dramatically, which I don’t see, I’m back to ‘OK, that thing’s coming. What can I do as mayor of North Salt Lake?’”

Gabriella Juarez, an LSU student affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society, a progressive organization, was removed from the room by LSU Police after she continued speaking after her time had expired. The committee allows each commenter three minutes for remarks. 
Juarez and six other students criticized the committee, which they characterized as illegitimate. The students alleged the members’ motivations were to appease Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. Some of their remarks were profane, though most of the students did not curse during their remarks.
Juarez’s removal sparked outrage from around 15 other students in the organization who immediately stood and began shouting at the police, following them outside the LSU Foundation building. 
After Juarez’s arrest, several students blocked the police car from driving off with her. Six other students were arrested for obstructing a roadway, according to Z Martin, a Students for a Democratic Society member. 
Juarez was arrested for disturbing the peace, Martin said. 
The meeting continued after Juarez’s removal. The Illuminator is seeking comments from LSU officials taking part in the meeting.

Corteva will split into two publicly traded companies with the spin-off scheduled to be complete in the second half of 2026.  The individual companies will focus on crop protection solutions (New Corteva) and the seed business (New business entity generically termed “SpinCo”).
Per slides released to the investor community, this will result in companies with estimated 2025 annual revenues of $7.8 billion (New Corteva) and $9.9 billion (SpinCo).
Future Handling of “Legacy” DuPont Pensions is Included in the Plan
Understanding the Impact of the DuPont Legacy on Future Business Strategies
An important aspect of this transaction for many retirees of the legacy DuPont Company is the handling of the pension responsibilities.  During the previous company spin-offs and splits the legacy pensions were transferred to Corteva.  There has been considerable concern and speculation about the future handling of those pensions, as rumors of this further split emerged.  Per the public announcement, “legacy liabilities, including historical DuPont pension plan and PFAS obligations, will be retained by New Corteva.”
Full leadership rosters are yet to be announced, but Greg Page, current Chairman of Corteva, will remain in the role of Chairman for the New Corteva.  Chuck Magro, current Corteva CEO, will become the CEO of the “SpinCo” entity.
While mergers typically realize benefits in the form of “synergies” and reduced cost of operation, a split has the potential to increase costs as duplicate functions need to be established for the second, newly created entity.  In this case, the leadership evaluates those added costs to be minor and estimates them at $80-100 million annually.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OIP.webp,,,2025-10-01 13:58:43.810237

(Photo from Rhode Island Collection, Providence Public Library)The toxic remnants of an out-of-use Providence swing bridge are finally coming down with the help of a $2.34 million federal grant, announced by Rhode Island’s congressional delegation Tuesday.
The Point Street Bridge funding, awarded through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Marine Debris program, will cover the cost for the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), along with The Nature Conservancy, to remove 250 tons of toxic and hazardous wooden timbers, pilings and sub-surface debris from the 1927 bridge.
The 527-foot swing structure, the third iteration of the bridge on the same site, was built to serve dual purposes, connecting motorists across the Providence River while also lifting to make way for a thriving water-borne shipping industry during the first half of the 20th century, according to a 1990 report by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. Construction of the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier, completed in 1966, blocked large vessel traffic, rendering the movable feature of the highway unnecessary.
It remains passable by motorists, but has not swung open since 1959. However, the creosote wooden timber system used to lift the bridge was never removed. Its deterioration has caused pollution of the Providence River.
“Old pilings in the Providence River are more than an eyesore — they create pollution and impede navigation,” U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement.
The funding for marine debris cleanup projects nationwide was carved out in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Other programs and grants included in the Biden-era spending package have been pulled back, or paused, since the Trump administration took office.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the CRMC, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday. The project is expected to begin this month, with a September 2027 completion, according to NOAA’s website. 
“Removing hazardous debris from the Providence River is good for the environment, the local economy, and Rhode Islanders’ quality of life,” U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement. “This new federal funding will make the river safer for boaters and strengthen Providence’s waterfront for residents and visitors alike.”
Rhode Island’s project was one of 13 nationwide awarded a combined $26.4 million through NOAA’s Marine Debris program, which also helps to remove derelict vessels and abandoned fishing gear.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung)Nearly half of U.S. Department of Agriculture employees will be furloughed during the federal government shutdown, though key programs that support nutrition, forest preservation and wildfire prevention, the most pressing plant and animal diseases and agricultural commodity assessments will continue.
Many offices, including county USDA service centers, will be closed or operating with minimal staff until Congress agrees on a temporary spending package. Support, payment processing and other functions of these offices are also suspended during the shutdown.
Congress failed to pass a stopgap spending bill Tuesday which resulted in the start of a government shutdown at midnight and federal agencies had to implement the contingency plans required by the Office of Management and Budget.
According to the contingency plan filed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, only a handful of agency operations will continue during the shutdown. The primary objective is that agencies cannot incur financial obligations if the funding source has lapsed and any planned or in-the-works activities that would incur new obligations, must cease. 
Activities that may continue during the shutdown include those that are financed by something other than current year appropriations, expressly authorized to continue, either by law or by necessary implication, necessary to the presidential duties and powers or related to emergencies that endanger human life or the protection of property.
According to the plan, more than 42,000 USDA employees are expected to be furloughed during the shutdown. That’s about half of the more than 85,000 employees the agency said would be “on board” prior to the shutdown. 
USDA programs that will continue despite the shutdown: 

Farm loan processing.
Certain natural resources and conservation programs that are mandatory under the farm bill or to protect human life and private property, like the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, dam safety and rehab work, the National Water and Climate Center which tracks flooding and weather risks and the National Soil Survey Center. 
“Core” nutrition safety net programs. This includes SNAP and child nutrition programs which have funding appropriations through October. The Women Infants and Children, or WIC, program is set to continue through the shutdown “subject to the availability of funding.” According to the plan, WIC can “recover and reallocate” unused grant funding from previous years to cover gap in coverage. 
Food safety operations, like inspections and laboratory testing.
Wildfire preparation and response. 
Activities like grading, assessment, inspection, import and export for farm commodities. These activities are supported by user fees and therefore not impacted by the shutdown.
Emergency programs under USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that address new world screwworm, highly pathogenic avian influenza, African swine fever, rabies and exotic fruit flies. Surveying for other plant and livestock diseases will cease during the shutdown. 
Prior obligations in the Section 521 rental housing agreement program. This is the program element of USDA Rural Development offices that will persist.
Operational requirements like human resource policies, cybersecurity and critical IT infrastructure. 

Under the contingency plan, USDA functions like ongoing research, reports, outreach and technical assistance are suspended. The agency will also stop processing payments and disaster assistance. 
Trade negotiations, hazardous fuel treatments, special use permits, regulatory work, training and travel by USDA employees and agencies are also suspended. 
According to the contingency plan, most functions are suspended for the Risk Management Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Foreign Agricultural Service, Food and Nutrition Service, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Economic Research Service, National Agricultural Statistical Service, Rural Development, and staff offices.
Website updates are also suspended under the shutdown. A banner atop the USDA website informs visitors that the website will not be updated “due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown.” 
“President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people,” the banner reads. 
According to the plan, “all activities will cease” for the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and her office during the shutdown. 
Approximately 67% of Farm Service Agency, or FSA, employees will be furloughed. According to the plan, selected leadership at headquarters and USDA offices will stay on during the shut down. This means county service centers, and the majority of the services they offer, will not be available during the shutdown. 
Nearly all, 1135 out of 1237 employees, at the Food and Nutrition Service offices were projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, though according to the plan, enough employees remain to facilitate SNAP, child nutrition programs and WIC. WIC must make unspent funds from past years available in order to continue operations through October.
Close to 20,000 of the 32,390 Forest Service employees will continue to work on certain approved areas of agency work, like wildfire prevention, protection of federal land and federal directives to expand timber production. Public access to recreation sites managed by the department will be reduced, according to the plan. 
A significant portion of Agricultural Marketing Service operations are funded by previous farm bill appropriations or by user fees, so services like the Federal Grain Inspection Service and dairy grading will continue, as will market news information.
Operations like country of origin labeling, the packers and stockyards program, the national organic program, shell egg surveillance and the pesticide data program will be suspended. 
The plan calls for a number of reconsiderations in the event the shutdown persists longer than 5 days. This could include, for example a farm loan employee or other staff member on call at USDA service centers, or the reinstatement of some furloughed employees to deal with wildfire management. 
Glenn “GT” Thompson, chair of the House Committee on Agriculture, blamed Democrats, who demanded extentions to the Affordable Care Act be added to the stopgap spending bill, for shutting down the government and putting “critical USDA services in jeopardy.”
“These political games harm rural America through disruptions to farm payments, disaster relief, food assistance, and other critical services,” the Republican from Pennsylvania said in a statement. “Performative photo ops at state fairs and lip service to the producers who feed, fuel, and clothe our country won’t hide the truth—Democrats forcing a government shutdown only inflicts more pain on our agricultural economy.”

“When the government shuts down, Montana suffers,” said Vicky Byrd, CEO of the Montana Nurses Association, in a statement. “Our nurses and healthcare providers are already stretched thin.
“This shutdown will make it harder to deliver care, to access care, to keep rural hospitals and clinics open, and to ensure patients get the treatment they deserve and need.”
Early Wednesday, the federal government started shutting down after the U.S. Senate failed to advance short-term funding measures before midnight. An estimated 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed at an impact of $400 million a day, according to States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., Bureau.
Open enrollment for people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace starts Nov. 1, and premiums could double in 2026 if enhanced tax credits in the ACA expire at the end of this year as scheduled, the D.C. Bureau reported, citing an analysis by health policy research organization KFF.
In a news release, the Montana Nurses Association said 47,000 Montanans rely on ACA coverage, they are facing an average premium increase of $5,900 a year, and older adults in rural areas will experience an even more severe impact.
The total premium in Montana was not immediately available Wednesday morning, but a national KFF analysis found premiums were expected to more than double on average, from $888 this year to $1,904 in 2026, according to States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau.
A married couple in Helena could see premiums rise by nearly $19,764 annually, the Montana Nurses Association said.
In a phone call with the Daily Montanan, Montana Nurses Association Vicky Byrd said repealing ACA subsidies and gutting Medicaid puts rural hospitals and clinics in vulnerable financial positions.
Without continued Medicaid support, hospitals could lose up to 50% of their uncompensated care funding, forcing them to cut services or close, the Montana Nurses Association said.
“You don’t know how long it’s going to take, but once these rural hospitals and clinics go bankrupt, there’s no bringing them back,” Bird said. “There goes jobs. There goes my nurses’ jobs. There goes our providers for these rural communities. Now, (patients) are going to have to drive miles and miles.”
She said some people won’t seek care at all, and they’ll end up even more sick and land in the emergency room as a result, where medical costs will be even steeper.
In the news release, the Montana Nurses Association urged the state’s Congressional delegation to “stand up for Montana values and protect healthcare, restore funding, and reopen the government.
“We call on President (Donald) Trump and Congressional Republicans to work with Democrats to find a solution that puts people over politics,” the association said.
The political standoff had Democrats blocking a temporary government funding bill by Republicans, arguing a solution needs to include an extension of tax credits in the Affordable Care Act. But Democrats didn’t have support to pass a bill of their own.
Republican U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana supported a GOP measure to fund the government for seven weeks, but they opposed the Democratic bid to continue funding for a month with extensions for health care provisions, States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau reported.

“Each day the government remains closed, I will be donating my salary to the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay which provides help to vulnerable populations who may be impacted by this reckless choice,” U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody said in a written statement.
The center provides social services for sexual assault survivors, veterans, and first responders struggling with PTSD and other mental-health challenges.
U.S. Reps. Kat Cammack from Gainesville and Gus Bilirakis from Pasco County said that they have formally requested that the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer withhold their congressional pay for the duration of the shutdown.

“If the military is not getting paid, members of Congress should not be getting paid,” Cammack said Tuesday night in a video posted to her X account. “It is the very least that members of Congress can do when other people, especially when our military and our Border Patrol, the Democrats want to withhold their pay, well, they need to do the same then.”
“Government shutdowns are costly, disruptive, and ultimately unproductive,” Bilirakis said in a written statement. “It is unacceptable for Members of Congress to receive a paycheck while dedicated federal workers — including members of our Armed Services — go without.”
Members of Congress get paid $174,000, a rate that hasn’t changed since 2009. They continue to receive funding during a shutdown per the U.S. Constitution. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution says: “The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”
Florida’s other U.S. Sen., Rick Scott, sponsored legislation in 2019 — his first year in the Senate — to prevent Congress from getting paid during government shutdowns. He doubled down on that proposal during an appearance on “Fox and Friends” on Wednesday morning.
“If you didn’t do your job in business, you didn’t get paid,” he said. “If you don’t show up in your job, you don’t get paid. Why are we getting paid? We shouldn’t get paid if we don’t do our job.”
Multiple news sources have listed Scott as the richest member of Congress worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Meanwhile, some federal lawmakers say they can’t afford to have their paycheck withheld.
“I’m not wealthy, and I have three kids. I would basically be missing, you know, mortgage payments, rent payments, child support,” Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., told NBC News. “So it’s not feasible, not gonna happen.”
About 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed during a government shutdown, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

In Mohsen Mahdawi and Rümeysa Öztürk’s cases, a federal appeals panel is weighing questions about the balance between the government’s power to enforce immigration laws and the individual rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.

A panel of federal judges heard arguments Tuesday in the ongoing court cases of two international students who were detained in Vermont earlier this year as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activism.
Mohsen Mahdawi, who is Palestinian, and Rümeysa Öztürk, who is Turkish, have been free from custody for months after judges in the U.S. District Court for Vermont ordered their release. Mahdawi was arrested by federal agents in Colchester in April and was held in federal custody in a state prison. Öztürk was held overnight in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in St. Albans after agents arrested her in Massachusetts. ICE then took her from Vermont to a detention center in Louisiana. 
Now, the Trump administration is in the process of appealing aspects of the Vermont District Court’s rulings. The challenges were heard one after the other Tuesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which is located in New York City. 
In both cases, the three-judge panel is considering questions with potentially national implications about the balance between the government’s power to enforce immigration laws and the protections of individual rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.
The appeals panel did not issue a decision Tuesday. Attorneys for Mahdawi and Öztürk said after the hearing that while they did not know when that ruling would come, it could be relatively soon because the judges were operating on an “expedited” timeline.
In both cases, the government is arguing that federal immigration law prevents district courts, such as the one in Vermont, from taking up certain cases in which those bringing a suit are challenging their detention by federal immigration authorities. 
In Mahdawi’s case, specifically, the government is appealing Vermont Judge Geoffrey Crawford’s decision to release the Columbia University student on bail while courts consider his challenge to his arrest. In Öztürk’s case, the government is appealing Judge William Sessions’ order that would have transferred the Tufts University student back to Vermont from an ICE detention center in Louisiana. But that order was essentially superseded by Sessions’ decision to then order her release on bail. 
In addition to the proceedings this week, both students are also challenging the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to deport them in proceedings in the federal immigration court system. That court system is part of the U.S. Department of Justice and separate from federal district courts, like Vermont’s. The students’ immigration challenges are both being heard in Massachusetts, their attorneys said. 
In court Tuesday, Tyler Becker, an attorney in Trump’s Justice Department, said the students should have been required to exhaust their options within the immigration system before seeking relief from the U.S. District Court judges in Vermont. 
Becker argued that even if the students lose their immigration court challenges, meaning they would be facing deportation, that system allows opportunities for appeals, including to the same level of court — the federal appeals circuit — as Tuesday’s hearing. He said the Vermont judges were wrong to take up the two cases. 
But attorneys for the students contended that those immigration proceedings could take months or even years. It’s unlikely the students’ immigration cases would get the same expedited treatment as their cases in Vermont’s district court, they said, because the students are no longer behind bars. That potentially long timeframe, the students’ attorneys said, would not give the students the immediate relief they needed to cure what the attorneys say were clear violations of their rights to free speech.
Both students appear to have been targeted for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza. Mahdawi was a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian campus protests at Columbia, while Öztürk wrote an op-ed criticizing Tufts’ response to the war. 
Moreover, the attorneys said, stripping the students of the ability to challenge their detention in the place where they were being held, at least for a time — Vermont — would violate the clause of the Constitution meant to guarantee individuals’ protection from unlawful government detention, known as the writ of habeas corpus.
Potential conflict between the immigration system and other courts, which the Trump administration is raising as a key concern in the students’ cases, is “just the price of our constitutional design,” said Michael Tan, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union representing Mahdawi, during Tuesday’s arguments. 
In Mahdawi’s case, Becker also argued Tuesday that a roughly decade-old Windsor Police Department report describing statements Mahdawi allegedly made to an Upper Valley gun store owner was not properly considered in the Vermont judge’s ruling. 
The report led an FBI agent to speak to Mahdawi, and the case was soon ended, lawyers for both parties have said. Crawford, the judge, said earlier this year he believed that the “shocking” allegations in the filings were “in large part fabricated.”
One of the judges on Tuesday’s panel, William Nardini — who is one of two Trump appointees hearing the students’ cases — was sharply critical of Crawford’s assessment of the fact the FBI did not pursue charges in the case, saying Crawford made “dramatically flawed” inferences about Mahdawi’s character based on that fact.
Tuesday’s hearing came on the same day, meanwhile, that a federal judge in Boston ruled in a separate case that the Trump administration has violated the Constitution in targeting non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. The ruling said Trump and his policies threatened free speech. 
Attorneys for Mahdawi and Öztürk said Tuesday they weren’t immediately sure how that case could impact the students’ proceedings. But in comments to reporters, Mahdawi himself quoted the Boston judge’s ruling and urged people to consider its words.
“He says: ‘Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, we the people of the United States — you and me — have our magnificent Constitution,’” Mahdawi said.

Child care advocates rallied in Raleigh last summer in support of calls for better funding. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) As a child care provider, I witness firsthand the struggles families face and the power of community in addressing those struggles. Recently, a teacher in one of my programs notified me of a child who repeatedly removed her shoes in class. We discovered it was because the shoes were too small and hurt her feet, and her mother couldn’t afford to buy new ones. When I told neighbors about it, they bought the child not just new shoes, but socks and other clothing, too. To me, their actions exemplify real care: understanding a need and offering tangible help in the way that actually reaches people.
Despite recent stories to the contrary, Republican’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) isn’t about helping families, and it certainly won’t help those who need it most. Ultimately, the law’s significant cuts to health care and food assistance will harm the early childhood field I work in and love.
While the OBBBA technically increased the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to allow families to claim up to $3,000, it remains non-refundable, meaning most low-income families cannot fully use it. Over 70% of the expanded benefit is projected to go to households earning over $100,000 annually. This excludes the vulnerable families I work with, who face housing instability, financial hardship, and sometimes can’t even afford basic necessities like shoes for their children.
While tax credits aren’t inherently bad, this bill’s provisions primarily benefit wealthy families, leaving the rest of us behind. Lawmakers shouldn’t be touting these credits as a child care win, because it isn’t.
Lowering costs for families is crucial, but laser-focusing on affordability without fixing the child care sector’s underlying problems is shortsighted – it’s like lowering gas prices when the roads desperately need paving. Even with employer tax credits, this approach won’t solve the child care crisis, as increasingly limited supply issues will further reduce families’ options.
Some parts of the new law also aim to expand access to employer-provided care, but this option isn’t widely used, and it places child care in the same bucket as employer-provided health insurance coverage—a benefit you lose if you lose your job. For a parent who’s just lost their job, losing access to child care makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find work again. Child care is also outside most employers’ core business, allowing them to easily discontinue the benefit and leave working families optionless.
The OBBBA also expanded “Dependent Care Assistance Programs,” designed to allow working parents to set aside a portion of their pre-tax income in a savings account for child care. But low-income families working paycheck-to-paycheck, like many in my program, have no wiggle room to set anything aside—and parents using the flexible spending account can’t use the tax credit for the same costs. Also, having more money in the short term, even for higher earners, doesn’t mean much if you can’t find or access care—which is the bigger problem for the more than half of Americans who live in child care deserts.
Nearly half of early educators rely on public assistance like Medicaid. About 80% of the teachers in my program need it, because I can’t cover their health insurance. Without basic needs programs, more educators will leave the field for better-paying jobs with benefits, worsening the turnover and retention crisis. This only grows waitlists and reduces access to care for parents. Fewer educators also means more of a burden on providers like me—I’m seeing more burnout and feeling it myself, and it’ll only get worse as educators struggle to cover basic needs like health care and food.
If we really want to fix the child care crisis, tax credits won’t cut it. We need a three-pronged approach: educating families on the importance of early years and offering whole-family counseling; investing in early educators through professional development, health care, and higher wages; and expanding services for children, including special education and supportive early care. Direct funding for child care programs could achieve these goals.
Children are our future. We must provide them with the best possible start in life, including family mental health support, accessible and affordable early education, and basic necessities—like shoes that fit.

(headshot courtesy of Wisconsin Court System)Appeals Court Judge Maria Lazar announced she’s running for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court Wednesday morning.
Since her election to the District II Court of Appeals in 2022, Lazar has been a reliable vote for right-wing causes on the panel — which is controlled by a 3-1 conservative majority. 
Lazar joins fellow appellate Judge Chris Taylor in the race for an open seat on the Court, which is being vacated by Justice Rebecca Bradley. Bradley has been one of the Court’s most right-wing members and announced earlier this year she would not run for re-election. 
In a video posted to X, Lazar said she was running for the seat to reduce the “politicization” of the Court. 
“We need to draw a line in the sand and stop the destruction of our courts, especially our state Supreme Court,” Lazar said. “I am an independent, impartial judge who strives to follow the law and Constitution in every decision I make from the bench. It is time to restore that level of judicial dedication to the Court.”
Lazar, a former Waukesha County judge and assistant district attorney, also noted that she’s been elected to her seats on the circuit and appeals courts while Taylor, a former Democratic state lawmaker, was first appointed to a seat on the Dane County Circuit Court by Gov. Tony Evers. 
While her campaign announcement sought to establish her nonpartisan bonafides, Lazar has a history of fighting for Republican causes. In her last campaign for her seat on the court of appeals, Lazar touted endorsements from prominent election deniers. 
Those endorsements included former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who recently agreed to have his law license suspended for three years over his widely derided review of the 2020 presidential election, Jim Troupis, who is facing criminal charges for his role in the plot to cast false Electoral College votes on behalf of President Donald Trump, and Bob Spindell, a Republican member of the Wisconsin Elections Commission who cast one of those fraudulent ballots and has regularly used his position to spread conspiracy theories about election administration. 
Lazar was also endorsed in that race by Pro-Life Wisconsin, an organization dedicated to banning all abortions in the state. That endorsement is a stark contrast with Taylor, who previously worked as policy director for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin. 
“Just like Rebecca Bradley, Maria Lazar has spent her career rolling back people’s rights, attacking reproductive health care and voting rights, and doing the bidding of powerful special interests and her billionaire friends,” Ashley Franz, Taylor’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “If elected, Maria Lazar would be the most extreme member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. It’s no surprise that she’s backed by the same right-wing billionaires who tried unsuccessfully to buy a seat on our supreme court this last April, which Wisconsinites overwhelmingly rejected.”

The large majority of the 51,600 people enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in the state are served by two insurers, UnitedHealth and Vermont Blue Advantage. Both are leaving the market for individual purchasers next year.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tens of thousands Vermonters are set to lose Medicare Advantage option in 2026.","The Medicare website. File photo by Rachel Leathe/AP
Nearly all Vermonters on Medicare Advantage individual plans are expected to lose their current health insurance for 2026. New data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reveal all but one provider in the state will discontinue coverage for 2026.
Neither UnitedHealth nor Vermont Blue Advantage has renewed its individual Medicare Advantage plans for the 2026 year, CMS data show. These plans cover the large majority of the more than 51,600 people insured by Medicare Advantage plans in Vermont. Vermont Blue Advantage alone currently serves 26,000 people in the state.
Humana will continue to offer its Medicare Advantage plans in Bennington, Caledonia, Essex, Orange, Windham and Windsor counties. CMS’s data for the coming year did not show any 2026 Medicare Advantage plans available for individuals living in the state’s other counties to enroll in.
“Without a doubt, it’s very disruptive for seniors to have limited options to these plans,” said Kaj Samsom, the commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation. 
These changes impact only the individual Medicare Advantage plans. Large employers may offer their retirees continued coverage with Medicare Advantage plans provided by the employer. In September, the State Treasurer’s Office announced that the health insurance plans it manages for retired teachers will transition from Vermont Blue Advantage to HealthSpring. Vermont Blue Advantage is run by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont in conjunction with its counterpart and parent company in Michigan.
Medicare Advantage plans are an option for people eligible for Medicare, a federal health insurance program for those 65 years and older and those with certain disabilities. The plans, sometimes called Part C plans, are operated by a private company but paid for by the federal government. They often include broader coverage, including prescription coverage, than standard Medicare, and they have a cap on annual out-of-pocket expenses. Generally, standard Medicare covers 80% of health expenses.
Last year two Medicare Advantage plans pulled out of Vermont, leaving only the Humana, Blue Advantage and UnitedHealth plans for individuals to choose from.  At the time, only 50 people were enrolled in Humana plans.
This week UnitedHealth, which is the nation’s largest provider of MA plans, announced an end to its MA coverage for 600,000 patients across the country in 2026. 
All across the country Medicare Advantage providers have been scaling back their coverage, as the plans become less profitable for the companies that run them. Many cite a decrease in the amount of money the private insurers receive from the federal government, higher numbers of patients seeking and paying for care, and a shift in federal rules outlining how much insurers can pre-pay providers for care. 
Current plans will remain in effect through the end of the year. Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, for patients to choose plans for the coming year, runs Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. 
Individuals who lose their MA coverage are guaranteed eligibility to enroll in any plan in the Vermont Medicare Supplement market up to 63 days after the MA coverage ends — for those whose coverage runs through the end of this year, that leaves until March 4, 2026, a press release from the Department of Financial Regulation explains. 
The department advises people to hold on to the notice they receive from their insurer announcing the end of coverage, as proof to secure guaranteed access to the supplemental plans. 
“This is disruptive, yes, but don’t panic. You have time, you have options. There are resources available to help guide you through it,” Samsom said.
He pointed people toward Vermont’s State Health Insurance Program (SHIP), which provides assistance to Medicare beneficiaries in Vermont, and the Medicare handbook for navigating coverage.
Without access to the Medicare Advantage  plans, individuals have the option to opt into standard Medicare for coverage. Those in traditional Medicare plans often need to buy a Medicare Supplement plan, or Medigap plan for short — which offers coverage for the remaining expenses that traditional Medicare does not cover. Many people on traditional Medicare also need to buy prescription drug plans, often referred to as Part D plans.
Vermont’s Medigap plans are expensive: “There’s a real risk of this change driving more people to be in Medicare with no secondary coverage,” said Mike Fisher, the state’s health care advocate. 
Yet Medicare Advantage plans have also received serious criticisms. 
“We regularly hear from people who feel like they have been sold something that doesn’t meet their needs,” Fisher said. “And we regularly hear from providers across the whole system of care who are really frustrated with underpayment.”
“There is a lot of frustration about them, so I think that there will be some people who will see this as a good thing,” he added. “But we also know that there’s a lot of Vermonters who have been quite satisfied and well served [by the Medicare Advantage plans].”

A federal district judge sided with Cook in early September after she challenged the president in court.  A three-judge panel then split 2-1 in rejecting Trump’s appeal to overturn the lower court decision and affirmed on Sept. 16 that Cook could keep her position as the case plays out. Trump asked the Supreme Court to intervene, adding to his series of petitions to the justices since his second term began. The decision could have major bearing on Trump’s powers as the chief executive.The legal battle is occurring against a backdrop of Trump’s ongoing pressure to insert himself in the decisions of the independent central bank. For months Trump and his allies have attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with antagonizing social media posts amid Trump’s continued campaign for lower interest rates.The president and Senate Republicans recently installed White House economist Stephen Miran on the board.

A bill (HB 73) that would establish a centralized database to track the voting-rights status of individuals with felony convictions has once again been filed in the Florida House of Representatives.
Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens, has sponsored similar legislation over the past several sessions. None have received a committee hearing (Broward County Democrat Tina Polsky has filed similar legislation in the Senate in previous years).
The origin of the legislation date to what happened after Floridians passed Amendment 4 in 2018. That measure was designed to restore the voting rights of Floridians who had served their criminal sentences (except for those found guilty of murder or sexual offenses).
The pool of potential eligible voters was reduced substantially, however, after the Legislature in 2019 required people with felony convictions to have to pay any “legal financial obligations” — fines, fees, and restitution — before regaining their right to vote.
That has led to uncertainty among individuals who have received confusing or contradictory information from the state since then about whether they are eligible to vote. Most notably, that resulted in the arrests of 20 individuals right before the 2022 primary election. Those arrests took place after state lawmakers approved the Office of Election Crimes and Security at the urging of Gov. Ron DeSantis during the legislative session earlier that year.
That lack of a centralized voter database led the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the leading advocate for the passage of Amendment 4 in 2018, to file a lawsuit in 2023 against DeSantis and election officials, alleging they had created a “bureaucratic morass that prevents people with felony convictions from voting, or even determining whether they’re eligible to vote.” (The group dropped the lawsuit in 2024 as they agreed to enter into mediation with the Florida Department of State, according to the News Service of Florida).
What would happen
Robinson’s legislation calls for the Florida Commission on Offender Review to develop and maintain a database of information for those with felony convictions including:

The remaining length of any term of supervision.
The remaining amount of any restitution owed to a victim as ordered by a court as part of his or her sentence.
The remaining amount due of any fines and fees initially ordered by a court as part of his or her sentence or as a condition of any form of supervision.

If the measure were to become law, the Department of State, the Department of Corrections, the clerks of the circuit courts, the county comptrollers, and the Board of Executive Clemency would provide the information listed above to commission.
That body would be required to provide the governor, president of the Senate, and speaker of the House a comprehensive plan by July 1, 2027, that would:

List government entities and methods by which the commission would collect, centralize, analyze, and secure the information required to be included in the database.
Describe any infrastructure and services, including but not limited to, software, hardware, and information technology services, that may be necessary to create and maintain the database.
List the anticipated number of additional employees to develop and maintain the database.
Estimate the cost of the database.
Cite any legal authority necessary for the commission to develop and maintain the database.

Six months after a deadline for filing claims, a judge will allow a new petitioner — and potentially others — to seek compensation from the state’s largest religious denomination.

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDigger
BURLINGTON — A year after filing for bankruptcy under the weight of 31 unresolved clergy misconduct lawsuits, the Vermont Roman Catholic Diocese is seeing its number of accusers rise nearly fourfold.
The state’s largest religious denomination had thought the pool of current abuse claimants had plateaued at 118 upon an April deadline for people to seek compensation. But at a hearing Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Heather Cooper endorsed a request by a new petitioner identified only as “John Doe” to add his name — a move that multiple lawyers involved said could potentially open the door for others.
After the diocese asked to reorganize its depleting finances on Sept. 30, 2024, the court said any claimants wanting to join the Chapter 11 case had to do so by April 4 — a date advertised in select national and state newspapers and local church bulletins.
But Doe, a former Vermonter now living in Florida, didn’t see the notice, he said in newly submitted court papers. 
Doe was placed within weeks of his 1947 birth at the diocese’s former St. Joseph’s Orphanage in Burlington, where he “suffered from repeated instances of abuse” during his decade there, his statement said.
Moving south in 1995, Doe didn’t know about the church’s bankruptcy case until a recent visit to Chittenden County this summer, when he learned of the filing as well as a new Burlington “memorial healing space” for the more than 13,000 children who lived at the orphanage from its opening in 1854 to its closing in 1974.
“For the first time in his life, Doe decided to acknowledge his history at the orphanage,” his lawyer, Celeste Laramie of the Burlington firm Gravel & Shea, wrote in court papers.
According to federal law, a bankruptcy court can decide whether to extend the filing deadline in such circumstances. But before the judge could rule on Doe’s request, attorneys for both the church and claimants agreed to add him to their current mediation topics — a move the judge endorsed on Tuesday without elaborating.
The updated total of 119 current claimants includes the initial 31 whose unresolved lawsuits spurred the bankruptcy filing. The new figure is almost double that of an earlier 67 accusers who settled abuse cases before the diocese sought Chapter 11 protection.
A year ago, the church said its assets had been reduced by half, to about $35 million. Since then, it has spent about $1.5 million — almost 5% of its remaining money — on legal bills, court records show.
Although the bankruptcy court has no authority to rule on any of the abuse allegations, which date as far back as 1950, it has allowed claimants to offer non-evidentiary “survivor statements.” On Tuesday, seven speakers told the judge of suffering depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, disassociation and problems with intimacy, sleeping and alcohol and drug use.
“Up to a year ago, I had planned to take my shame and humiliation to the grave,” said a Montpelier man identified as “speaker 4.”
Then he and others came forward upon the church’s bankruptcy filing.
“If the priests had been held accountable,” another speaker said, “we could have avoided all the pain.”

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Fargo-based Prairie Public announced Wednesday it has cut 12 staff positions in response to the elimination of federal funds for public broadcasting and a reduction in state spending from North Dakota.
Prairie Public laid off seven employees and eliminated five positions that were open, reducing staff by 18%, Prairie Public President and CEO John Harris said in a statement.
“The loss of federal and state funding has resulted in approximately a 25% reduction in our revenue,” Harris said. “Like most every public media organization in the country, we were forced to make hard choices – that included the difficult decision to part with valued members of our staff.”
In July, federal lawmakers rescinded about $1.1 billion in previously approved congressional spending that was to be distributed to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and its affiliate stations across the country. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced Aug. 1 its plans to close in response to the federal cuts, with a majority of staff positions ending Sept. 30.

Harris said some of Prairie Public’s programs and services could be reduced or eliminated in coming months as the public broadcaster redistributes responsibilities among the remaining staff.
“Amid the hardship, we remain committed to serving our communities as best as we can,” Harris said. He added continued support from their viewers and listeners will be critical to the organization moving forward.
During debate on the funding pull back, Republicans criticized Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio as having bias toward liberal points of view.
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said during a virtual forum Monday she considers herself a lifelong public radio listener, but she supported the budget cuts to NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting because she thinks they can be sustained by their supporters. 
There is more media competition than ever before in the marketplace and the government should not be “investing” in any specific media entity, she said.
“I thought it was an appropriate time to start pushing away from that and allowing public radio and television to stand on their own two feet,” Fedorchak said. “I’ve heard the fundraising calls that they are making and I’m pretty optimistic that they are going to have their supporters step up and help them fill those gaps that the federal government is leaving behind.”
In addition to federal cuts, Prairie Public saw a reduction in funding this year from the North Dakota Legislature.
During the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Kelly Armstrong proposed $2.9 million for Prairie Public for the 2025-27 budget cycle, including $1.7 million in one-time funding for transmitter replacement and maintenance. Lawmakers reduced the overall state funding to $400,000, providing money for tower improvements. Some lawmakers had advocated for cutting off funding to Prairie Public completely.
Prairie Public plans to continue providing educational programming, national content from PBS and NPR and maintain its transmitters in North Dakota, Minnesota, Canada and eastern Montana, according to the statement.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Is it time to let the Connecticut Sun set?,Jim Bellano,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/is-it-time-to-let-the-connecticut-sun-set/,"As much as it pains me to say it, it may be time for the State of Connecticut to confront reality and move on from the WNBA’s Sun.","As much as it pains me to say it, it may be time for the State of Connecticut to confront reality and move on from the WNBA’s Sun. 
As someone that has worked with eastern Connecticut municipalities, specifically in the tourism sector, I know what the presence of a professional sports franchise means for businesses and visitor traffic in the region.
Of course, the state will not move on– at least not without a fight. For obvious reasons, government officials will pursue, at least rhetorically, all avenues to keep the franchise in Connecticut. As we know, historically, the Nutmeg State is particularly sensitive to this issue.
For many, the sting from losing the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina after the 1996-97 season still endures. This is evidenced by the lingering presence of Whaler’s caps, T-shirts, and jerseys still worn by the team’s faithful.
And then there was the romancing of Hartford by the New England Patriots, only to have the city left at the altar after being used as leverage for a new stadium in Foxboro. Actually, it was less of a romance and more of a one-night stand, with Pat’s owner Robert Kraft leaving in the morning and telling then-Gov. John Rowland, “I’ll call you.”
First, Sun ownership has done all that it can to prepare the team for a move. Purchased in 2003 for $10 million, the most recent analysis by the website Sportico has the Sun valued at $180 million– 12th out of the WNBA’s 13 teams. However, the current bidding war has a Boston investment group battling a proposed Connecticut public-private partnership and dangling the number $325 million. Can the Mohegans resist such a return on investment?
Also, after reaching the semifinals in 2024, Sun ownership conducted a fire sale and gutted the franchise to the bone. This included the departures of the head coach, Stephanie White, WNBA legends Alyssa Thomas and Dewanna Bonner, and 2024’s Most Improved Player, DiJonai Carrington. Only two players from last year’s roster were around to take the court in 2025.
Second, a pivotal question is whether, like the Whalers, a professional franchise can flourish in Connecticut sitting halfway between Boston and New York. While league attendance has exploded over the past two years, according to accrossthetimeline.com, in 2025, the Sun drew an average of 8,635 fans per game in an arena that has a capacity of 9,323 seats for basketball. As with all WNBA franchises, this is significantly higher than what the team drew in the year 2023 BCC (before Caitlin Clark). But the Sun were still the fourth lowest in attendance this year, only surpassing teams that play at much smaller venues. Also, these attendance numbers were buttressed by a single game against the Indiana Fever held at TD Bank arena in Boston that drew over 19,000 fans- two and one quarter times higher than the usual crowd.
UConn’s Athletics website states that Peoples Bank Arena accommodates 16,294 seats for basketball. Therefore, an ancillary question is, would a Sun franchise in Hartford draw double the current fan base given that proximity between New York and Boston?
Finally, while well-intentioned, something just doesn’t sit right about a state government taking an ownership interest in a professional sports franchise, albeit a minority stake. As we see, the use of state pension funds for the deal does not have universal support. It is said that politics makes strange bedfellows. Here, both Republicans and the largest state employee’s union (AFSCME) have gone on the record opposing the proposed investment.
And let’s face it, the typical state official– elected or appointed, including those in the General Assembly– do not evoke a picture of a “silent partner.” You can almost see the following proposed bill in an upcoming session: “HB 2055, An Act requiring the Connecticut Sun to change from Man-to-Man to Zone defense.”
In the end, Connecticut’s efforts may buy a few years for the Sun to remain in state. In the end, however, such efforts are likely to go for naught. Antitrust and contractual interference accusations aside, professional sports leagues have significant control over the sale and location of their franchises. For reference, see Art Modell’s Cleveland Browns, Robert Irsay’s Baltimore Colts, and Donald Sterling’s Los Angeles Clippers- none of which exist anymore due to actions strongly supported by their respective leagues. Like Connecticut today, the Cleveland and Baltimore situations involved significant, but futile, state, and municipal opposition.
Make no mistake about it, Boston is too big a market not to have a franchise. The city is slated for one of the future rounds of expansion after 2030. With the explosion of revenue and team values it looks doubtful that both Boston and the WNBA will wait around six or seven years to cash in on what the Boston market has to offer.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — Complying with a federal policy designed to avoid conflicts of interest could cause “massive system disruption” for Kansans who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, an advocate told legislators last week.
Multiple people testified Sept. 25 before the Special Committee on Health and Social Services, to raise concerns about proposed changes because of a rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Kansas is out of compliance with the rule and stands to lose $350 to $400 million in federal funding if changes aren’t made, said committee chairman Rep. Will Carpenter, R-El Dorado.
The Kansas Department for Aging and Disabilities Services is addressing the issue as part of an overall strategy to modernize its home and community-based support waiver program.
To avoid conflict of interest, individuals with IDD who are on Medicaid cannot receive services from the same organization that provides their case management, said Jeanine Zlockie, National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services.
A case manager who has a financial relationship with the service provider could, for instance, feel pressured to steer a client to their company’s services, rather than objectively determining best services, she said.
CMS rules allow for workarounds in certain situations, such as in rural areas where there are limited providers, Zlockie said.
“The direction we’ve set based on these consensus recommendations is that there will be no dual service provision under a conflict-free system in Kansas,” said Seth Kilber, a KDADS assistant commissioner. “It’s going to require us to map the current state and the future state, defining those swim lanes for what each entity is able to actually do and perform.”
Paul Coffell, targeted case management supervisor for Starkey Inc. in Wichita, said the Kansas system already has conflict of interest practices in place and that he believes the system is strong and works well. He expressed concerns that separating organizations that provide services from organizations that provide case management would create an “invisible” waiting list as people wait for case managers.
“I would ask that everyone involved would remain open to persevering with what has been positive and successful for our TCM program instead of assuming that massive system disruption is unavoidable,” Coffell said.
Jeff Whittier, director of support services for Cottonwood Inc. in Lawrence, said the consensus reached among those working with KDADS to modernize the waiver was based on options presented to them. He called the agreement Kilber referred to as “the least damaging.”
In the Cottonwood community developmental disability organization area, Whittier said, there are 14 targeted case management providers, four of which are conflicted agencies.
“The remaining 10 are quote-unquote independent,” he said. “That sounds great on paper, since only 29% of the TCM providers in our area are conflicted.”
“In reality,” he added, “the four conflicted providers provide (targeted case management) services for approximately 66% of individuals in our catchment area.”
If the current plans addressing conflict of interest were implemented today, Whittier said, most providers, including Cottonwood, would likely divest themselves of targeted case management services.
Whittier said Cottonwood loses money providing targeted case management services, which is why most companies would choose to divest themselves of that portion of their work. He told the committee changes could be made systemwide to make the case management more sustainable, such as updating billing practices and costs.
“We really don’t have a choice in this matter, and I’m hoping that you will collaborate and be part of the solution, and everybody in this audience needs to be part of this solution,” Carpenter told Whittier. “The federal government has told us where we’re going to go with this, and I hope everyone understands that. They’ve been pretty lenient so far, but they’ve made it pretty clear we need to get our act together.”
Loved ones of people being served through the IDD program told the committee that changing case managers would negatively affect their family members.
Julie DeMarco gave examples about how the case manager who supports her 53-year-old brother, who has autism and is nearly nonverbal, has supported him because she knows him so well.
“A TCM who is not embedded, I fear, would not have that first-hand knowledge of him,” she said. “I believe the proposals break the essential links. I’m aware of the conflict of interest concerns, but I’d like to provide informed consent to keep my TCM embedded at the service provider. It should be our choice.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Julie-DeMarco-IDD-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

(Josh Merchant/The Beacon)A large majority of Jackson County voters have cast ballots to recall County Executive Frank White Jr. Preliminary results from Sept. 30 reveal 85% of voters supported the recall.
The open question is whether those results will stand up against ongoing legal challenges.
As soon as the vote is certified, White’s position will be considered immediately vacant and the campaign for the next county executive — which has been quietly happening behind the scenes for weeks — will kick into high gear.
But it’s possible that the election result may not be certified soon.
You may have noticed that this year’s recall election was scheduled for an unusual September election date — instead of the normal schedule in early April, June, August or November. (Special bond elections sometimes happen in February, as well.)
Elections are almost always on those regularly scheduled election days.
That could explain why voter turnout was relatively low. White was voted out of office yesterday by just 16% of Jackson County voters — compared to the 48% that turned out in the 2022 general election where White won reelection. In Kansas City specifically, turnout for the Frank White recall was even lower at 11%.
White and the Kansas City and Jackson County election boards argue that a Sept. 30 election is not just unusual, but illegal. And that could spell doom for the recall vote if a judge agrees with them.
A judge initially set the Sept. 30 date as a compromise with the recall campaign, which initially wanted to set the date for Aug. 26. The election boards argued in court that scheduling an August election on such short notice would disenfranchise military and overseas voters, who would not have received their ballots in time.
Now, White’s lawyer is asking the Missouri Supreme Court directly to stop the election boards from certifying the vote until they hear the case.
Here’s how that could affect Tuesday’s vote.
 Why did the election boards sue to reschedule the election?

The Jackson County Legislature initially ordered the election to be held on Aug. 26 after approving the ballot language in early July.
That’s based on a requirement set by an ordinance in 2023 that a special recall election be held within 60 days after signatures are filed.
But both the Kansas City Election Board and the Jackson County Election Board objected.
Those offices, which operate independently from White and the rest of county government, said that wasn’t enough time to prepare an election.
Military ballots would have needed to be mailed out just days later, and the boards would have had only about a week to prepare for absentee voting to begin.
DaRon McGee, chair of the county Legislature, was not sympathetic. McGee is one of the candidates vying to replace White now that he has been recalled.
“I am deeply concerned by reports that this election may not move forward on the timeline the law requires,” he told KCUR in a statement at the time. “The Legislature has done its part. We now look to the executive branch and the election board(s) to fulfill their roles.”
So the election boards sued.
They argued that Missouri law only allows counties to schedule elections on regular election days — in February, April, August or November, unless otherwise specified in a city or county charter. The Aug. 5 election was already underway, so they asked a judge to reschedule the election for Nov. 4.
Notably, every countywide Jackson County election for the past 27 years has occurred the Tuesday after the first Monday of February, April, August or November.
The same generally goes for elections in Kansas City, which also schedules City Council elections in April and June under the city’s charter. The only recent exceptions were elections related to the streetcar in October 2017, December 2012 and on a Friday in August 2008.
The Jackson County circuit judge, Marty W. Seaton, ultimately disagreed with the election boards.
He said that Missouri statute carves out an exception for elections that are authorized by a county’s charter. He argued that meant the 2023 Jackson County ordinance allowed a recall to happen outside of those dates in order to meet the 60-day requirement.
But he said an Aug. 26 election would still be too soon because military and overseas voters wouldn’t get their ballots in time, which would be unconstitutional. So he set a compromise date of Sept. 30.
 The legal battle continues

The election boards wanted to appeal, but a procedural move made that impossible.
Weeks earlier, while the case was playing out, White joined the lawsuit, arguing that the recall petition signatures themselves were illegal because some of the signature gatherers were not Missouri residents.
The judge heard arguments on the election date, but he set aside the issue of the out-of-state signature gatherers.
And because that issue remains unresolved, Seaton has not certified his ruling yet. That locked the election boards out of immediately appealing to a higher court.
So on Sept. 26, White’s lawyers tried a different maneuver.
They filed a lawsuit directly with the Western District Court of Appeals asking it to postpone the election until November because the election boards have not been able to appeal the circuit judge’s interpretation of the law.
“The election is imminent, and the trial court refused to certify its ruling for appeal,” White’s lawyers wrote. “Unless this Court intervenes, an unlawful election will proceed, wasting taxpayer resources, confusing voters, and undermining public confidence in Missouri elections.”
If this legal precedent stands, they argued, it would waste taxpayer dollars and confuse voters. If Jackson County can set an election for any day of the year, voters who are less tuned in to county politics may not even know that they’re missing an election.
The judge at the Western District Court of Appeals declined to take up the case. So now they’re taking it to the Missouri Supreme Court.
White’s lawyers filed a lawsuit against Seaton, the Jackson County circuit judge, just hours before the polls closed on Sept. 30, arguing that the election was illegally scheduled. They argued that proceeding with the election before the legal challenges are resolved would create chaos and distrust.
“Once results are released, the damage to public confidence cannot be undone,” the lawyers argued in their lawsuit filed with the Missouri Supreme Court. “Securing ballots until this Court resolves the legal issues preserves the integrity of both the vote and the judicial process.”
Phil LeVota, an attorney representing the recall effort in court who is also a candidate to become county executive if White is recalled, believes that Seaton’s ruling is strong enough to hold up in an appeal.
“He made a pretty good order where he really cited a lot of case law,” he said. “The charter says 60 days, and I’m going to err on the side of getting it in front of people sooner than later. And there’s no downside to having (the election) on Sept. 30.”
But White’s lawyers point to a 2002 precedent when a court ruled that a “floating timeframe” (like the 60-day requirement set by the 2023 ordinance) does not qualify as a specific election date authorized by law.
 Election outcome could be reversed

The Jackson County Circuit Court judge believes that the Sept. 30 election date was legal. But no other judges have given a legal opinion to back it up.
There are still a couple of legal avenues for White and the election boards to challenge the results.
The first option is the most recent Missouri Supreme Court case. White asked the judge to prevent the election boards from certifying the election results until the legal questions are resolved. That would keep White in office as county executive until the judges decide whether the election was legal.
The second option is that the election boards appeal the case once the circuit judge certifies his ruling. At that point, the Western District Court of Appeals — and potentially the Missouri Supreme Court — would hear the case and decide whether Seaton was correct in setting the election for Sept. 30.
The third option is for White to challenge the election results by suing the election boards. He could argue that there is reason to believe the election was unlawfully administered, and he could cite the election boards’ own argument in court earlier this year that Sept. 30 was not a legal date for an election.
If any of those judges decides that Sept. 30 was an illegal date to hold an election, the court could order another election for a redo. At this point, that likely would not happen until April 2026.
This wouldn’t be the first time that a ballot question had to go to voters for a redo.
In November 2022, Missouri voters voted on a constitutional amendment to force Kansas City to increase its level of police funding from 20% of its budget to 25%.
That constitutional amendment, put on the ballot by the Missouri General Assembly, passed by a wide margin — nearly two-thirds of Missourians voted “yes.”
But then the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that the ballot language was misleading. So a judge struck down the measure and ordered a new election with updated ballot language.
It still passed, but by a much smaller margin — by about 24,000 votes, or 2.2%.
With these legal questions looming, a messy scenario rests on the horizon.
Imagine that the election boards certify the vote later this week or next week. The county executive position is vacated, and the county Legislature appoints a replacement.
Meanwhile, the appeals court or the Missouri Supreme Court takes up White’s case about whether Sept. 30 was a legal date to hold an election.
And suppose they rule in White’s favor — that elections must be scheduled only on days that are specifically outlined by Missouri statute or the county charter.
That would mean that legally, White never should have been removed from office. And Jackson County would then have two county executives.
LeVota believes the circuit judge’s ruling is compelling enough that an appeals court or the state Supreme Court would back it up. But he acknowledged the possibility of a political crisis as a result of the ongoing litigation around the recall.
“The appeals court could come back,” LeVota said, “and say, ‘You know what, we don’t think the trial judge was right. We think it should have been a November election. We’re throwing that entire election out, and we’ll have to do a new one.’ That could definitely, definitely happen.”

In a joint press conference held Wednesday morning, hours after Congress missed the deadline to pass a federal budget, all six of the state’s Democratic representatives expressed concerns about rising health care costs, specifically the exclusion of an extension to the Affordable Care Act tax credits in Republican budget proposals. 
“We hear Republicans over and over all saying that they want to restore the ACA [Affordable Care Act] tax credits,” said U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City). “Put it on the floor, and we can end this tomorrow.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We are here because at some point you’ve got to fight for your constituents,” said U.S. Rep Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor). “Our colleagues appear that they’d rather shut down the government than make health care more affordable and address the affordability crisis we’re all hearing about every day.”
Each representative on the call described the rapidly rising health care premiums for their constituents. Those costs have become a defining issue for Democrats from across the country as federal funds expire. 
“This is a spinning out of control reality for our state, and it’s not acceptable,” said U.S. Rep Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham). “Michigan families expect us to do our jobs, and that means passing a responsible budget. That means holding the line on rising health care costs.”
They also pushed back against claims by GOP leadership, including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, that health care benefits were going to benefit illegal immigrants.
“Instead of sitting down and talking about the issues, they’re distracting with this lie,” said U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids).
Members of Congress on the call were also critical of their Republican colleagues for what they called a lack of effort to negotiate or work towards a responsible budget. 
“My colleagues not showing up yesterday, standing on the House floor was very shocking to me as they motioned to just adjourn,” U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said. 
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), who voted against a continuing resolution put forward by Republicans, shared similar concerns to her House colleagues in a press release, writing, “Since July, I have been very clear: any conversation about my vote needs to start with health care. President Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ will result in every single Michigander either losing their health care or paying more than they already have.”

Trump has said that instead of temporary furloughs of non-essential federal workers during the government shutdown, his administration will pursue permanent layoffs of these government employees. The actual ramifications of this have yet to become clear, but the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that around 750,000 government workers will be furloughed due to the shutdown. 
Dingell addressed the impacts of the shutdown on federal workers, saying, “None of us makes this decision lightly, but in the end, we’re gonna protect the people that we represent.”
U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) added, “We cannot blink, we cannot compromise on providing health care to the people that need this care, life saving treatments, life saving medications.”
Michigan’s U.S. House Republicans have placed the blame for the shutdown squarely on the shoulders of Democrats in social media posts, but Democrats in their press conference called it a “Republican shutdown,” noting that the GOP currently controls the White House and both houses of Congress.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uscapitolstop2025-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

Jim Banks introduced a bipartisan bill this week to ensure the United States Postal Service will give certain communities in Indiana their own ZIP codes, making mail delivery clearer and more efficient.
Fellow Sens. Michael Bennett, D-Colorado; Markwayne Mullin, R-Oklahoma; and John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, are original cosponsors of the legislation, which includes several other states.
“I’ve heard from too many Hoosiers frustrated by mail delays and mix-ups. Our growing communities deserve their own ZIP codes so families and businesses can count on reliable service,” Banks said in a press release.
Noblesville Mayor Chris Jensen supports the effort to assign single, unique ZIP codes for communities.
“This will eliminate longstanding address confusion for businesses, residents, and newcomers by saving time, reducing errors, and improving local services. The clear boundaries also help ensure tax collections are accurately divided among the communities they serve,” he said. “I applaud Senator Banks for introducing a bill to give cities a dedicated zip code, provide clarity, and have a lasting impact on residents and business owners.”
The bill directs the Postal Service to designate single, unique ZIP codes for the following communities in Indiana:

Carmel, Indiana
Lawrence, Indiana
Noblesville, Indiana
Westfield, Indiana
Zionsville, Indiana

A release from Banks included supportive statements from other area leadership.
“We have people who live in Zionsville, but they have a Brownsburg, Lebanon or Whitestown ZIP code, so this bill will help foster community by reflecting our true boundaries,” said Zionsville Mayor John Stehr. “It will also simplify services and make emergency response more efficient by eliminating confusion over who has jurisdiction for a particular location.” 
Lawrence Mayor Deb Whitfield said “having our own ZIP code is more than just a number on mail. It’s about identity, efficiency, and opportunity. It gives our city the recognition it deserves, improves services for residents and businesses, and strengthens the sense of community we all share. Thus, this step ensures that the people of Lawrence, that I serve are better connected, better represented, and better supported.”

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana domestic violence shelters doubled the number of beds available for emergency housing in recent years with millions in state funding.
The shelters went from offering 335 beds statewide in 2021 to 663 beds in 2025. Louisiana governors and legislators gave an additional $7 million per year, starting July 1, 2023, and continuing through June 30, 2026, which allowed for the expansion, said Mariah Stidham Wineski, executive director for the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
Louisiana shelters typically turn down approximately 2,500 requests for emergency housing annually. But over the past 12 months, they have been able to meet more of the demand, only turning down 1,300 requests. 
“That investment did completely change the landscape of these services,” Wineski said at a Louisiana Senate Select Committee on Women and Children meeting Monday. 
With the new state funding, advocates opened five shelters and 11 outreach offices for day services in rural parishes. They also expanded seven existing shelters, six child advocacy centers and six legal advocacy offices for victims. Counseling and domestic violence prevention programs were also added with the money, Wineski said. 
In total, the state now has 21 domestic violence shelters run by 16 organizations. 
Before 2023, approximately 90% of the funding for domestic violence survivor services came from the federal government and totaled $7 million annually. Another 10% came from state marriage license fees and a grant from Louisiana’s criminal justice reinvestment fund. The shelters also do private fundraising.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Domestic violence is more destructive in Louisiana than in almost any other state. Louisiana has ranked in the top five states for homicides between intimate partners since 1997, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.

One out of 100 Louisiana residents – approximately 45,000 people – had a spouse or dating partner threaten them with a firearm in the past year, Wineski said. 
There were 181 deaths in Louisiana that were the result of intimate partner violence between 2020 and 2022, according to a state health department report. More than 65% of the victims were women, and three-quarters of the deaths were caused by a firearm. 

The health department started monitoring domestic violence deaths three years ago through a new state domestic violence fatality review panel, which studies specific cases of domestic violence homicides. Based on its investigations, the panel makes recommendations on how to prevent domestic violence deaths. 
While the new state funding is appreciated, Wineski said some of it has had to backfill federal funding that has been cut. Over the past five years, Louisiana domestic violence shelters have lost $4 million in federal money. 
Access to affordable, interim housing continues to be a barrier to victims leaving their abusive partners. Emergency shelters take approximately 45 days to house survivors, and many people need another temporary place to stay before they fully independent, Wineski said. 

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides money for one to two years of rental assistance for domestic violence survivors. Wineski’s organization also uses an $800,000 annual grant it receives from the state to provide housing assistance on a short-term basis for people leaving shelters. 
But the $800,000 is at risk of going away, Wineski said. The money comes from Louisiana’s criminal justice reinvestment fund, which was tied to savings achieved through drops in the state prison population that occurred when Gov. John Bel Edwards was in office. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has sought to undo many of the criminal sentencing changes Edwards made, which could reverse the prison population drops. With Landry’s support, lawmakers have enacted longer prison sentences that could dramatically increase the number of state prisoners. 

Wineski said she hopes legislators will find another source for the money.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PXL_20240223_230001247-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)A proposed ballot measure to allow voters to decide whether Nevada should have an independent redistricting commission will be withdrawn, say organizers, following a court challenge by lawyers aligned with the Democratic Party.
Marc Elias, the nation’s most prominent Democratic election lawyer, on Monday announced his firm, Elias Law Group, along with Bravo Schrager, a Nevada firm also aligned with Democrats, are representing a Nevada voter named Juan Medina and challenging an independent redistricting commission ballot question proposed by Vote Nevada PAC.
In response, the political action committee plans to withdraw its proposal, citing an inability to fund a legal defense.
Independent redistricting commission, nonpartisan voting ballot measures proposed in Nevada

“The sponsors of the independent redistricting commission ballot question are disappointed that Nevada’s Democratic Party has once again silenced Nevadans by blocking our right to discuss redistricting reform as a community,” said Vote Nevada PAC Executive Director Sandra Cosgrove in a statement to the Nevada Current. “Feeling entitled to draw our district maps does not give the Democratic Party the right to gerrymander our voices into silence.”
In 2024, a similar ballot measure to form an independent redistricting commission was deemed “legally deficient” by the Nevada Supreme Court because it did not establish a revenue source to pay for the new public body. Cosgrove was a part of that effort, which was filed by Fair Maps Nevada PAC. The legal challenge against Fair Maps was also filed by Elias Law Group and Bravo Schrager.
The complaint filed against this year’s proposal argues that the “operative text” of the ballot measure is identical to the one two years ago, and therefore still violates the state constitution’s prohibition on unfunded mandates. Attorneys also argue that, because the organizers of the new measure were involved in the nearly identical measure that was thrown out, they cannot resubmit the measure under a new PAC.
Bravo Schrager declined to comment Tuesday. Elias Law Group did not respond to a request for comment.
Cosgrove has previously said she disagrees with the Nevada Supreme Court ruling regarding the unfunded mandate, saying it is applied selectively.
In her statement Tuesday, she said the Vote Nevada organizers plan to submit a new petition “that directly addresses this misinterpretation of our Constitution.”
Vote Nevada last month filed a second proposed ballot measure to amend the state’s Voter Bill of Rights to include a provision that could force the two major political parties to open their primaries. That proposal was not challenged in court, and the PAC plans to move forward with it, according to Cosgrove.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PXL_20211115_204204863-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

The organization was already absent in Wyoming, North Dakota and Mississippi.","BATON ROUGE, La. — Planned Parenthood on Tuesday shut down its two clinics in Louisiana over what the organization said were mounting financial and political challenges that made operating in the state no longer possible after more than 40 years.
The closures make Louisiana the most populous of just four states with no Planned Parenthood locations. Louisiana joins Wyoming, North Dakota and Mississippi as states where the organization is absent.
The exit underlines the pressures on Planned Parenthood as it warns of wider closures nationwide in the face of Medicaid funding cuts in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill. The organization is also halting advocacy work in Louisiana, where the state’s Republican leaders have cheered on the closures.
The closures were “not the result of a lack of need” but rather the outcome of “relentless political assaults that have made it impossible for us to continue operating sustainably in Louisiana,” said Melaney Linton, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast.
Supporters have said the closures will have a detrimental impact on Louisiana, where Planned Parenthood has never been licensed to perform abortions in the state but did provide other medical care services to nearly 11,000 patients last year at its Baton Rouge and New Orleans clinics. 
Advocates and medical professionals fear that the organization’s departure will further exacerbate reproductive health care in a state that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows already has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. In addition, a March report by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office noted the state’s significant OB-GYN shortage and health care deserts.
Trump’s spending and tax plan instructs the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to certain abortion providers. While the organization is seeking to have its funding restored through the courts, Planned Parenthood officials have warned that around one-third of roughly 600 clinics could be forced to close.

Earlier this year, five clinics in California and eight in Iowa and Minnesota shut their doors. In the past week, the Wisconsin affiliate announced that it would stop providing abortion and the Arizona affiliate said it would halt Medicaid-funded services.
“This is a win for babies, a win for mothers, and a win for LIFE!” Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry posted on social media Tuesday.
Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of services, including cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.
In Louisiana, a state with one of the nation’s highest poverty rates, 60% of patients at Planned Parenthood clinics used Medicaid. Last year, the clinics in Louisiana provided nearly 30,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections, 14,400 visits for birth control, 1,800 cancer screenings and 655 ultrasounds.
Nearly a decade ago, Jordyn Martin said she turned to Planned Parenthood when she couldn’t afford medical services anywhere else. While at the clinic, a doctor offered Martin a free HIV test. A week later, she was diagnosed with the virus.
“Planned Parenthood saved my life,” said Martin, who went on to volunteer for the organization.
Outside of the New Orleans Planned Parenthood clinic Tuesday, several people gathered and brought thank-you notes to the organization that has spent four decades in Louisiana. Inside the building, up until close, staff worked to connect patients with alternative health care providers.
Starting Wednesday, calls to Planned Parenthood numbers in Louisiana were being transferred to the nearest location in Texas or Arkansas.
Michelle Erenberg, head of a New Orleans-based abortion rights group named LIFT, said people have been contacting her for help to find new clinics. She said it was important to connect people with providers but worries about the strain it will put on clinics that are already short-staffed.
“Whether patients are going to be able to get appointments quickly, or access all of the services that Planned Parenthood provided, is unknown at this point,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01095411/AP25273767476432.jpg,,,2025-10-01 11:59:07.028943

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The national museum and memorial commemorating the Oklahoma City bombing will remain open despite the federal government’s partial shutdown.
Though it is affiliated with the National Park Service, the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum’s operating hours won’t be affected because it does not receive annual appropriations from state, federal or local governments, officials said.
However, National Park Service rangers will not be on site during the shutdown, which began Wednesday after Congress was unable to reach a stopgap funding agreement ahead of the new federal fiscal year. 
The memorial, which is located at the site of the 1995 bombing, commemorates the country’s worst act of domestic terrorism that killed 168 people, including 19 children, and injured about 850.
In April 1995, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb was detonated outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested and convicted for their roles in the attack. McVeigh was later executed.Nichols is serving life in prison. A third man, Michael Fortier, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for not reporting knowledge of the plot.
During the duration of the government shutdown, the Memorial and Museum plans to provide federal employees free admission to the museum if they present a valid federal identification.
The Museum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Farmers Union)LINCOLN — After having the biggest gross domestic product loss among states at the start of this year, Nebraska tied for the sixth-highest GDP gains during the second quarter. 
The latest report from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis shared that Nebraska’s GDP rose roughly 5.2% in April, May and June. The real GDP nationally rose 3.8%, following slower growth of 0.5% in the first quarter. GDP represents the total market value of goods and services produced during a specific time period.

“This report points to the underlying strength of Nebraska’s economy — one driven by agriculture, value-added processes, biofuels, manufacturing, financial services, healthcare and other key components,” Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. 
Nebraska’s GDP fell 6.1% in the first quarter of 2025, a previous bureau report shared, joining Iowa in posting the biggest declines during that period. Falling row-crop prices were a big contributor, as products like wheat, corn and soybeans make up a large portion of Nebraska’s agricultural output.
Row-crop prices are still hurting, according to Ernie Goss, a regional economist and professor at Creighton University. But prices on other agricultural products — namely livestock — have continued to strengthen. 
With Nebraska being a largely “ag independent” state, Goss said shifts in the agricultural industry can have a larger impact on the state’s economy compared to others. 
“You live with the volatility, and you die with the volatility,” Goss said.

Goss pointed to several other factors that contributed to Nebraska’s GDP growth. He said construction and health care spending was up during the second quarter. He noted high-tourism events like the College World Series also likely played a role. 
Pillen said the federal report confirms that Nebraska’s economy is stable and argued lawmakers should use that advantage to improve the state’s tax system. State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said in the governor’s press release that he believes the state’s recent income tax reductions and property tax relief contributed to the growth. 
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte said, “The latest GDP growth for Nebraska is further evidence that the Nebraska way of lowering taxes and growing our traditional values is working.” 
However, Goss said Nebraska’s second quarter growth may have been an “anomaly.” He said it’s common for states seeing a period of economic slowdown to bounce back in the next quarter, but he said there are signs the third quarter might not be so positive. 
A Creighton economics report released Wednesday indicated that Nebraska’s business conditions fell this fall and found that the overall value of the state’s exported goods in 2025 is not as high as it was at this point in 2024.
Goss said China, which was once a big buyer of Nebraska pork and soybeans, has not made a purchase since May. He speculated that this may be in retaliation for the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. 
While Goss said Nebraska’s GDP may not fall into the negative percentages next quarter, he doesn’t expect the growth to be as significant as 5.2%.
“It won’t be negative, but it won’t be the strongest,” Goss said.

WILMINGTON – Breast Cancer Awareness Month is underway, and the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC) is putting the spotlight on the lifesaving power of self-awareness and advocacy. Breast cancer remains a pressing concern in Delaware. In 2025, an estimated 1,210 new cases will be diagnosed among Delaware residents. The state’s rates are higher than the national average, especially among underserved populations.
The Unexpected Connection
At DBCC, the mission has always been about reaching individuals with education, screenings, and support. But sometimes, chance encounters carry the biggest impact.
That was the case for Lissette Rivera, DBCC’s Women’s Health Screening Manager, during a visit to an imaging center earlier this year. Rivera was there to assist a scheduled patient who required interpretation services. Unable to spot her patient in the waiting room, Rivera sent a quick text: “Where are you?”
Looking around, she noticed a young Latina woman standing alone, clearly anxiously awaiting her appointment. Rivera approached, assuming she was the patient. She wasn’t—but she was also in desperate need of interpretation services for her own upcoming appointment.  The young woman’s self-breast exam led to the discovery of a lump forcing her to bravely advocate for herself to get breast cancer screening before the age of 40. Without hesitation, after learning more about her story and reason for screening Rivera offered to stay and assist this woman as well.
Two Appointments, Two Outcomes
Rivera’s decision led to two very different outcomes that day.

The scheduled patient, the reason for Rivera’s visit, received wonderful news: a clear screening.
The 34-year-old woman she met by chance, received devastating news: a breast cancer diagnosis.

That diagnosis came the very week the woman was preparing to celebrate her 35th birthday in early September.
What could have been a lonely, frightening experience became a moment of compassion. DBCC, through Rivera, was there immediately to offer support and begin guiding the young woman through the next steps of treatment and survivorship care.
The Power of a Chance Encounter
Since that day, DBCC has continued to walk alongside the newly diagnosed patient, helping her navigate the complexities of surgery, treatment, and the emotional toll of cancer.
“This story is a powerful reminder,” says Lissette Rivera, “that advocating for yourself—even when it feels uncomfortable—can save lives. And when someone is willing to step in and connect you with the right resources, that support can make all the difference.”
The coalition encourages Delawareans to prioritize screenings and self-advocacy, and reminds the community that DBCC patient navigators are available in English, Spanish, and Haitian-Creole. To schedule a mammogram or seek support, call (302) 672-6435.
“Get screened for breast cancer,” Rivera urges. “Early detection saves lives—one of them could be yours, or someone you love.”
DBCC’s Statewide Role
With headquarters in Wilmington and offices in Kent and Sussex Counties, DBCC is the only organization providing comprehensive breast cancer support services across Delaware. Its work includes:

Screening & Education: Free or reduced-cost mammograms, outreach programs, and community health fairs.
Survivorship & Support: Peer Mentor Program linking newly diagnosed patients with survivors, plus bilingual and culturally tailored outreach.
Advocacy & Empowerment: Partnerships with the National Breast Cancer Coalition to push for research and an eventual end to breast cancer.

“Our vision is to create a community where every person diagnosed with breast cancer is a survivor, and fear and doubt are replaced with knowledge and hope,” said Francesca Vogel, DBCC CEO
Community Spotlight: Dewey Goes Pink
The state’s largest awareness event, Dewey Goes Pink, returns Saturday, October 4, drawing more than 5,000 participants to the beach for a 5K walk/run, music, and a post-race feast. Last year, the event raised $365,000, bringing its 13-year total to nearly $2 million for DBCC programs.
Other events throughout the month include walks, golf outings, art exhibits, film screenings, and wellness gatherings—all fueling education, screenings, and survivor services year-round.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Fifteen years after a 1,600-bed private prison in west central Minnesota shuttered, the Trump administration is considering reopening the facility as an immigrant detention center. 
Internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement records obtained by the Washington Post in August named the vacant Prairie Correctional Facility in Appleton as a piece of the plan to expand immigrant detention capacity to more than 100,000 beds by the end of the year — about a 66% increase from April. 
Faith leaders from across the state joined Appleton residents in a prayer vigil in protest of the prison’s potential reopening Tuesday. One resident, with supporters in tow, delivered a letter to local leaders, signed by a number of faith leaders and immigrant rights organizations, opposing the detention center plans and requesting transparency. 
“Appleton, frankly, is going to be a real hotbed of resistance,” said Rev. Daniel Romero of Disciples Public Presence, a social justice advocacy arm of the Disciples of Christ church.

The documents obtained by the Post were preliminary plans and were still in flux at the time of reporting, but the prison’s owners, CoreCivic, and ICE have not denied the reports. 
Appleton City Administrator John Olinger told MPR News in August that CoreCivic was “aggressively pursuing” a contract with ICE.
ICE and its enforcement and detention tactics have become a flashpoint as the Trump administration attempts a mass deportation campaign, while human rights activists and civil libertarians demand more scrutiny and accountability. 
On Tuesday, for instance, U.S. District Court Judge William Young, a Reagan-appointee, slammed the Trump administration for using deportations as a way to stamp out the free speech rights of immigrant pro-Palestinian demonstrators. He called the conduct of the administration unconstitutional and “a thing virtually unknown to our constitutional tradition.” 
In a statement to the Reformer, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity.” The Republican megalaw passed in July boosted funding for immigrant detention and deportation by $176 billion, with $45 billion set aside for expanding detention capacity. 
CoreCivic spokesman Brian Todd said the company “continue(s) to explore opportunities with our government partners for which our Prairie Correctional Facility could be a viable solution.”

Prairie Correctional Facility was Minnesota’s only private prison until it shut down in 2010. A state law passed by the DFL-Legislature in 2023 bans private prison contracts at the state level — but won’t impact the federal government’s efforts to establish a private detention facility in Minnesota. 
The resistance is certainly present — if not widespread — in Appleton, which Trump won in 2024 by 27 points. As dozens of people gathered to sing and pray together in the green space next to Appleton City Hall, a truck circled the block with an American flag flying and a “WELCOME ICE” sign. 
One woman stopped by to heckle the group.
Speakers at the vigil cited moral and religious opposition to Trump’s increased immigration enforcement. They criticized CoreCivic over allegations of violence, sexual abuse and understaffing at its facilities. And they called on local officials to meet with local residents and faith leaders before approving the reopening of the facility.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250927_0312-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 10:57:16.497556

The cost of a single subway, bus or paratransit ride will hit $3 for the first time come January, after the MTA board on Tuesday approved the latest in a series of every-other-year increases.
The MTA had avoided hitting the 3-buck milestone in recent years, despite previous proposals to reach the mark that stretched back nearly a decade. 
MTA Chairperson and Chief Executive Janno Lieber acknowledged that any bump in fares is “always painful,” while contrasting what amounts to a 2% annual increase with double-digit fare hikes elsewhere in the country. 
“As we always say, transit is one of the things that makes NY affordable,” Lieber said. “Let’s start talking about housing and childcare and the other things that are clearly the center of that affordability crisis.”
Lieber pointed to a double-digit fare increase last year at New Jersey Transit and at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, where a 21.5% fare hike kicked in Sept. 14.
Officials also noted how transportation costs are lower in New York City than in almost all major U.S. cities — and flagged how the fare increase could have sent the cost of a single ride surging to $3.14.
“If we had actually followed the rate of inflation over the last two years, we would be asking you for a 24-cent increase to the base fare today,” Jessie Lazaruz, the agency’s deputy chief for commercial ventures, told the board prior to the 11-0 approval, with two members abstaining.
Instead, the MTA stuck to a pattern of what agency officials call “small and predictable” fare increases every other year.
Accompanying bumps will come for reduced-fare bus, subway and Access-A-Ride service, with the cost per ride going up 5 cents to $1.50 and the cost of express bus service that links the boroughs with Manhattan going from $7 to $7.25. The last fare increase came in 2023, when it went from $2.75 to the current $2.90 mark.
The vote also locked in a fare cap under the tap-and-go OMNY fare-payment system, ensuring that riders will pay no more than $35 for rides within a seven-day period, while reduced-fare riders will be capped at $17.50. That will permanently replace the unlimited-ride options available under the 7-Day and 30-Day MetroCard, as well unlimited passes for express buses.
The MTA earlier this week dropped the seven-day fare cap a buck from an earlier proposal of $36, citing the response of riders during the six-week public comment period that followed the July unveiling of the fare proposal.
“That feedback has helped us modify our proposals,” Lazarus said.
Transit officials said the increases — which will also kick in on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road — are essential for the agency’s bottom line, with two-thirds of the agency’s operating expenses going to labor costs associated with its 70,000 employees. 
“It’s real simple, 70% of the MTA’s operating budget goes to pay their workers their medical coverage, their benefits and their pensions,” Lieber said. “Their wages increase, on average, between 3% and 4% a year, it varies a little bit — we now have a 2% per year fare increase.”
The Citizens Budget Commission noted that labor also has a part to play in the MTA’s financial well-being.
Adam Schmidt, a senior research associate with the non-partisan think tank, cited ongoing labor talks with Long Island Rail Road workers and a looming labor showdown next spring with the Transport Workers Union. 
“Both sides should pursue work role changes that increase productivity and operational flexibility so the MTA can continue to provide reliable service and fair wage increases,” he said.
Lieber also acknowledged that the ‘pizza principle’ — a theory that the cost of a subway ride and the slice of pizza should be about the same — no longer holds.
“I don’t know what the pizza principle would dictate at this point because folks have told me that we’re less than a slice in many cases,” he said. “Certainly at Totonno’s or some of the other great Brooklyn pizzerias that I favor, the slice has gone north of $3.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/042025_omny-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 10:57:16.497556

“As part of our ongoing restructuring, we have adjusted our upcoming schedule to focus on our strongest markets,” the airline said in a statement. “This includes the difficult decision to discontinue service at Hartford (BDL), effective Oct. 31, 2025, and Minneapolis (MSP), effective Dec. 1, 2025.”
The airline said it would reach out to affected passengers to provide refunds.
“We thank our airport, business and community partners in Connecticut and Minnesota for their support over the years,” the airline said.
The Connecticut Airport Authority, which operates Bradley International Airport, released a statement.
“Spirit Airlines has been an integral part of Bradley International Airport’s airline network over the last eight years,” it reads. “We thank Spirit Airlines for their investment in the Hartford market and will be ready to welcome them back when their current circumstances change.”
Connecticut Airport Authority Public Information Officer Brian Spyros said passengers will still have other options.
“It’s also important to note that Spirit has been offering year-round or seasonal service to Fort Lauderdale, Myrtle Beach, Detroit, Nashville and Orlando,” Spyros said. “Other airlines here at the airport already fly to those same destinations — so there will be no loss of nonstop routes for passengers from BDL in the wake of Spirit’s departure.”
The budget airline filed for its second bankruptcy in August, saying it was determined to keep flying. Last week, Spirit announced its plans to furlough nearly 2,000 flight attendants.

(Photo courtesy of Maine Family Planning)Maine Family Planning will shutter its primary care practice by the end of the month after being blocked from accepting Medicaid funds.
The state’s largest reproductive health care provider was one of two Maine organizations that can no longer claim Medicaid reimbursements due to a provision in the budget reconciliation bill that targeted certain providers that offered abortions (although the federal funds cannot and were never used to fund abortion services).
That meant a loss of $2 million in annual revenue for Maine Family Planning, which operates health care centers in 18 locations across the state. Primary care services were available in three of those locations. 
Maine Family Planning filed a lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to block the law from applying to the organization, but Judge Lance Walker — who was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term — denied that request. Maine Family Planning appealed to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston requesting a response by September 30.
“We have been very clear with the courts that without intervention and without the ability to bill Medicaid, we will have to end our primary care practices in Ellsworth, Presque Isle and Houlton by October 31,” said Olivia Pennington, the group’s director of advocacy and community engagement. 
“Those are all federally designated medically underserved areas. So we know already that folks have difficulty accessing health care, especially primary care, in those areas.”
Federal judge OKs Medicaid defunding of Maine’s largest reproductive health care provider

Walker wrote in his late August decision that the health care provider failed to demonstrate the irreparable harm it claimed to face, despite attorneys for Maine Family Planning warning about the impending shuttering of primary care and having to lay off providers in rural areas where health care is already scarce.
Maine Family Planning’s primary care practice was modeled to serve patients on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, so without those federal funds, it is no longer sustainable, the organization said in a statement. Over the next 30 days, it will notify patients that they are being discharged and will work with them to help identify other primary care providers in the region that are accepting new patients. 
 “The cruel and dangerous law has put us in an impossible situation,” said George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning. “Discharging and turning away vulnerable patients strikes at the very heart of MFP’s reputation as a trusted community provider that has been able to serve patients of any means for more than 50 years.”
The provider is still seeing patients who need family planning care, regardless of insurance status, for as long as that is possible. 
Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the other Maine provider blocked from accepting Medicaid funds, is still continuing to see patients in four health care centers across the state, regardless of their insurance or ability to pay. The organization recently started canvassing communities in southern Maine to let residents know about the broad health services they offer.

Alaskans have occasionally participated in the parade in New York City, which is celebrating its 99th anniversary this year, but the company believes this will be the first time that the state will be represented by a float in the event.
The announcement came on one of the last days of Holland America’s summer cruise ship operations in Alaska’s capital city. Juneau will continue receiving occasional large cruise ships through October.
“The float will be named simply ‘The Land of Glaciers, Wildlife and Wonder,’” said Leanne Jones with Holland America official during a ceremony announcing the float and a $5,000 donation to Trail Mix, a local trail-building nonprofit in Juneau.
“This marks the first time Alaska will be featured in the iconic holiday event, and the first time Holland America Line has ever participated in this parade,” Jones said. The parade is scheduled to start at 4:30 a.m. Alaska time on Thursday, Nov. 27.
A rendering displayed Monday shows a howling wolf, black bear and a moose at the back of the float. The main platform is a glacier and river with leaping salmon. 
“Well, that’s a pretty exciting announcement,” said Juneau Mayor Beth Weldon. “And you know, after Macy’s parade, we do have a Fourth of July parade in Juneau.”

Kaela Berg, DFL-Burnsville, listened to testimony on a mental health education bill in 2024. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Rep. Kaela Berg, DFL-Burnsville, announced Wednesday that she’s running to replace U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for the U.S. Senate.
Berg is a single mom, flight attendant and union activist.
“I have had to fight to be in every room that I have been in,” Berg said in a Reformer interview.
She was first elected to the Minnesota House in 2020 after winning a south metro swing district race.
The south metro 2nd Congressional District is Minnesota’s most competitive. In 2024, over $13.3 million was spent on the race, most of which supported Craig’s campaign, down from over $31 million in 2022, according to campaign spending tracker OpenSecrets. Craig turned the district blue in 2018 and has won close races ever since, widening her victory in 2024 despite the Republicans’ victory nationwide.
Minnesota Sen. Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, and former DFL Sen. Matt Little are also running for the seat, as are Republicans Sen. Eric Pratt, R-Prior Lake, and Tyler Kistner, the 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee who lost to Craig twice.
Berg is part of a small group of working class state legislators — a 2024 study from Duke and Loyola Chicago found that less than 2% of state lawmakers nationwide come from working class jobs, dwarfed by the 50% of the labor force in working class jobs. Berg, whose parents are retired college professors, does not have a college degree.
She’s been a flight attendant for 22 years and is a lifelong Minnesotan, according to a campaign press release. She currently works for Endeavor Air, a subsidiary of Delta, and has held various leadership positions in her local union, including union steward and vice president.
Berg has pushed legislation to expand funding for school mental health personnel, and another bill to increase the criminal penalties for so-called straw purchases of firearms, which is when someone buys a gun for someone else who isn’t legally allowed to own one. Her district endured the shooting and killing of two Burnsville police officers and a paramedic last year by someone who was heavily armed via straw purchases.
Berg said that her policy focus in Washington would be on lowering living costs, strengthening public schools and stopping “attacks on health care” from the Republicans’ “egregious agenda.”
Lowering the cost of essentials is “easier than most people think,” Berg said: tackle “unfair tariffs”; make sure the wealthiest 1% and corporations pay their fair share in taxes; and invest in health care, housing and utilities.
“There are too many hardworking families in this district who feel like they’re falling further behind while Washington politicians look out for the wealthy and well-connected,” said Berg in the release announcing her campaign.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/working-class.jpeg,,,2025-10-01 09:57:58.795050

Visitors can use hotels, roads, lookouts, trails, open-air memorials and other sites but there won’t be visitor services, plan states.
The post Yellowstone, Grand Teton ordered to remain partly open as government shutdown begins appeared first on WyoFile .","The Department of Interior on Tuesday ordered Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks to remain partly open as the federal government shut down at midnight over a budget impasse in Congress.
“Park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” according to the “lapse plan.” But visitor centers and other facilities that are usually locked after business hours will be closed, according to the agency’s September 2025 contingency plan posted Tuesday evening.
Staffing will be reduced “based on the assumption that the NPS is conducting no park operations and providing no visitor services,” the plan states.
Parks will begin notifying the public today regarding operations, services and which facilities are open or closed. Those notifications could clarify some elements of the plan that may appear confusing, including what visitor services will or will not be provided.
Whether “accessible areas” will have basic services appears to depend on whether fees are collected there.
“Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks.” The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks
“Basic visitor services” to maintain restrooms, sanitation, trash collection, road maintenance, campgrounds, law enforcement, emergency personnel and access through entrance gates will be provided at sites that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, the plan states.
At Yellowstone, campgrounds will be open, WyoFile has learned. Emergency services parkwide, however, will be limited.
Hotels operated by concessionaires can remain open with the blessing of a park’s superintendent and approval by the Interior Department’s assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks.
The Park Service will not provide road or trail conditions and will not maintain websites or social media except for emergencies, the plan states. The Park Service will not open parks that don’t have “accessible areas,” according to the plan.
Former supervisors protest
The plan was put in place over the objections of 42 former park superintendents, including former Yellowstone Superintendent Mike Finley. They wrote Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on Thursday under The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks’ letterhead.
“[W]e write to you with an urgent appeal to protect our parks and public lands by closing them if a government shutdown occurs,” the letter reads. “Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks: Iconic symbols cut down and vandalized, trash piled up, habitats destroyed, and visitor safety jeopardized.”

The Park Service plan allows closure of areas with sensitive natural, cultural, historic or archaeological resources that can’t be protected — if the closure is approved by the assistant secretary.
The plan expects 9,296 of 14,500 employees to be furloughed,leaving 5,204 workers — about 36% — to run the parks.
In addition to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, the agency operates Devil’s Tower National Monument, Fossil Butte National Monument, the Fort Laramie National Historic Site, the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway and Bighorn Canyon National Recreational Area in Wyoming.
One wildlife tour operator on Thursday shared a letter to Wyoming’s congressional delegation saying uncertainty over a shutdown was plaguing his business.
“Our work, and the experience we provide to travelers from all over the world, relies deeply on the operation, maintenance, and stewardship of our public lands and the National Park Service,” wrote Taylor Phillips, owner of Jackson Hole EcoTour Adventures. “We have already seen the impacts of workforce cuts,” he wrote, worrying about “further reductions that would only weaken the guest experience.
“And when that experience suffers, visitors go elsewhere.”
In 2024, national park sites in Wyoming drew 8.1 million visitors, who spent $1.2 billion in the state, the agency reported Monday. That included $710 million in visitor spending for Yellowstone, $808 million for Grand Teton, $41.7 million for Devils Tower, $1.3 million for Fossil Butte and $1.4 million for Fort Laramie.
A glorious time
Some Yellowstone facilities were scheduled to remain open through Oct. 31, although many shut down for the season before that date due to weather. Whether that schedule changes with limited operations under the shutdown plan remains uncertain.
Plowing roads, for example, will not generally be allowed, according to the plan. Meantime, Yellowstone remains a magical place in the fall, a seasonal ranger said.
Bugling elk and fall colors draw crowds to Grand Teton and Yellowstone this time of year. 
“It’s just a glorious time to be here,” said John Kerr, who works in the summer in Lamar Valley. Now off duty, Kerr spoke for himself and not in any official capacity. “This is a time when bears are in hyperphagia — they are eating as much as possible to prepare themselves for a winter of hibernation. They are more visible.”

The Florida Department of Education reported that 444 titles were removed in some capacity across 16 counties in the state during the 2024-25 school year, down from 732 titles removed the school year before. In 2022-23, the state reported 386 removed titles.
In this, PEN’s fourth year of reporting, Florida ranked highest in the nation with 2,304 bans statewide of the 6,870 reported nationwide. Florida was responsible for 4,500 of the more than 10,000 books PEN reported the previous school year. 
The state reports books as removed when material has been discontinued in response to a parent or resident of the county and the data are reported by school districts.
PEN America’s dataset comprises school book bans reported to the organization and those covered in news media. The organizations cautions that its dataset is not comprehensive —  “there are likely additional school book bans that have not been reported.” It’s sum includes books that have been shelved pending review and those removed in response to direct or threatened action by government officials.
“Over the past four years, a misleading campaign to ‘protect children’ alongside advocacy for ‘parental rights’ has been weaponized to diminish students’ First Amendment rights in schools, sow distrust in librarians and educators, and diminish the ability of authors and illustrators to connect with their intended audiences,” PEN wrote in a news release.
The PEN database includes about 600 titles in Hillsborough County that are “banned pending investigation.”
The DOE list does not disclose any titles in Hillsborough County, for example, that have been removed.
The PEN list includes 500 materials in Union County “banned” in June 2025, although the DOE list does not include any titles removed in that county during the previous school year. 
Volusia County, in the PEN report, saw about 180 titles “banned pending investigation” and, per the DOE methodology, one title was removed during the previous school year, “The Kite Runner.”
The bulk of the state’s reported removals were in Clay County. PEN puts about 400 titles in jeopardy there, while the state lists about 280 removed titles in Clay County.

In August, PEN America celebrated a recent lawsuit by book authors and publishers challenging the state’s law removing books from classrooms and libraries. A federal trial judge ruled that the state’s law banning books deemed “pornographic” from school libraries is, in part, “overbroad and unconstitutional.”
Law banning school library books ruled ‘overbroad and unconstitutional’

“It is important to recognize that books available in schools, whether in a school or classroom library or as part of a curriculum, were selected by librarians and educators as part of the educational offerings to students,” PEN America wrote. “Book bans occur when those choices are overridden by school boards, administrators, teachers, or even politicians on the basis of a particular book’s content.”
PEN America credits Florida’s rate of removals to “the passage of multiple vague laws, direct pressure from local groups and elected officials, and threats to educators’ professional licenses if they fail to comply.”
Florida Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas, for example, has taken to social media to threaten Hillsborough County Superintendent Van Ayres over books available in that county’s catalog.
According to PEN, the most frequently banned book nationwide is “A Clockwork Orange” by Anthony Burgess with 23 instances. The next-most banned book is “Sold” by Patricia McCormick with 20. 
Nationwide, Stephen King is the most-banned author, followed by Ellen Hopkins, Stah J. Maas, Jodi Picoult, and Yusei Matsui. 
Lawmakers in 2024 acknowledged book challenges may’ve been out of control, calling abundant challenges by a small number of objectors “frivolous” when they passed a law limiting objections from non-parents to one per month. This school year was the first year that law was in effect.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)Nothing reminds you of the constantly-changing needs of humanity quite like a tornado ripping through your community. 
When the May 16 storm hit St. Louis, it devastated neighborhoods and left a lasting impact on hundreds of residents who were already at higher risk of food insecurity. Combine that with upcoming changes to SNAP benefits and grocery prices that are nearly 30% higher than five years ago, and it is irrefutable that the food security landscape in our region is shifting.
We see these shifts firsthand at Operation Food Search, where demand for hunger relief services has more than doubled in certain areas. 
Our job, as an organization, is to respond to these changing needs. But adaptation requires accurate information. Without reliable data, we cannot adapt our programs in ways that are precise and impactful. 
That is why the USDA’s decision to cancel its 2025 Household Food Security Report is so troubling.
What is happening in our region is a microcosm of a reality that plays out across the nation every day. Needs shift, and the organizations that serve them must adapt. 
For 30 years, the data collected in the Household Food Security Report has guided governments and nonprofits on how to do so. At Operation Food Search, for example, it provides the level of detail required to make decisions about where to expand school-based weekend meal programs and how to prioritize routes of our mobile farmers’ market. These are programs on which the most vulnerable populations (including children, veterans, and disabled and elderly people) depend. Without consistent data, organizations like ours will be less able to direct resources in a way that maximizes impact.
The USDA’s statement that “trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged” glosses over statistically significant shifts. 
In a nation of more than 340 million people, even an incremental percentage signifies thousands of real humans. The Household Food Security Report remains the only source that has tracked three decades of national and state-level hunger with consistent, comparable data. Its breadth and continuity—breaking down results by age, race, ethnicity, geography, and severity—are what allow policymakers and nonprofits to understand what’s working, what’s not, and how to evolve as needs do. 
On a national scale, the loss of this data comes at a particularly dangerous moment. In the 12 months ending in August, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.9%, with core inflation up 3.1% as tariffs and a tight labor market pushed prices higher. 
The food price index rose 3.2% in the same period, and as food costs climb, so does the risk of food insecurity. At the same time, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that 150,000 Missourians and 472,000 Illinoisans will lose some or all of their SNAP benefits under new requirements. 
To be clear, without the USDA’s annual survey we will not know how many Americans have enough to eat. Hunger is not static. It evolves with every storm and every policy change.
Cancelling this research does not cancel hunger; it simply makes it harder for us all to clearly see challenges and address them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/produce-usda-image-1024x678-1.jpg,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

Jed Leano
Jed Leano is a member of the Claremont City Council.


The word “accountability’’ continues to be thrown in every direction when it comes to solving homelessness. 
A bill on the governor’s desk, Senate Bill 634 from state Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, would be a step forward in holding local jurisdictions accountable for addressing homelessness by stopping cities from chasing away critical, supportive services — along with the people who take on the tough task of helping unhoused people.
In his efforts to hold cities accountable, Gov. Gavin Newsom has rightly castigated some of the worst actors at the local level — from the city of Turlock, which refused to commit $1 in local funding to unlock major state funding to keep an existing shelter open, to the city of Norwalk, which sought to ban supportive housing and shelters in violation of state and federal law. Thankfully, a state lawsuit forced officials there to back down.
I have seen the entire spectrum of local efforts on homelessness — positive and negative —  in my role as a city councilmember in Claremont, chairperson of the San Gabriel Valley Regional Housing Trust and board member of the LA County Affordable Housing Solutions Agency.
Some localities are good actors, trying to solve the problem but lacking the tools and partnerships required to be effective. Some are bad actors, turning homelessness policy into an indictment of the people who cannot afford housing — suggesting the problem is that they are visible, not that they are unhoused. 
Accountability from state leaders means continuing to provide desperately needed funding for housing and supportive services, to help get our homeless neighbors back into housing. Accountability from cities means, at the most basic level, allowing those lifesaving, supportive services to reach the people experiencing homelessness on our streets. 
Despite reams of evidence that criminalizing homelessness not only fails to solve the issue but actually prolongs homelessness and makes it worse, some cities even tried criminalizing basic supportive services that help people survive the streets and get them back into housing.
In February, Fremont proposed criminalizing people who ‘’aid and abet’’ homeless encampments, as though social workers and good Samaritans handing out sandwiches were driving the getaway car in a bank robbery.  El Cajon, Santa Ana and other cities have tried it, too. 
That makes SB 634 even more critical. As the Trump administration pushes cities to take more draconian tactics, the bill would draw a line, so cities cannot prohibit the delivery of basic outreach and supportive services to people experiencing homelessness.
These services — coupled with access to housing that’s affordable — are ultimately the only long-term solution to homelessness. Everything else is just a shell game. 
Cities can and should do more. They should enact zoning that makes it easier to build affordable housing and shelters. They should partner with counties to make sure behavioral health services are available for people seeking them. The list of best practices goes on. 
At the very least, they should not bar the services needed to address homelessness for which Newsom has consistently provided funding. The governor should take these recalcitrant cities to task and sign SB 634.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04023-Bakersfield-PROJECT-LV_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

(Photo by baona/Getty stock photo)On Oct. 6, the Maryland Supreme Court will hear consolidated appeals in climate lawsuits filed by Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County against numerous American energy companies. At stake is whether Maryland law can be stretched to hold American energy producers liable for the global effects of climate change.
State court judges in Baltimore and Annapolis already dismissed these cases as preempted by federal law. The question now is whether Maryland’s highest court will affirm that ruling or allow identical litigation that has failed in Maryland and across the country to continue.
Since 2017, close to three dozen states, counties and municipalities have tried to use state consumer or nuisance laws to pin the costs of climate change on energy producers. Most have lost. Courts in New Jersey, South Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania have already dismissed such claims, finding them far beyond the scope of state laws.
Climate change is a global challenge. Emissions come from billions of decisions made over more than a century, across every state and country. Courts have consistently recognized that no single jurisdiction can regulate global emissions through local tort law. As one South Carolina judge warned, these suits risk creating a “chaotic web of conflicting legal obligations.” That is why the U.S. Supreme Court in American Electric Power v. Connecticut – in a decision handed down by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – unanimously held that federal law governs these claims, and why Maryland judges have already dismissed them.

Even the Biden-Harris administration acknowledged that these cases face constitutional hurdles. In the former solicitor general’s brief, the Justice Department admitted that climate lawsuits may falter when they attempt to penalize companies for out-of-state or international conduct. The brief noted defendants “may ultimately prevail on their contention that respondents’ claims are barred by the Constitution … to the extent the claims rely on conduct occurring outside” state borders. That rationale led a Delaware state court to narrow that state’s lawsuit to in-state emissions and a Baltimore court to dismiss its case outright last year. The legal foundation for climate litigation is shaky at best.
National security leaders have also urged caution. Retired Air Force Gen. Richard Myers and retired Navy Adm. Michael Mullen warned that undermining petroleum production through litigation could harm America’s fuel security and military readiness.
None of this is to say that climate change is not a real and urgent problem. Marylanders know firsthand the risks of rising seas, stronger storms and hotter summers. But the state’s path forward lies in practical solutions, not courtroom battles with little chance of success.
Maryland has already invested in resilience projects, renewable energy and emissions-reduction initiatives that make a measurable difference. Expanding those efforts, through innovation, infrastructure and collaboration will do far more for local communities than years of costly litigation likely to end in dismissal.
It is also worth noting that the Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County cases have been brought by San Francisco-based trial lawyers. Their interests do not align with Maryland’s. For them, the lawsuits are part of a broader campaign, regardless of whether they succeed. For Maryland, however, the risk is wasted time, taxpayer dollars and missed opportunities to implement real solutions.
Climate change is a challenge of governance and policy, not ambulance-chasing tort law. Disputes of such interstate and international nature belong with Congress and federal agencies, not local courts. Allowing state-level claims to proceed risks turning judges into policymakers, imposing regulations through litigation rather than democratic debate.
Maryland’s own circuit judges recognized this, finding that the Constitution’s federal structure does not allow state law to be applied to claims tied to global emissions. Upholding those rulings would not be a denial of climate action. It would be an affirmation that the courts must respect their proper role.
If Maryland truly wants to lead on climate solutions, it should build on the work already underway: Investing in coastal resilience, supporting technological innovation and fostering partnerships with federal agencies and the private sector. These initiatives can deliver real benefits for Maryland families, workers and communities. By contrast, pursuing lawsuits that have already failed in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina — and Maryland — itself is a distraction. It will not bring the progress Marylanders need.
The Maryland Supreme Court has an opportunity to bring clarity and finality. By affirming the dismissals, it can ensure that the state’s energy and resources are directed toward viable solutions, not prolonged legal battles. Doing what’s best for Maryland means moving beyond litigation and focusing on policies that actually work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1182600677-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

Burlington, Vermont
Died Sept. 15, 2025
Essex, New York


Stephen Goddard “Steve” Phillips, 82, of Elm Street, Essex, NY, died unexpectedly Monday, September 15, 2025, at his home, with his loving wife by his side.
He was born in Burlington, Vermont, September 12, 1943, the son of Edward Steward and Madelon Frances (Glaser) Phillips.
Steve graduated from Burlington High School, Class of 1961. He went on to pursue a degree in engineering from UVM, but mid-way through his junior year his ambition to build became uncontainable and he left college to begin forming the foundations of his company, S.G. Phillips, Co. What began as “grunt” work, clearing and grubbing for the Vermont Interstate System and working in sewer lines, quickly grew into being named a Top 100 Contractor in the U.S. From Maine to Florida, his company built municipal wastewater facilities, buildings for IBM and Hannaford, ski resorts in Sugarbush and Ascutney, and transformed Church Street in Burlington in the ‘80s, laying every brick you walk on today. His company was only successful by the hard work and determination of his employees, all 700+ at its peak. Steve had a rare skill of surrounding himself with smarter people whose appetite for construction was equal to his. He had profound love and respect for his construction family.
Steve had another family he was building concurrently. He and his first wife, Pamela (Gerhard), bought and began fixing up an old farmhouse in Waitsfield, VT that welcomed his first two sons. Shortly after their marriage ended he met and married his second wife, Judith (Osler) and welcomed two more sons. Their home became quite literally the command center, complete with a landing strip, where his children were raised with an abundance of love, excitement and opportunity.
After a complicated back surgery in the ‘90s, Steve’s life shifted direction and he left “The Valley”, closed up his company and headed to the shores of Lake Champlain.
In 2002, providence came in the form of a question, would you like to go for a boat ride?, Steve asked Emily, unaware at the time that she would go on to become his wife, caregiver and most importantly his soulmate. They married in June of 2006 and built a loving life together with their dogs and cats in Essex, NY.
Steve was a husband, a father, a Flippy, an uncle and a dear friend to many. He lived an incredibly full and captivating life, leaving nothing on the table. He had a deep passion and desire to push the limits which he did through skiing, hunting, racing cars and on the waters of Lake Champlain. He found his peace and love on his Diamond Island.
Stephen is survived by his wife, Emily (Gardner) Phillips, his sons, Briggs Phillips and his wife Amanda of Charlotte, VT, Harper Phillips of Stowe, VT, Christopher (Botsy) Phillips and his wife Olivia of Boulder, CO, Whitney Phillips and his wife Jesse of Warren, VT, and his daughter Dawn Tebbetts of New Haven, CT and by his grandchildren Crawford, Questwell, Cowen, Waverly and Walker Phillips. He also leaves behind his cousin Candy Davidson, his in-laws, Alan Gardner and his wife Tina and Nancy Belzile and his very special dog Sibley Diamond.
He was predeceased by his parents and brothers Thomas and Richard Phillips.
A funeral service was held at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in Essex, NY on Friday September 26 at 11:00 am.
In lieu of flowers the family would appreciate donations be made in Steve’s memory to support students attending CV-TEC, particularly in the Construction Trades to Champlain Valley Educational Foundation PO Box 4 Westport, NY 12993.
Steve loved small, generous acts- consider taking in a stray cat, helping a stranger and most importantly, tell the person you love the most everyday just how much you love them. Everyday is a gift.
Arrangements are in the care of the Hamilton Funeral Home, 294 Mannix Road, Peru, 518-643-9055.

Research by the commission found court costs in the state vary depending on the county because of local laws passed by Legislature. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Local laws have created significant disparities in court costs and access to court services in different counties in Alabama, according to findings presented by the Joint Interim Commission on Court Costs on Tuesday.
“There are a lot of local court costs,” said Nathan Hudson, administrator for the Administrative Office of the Courts for Alabama. “There is a good bit of disparity. There are various things that we fund with court costs.”
The findings came after weeks of review  of regulations. Alabama Chief Justice Sarah Stewart, who leads the commission, directed commission members in June to compile a list of fees and fines that are charged by counties. That information would then form the foundation for the analysis to gauge the current state of court costs in Alabama.

The commission first met several months by way of a resolution approved by the Alabama Legislature during the 2025 session. The Joint Interim Commission on Court Costs is tasked with providing a report to lawmakers after they evaluate the current situation to possibly move toward a more uniform system.
Hudson displayed a spreadsheet that laid bare the fees that Autauga County charges to residents to file documents with the court to obtain legal services as an example. For example, Autauga County charges $244 to file for divorce but Madison County charges $324 for the same service, according to their respective websites.
The fees, as well as fines, are allocated to several funding sources. Some pay for court operations. Others are allocated to the state, including the General Fund budget.
A state regulation is meant to reduce the disparity in fees. But lawmakers often bypass that rule by enacting local legislation that allows municipalities within their respective districts to charge court costs for specific items and designate the funding for specific sources.
“This is probably something that has been going on for the last 50 years,” said Stephen Wallace, circuit court judge for the 10th Judicial Circuit, a member of the commission who attempted to identify patterns in the history of local laws affecting court fees.
According to his findings, counties imposed court fees to pay for the construction of jails within their jurisdictions, oftentimes tied to debt service. From there, local laws were passed to fund law libraries in the mid-1980s to 1990s.
Other laws were enacted to provide services for youth and juveniles, then used to fund sheriffs’ departments; diversion programs and domestic violence programs. Since 2010, court costs have been  earmarked for specialized programs, such as mental health courts for example.
“Overall, it is a patchwork system,” Wallace said. “The defining feature is that there is no defining feature. It was built over 50 years, and it has taken a long time to get to that point.”
Members also found similar themes for civil fees, such as filing for a divorce.
“The general takeaway is that the base fee was in the middle, even a little bit on the low side,” said Steven L. Nicholas, an attorney based in Mobile, regarding civil filing fees in Alabama. “The counties or circuits that don’t have big fees are still in the middle. It is the outliers that are starting to press up against the high side.
The commission will consolidate the findings and prepare a report for the Legislature to review by the time the 2026 legislative session begins.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250624_110807-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

Spencer Cox speaks during a Turning Point USA event at Utah State University in Logan on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Back in Utah for the first time since conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was killed three weeks ago, the company he co-founded, Turning Point USA, continued its “American Comeback Tour” at Utah State University on Tuesday. 
Turning Point staff estimated 6,500 people — mostly college-aged, but some older and younger  — came to the event in Logan, about 120 miles north of Utah Valley University where Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10. 
The aftermath of Kirk’s death was apparent, with tightened security and a heavy police presence across campus as thousands of people filed into the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum arena. While attendees lined up outside, armed police officers could be seen patrolling the area, positioned at various entry points across campus. Bag-sniffing dogs walked up and down lines as students waited to enter. 
Students cheered, repeatedly chanted “USA” and “Charlie,” and danced to hype music while waiting for the event to start. Along with President Donald Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” red caps, many wore white shirts with the word “freedom” across their chests, matching the shirt Kirk wore when he was killed.

Kirk’s memory was center stage throughout the event — meant to honor him, but also keep his conservative activism alive. Repeatedly, speakers called Kirk a “martyr” while calling what happened to him “evil” and urging his supporters to continue to fight for conservative beliefs.  
“I’m not here to eulogize Charlie Kirk. I am here to pass the torch on to every single one of you,” said Alex Clark, the host of a conservative health and wellness podcast associated with Turning Point USA. “Tonight, each of us certainly feels the weight of this loss. But what we don’t do, what we refuse to do, is bow to despair.” 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox booed, but also applauded 
In Kirk’s absence, Turning Point hosted a panel of Republican politicians including Gov. Spencer Cox, former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz who is now a Fox News commentator, and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, who plans to run for Arizona governor in 2026. 
Tyler Bowyer, chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, moderated the panel, which he pointed out featured speakers who are all also members of Utah’s dominant faith, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
When Cox was introduced, loud boos boomed through the arena. 
Cox, in the wake of Kirk’s killing, has drawn national attention as he has condemned Kirk’s killing — calling it a “political assassination” while denouncing political violence. He urged Americans to “stop hating” each other, spend less time on social media, and more time connecting with their family and neighbors. 
‘Our nation is broken,’ Utah Gov. Cox says of Charlie Kirk assassination

But divides within the Republican Party — including Kirk and his supporters — concerning Cox date back years. In 2022, Kirk said in a post on X that Cox “should be expelled from the Republican party” after the governor vetoed a bill banning transgender girls from school sports. 
When Cox first began to speak, recalling when he first learned about Kirk’s killing, he was immediately drowned out by boos. Bowyer urged the crowd to help “facilitate a conversation.” When he was able to speak uninterrupted, Cox recounted speaking to Trump after the shooting and pledged to hold Kirk’s shooter accountable, calling his killing “treasonous.” 
“This was more than an attack on Charlie Kirk. This was an attack on free speech. It was an attack on America. It was an attack on American ideals. It was treasonous,” Cox said, adding that the nation has not seen “that kind of political assassination in my lifetime.” 
The crowd, though they at times also applauded Cox, gave a warmer reception to Biggs and Chaffetz, who both repeatedly praised Kirk and Trump.

Utah’s ‘soft’ politics?
During the panel discussion, Bowyer posed a question that seemed to challenge Utah’s tempered style of politics, asking whether the “soft Utah approach” has “enabled people who are mentally ill.” He also pointed to Cox’s “Disagree Better” campaign that has sought to discourage political tribalism, hate and polarization and asked “is that really a both sides issue?”
Cox said “this isn’t just about left or right, it’s about good and evil.” He condemned labeling people “fascists and Nazis,” while also saying “the idea that speech is violence” is “so dangerous” because it can be used to justify actual violence. 
Cox also said “there are violent people on the far right. It happens. And to say that that’s not true would be a lie.” 
On Bowyer’s question about Utah’s “soft approach,” Cox, who is a Latter-day Saint, pointed to the death this week of President Russell M. Nelson, the faith’s leader, saying, “he very passionately believed that anger never persuades.” 
Cox got loud applause for that. 
“That is not ‘soft,’” he continued. “Peacemaking is not soft. It’s the hardest thing you can do.” 
Cox then said that’s what Kirk did. While he debated people who disagreed with him, he also “treated them with respect,” he said. He also acknowledged “there is a rift” within the Republican party.

“There are people in our party who don’t want to do what Charlie (did),” Cox said. “They just want to call each other names and we can’t fall prey to that.” 
Bowyer also asked a pointed question about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, questioning whether it should “take mental illness a little more seriously” and take a stronger stance against “inclusion politics.”
Cox said his faith teaches him “we all have agency, and everybody’s responsible for their own decisions.” He said Kirk’s shooter is responsible, “not the church, not Utah, not someone else. That person is responsible.” He also agreed the entire country needs to take “mental illness more seriously.” 
“Charlie had the answer to that,” he said. “Get off your couch. Get off social media. Get married. Have kids. Do something with your life.” 
Biggs, in his answer to Bowyer’s question, said, “You have to be honest, and you call balls and strikes the way they are. … If you don’t call balls and strikes, if you aren’t honest, if you aren’t speaking with clarity, purpose and principle, you are deceiving you, yourself (and) the person you’re having a conversation with.”

When Bowyer asked whether “inclusionary politics has gone too far,” and has led some to give up on their “moral compass,” Chaffetz said from his experience “those that preach the most tolerance are the least tolerant among us.” He also added that he worries about “too much tolerance” and there needs to be a “balance.”
Chaffetz then got what was one of the loudest moments of applause when he said: “You do not need a man with junk in a woman’s bathroom.” 
Toward the end of the event, dozens of students lined up to ask questions. One questioned Cox about the veto of the bill banning transgender girls from school sports. Cox explained that he worried the ban would only get overturned in the courts, so after he vetoed it he and the Legislature “worked together” to put in place a commission to decide transgender athlete eligibility rather than an all-out ban. 
“I think Charlie and I would agree on 99% of things,” Cox said, adding that he wished there would have been an opportunity for him and Kirk to have “had that debate together.” Even though Cox said he thinks Kirk would have still disagreed with him, “what matters” is continuing to talk to people you may disagree with. 
“We’ve got to make space for that,” Cox said. “And we’re doing that tonight.”

This week Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, joined those who've ended their campaigns.","Over the last half-century or so, California has had six elections for governor when the office was being vacated.
Understandably, such incumbent-free elections to run the nation’s most populous and economically powerful state have drawn serious candidates, mostly holders of other high-profile offices who declared themselves as soon as decorum would allow.
When, for example, Republican Ronald Reagan’s two terms as governor were ending in 1974, the Democratic secretary of state, Jerry Brown, narrowly defeated the Republican state controller, Houston Flournoy.
This bit of political history is offered because the end of Gavin Newsom’s governorship is approaching rapidly. In scarcely a year, California voters will choose a new governor. The June 2  primary, which will determine the two finalists, is just eight months away. 
Yet the field of would-be governors remains very unsettled.
For months voters, political media and potential campaign financiers waited for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether, after losing the presidency to Donald Trump, she would seek the governorship.
Harris finally said no, with a rather odd remark: “I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken.” She may have been referring to national politics, but since the issue was California’s governorship, she could also have been implying the state was broken after many years of dominance by her Democratic Party.
Harris’ decision, whatever her motives, did not settle the question about who will be running for governor next year. There are declared candidates, of course, but none scores very high in preliminary polling.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis had been one of the first to declare her candidacy but shortly after Harris announced her decision, Kounalakis dropped out, opting instead to run for state treasurer.
With those two out of the picture, former Congresswoman Katie Porter became the frontrunner, more or less by default, but with underwhelming support — 17% in a poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, released in late August. Her standing may have reflected nothing more than name recognition from her losing campaign for U.S. senator last year.
This week Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, also ended her campaign, saying she could see no pathway to victory. A few other Democrats remain, most notably former Biden administration official and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
Mostly, however, we are seeing just preliminary skirmishing among those still in the race, because we’re still waiting to see who else might run.
After the departure of Harris and Kounalakis, another name popped up in media speculation:  U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla.
It’s difficult to understand why Padilla, who holds one of the nation’s most coveted political offices and could remain in the Senate for the rest of his life, would want to seek no more than eight years as governor.
Does he really want to deal with California’s plethora of infinitely difficult, unresolved issues, such as homelessness, housing shortages, water supply uncertainty, economic stagnation and, perhaps trickiest of all, a chronic multibillion-dollar budget deficit?
Were Padilla to give up his Senate seat for the governorship, as Republican Pete Wilson did in 1990, the only logical motive would be civic duty — he thinks California needs him to weather its crises.
Meanwhile, we’re waiting for another potential candidate, Rick Caruso, to also declare intentions. The very wealthy Los Angeles businessman ran a credible but unsuccessful race for mayor of his city after switching his party identification from Republican to Democrat and could draw support from moderate voters and interest groups of both parties. He says he’s weighing a race.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/011923-Toni-Atkins-Governor-Campaign-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-01 08:57:05.904740

(Photo courtesy of Lizzy Tomber).David Tomber-Young, 9, of St. Louis, has always been musical and expressive. 
According to his mom, Lizzy Tomber, he can sing the theme song to his current favorite movie, “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” from memory, including the parts in Korean. And when he watches movies, he has a knack for imitating the actors’ facial expressions.
But David, who along with his three younger brothers has been diagnosed with autism, struggles with some aspects of verbal communication, like answering open-ended questions and talking about the past.
Tomber said David has had “really huge progress” since he began taking a medication prescribed by his doctor in May: leucovorin.
“Before, you would really have to be like, number one or number two, and kind of give him a couple of choices,” Tomber said. “Right now, he’s talking more at school and, I think, talking about what he did last weekend or what he wants to do tomorrow.”
Leucovorin was at the center of statements by President Donald Trump and top federal health officials on Sept. 22 about the causes and treatment of autism spectrum disorder. Officials endorsed the use of leucovorin, which is used to treat side effects of chemotherapy, as an autism therapy. They also asserted a link between autism and pregnant mothers’ use of acetaminophen – the active ingredient in the pain and fever reducer Tylenol.
Specialists across Missouri urged caution around the claims from the White House last week, advising parents to consult their doctors and underlining the complexity of factors that influence autism.
Doctors said that scientific research on Tylenol and autism is inconclusive, while noting the importance of treating maternal fevers and pain.
“Your specific healthcare needs are best addressed with your physician,” said Dr. Benjamin Black, medical director at the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment at the University of Missouri. “You want to appropriately treat illnesses and fevers during pregnancy, and whatever that needs to look like in your pregnancy is a discussion to have with your care provider.”
Leucovorin is a form of vitamin B9 that limited studies have suggested can boost verbal communication in individuals with autism. The “hypothesis,” said Dr. Gregory Cejas, co-director of the Washington University Autism Clinical Center, is that some people with autism have an autoimmune reaction that prevents the uptake of folate in the brain – and that leucovorin can help.
“I think what we don’t know,” Cejas said, “is that a true hypothesis? So we have to test that more. We have to, I think, do bigger studies on those things.”
Tomber said that while she thinks leucovorin, along with speech therapy and his teachers’ support, has helped David, it isn’t a “miracle drug.” Two of Tomber’s younger sons, who are mostly nonverbal, tried leucovorin and stopped due to possible side effects.
“They’re obviously frustrated that they can’t communicate, that they can’t get their point across,” Tomber said. “If I can give them a tool to do that better, of course I’m going to do it.”
 ‘We don’t want to put blame on our families’

Jenny Shank, of St. Louis, said Trump’s assertions pulled her back to her self-doubt in the early days of her now 17-year-old daughter’s diagnosis with autism.
Trump urged pregnant women to endure pain and “fight like hell not to take” Tylenol, except in cases of high fever.
“As a woman, I think you go back so many times,” Shank said. “Even though you’re so grateful for your child and you wouldn’t change them, you still go back and you think, ‘Was it this? Was it that?’”
Cejas said that as researchers work to learn more about autism, it’s important not to “put blame on our families.”
“I think a lot of parents ask me, ‘Is it something that I did?’” Cejas said. “And my usual answer is no, there’s nothing that you did specifically. There is no way to predict anything that you did in your pregnancy or otherwise that led to this point.”
Michelle Trupiano, executive director of Beacon Reproductive Health Network, formerly the Missouri Family Health Council, said misinformation, including around Tylenol, sows uncertainty and distrust.
“It just causes confusion for folks that is going to trickle down into continued confusion for patients over who they can trust, who they can go to for accurate information,” Trupiano said.”
Zachary Moser, administrator at the Dent County Health Center in rural southwest Missouri, said his office doesn’t plan to make any changes following the president’s remarks on Tylenol.
Moser, who is also a pharmacist, said a letter published Monday by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs offered a “reasonable” and “substantially different” message from Trump.
“It just uses the common sense principles that we use in medicine all the time,” Moser said. “Use the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time as possible. That applies to everything we do.”
The letter ended by describing acetaminophen as “the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy” to aspirin or ibuprofen, which “have well-documented adverse impacts on the fetus.”
As of Friday, Moser saw some chatter about Tylenol online but had not yet been approached by many in his community for guidance on taking the medication. 
 ‘No single medical treatment’

Black, the medical director from the Thompson Center, said that because autism can’t be traced to any single cause or pathway in the brain, “no single medical treatment will be the answer for all patients and families.”
Though leucovorin appears to present minimal risk, Black said, there are no safety studies specific to patients with autism, and tests for the type of folate deficiency the drug may treat can be expensive or rely on scant data.
For now, Black said he is taking “a relatively cautious approach” to leucovorin.
Shank said that she will likely ask her daughter’s doctor about leucovorin. She wishes she could take away some of her daughter’s struggles, but she isn’t looking for a cure. 
“I don’t think that autism is something that needs to be cured,” she said.
Looking back on her family’s journey, Shank said she wants parents of children with autism to feel empowered to reach out to other families, because “most other families, they get it, they understand.”
“Go out of your comfort zone to fight for your child and advocate for them and create opportunities for them,” Shank said, “and give them the tools they need to succeed.”

“That means there were like [16] kids graduating high school,” DYS Schools Superintendent Tracy Smitherman said Friday. “So we’re just bouncing off of the rooftops down there, around here, about what all our kids are doing.”
In addition to students getting more high school diplomas, Smitherman also reported that 57 students enrolled in the Training and Advancement Center passed all three parts of the General Educational Development (GED), bringing the DYS passing rate to 65%.
“These students are diligently working toward their GEDs, post-secondary courses, and acquiring career readiness skills in over 20 areas, including [National Center for Construction Education and Research] and Microsoft certifications,” Smitherman said in a statement on Aug. 6.
In a phone interview on Tuesday, Smitherman said the increase in graduates is due to DYS School System guidance counselors checking transcripts for students.
“Our counselors are almost like private investigators trying to piece [student records] together so that the children don’t take the same class multiple times and make sure that they’re actually taking the classes that they need to take with us instead of something that they don’t need,” she said. “We have really put a lot of effort and a lot of meetings in with counties and with the specialized treatment centers and with the State Department of [Education] trying to get every one of the players to utilize the PowerSchool [software] as it’s set up to be used so that we can actually look at a child holistically and piece all the pieces together and make sure he meets the standards for graduation.”
PowerSchool is a software used by school systems to track grades, attendance and other data.

That’s more than $80 billion in assets managed by volunteer boards guided by professional managers and lawyers — usually with little outside oversight. My own HOA has over 8,000 units — a small city by Nevada standards. If you think your HOA is just a harmless neighborhood committee, my story should make you think again.
I’ve spent over half a million dollars in legal fees, plus untold insurance defense costs, defending rights most of us assume are guaranteed: to speak, to run for a board seat, and to hold an HOA to the law. I’m not wealthy and many would call this foolish. 
This is not just my story, or only about HOAs. The misuse of attorney-fee provisions as weapons reaches across our civil justice system, where those with deep pockets can intimidate, silence, or bankrupt opponents simply by driving up costs. HOAs are just one arena.  Unless this abuse is reined in, no one is safe.
When speaking out gets you sued
As a retired Air Force officer and healthcare executive, I never expected to be sued by my own HOA — twice — simply for running for its board.
The first time, the developer still in control of my community filed a defamation lawsuit. My offense? Questioning his decades-long grip on power. I fought back and won. In doing so, I set a precedent: the Nevada Supreme Court confirmed that HOA governance is a matter of public concern and that owners are entitled to anti-SLAPP protections.
The court fined the developer $10,000, pocket change to him. For me, “victory” cost hundreds of thousands in legal fees and left a target on my back.
On my second run, homeowners elected me. But eighteen months later, developer-appointed directors ousted me — no recall, no due process — with the association’s lawyer’s blessing. The state regulator, the Nevada Real Estate Division (NRED), knew and did nothing. I challenged the removal; years later, the case still drags on.
A system built to intimidate
The tools used against me are available against any homeowner. It’s like getting a speeding ticket from the police — then being sued by a random driver as if they were your prosecutor. No one imagines civic life works this way — except in HOAs, where private lawsuits and “prevailing party” attorney-fee clauses turn disputes into financial weapons.
A second ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court in my case weakened protections further. Today, it’s even easier for developers, boards, and their attorneys to silence dissent and bankrupt opposition.
NRED has the authority to enforce the law, but avoids tough calls, ignores complaints, operates in secrecy, and refuses to bring issues before its oversight body, the Governor-appointed Commission for Common-Interest Communities. The Commission sees the problem and does nothing.
One example says it all. My association and its developer demanded $120,000 in attorney fees for a single appellate answer. That’s more than twice the median annual salary of a Nevada worker.
My own attorney cost about $40,000 — expensive, yes, but what choice did I have? He handled both my appeal and the association’s counter-arguments. These fee claims aren’t about fairness; they’re designed to intimidate and deter. And it works.
More than one battle
My legal fight has spawned multiple cases, all tied to one unresolved question: after 25 years, should this community be run by its owners or by the developer?
Opposing counsel insists defending developer control is the same as defending the HOA itself. That’s wrong. Developers and homeowners do not share the same interests, and boards stacked with appointees almost always protect the former.
And even in fully owner-controlled HOAs, the risk remains. A determined board with aggressive lawyers can isolate and crush dissenters using the same tactics. Nevada’s HOA laws — weak enforcement, lack of transparency, punitive fee provisions — make abuse possible anywhere.
Many homeowners keep their heads down. I once saw that as apathy. Now I see it as survival.
I love my community. I love Las Vegas. I love Nevada. But outside of HOAs, there are few housing choices and lawmakers know it. The real question is whether we accept this as the price of living here, or whether we demand better.

(Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)More than three decades ago, water managers in Southern Nevada launched a plan to pipe groundwater from hundreds of miles away to augment Lake Mead’s water supply. The plan fell through and the region moved on, implementing major water conservation efforts instead.
A coalition of conservation groups say Nevada’s history can offer hope as water managers across western states negotiate new rules for sharing the Colorado River’s dwindling water supply.
The Great Basin Water Network, Living Rivers-Colorado Riverkeeper, Utah Rivers Council, and the Glen Canyon Institute released a report Wednesday with several recommendations they say would prevent the continued over-consumption of the river’s water.
States reliant on the river are approaching a 2026 deadline to reach a consensus on how to manage the river, and they have until mid-November to reach a preliminary agreement or risk federal intervention.
With only weeks until the earlier deadline, Colorado River basin states remain at odds over how to manage the river that serves 40 million people across the West. Those disagreements largely center on which half of the basin should decrease its water use, and by how much.
States are split into two camps, the Upper Basin – Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico – and the Lower Basin – California, Arizona and Nevada.
But states, experts and policymakers do agree on one thing: the river is overallocated. 
Chronic overuse, drought and rising temperatures linked to climate change have shrunk water flows. The river has lost nearly 20% of its natural flows in the past quarter century. Hydrologists say it could lose another 20% in the coming decades.
The report by the coalition of conservation groups highlights nine recommendations on how to permanently reduce water use on the Colorado River as supplies shrink. 
Those recommendations include preventing new dams and diversions, sharing water cuts among states, improving hydrology data, increasing water recycling, stabilizing groundwater decline, preserving endangered species, and improving agricultural irrigation. 
Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, said the recommendations are meant to confront difficult “hydrologic realities and the legal realities” as Colorado River negotiations stall and federal deadlines near.
“Things are so tense right now, nobody wants to upset the other side. They are divided. So nobody wants to say anything meaningful in public,” Roerink said. 
“Here we are really getting down to the wire,” he continued. 
Tense negotiations have also created a lack of public transparency as states develop the new management guidelines, said Roerink. When the current Colorado River guidelines were developed in 2007, public participation was significantly more robust, said Roerink.
“Now we’re just getting nothing,” he added. 
A major factor that needs to be considered during negotiations is the planned development of new dams and diversions that could lead to future legal conflicts, says the report. The Great Basin Water Network tallied more than 30 project proposals in the Upper Basin that could pull more than a million acre feet from the Colorado River if constructed. 
Rather than developing infrastructure to pull more water from the river, the report recommends Upper Basin states create water curtailment plans to establish a “clear-cut understanding of what entities have to cut during a shortage.” Lower Basin states are already subject to curtailments under the current operation guidelines. 
Some existing dams, like Glen Canyon Dam, will need to be modified to adapt to lower stream flows, says the report. 
Water in Lake Powell needs to pass through Glen Canyon Dam to reach Lower Basin states, but when the lake dips below a certain elevation significantly less water can pass downstream due to the dam’s engineering. In 2023, water levels in the lake came within 30 feet of that benchmark elevation.
The coalition asks the Bureau of Reclamation to include modifications to Glen Canyon Dam as part of the ongoing negotiations.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2223867672-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-01 07:57:34.193530

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/10/01/as-lieutenant-governor-hopefuls-debate-nj-republicans-say-trumps-future-is-at-stake/,Republicans gathered at a Nutley VFW Hall on Tuesday to watch our lieutenant governor candidates debate for the first and only time.,"Lieutenant governor candidates Dale Caldwell, left, and Jim Gannon meet on the debate state on Sept. 30, 2025. (Photo courtesy of PIX 11)NUTLEY — Where else to watch the one-and-only debate between our leading lieutenant governor candidates than in one of New Jersey’s swingiest towns?
Nutley voters backed Republican Gov. Chris Christie’s reelection bid in 2013, then flipped to Democrat Phil Murphy four years later, then switched to Republican Jack Ciattarelli in 2021. Their presidential choices are equally swingy: Barack Obama in 2012, then Donald Trump four years later, Joe Biden in 2020, and Trump again last year.
This is a town that cannot make up its mind. Not that I thought I was going to run into many fence sitters at Tuesday’s debate watch party hosted by American First Republicans at VFW Post 493. This was such a pro-Trump crowd, one woman wore a t-shirt that read “even my dogs love Trump.”
And while we were all there ostensibly to watch Democrat Dale Caldwell and Republican Jim Gannon — running mates of gubernatorial hopefuls Mikie Sherrill (D) and Ciattarelli — debate issues like property taxes, transit, and immigration, the stakes of November’s gubernatorial race are so high for some of those at the Nutley VFW that no less than Trump’s political future is on the line if Democrats win New Jersey’s governorship in November.

“Donald Trump is on the ballot this year,” said Michael Byrne, the Montclair GOP chair. “If they win this race, they’ll go into the midterms with momentum and they’ll impeach him for a third time. We can’t have that. This election is about Trump as much as it’s about Jack and the future of our state.”
Trump was a major theme in Tuesday’s debate, too, at least for most of the time Caldwell spoke. Caldwell, like running mate Sherrill, name-drops the current occupant of the White House like Trump is his actual opponent. Whether the question was about lowering property taxes or discouraging political violence or continuing the Anchor tax rebate program, Caldwell’s responses were more about Trump than his and Sherrill’s plans to govern.
Even when asked about whether he would support continuing NJ Transit’s plan for annual fare hikes, Caldwell said, “We have to look at them, see where the money’s coming from, with the assault from the Trump administration.”
It didn’t get much better when Caldwell avoided Trump, like when he was asked about state school policy on transgender students. The Murphy administration has been sharply criticized by Republicans for a policy that requires school officials to accept a child’s asserted gender identity even absent parental consent. Ciattarelli has vowed to reverse that policy.
Democrats, especially in the wake of embarrassing national losses in 2024 that came after aggressive Republican campaign ads targeting transgender people, have struggled to communicate on this issue. Caldwell’s rambling answer to this yes or no question veered from saying his dad was supportive of the LGBT community to calling the relationship between parents and their children sacrosanct to saying not every school district is the same.
“We need to begin to look at the unique needs and the unique safety issues around every child. Mikie has said, and I have said, that safety is No. 1. We will do whatever it takes to make sure that the safety of the children in the school district, the safety of the children in the community, is our priority,” he said.
Yeesh. Moderator Dan Mannarino pressed him, “So you would keep the guidance?”
“We would, we would review the guidance, but, uh, you know, at this stage it makes some sense,” said Caldwell, a pastor and president of Centenary University in Hackettstown.
Here’s how our next governor says they’ll make NJ more affordable

Then there was the GOP side of the debate stage. Gannon, the Morris County sheriff, stepped in it big time when asked if a millionaire’s tax would be on the table for the Ciattarelli administration to fund services like food stamps that are facing cuts on the federal level.
“Taxes are on the table, but I’d be careful of millionaire’s taxes. They’re employing us,” Gannon said.
“So new taxes are on the table in New Jersey in your administration?” moderator Henry Rosoff asked with what I detected was a hint of incredulity.
“Well, you have to look at it. You have to look at the whole thing, but what I’m saying is, millionaires, we can’t just beat up the millionaires. The millionaires many times are employers. They’re employing us,” Gannon said.
Talk about a gift for the Sherrill campaign, which has argued repeatedly that Ciattarelli would raise taxes if elected governor (he says he would not). Within moments, a clip of Gannon saying taxes are on the table if he becomes lieutenant governor was widely shared by Sherrill’s campaign and her allies.
I heard no response among the crowd at the Nutley VFW when Gannon said this. There was a much larger audible reaction to Caldwell using his closing statement to praise Republican radio talk show host Bill Spadea, a Ciattarelli foe, with one woman saying, “That was a slimy move.” Afterward, the event’s organizers said they saw nothing in the debate that dampened their enthusiasm.
“Jack is more popular than he ever has been, with President Trump,” GOP operative Mike Crispi told me. “Mikie Sherrill, when she harps on these national issues in a race that I think is very localized, because it’s an off-year election, where the focus is Garden State issues, people roll their eyes.”
We’ll see if he’s right very soon. Election Day is in 34 days.

We have to work harder than ever to identify and implement common sense reforms that make it faster and more cost-effective to build renewables here in Vermont and across New England.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jonathan Dowds: Northeast states must resist President Donald Trump’s expensive swerve back to fossil fuels.","This commentary is by Jonathan Dowds, of Burlington. Dowds is the deputy director at Renewable Energy Vermont, the trade association representing Vermont’s renewable sector.
The Trump administration is forcing Americans to increase our dependence on the fossil fuel industry at the direct expense of our economy and our environment. 
President Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress have done everything in their power to kneecap the deployment of wind and solar, even though renewables are our country’s cleanest and cheapest sources of power and are the ones that we can build most quickly to meet rising electricity demand. 
Fortunately, the Trump agenda is not the last word. When he pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Accords during his first term, the Vermont Legislature voted to enact these important greenhouse gas reduction goals. Once again, Vermont and our New England neighbors need to craft our own response to resist Trump’s efforts to tie us ever more tightly to dirty and expensive fossil fuels.
The evidence that Trump’s energy policies amount to economic malpractice purely to benefit the fossil fuel industry is widespread. The U.S. Department of Energy has unilaterally mandated that a coal power plant in Michigan and an oil plant in Pennsylvania remain in operation beyond their planned retirements, despite the determination by state regulators, electric utilities and regional grid operators that closing the plants would not increase the risk of power shortages. 
Forcing these plants to remain operational has already cost tens of millions of dollars. Analysts at the company Grid Strategies estimate that expanding this practice to other uneconomical plants on the cusp of retirement could cost ratepayers between $3 and $6 billion per year. 
These poorly justified interventions in the normal operation of our grid amount to a forced subsidy for an industry that no longer makes economic sense. 
In New England, state governments and environmentalists agree that offshore wind is a foundation of our clean energy future. The Trump administration recently forced one project that was nearly completed, Revolution Wind, to stop work with minimal justification. ISO New England, the entity that runs our grid, declared unpredictable and unjustified stop-work orders for fully permitted projects, like Revolution Wind, would increase costs for consumers and threaten the reliability of the grid. 
Of course, bad news for wind is good news for fossil fuels, as halting Revolution Wind will lead directly to heavier utilization of existing oil and gas plants. New England ratepayers will pay a monetary cost for this, and the people who live near New England’s fossil fuel plants — disproportionately minority and low-income households — will suffer the risks of increased exposure to harmful pollutants. Slowing down offshore wind to increase gas generation is not a trade that is in our best interests.
Trump’s recently passed budget bill is loaded with more of the same handouts to the fossil fuel industry. 
It reduced the royalty rates paid on oil and gas leases, increased the tax credit for carbon sequestration for “enhanced oil recovery,” and created a new tax credit for metallurgical coal, all while abruptly gutting tax credits for the development and manufacturing of wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles. 
The nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation has estimated that the Trump budget bill’s attacks on renewables will lead to a 9% to 18% jump in electricity rates by 2035. These are not policies designed to alleviate an energy shortfall. They are policies that ensure our continued reliance on fossil fuels. 
By eliminating the Solar for All program and tax credits for home solar, the budget bill also represents a major step back for Vermonters looking to control their energy bills. Solar for All had committed to deliver more than $60 million in federal grants to Vermont, designated to help low-income families and the affordable housing community access the benefits of solar. 
The tax credit for home solar, which had been scheduled to run into the 2030s, has helped thousands of Vermont families go solar. Its loss will be a blow, and the state will need to act to ensure that building rooftop solar remains a viable option for Vermonters.  
For all of the damage that Trump’s opposition to affordable renewable energy is doing, there is a path forward. Vermont took one of the most important steps last year, when the state updated its Renewable Energy Standard to mandate that all Vermont utilities get to 100% renewable power by 2035. 
These state standards act as a backstop against Trump’s interference, ensuring that our power comes increasingly from renewables rather than more natural gas plants, regardless of what is happening at the federal level. Simultaneously, we have to work harder than ever to identify and implement common sense reforms that make it faster and more cost-effective to build renewables here in Vermont and across New England. 
Trump is working to drag the country back into the past. Together, we can push for a renewable future.

Each bag is intended to last up to 125 uses. (Photo by Emily Fitzgerald/Washington State Standard.) Washington shoppers will pay 4 cents more per plastic grocery bag starting in January. But the bags themselves won’t get any thicker for at least another two years as lawmakers fine-tune the state’s single-use plastic bag restrictions. 
The price increase is a part of a law passed in 2020 banning some thinner, single-use plastic bags statewide and creating regulations for retailers offering carryout bags to customers. 
Approximately 80,000 Washington businesses are affected by the law, according to the state Department of Commerce. 
Under the law, paper and plastic bags have to be made with 40% recycled content, and plastic bags must be 2.25 millimeters thick and marked as “reusable.” The standard thickness for plastic grocery bags was previously 0.5 millimeters. 
Customers are required, under the law, to pay a fee for a paper or plastic bag. The revenue from bag fees stays with the retailer to help cover the costs of meeting the state requirements. The law also allows for single-use compostable bags, which don’t have a per-bag fee. 
The law set the initial fee for both paper and plastic at 8 cents per bag, but pre-scheduled a price increase for plastic bags to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Once in effect, plastic bags will cost 12 cents per bag, while the fee for paper bags will stay at 8 cents. 
The 2020 law also scheduled an increase in the required bag thickness, from 2.5 millimeters to 4 millimeters, to take effect in January 2026. But legislation passed this year delayed that increase for two years. 
The delay gives the Legislature time to revisit the state’s reusable bag policies and make further adjustments, lawmakers said. 
To deter retailers from making the switch to thicker bags early, retailers who sell bags thicker than 2.5 millimeters between 2026 and 2028 will be penalized 4 cents a bag on top of the standard 12-cent fee beginning in January. 
The penalty was part of the amendment to the bag law that lawmakers passed this year. 
Under the law, the penalty will be passed to the customer, increasing the total per-bag price to 16 cents. Revenue from the penalty will be deposited into the state’s waste reduction, recycling and litter control account. 
The 4 millimeter-thick bags are not widely used and retailers will “do everything they can” to avoid the penalty, Brandon Houskeeper of the Northwest Grocery Retail Association said during a House Environment and Energy Committee work session on Monday. 
Houskeeper and Department of Ecology Solid Waste Program Manager Peter Lyon each confirmed Monday that, while Ecology has received over 800 complaints of bag ban violations since the law went into effect in 2022, no businesses have been fined for non-compliance. 
Ecology staff and retailers have been successfully working together to address violations as they occur, Houskeeper and Lyon said. 
Even though the bag fees have helped offset some of the costs, businesses are paying substantially more for the bags than they make back from the fees. 
Depending on the manufacturer, plastic bags cost between 10 and 39 cents per bag to make and paper grocery bags can cost between 15 and 30 cents per bag. 
The bag fees also don’t account for bags given to customers on food assistance programs who, under the law, are exempt from paying the bag fees, or bags that are stolen from self-checkouts. 
A Washington State University study released this week found that, since the 2020 law went into effect, Washington saw a 50% decrease in the amount of plastic bags distributed, but a 17% increase in the total amount of plastic used.  
In other words, shoppers were using fewer bags with the fee in effect, but the requirement for thicker bags was requiring more material, the study said.
Paper bags saw a 22% decrease, the researchers found. 
The study also said that customers were not reusing plastic grocery bags enough to compensate for the higher plastic volume and the higher cost of producing them. 
“The fact of the matter is, individuals aren’t reusing them seven to 12 times,” Department of Commerce representative Kirk Esmond said during Monday’s work session.
The study authors acknowledged that they struggled to obtain comprehensive data due to the pandemic and a lack of cooperation from some distributors. 
However, they recommended that the Legislature remove the 4 millimeter bag thickness requirement entirely, and consider lifting the single-use plastic bag ban and allow retailers to again offer 0.5 millimeter-thick single-use plastic bags. 
Commerce and Ecology representatives agreed with the recommendation on the 4 millimeter-thick bags, but disputed the proposal to lift the single-use bag ban. 
“It certainly contradicts the law’s goal and the environmental factors that are associated with that,” Esmond said, calling the issue “very complex.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_9697_720.jpg,,,2025-10-01 07:57:34.193530

(Getty Images)Google recently pulled out of its proposed Indiana data center, which was to be built in Franklin Township. Proponents and opponents of the project disagreed, among other things, about just how many jobs the new center might offer.
While we argue over just how many careers may be ultimately available for a single site, we are missing a key challenge of the existence of such centers to begin with: while creating some jobs, the ability for machines to conduct complex skills like analyzing big data threatens to take away even more occupations. As professors, the lack of broader conversation among politicians, educators, and technologists concern us. In a world where artificial intelligence threatens to take away many of the professions we are training students to enter, what is college for?
In a future world where the paid work of the knowledge economy may become scarce, will a college education still function to build critical thinking skills, professionalize, and equip students with a set of skills to begin their careers? Or, could college be so much more for people — perhaps a place that is for learning how to live, not just how to become a driver of the economy?
Generative AI has changed many things in our society. AI is able to combine multiple sources of information together to do tasks far beyond just a search. At the moment, AI is dependent on available internet information (or misinformation) but the capabilities will only increase from here. It is prudent to plan for a disrupted working world.
As faculty members who are two of the Co-Directors of our University’s Teaching and Learning Center and who love to teach courses in Religion and Sociology, we are used to students not understanding why they find themselves in our classrooms—and who might not fully understand why for another 10 or 20 years. After all, our domains don’t necessarily translate into easily commodifiable skills or knowledge. But, later in life when people reflect on the deeper questions about meaning and the purposes of life, or how society is constructed around general assumptions about how people work and live together, or draw upon a particular skill set that they have not dusted off for some time, our domains are a powerful toolbox for asking deeper questions.
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

A future world, a one that is not too far away where work is limited or fully automated, could be a dystopian nightmare or a utopian dream. In a nearly workless world, what shall we do with our time? Will our daily lives be spent working on our individual passions, or will society become unglued because we now have more time than we know what to do with? That is the choice that stands before us currently and which offers opportunities for enormous, productive, and hopefully positive change.
A college education would have to shift away from the current reductionist view of skills and monetary benefit to a model where human freedom is taught as a thing of radical responsibility: to create one’s own projects of meaning and value within a complex matrix of others doing exactly the same thing. Such projects may include things like we have now with production, but what we’re suggesting is that these are done for their own ends, not simply financial gain. Humans with this much freedom over their own time would have to learn what they value – and why – which is precisely what a college education should be doing anyway.
The college education of the future could then invent all sorts of new pathways to cultivating a life away from a world of work. We could study sociology and religion because they express human values. People could study biology because it expresses the enormous beauty of life on this planet. People could study business because it provides a rich tapestry of value propositions and calculations. Most importantly, people could study anything they want simply because they’re interested, not because they’re fearful of being able to make a living in a highly competitive, ever shifting, consumerist economy.
There will certainly be those who are stuck in the old model of education. In the current economy, college graduates make more money over a lifetime. College graduates earn about $40,000 more per year than someone with a high school diploma. While that is, of course, something to be celebrated, it is not the only benefit of matriculation. College graduates also remain married longer than those without a college degree, are far less likely to get dementia later in life, are more engaged in civic issues and service, are more likely to participate in religious services, and a myriad of other benefits. However, this is in the current economy, not the one on the immediate horizon, one in which such statistics may simply fall apart. The growth of AI to automate traditionally white collar tasks, and soon the blue collar tasks, will likely seriously disrupt employment trends.
The time to rethink the purpose of a college education is right now. In a world where work is deprioritized, what would be the point of the economic incentives of a college education? Disentangling income from education can provide the next great catalyst for higher education and for society. While it is important for faculty to prepare students for their future careers, in a world where we cannot even guess what those will be, we also must learn to help them think critically, with a mind to global awareness and cultural humility.
If we do so, we will know we’re not just preparing them for jobs, but for vocations, especially in an unknown economy where data centers power artificial employees. After all, the college students of today who build skills and maintain intellectual flexibility will soon become the generation that shapes the future for all of us.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Flying with the Indiana State Police isn’t as simple as being a trooper and having a pilot’s license. Sgt. David Ploog came out of the academy with five years of flying experience under his belt with the U.S. Army, but still worked on the ground for roughly a decade. When a former ISP pilot left to join the National Guard full time, Ploog — who still flies with the Army and has been with the Indiana National Guard for 24 years — was tapped to join.
“I always knew I would fly for the department, just didn’t know I’d be doing it this soon,” Ploog told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. He’s now been flying with ISP for roughly three years.

Staffing has ebbed and flowed over the decades. At one point, the aviation wing had a dozen aircraft, with mechanics and over 20 pilots spread out across the state. Today, all five of the state’s aircraft are located within a state trooper outpost in Greenwood.
The central location, nestled by a field of corn right off the interstate, means that most ISP aircraft can reach every part of the state within an hour. 
Today, there are six full-time pilots — most of whom are troopers with the exception of one retired trooper who now flies as a civilian — alongside a handful of Tactical Flight Officers, or TFOs. Of the latter, just one is full time while the others are part time, shifting from other trooper duties as needed. 
One trooper and one TFO are always on call, though not every flight requires a TFO. 
Ploog said that TFOs are necessary when operating the aircraft’s specialized camera systems, including the so-called Churchill navigation system that can pinpoint an address and keep a camera locked onto that location regardless of movement.
“They’re responsible for that camera system, radio communications with the ground and just performing general police duties,” said Ploog. “That way the pilot can focus on flying, obstacle avoidance and safe aircraft operation.” 
With fewer and fewer law enforcement agencies retaining their aircraft, ISP pitches itself as a free resource available to local departments. Just one other county — northern Indiana’s Lake County — has aircraft.
“Other than that, it falls on us. It’s our responsibility to support 91 other counties,” Ploog said. “The county units, the city units, the town units — if they need aircraft, they come to us.”
 Flying missions

In a presentation geared toward sharing the aviation unit’s resources with other law enforcement agencies, Ploog spoke about the department’s overall mission to support units on the ground — no matter their law enforcement agency. 
Specific missions fall into general categories, including: 

Search and rescue
Law enforcement patrol/support
Surveillance/situational awareness
Pre-raid surveillance for warrants
Aerial photography/videography
Casualty evacuation 
Marijuana eradication
General transportation
Disaster assessment 

“Bottom line: we support units on the ground,” said Ploog. “We don’t have our own … flying club where our goal is to get 100 hours this month.”
From the air, aviators can tell on-the-ground officers about details invisible from their perspective  — whether it’s a leaking tank after a semi accident or a suspect reaching into their pocket during a tense standoff. At large events like the Indiana State Fair or the Indy 500, a bird’s eye view can spot potential dangers to the public and monitor without interference.
The presence of ISP helicopters, in particular, have gained a reputation in Indianapolis’ street racing community, Ploog said. Aircraft now have to keep their distance until ground units are in place.

“As soon as they know a helicopter’s in the area, they disperse and they take off. It’s a show stopper,” Ploog said.
Some aircraft even operate lasers to guide officers with night vision goggles to specific locations. And though the cameras can capture eerily good details — Ploog said heat sensors can sometimes pick up expressions, since lips are typically cooler than other parts of the face — there are still limitations.
Hot weather disrupts heat sensors, which can be used to track fleeing suspects across miles or identify lost persons, while buildings and thick foliage can obscure camera angles. Humans still make mistakes, sometimes identifying a sleeping coyote as a potential body.
Ploog estimated that roughly 80% of the aviation wing’s time is devoted to crime fighting, while the remaining 20% is spent on finding someone who is lost — whether it’s a hiker, an elderly person with dementia or a child far from home.
Aircraft software can even hone in on specific locations sent from trackers like Project Lifesaver, which was recently used to identify a lost child with autism. The heat sensors can find a man with dementia who laid between rows of corn just a few rows deep — far enough that it could have taken hours to find him without the technology.
Some states even cross-train their aviators to be paramedics, beefing up emergency responses in rural areas — though that’s not yet the case in Indiana, such efforts could be explored in the future.
 Less common missions

Different aircraft serve different purposes. Of the unit’s five aircraft, two are fixed-wing planes — capable of holding just one to two passengers in addition to the pilot. These planes can be used to target marijuana growing operations or traffic enforcement. 
Early, black-and-white photos of the ISP’s aviation wing show these pilots often traveling solo with a shackled prisoner, transporting detainees quickly from location to location.
Now, such transport is generally reserved for other purposes. 
Ploog estimated that he’d done two transports so far this year, so rarely that “I almost forget that those even pop up.” 
“We try to facilitate the need as best we can,” Ploog continued.

Sometimes such requests can come when troopers are already dispatched to various parts of the state, and just need to adjust time frames. But Ploog said such transports have also been abandoned in favor of higher priority missions like missing persons or criminal activity. 
Once, Ploog said the unit was tasked with transporting a special prosecutor who had cases back-to-back and wouldn’t meet the commitments otherwise. Another example includes a bird flu researcher from Purdue University. 
More recently, Gov. Mike Braun has made headlines for using ISP’s helicopters to go from the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis to his private home in Jasper.
The governor’s office said ISP “expects” pilots to fly regularly, and the state said flight hours were necessary for other reasons. 
Ploog said that while helicopters were flown daily, weather permitting, there weren’t any set hours. Rather, regular flights were necessary to maintain the aircraft and keep aviators sharp.
ISP’s aviation wing has three helicopters that hold between two to four passengers. The oldest dates back to 1983 and has nearly 10,000 hours of flight time while another is unadorned and used more for general transportation purposes. 
Depending on the conditions and models, aircraft can usually fly for a few hours until they need to refuel. These are additional considerations for aviators like Ploog, who need to plan out those sorts of trips in advance.
“It’s a privilege to be here,” Ploog concluded. “Where else can I get paid to operate million-dollar aircrafts for — and really, I don’t want to sound cliche — but to help the public. It’s what I signed up for and to put it all together, it’s amazing.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)As governor, Tim Walz has passed a range of progressive policies to benefit the people of Minnesota. He signed the state’s landmark law requiring carbon-free power by 2040, a measure meant to put Minnesotans first in the clean energy transition. 
But if the governor’s own Public Utilities Commission signs off on Wall Street giant BlackRock’s attempted takeover of Allete and Minnesota Power, the decision could undercut his legacy, his promises, and the very communities he represents.
All five PUC commissioners are Walz appointees. A Department of Commerce representative, part of his administration, has seemingly been shown — through records obtained by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project — to be communicating with a handful of “clean energy” groups that filed last-minute comments in support of the deal. 
At the most recent PUC hearing, Commissioner Audrey Partridge — a Walz appointee and former employee of one of those groups — gave them a platform to speak in support of BlackRock’s proposed deal, while requests from ordinary Minnesotans were ignored. This is after an independent investigation found that one of these very “clean energy” groups now backing the BlackRock takeover have accepted industry-linked funding — including money raised at a fundraiser supported by Allete itself and counsel for the private equity firm buyer. According to CURE MN, members of the public had submitted requests to testify at this same hearing but were denied. 
Given these actions, are Walz’s appointees tilting the process toward BlackRock instead of the public they are supposed to serve?
The facts on the record are damning. In her report, Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie recommended denial of the BlackRock deal, finding it not in the public interest and likely to result in rate increases to MN Power customers. Approving it could mean higher electric bills, less transparency, and a less stable grid. 
For Indigenous communities, accusations of BlackRock’s record on Indigenous issues offers a troubling preview of what’s to come in Minnesota. In South Texas, for example, BlackRock and its subsidiary GIP are backing the Rio Grande LNG terminal, which members of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe say will be built on their ancestral land.
This BlackRock deal could hinder Minnesota’s 2040 carbon-free mandate, since there’s no requirement that BlackRock advance this clean energy vision. As the administrative law judge concluded, the petitioners have not shown the acquisition is necessary to meet the state’s clean energy goals.
BlackRock’s hand-picked spokesperson at the September PUC hearing, Jonathan Bram, claimed he would be “personally devastated” if Minnesota Power failed under his watch. 
Yet during his time as a board member, SunPower collapsed into bankruptcy in August 2024, citing erroneous financials that rendered the company unable to secure financing. 
PESP documented Bram’s oversight failures in expert testimony and follow-up research. That is the track record Walz’s PUC is being asked to believe in. Commissioner Joe Sullivan literally characterized it as a leap of faith in the hearing.
This is Walz’s decision. If the PUC approves BlackRock’s takeover, it will be his commissioners who rubber-stamped it. It will be his Department of Commerce that greased the skids. And it will be his constituents who pay the price — in higher bills, diminished accountability, and a utility no longer owned by the people it serves. 
The PUC commissioners are supposed to protect the Minnesota public. The public, numerous experts, and the state administrative law judge are telling them this deal is bad for Minnesota.
Minnesotans should ask: Will Walz stand with you? Or with BlackRock?
With the final PUC hearing and decision scheduled for October 3, that deadline now belongs to the governor.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2165923397.jpg,,,2025-10-01 09:57:58.795050

(Photos by Dana DiFilippo, Hal Brown, and Amanda Brown)The two front-runners in this year’s gubernatorial race don’t have many overlapping proposals, but their main pledge is the same: to make New Jersey, a state with some of the highest taxes in the country, more affordable.
Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s plans range from revamping how state aid is distributed to schools to promising to veto pet projects in the state budget if he’s elected governor in November. Ciattarelli on the campaign trail has reminisced about days when he said more people would come to New Jersey to start a family, open a business, and retire here.
“Those are the things that people feel terribly insecure, if not fearful of, today, and I refuse to be the governor of a state in which people live with insecurity and fear,” he said at a recent campaign stop in Elizabeth.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat hoping to keep the governorship in her party’s hands for the third term in a row, has also made lowering costs a chief plank of her campaign for the state’s top job.
“I’m going to be fiscally responsible with your money, I’m going to drive down your costs at every level, and I’m going to make sure your kids have great opportunities here in the state of New Jersey,” she said earlier this month when the two candidates met for their first debate at Rider University in Lawrenceville.
The two are vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat. Here are five ways Ciattarelli and Sherrill say they would reduce costs if elected on Nov. 4.

Property taxes
Ciattarelli wants to cap property taxes by linking them to a percentage of a home’s assessed value, a move he said would help make home ownership a reality for more young people. 
“We want people to own a home again. In this country, you build equity with home ownership,” he said. 
Utilities
Ratepayers in New Jersey were socked with 20% increases starting in June (rates are expected to rise again next year after a price-setting auction held in July).
Ciattarelli blames Murphy and Trenton Democrats for the increase, citing the Murphy administration’s push for offshore wind farms that failed to become a reality and its reliance on out-of-state power generation.
“As governor, I’ll ban offshore wind and diversify our energy sources in New Jersey to once again include natural gas and nuclear,” he says in a campaign ad.
Small business
Ciattarelli has called for the first $100,000 of income for small businesses to be tax-free and for the first $100,000 of their payroll to be exempt from employer payroll taxes.
“Watch entrepreneurship take off in New Jersey,” Ciattarelli told reporters after the Rider debate.
Corporate business tax
Ciattarelli has vowed to slash the state’s corporate business tax over six years. Currently, businesses are taxed between 6.5% and 9%, and businesses with a taxable income greater than $10 million face an additional, non-marginal 2.5% surcharge. He has proposed reducing the top tax rate by 1% annually for six years.
Income taxes
New Jersey’s income tax is paid under a series of marginal rates that increase along with the filer’s income, starting at 1.4% and topping out at 10.75% for income that exceeds $1 million. There are five tax brackets in between.
Ciattarelli has called for three tax brackets that top out at 5%.
“We’re going to restructure and simplify our income tax rates. Pennsylvania has a 3% flat tax for everybody … We’re going to simplify it. I’m in favor, at the very least, of three brackets. 3%, 4%, 5%.”
Sherrill supporter Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) echoed her campaign-trail threat that Ciattarelli will raise taxes if elected, noting that Ciattarelli voted to raise taxes when he held local elected positions. Sherrill, Gopal said, is focused on lowering property taxes, increasing shared services, and addressing skyrocketing utility costs.
“You look at Jack’s six years in the Assembly with Chris Christie, they raised taxes those years. So I’m not sure there’s anything to say that any voters I’ve talked to have any confidence Jack is going to make things more affordable,” he said.

Property taxes
Sherrill has said shared municipal and school services could drive down property taxes, and supports mandatory consolidation of certain school districts.
“We have some school districts who have the whole administrative cost, all of the buildings, and yet they’re not even running a K-12 school system, so we do need to merge some of these school districts,” she said at the Rider debate.
Utilities
Sherrill’s response to rising electricity prices is to propose a state of emergency on her first day as governor, one she claims will allow her to freeze utility rates.
“When I take office, the average New Jersey family won’t see an increase in utility rates for an entire year,” she said at an event in August. 
Health care
Sherrill’s health care plan includes driving down prescription drug costs by requiring pharmacy benefit managers — middlemen who negotiate drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of insurers —  to pass discounts directly to patients. She said she’d also remove incentives that allow them to pick expensive drugs for coverage.
“I’ll hold PBMs accountable for achieving cost savings for consumers, not lining their own pockets, making sure they’re not directing consumers towards those more expensive drugs that are driving up their costs,” she said in a May campaign video. 
Small business
Sherrill has proposed removing “red tape” for small businesses and making the permit-approval process more transparent so residents aren’t wasting time and money on redundant forms. She said it’s too hard for new business owners to obtain permits, and they often find themselves lost in paperwork. 
“But a lot of this is going to be a culture change in Trenton, as we have a ‘get to yes’ culture, instead of a ‘gotcha’ culture,” she said.
Food
Sherrill wants to lower the rising cost of groceries by offering incentives to local grocers to open more stores, which she said will create more competition, lower prices, and address food deserts. 
“My affordability agenda is about making New Jersey work for the working people,” she said.
Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican strategist, praised Ciattarelli’s tax reduction plans and called it “a big red flag” that Sherrill, at the Rider debate, declined to commit to not raising the state’s 6.65% sales tax.
“Jack has a place to address every single problem, they’re very specific, and he can talk about them in detail and in a reasonable way. He has a better command of the issues,” she said.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Initial fall 2025 enrollment numbers reported by Indiana’s public colleges and universities show growth in first-year students at several campuses, even as the state continues to grapple with a consistently low college-going rate.
The announcements come on the heels of new state data showing that just 51.7% of Indiana high school graduates in 2023 went directly to college, continuing a years-long dip in enrollment among Hoosier students. 
State leaders have emphasized that the trend highlights a need for more aggressive recruitment, degree program realignment and increased affordability measures as Indiana reshapes its higher education landscape.
The Indiana Commission for Higher Education released data that show overall enrollment at statewide public institutions increased for the fourth consecutive year, growing by over 4,200 students, or approximately 2%, from fall 2024.
“Indiana’s higher education institutions continue to move the needle on increasing enrollment, particularly with resident students,” said Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery. “Through intentional, strategic initiatives geared toward helping our fellow Hoosiers, such as Indiana Pre-Admissions, more Hoosier students and families are being informed of, and choosing to attend, the colleges and universities right here in Indiana.”
Gains reported across public colleges, universities
At Indiana University, overall enrollment climbed to 89,247 students, including 25,308 new undergraduate and graduate students, according to a Sept. 8 news release.
The university welcomed a record 16,636 beginners, a 6.7% increase over last year. IU Bloomington set a new high with 48,626 students, while IU’s online programming topped 10,000 students for the first time.
Indiana’s college-going rate drops again, dipping to 51.7%

President Pamela Whitten said in a statement that fall enrollment “affirms that the word is out about the exceptional quality of an IU education.”
Purdue University again broke application records, receiving 86,953 applications for its incoming undergraduate class. Officials called it the most selective class in university history, while also touting Purdue’s highest graduation rate to date. 
As of Sept. 16, university officials said 8,914 new undergraduate and 3,189 new graduate students are beginning their first semester at the flagship campus in West Lafayette, along with 666 new undergraduates and 30 new graduate students in Indianapolis.
Still, the Journal and Courier reported that both out-of-state and international enrollments declined year-over-year. The rate of admission for out-of-state undergraduates dropped to 39%, down from 45% the prior year — a shift Purdue officials attributed in part to pressures on housing and infrastructure after last year’s unexpected enrollment surge.
Meanwhile, international student enrollment across Purdue’s campuses fell nearly 15% year-over-year. A similar drop in international student enrollment was recorded at Indiana University.
Trevor Peters, a university spokesperson, said that some of the decline reflects a “slightly smaller class” the university opted to admit this cycle, partly in response to the “surprising jump” in enrolled students in recent years, Axios reported.
Visa delays and tightened immigration policies — affecting international enrollments nationally — are also a likely factor.
Indiana State University, meanwhile, reported its largest freshman class in five years, enrolling 1,602 first-time, full-time students — a 13% increase from 2024. Nearly half are first-generation students and more than half are eligible for Pell Grants. Total undergraduate enrollment rose 2% to 6,352. ISU also set a record with 415 students entering its Honors College.

At the University of Southern Indiana, this fall marked the third consecutive year of freshman enrollment growth. USI welcomed 1,367 first-time freshmen, up 3.5% from last year. 
University officials said that overall headcount dipped slightly due to small declines in graduate and dual-credit students, but the school highlighted gains in retention and credit hours. 
President Steven J. Bridges said “these achievements demonstrate that USI is not only attracting more students but supporting them as they thrive.”
Vincennes University additionally reported “positive enrollment growth.” Headcount at its main campus rose 5% to 2,481 students, the highest since 2023. Enrollment at the Aviation Technology Center in Indianapolis surged 39%, while the Jasper campus saw a 23% jump in new full-time students.
Ivy Tech Community College, the state’s largest postsecondary system, has not yet provided statewide fall 2025 numbers, but some of the community college’s campuses have already reported local gains.
Paula Luff, Ball State University’s vice president for enrollment planning and management, reported that Ball State welcomed 3,733 new freshmen this fall. This is the third consecutive year in which the university has enrolled a freshman class larger than its pre-pandemic average.
More work ahead
The enrollment announcements come amid sweeping changes across Indiana’s higher education system. 
Earlier this year, CHE updated its degree review process and schools have already cut or merged hundreds of programs across public campuses. Leaders said the move is meant to ensure “relevance and performance” in degree offerings.
State commissioners have also warned that institutions will need to adapt to shifting student demographics, declining numbers of high school graduates and changes to workforce demands. 
Members of the CHE board emphasized earlier this year that Indiana’s higher education landscape will especially require new strategies to attract and retain students.
As part of that effort, Indiana has rolled out a suite of programs.
A major lever is the 21st Century Scholars program, which saw its enrollment more than double after a 2023 law allowed all income-eligible students to be automatically enrolled.
Story continues below.
5-Preadmissions
 
There are already 48,000 ninth-graders in the 2029 cohort, according to the latest CHE data — although students must still activate their accounts, meet GPA and diploma requirements, and file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. 
Lawmakers also made FAFSA completion mandatory. About 55% of the Class of 2025 had completed the FAFSA by April 15. But among 21st Century Scholars, the completion rate was closer to 66%, according to CHE. By June 30, those rates rose to 60% and 72%, respectively.
To lift those rates even more, CHE staff said they’re running a statewide FAFSA campaign with in-school “filing days,” mailings, media outreach and social media infographics.
CHE now sends “pre-admissions” letters to eligible high school seniors, too, letting them know they qualify for admission at up to three Indiana colleges. This fall, commission staff expect to send more than 74,000 letters to students at 456 Indiana high schools. Forty-one campuses — 18 public and 22 private — are extending pre-admission offers to eligible students this school year.
Separately, CHE is sending thousands of “Enrollment Ready” letters to the state’s 9th, 10th, and 11th graders to encourage and prepare students to enroll in college after graduation.
Additionally, included in the state’s high school diploma redesign is a new “seal” that officials said should help streamline more college-bound students to Hoosier institutions. 
Under a law passed this year, students who graduate with the new diploma and earn an “Enrollment Honors Plus Seal” are automatically admitted to all public colleges. At least 300 Hoosier students in the 2026 cohort are on the path to obtaining that seal as of Sept. 12, according to CHE.
The agency is further pushing earlier outreach through its “Enrollment Ready” initiative and encouraging high schools to offer the 30-credit Indiana College Core, which transfers across campuses and boosts the odds of college enrollment.
CHE officials emphasized that in 2023, 2,625 students earned the College Core — an increase from prior years — and 91% of them enrolled in college.

His wife’s full-time job with benefits provides the family with health insurance, but for Raboin, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made an important difference for some of his employees.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


“We don’t offer insurance ourselves,” Raboin said during a recent round table discussion set up by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin). “A lot of small businesses in small towns aren’t in a financial place to do that.”
Like Raboin, some of his employees get their coverage through a spouse or because they also work another full-time job that provides benefits. But over the years, the ACA and the HealthCare.gov marketplace created under the law have been a critical source of health coverage for many of his employees, Raboin said.
Recently he polled a number of them. One memorable response came from a part-time employee who also has a part-time job with a local church. She buys her health insurance on HealthCare.gov. Thanks to an increase enacted in 2021 in tax credit subsidies, she’s been able to afford the premiums, Raboin said she told him.
“So without it, she’s like, ‘I can’t keep working for you. And I don’t think I keep working for my church. I think I have to find a different job,’” Raboin recalled.
The ACA and HealthCare.gov have made it possible for millions more Americans and thousands more Wisconsin residents to obtain health insurance.
But less visibly, the health care marketplace that the ACA created has also helped support many small businesses. If the enhanced tax credit subsidies that lowered the cost of health insurance for millions over the last three years aren’t renewed, small business owners and employees say they could be especially hard hit.
Nearly half of people who get their health insurance through the HealthCare.gov marketplace are self-employed or small business owners, or else work for small businesses, according to KFF, an independent nonprofit that researches and reports on health policy.
To expand access to health care, the ACA created the HealthCare.gov marketplace to make buying health insurance easier for people whose jobs don’t provide coverage and who don’t qualify for government programs such as Medicaid.
To make coverage more affordable, the law provides tax credit subsidies for people with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty guideline. Those subsidies were increased in 2021 and expanded to people with higher incomes.
The enhanced subsidies will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress extends them — driving up the cost of health insurance for millions.
The enhanced subsidy “saves more than 230,000 Wisconsinites an average of $500 every single month,” Baldwin said during a Zoom press conference Tuesday.
For Chrysa Ostenso and her late husband, the enhanced subsidies lowered their premiums from nearly $2,000 a month to about $300 a month, Ostenso said.
Ostenso lives in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, where she and her husband operated an optometry clinic for more than three decades, raising four children along the way.
“We always struggled to afford health insurance but of course we had to buy it,” Ostenso said in an interview. “As a family of four kids with a small business, you can’t go without health insurance.”
The family’s high deductible plans required them to pay $6,000 a year out of pocket before insurance would cover their health care. By 2020, when the children were grown and the health plan just covered Ostenso and her husband, they were paying $1,979 a month, she said.
They hadn’t qualified for the original ACA subsidies. When the enhanced subsidies were enacted in 2021, however, Ostenso said their premiums went down to $300 a month, increasing to $500 a month in subsequent years.
“It actually meant freedom to go to the doctor, because we were spending so much money on our premiums [previously] that we actually couldn’t afford to go to the doctor,” she said.
Standoff over extending subsidies
In the weeks leading up to Tuesday night’s federal shutdown, Democrats in Congress demanded that Republicans rescind sweeping changes to Medicaid that were part of the major tax- and spending-cuts megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.
They also demanded an extension of the enhanced ACA subsidies.
Baldwin has coauthored legislation that would make the enhanced subsidies permanent. She spent part of the just-concluded congressional recess traveling Wisconsin and meeting with people who expect to see their health costs go up sharply if the increased subsidies end.
During Tuesday’s press conference, Baldwin related a conversation with a  bakery owner who worried about how she and her family will afford health insurance, “but also that increased costs on the [HealthCare.gov] exchange will mean that her employees at her bakery may have to quit to work for big companies that offer insurance.”
During Baldwin’s press conference, Gigi Gastevich, an artist who owns a retail space in Stoughton, said the ACA and the enhanced subsidies had made it possible for her to launch and grow her business.
Gastevich is a 15-year cancer survivor. When starting her business, she qualified for BadgerCare — Wisconsin’s main Medicaid program — which covered the ongoing medical monitoring she requires as a cancer survivor.
In 2025, with her income above the limit for BadgerCare, she found an insurance plan on HealthCare.gov that included her existing health care professionals in its network and had an affordable deductible.
The plan’s premium was $481 a month, Gastevich said, but the enhanced subsidy  brought it down to about $100 a month.
Without the subsidy, she said, she will have to switch plans — possibly losing her long-standing group of providers if they aren’t in the network. She said her choices include taking a high-deductible plan that would put some of the regular care she’s been recommended as a cancer survivor out of reach financially; or closing down her business. 
“[That] would mean not only abandoning my dream of entrepreneurship and being a self-employed artist, but taking away an income source for the dozens of artists and artisans whose American-made work I sell here,” Gastevich said.
It would also forestall her plans to scale up her business to sell her own line of textiles and employ others. “I won’t be able to do that if my health and well-being is tied to being on an employer-based health care plan,” she added.
Uncertain future
During her tour of the state, Baldwin stopped in Mount Horeb on Thursday, Sept. 25, where she spoke with Brix owner Matt Raboin and four other business owners as well as local health care providers.
The round table took place at the Upland Hills Health Mount Horeb clinic. The urgent care clinic is part of a broader system that includes a hospital in Dodgeville and clinics in surrounding communities.
Dr. Mark Thompson, Upland Hills CEO, said system executives expect to see about $400,000 a year in additional uncompensated care based on projections of people leaving the insurance rolls because they don’t think they can afford the new ACA premiums.
Jay Goninen sat in as a board member of the Upland Hills system, but he’s also an employer for whom the ACA has made it possible to provide health benefits.
Goninen owns a business that helps connect the auto repair industry with high schools and technical schools. For the last few years, he’s opted to have employees of the firm purchase health insurance on the ACA.
The company pays a portion of the cost. Goninen likens the arrangement to a common practice of employers who offer a group health plan and split the cost with their employees.
“I do really worry about just the individual person and their ability to afford to live right now, in general,” he told Baldwin. “It is tough.”
In addition to worrying about what will happen to employees who bought coverage at HealthCare.gov if they lose their subsidies, Raboin said he’s also concerned about the broader ripple effect in the community.
“Our clients aren’t rich,” Raboin said. “Not everybody can go out to eat all the time, and if you start taking away that expendable income, that’s less people coming out to eat. So I think it would depress the whole economy.”
Rachel LaCasse-Ford owns a campground with her husband and also heads the Mount Horeb Chamber of Commerce.
“I’ve never really had a job that offers health care,” LaCasse-Ford told Baldwin. “I’ve always worked in small business, so we have always used health care from the ACA.”
The enhanced tax credits “definitely benefited” the couple, she said. “And if those go away, that will make our budgets tighter, and it will make things more challenging for us.”
With every new job, LaCasse-Ford said, she considers its impact on their health coverage and whether she can stay with a nonprofit employer such as the chamber, work for a small business, “or if I need to look for a larger employer that offers benefits.”

More than a year after shedding jobs and closing campuses, the outdoor leadership and wilderness medicine school shared new economic impact data at 60th anniversary event.
The post Lander-based NOLS brings $19M benefit to Wyoming, but is still in financial hole appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Lander-based National Outdoor Leadership School celebrated its 60th anniversary with a cluster of high-profile events last week, President Sandy Calhoun delivered mixed news regarding the state of the organization.
The good: NOLS, which is among Fremont County’s top employers, contributed $18.7 million to the state’s economy in 2024. 
The bad: More than a year after shedding dozens of jobs and closing some campuses, the nonprofit school has yet to right its financial ship.
“We have extraordinary momentum at this moment,” Calhoun told a large crowd of NOLS instructors, alumni and friends during a public speech Friday in Lander, before tempering his message. “We’re doing great, but we’re not out of the woods yet.”
Calhoun’s presentation offered insight into the evolution and challenges involved in running what has grown into a multifaceted, $40 million global organization.

With multiple campuses, hundreds of employees and thousands of alumni, NOLS offers expeditions in locales ranging from Alaska to India and Kenya. The school is also a leading provider of wilderness medical training. It offers customized education courses, semesters in the field and instructor certification.  
It’s got a lot going on, in other words. 
In March 2024, the school restructured, citing an operational shortfall caused by declining student field days and other factors. NOLS eliminated 60 positions and suspended three campuses.
Those changes put the school on a trajectory out of deficit, Calhoun said, but “we’re not there yet.” NOLS experienced a $3.6 million operating loss in 2025, he said. 
“So what’s our playbook for the future?” he asked. “We have to focus on financial rigor. We have to continue to reduce costs, year over year.”
Brighter news  
One of the more positive moments came when Calhoun unveiled the highlights of an economic impact study conducted by University of Wyoming researchers. 
The study found that in fiscal year 2024, NOLS supported 142 jobs and generated $16 million in economic output in Fremont County, where it’s among the top 8% of employers. 
“Due to its significant presence, NOLS has a substantial impact on the economy of Wyoming and Fremont County in particular,” the study states, adding that the school also makes meaningful non-economic contributions to the state.

“For example, NOLS Wilderness Medicine provides emergency medicine training to the University of Wyoming Medical school first-year class, the Fremont County Search and Rescue team, Shoshone National Forest rangers, and over 450 EMTs annually qualified to work in the State of Wyoming,” it reads. “Additionally, NOLS contributes to Wyoming’s culture of outdoor recreation, leadership, and stewardship through the courses and experiences it provides to students.”
When you extrapolate that data over decades, Calhoun said, “NOLS has been such a huge contributor to the state of Wyoming, and we’re proud of it, and it’s a story we haven’t told.”
NOLS has certainly helped shape Lander’s culture and economy — attracting many who end up putting down roots in the remote mountain town. But there is also occasional friction between long-time locals and the school, which mainly enrolls out-of-towners for wilderness courses.
In late 2024, Lander’s city council gave NOLS an economic development LIFT Grant of $45,000 for its 60th anniversary festivities. Many residents censured the move as a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars that could be better put toward things like infrastructure needs. 
NOLS Board Chair John Babcock, who introduced Calhoun on Friday, addressed the grant controversy. 
“We brought hundreds of people to town” for the anniversary events, Babcock said, and “100% of [the grant] investment went directly back into this community … and so it’s been a great reinvestment in Lander.”
Kids these days 
Accomplished mountaineer Paul Petzoldt started NOLS out of a cabin in Sinks Canyon near Lander in 1965. The founder had a vision of teaching leadership and outdoor skills on wilderness expeditions. 
Six decades later, what began as a humble operation has grown into a seasoned heavyweight in the world of outdoor education. NOLS itself isn’t the only thing that’s different.
“Over the last 60 years, our mission and our values have held steady, but the world around us has changed,” Babcock said. Some of the most drastic differences are in students, he noted. Young people are increasingly brought up to avoid risk. They’re also logging more time online.

When the organization began, he said, “most students arrived at NOLS with experience just exploring their own neighborhoods unsupervised, and today, many students arrive with far less of that. Today, for many of our students, a NOLS course is the first time offline in their life.”
There are also encouraging trends among young people, Calhoun said. 
“There’s all this good news that points to the idea that we should have a line out the door,” he said. Nearly 70% of young folks see themselves as outdoorsy, and 80% of Gen Z and millennials want to spend more time outside, according to industry research, he said. 
While that creates more demand, companies with outdoor offerings have also proliferated. “The reality, and this is a huge reality for NOLS, is that we are in such a competitive place.” 
NOLS’ student satisfaction is consistently high, he added, which reflects very positively on the organization. But the school needs to return key metrics like student time on field courses to growth patterns and find ways to operate in the black. 
“We’re not necessarily where we want to be,” Calhoun said. “And there’s work to do.”

Wyoming has never been free from outside money, but that amounting to political influence is not a foregone conclusion, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Outside money inside The Big Empty appeared first on WyoFile .","I recently participated in a panel discussion in Lander focusing on problems we face in Wyoming and how to address them. There were 150 or so attendees from Lander and the surrounding environs in the audience, all well-behaved, engaged and curious. Pretty much anywhere you go in the Cowboy State to discuss the current political atmosphere these days, you can draw a standing-room-only crowd.

Opinion

One of the questions asked of the panel was, and I’ll paraphrase, “How do we fight the influence of all the outside money pouring into Wyoming, trying to change the state we love?” That is certainly a valid question, and heads nodded throughout the audience when it was asked. Nobody wants to see outsiders shoving their weight around in the Big Empty just because they have wads of cash in their out-of-state bank accounts.
I think I shocked the crowd when it came my turn to answer, and I said, “Wyoming has NEVER been free from the influence of outside money.”
If you don’t believe that statement, go to your bookshelf, and pull down that dusty old copy of T.A. Larson’s “History of Wyoming” (and we’ll all tip our Stetsons when Larson’s name is mentioned) and re-read his definitive work. You’ll see for yourself that Wyoming has never been immune from the effects of outside money. Never!
Furthermore, why would we want to look down our sunburned noses at outside money? It is precisely what made our state what it is today.
If anyone had reason to look askance at the influence of outside money, it was the Native American tribes who watched pale-faced mountain men traipsing up and down frigid mountain streams in search of beaver pelts. The fur industry was Wyoming’s first lucrative commercial enterprise, and it was funded by outside corporate interests — the American Fur Company, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company.
The next splash of outside money capitalized Wyoming’s hardrock mining industry, first in the South Pass gold fields, and later the copper bonanza in the Sierra Madre. Enough of the profits stayed in Wyoming to create local wealth, but most of it was deposited in the financial institutions of the Great Elsewhere.
Outside money from Texas and Great Britain created the range livestock industry, and gave our state its namesake cowboy. The cattle industry is still the most culturally significant part of Wyoming’s past, but it was never homegrown. It came about due to the influence of outside money.
The same offshore capital built the Union Pacific Railroad through our southern counties. That benchmark project was light-years beyond the means of local Wyoming capital, so out-of-state interests stepped up with shady schemes like Crédit Mobilier to get the thing built. That infusion of non-Wyoming money yielded lasting results that still influence Wyoming today.
Pennsylvania wildcatter Mike Murphy drilled the first producing well in Wyoming’s oil patch, and his discovery was quickly followed up by national oil companies that perforated our state to extract her wealth. Our coal industry too, which began to fuel non-resident-owned locomotives, is now dominated by out-of-state corporations.
Today’s emerging industries, from “green” energy to massive data centers, all owe their beginnings to outside money. Simply put, Wyoming would not exist without “outside money” as much as we would like to think otherwise.
Now, perhaps the question posed to the panel was directed specifically at the flood of “outside money” flowing into our state to influence our political thinking. That is a different kettle of fish (or money) entirely.
Lord knows there is plenty of it buying political ads, putting up billboards and packing our mailboxes full of garishly offensive flyers. It represents a tsunami of bullshit and, make no mistake, it originates from every point on the political spectrum.
The motive behind this mountain of dough is not profit, but power. And it is protected by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in “Citizens United”, which concludes that money equals free speech, covered by the First Amendment.
As I told the audience in Lander, the best way to insulate ourselves from this corrosive outside money is for every Wyomingite to make sure that their personal bullshit detector is fully charged and the filter is routinely cleaned. Our best defense against the caustic effects of this outside political money is to simply not believe what it says. That is something each and every one of us can do.
A better understanding of our own Wyoming history would help, too.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)MERIDIAN — By one early afternoon in late August, Dr. Colleen McNicholas had already inserted an IUD, seen a patient to provide gender-affirming care and helped a patient access HIV prevention medication. 

At the last Planned Parenthood in Idaho, located just outside Boise, she said the clinic handles “really anything that somebody needs for their sexual and reproductive health care, basically from puberty through menopause.”
After the Idaho Legislature’s near-total abortion ban took effect three years ago, the state has lost more than a third of its OB-GYN doctors — and new recruits aren’t making up for the losses, a peer-reviewed study recently found. Planned Parenthood has expanded services to fill in gaps left behind, said McNicholas, an OB-GYN at the clinic and the chief clinical transformation officer for the regional Planned Parenthood affiliate. 
Without Planned Parenthood, other Idaho health care providers couldn’t easily pick up the slack on routine reproductive care because there just isn’t enough infrastructure, McNicholas said. If Idaho’s only Planned Parenthood clinic closed, other health centers in Idaho would see a 23% increase in patients seeking contraceptives, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute that found that federally qualified health centers can’t easily replace Planned Parenthood. 
But the budget reconciliation bill known colloquially as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” passed by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump, will prevent Medicaid from funding any services at Planned Parenthood for a year because of its association with the broader organization and its clinics that provide abortion care. That’s on top of a federal law that bans federal funds from funding abortions, and the Trump administration recently stripping other federal funds from Planned Parenthood.

 Federal appeals court upholds law blocking Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services

Despite the cuts, Idaho’s last clinic is here to stay, said Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of the largest regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, which covers Idaho and five other states. 
“We aren’t going anywhere. While it’s hard for us to operate in such a hostile political environment, we aren’t going to turn our backs on our patients in the same way that lawmakers have done,” Gibron told the Idaho Capital Sun.
A federal appeals court recently allowed the GOP-backed law’s provision blocking Medicaid from funding Planned Parenthood services to go into effect. The court, in a brief decision without explaining its reasoning, overturned a lower court’s block on the funding ban that came in response to a lawsuit by Planned Parenthood, States Newsroom reported.

Starting in October, patients who had used Medicaid at the clinic must pay out of pocket, Planned Parenthood announced in a news release after the court’s ruling. 
Idaho’s last clinic has been a “lifeline,” Gibron said. If it closed, she said more patients might not get treatment for the range of reproductive health care services that Planned Parenthood provides — risking undetected cancers, rising sexually transmitted infections and more unplanned pregnancies.
“This was never only about abortion. This is about dismantling a critical access to care safety net provider in the state of Idaho that provides comprehensive, compassionate sexual and reproductive health care,” Gibron said. “These politicians are going after Planned Parenthood because of who we are, because of the services that we provide, and because of what we stand for.”
 Even with Medicaid cuts, Planned Parenthood is looking to make care affordable and accessible

The clinic in Meridian became Idaho’s last clinic after Planned Parenthood closed locations in Twin Falls and in Boise following funding cuts during the first Trump administration.
An hour away from Boise, Planned Parenthood set up a new clinic in Ontario, Oregon, to provide abortions after Idaho’s near-total abortion ban took effect. And on the border of North Idaho, Planned Parenthood runs another clinic in Pullman, Washington, a short drive from the college town of Moscow, Idaho.
But as Idaho’s only Planned Parenthood clinic, the Meridian clinic draws people from across the state to visit for care. In the past year, some of the clinic’s roughly 5,000 patients traveled from more than a dozen rural Idaho counties, according to the organization.

About 15% of the clinic’s patients are on Medicaid, accounting for nearly 10% of its patient revenue. The goal is to keep treating those patients, and to find a way to fund their care without payments from Medicaid once the cuts from the budget bill come through, Gibron said.
McNicholas hopes people understand that Planned Parenthood isn’t fighting for just abortion access.
“Planned Parenthood is certainly accustomed to the fight, and this is just another sort of rock in that path that we are going to navigate,” she said. “We’re going to make sure that we are adapting to stay nimble, to make sure that as those tens of thousands of people lose their access to their health insurance, that we are thinking about ways that we can change our model to be affordable and accessible to them, even if they don’t have health insurance to cover those costs.”
 One patient scheduled a same-day routine check up, after struggling to find a gynecologist. Another, who was about to lose Medicaid, came in to get her IUD replaced.

Most days, patients can schedule a same-day appointment to the clinic, a rarity in a state with the worst doctor shortage in the nation.
That’s what Liana Young did for a check up.
A year and a half ago, she said she had a hysterectomy but couldn’t find a gynecologist for follow-up care after her doctor moved out of the country.
Young has private insurance through work, but her mom is on Medicaid. She wishes elected officials understood women need reproductive care.
“Everybody deserves to have life-saving care or the basic care …” Young said. “Nobody should run around unsure of what’s going on with their bodies.”

Christina Aslett came in to get her IUD replaced.
She could’ve waited a few more years, but she was about to lose access to Medicaid because she earned too much money to qualify. But part of why she came in was because she wasn’t sure what the future would hold for “our rights as women and people with uteruses,” she said.
Aslett, 40, said she has been going to Planned Parenthood since she was 16 years old. 
When she first got pregnant at 22 years old, she didn’t feel ready. So she got an abortion, but not at Planned Parenthood.
Less than a year later, she got pregnant again and had her first child. Then she got an IUD from Planned Parenthood.
“You just know that they’re going to be there for you, whenever you need them,” she said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)State lawmakers have failed to find a solution to stop cuts taking effect in October to two Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs programs that help veterans struggling with homelessness and mental health issues. 
The Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP) is closing two of its locations, one in Chippewa Falls and the other in Green Bay, and the Veterans Outreach and Recovery Program (VORP), which serves veterans dealing with mental health and substance use issues and aims to reduce the suicide rate among veterans, is set to lose seven positions.
The VHRP has been the center of back and forth between Democrats and Republicans for months since the announcement of the closures in July. 
A Republican bill to fund the program received a hearing in September, but it was too late to stop the closures. 
VORP launched in 2015 with the help of a federal mental health grant. It is now state funded and Evers used American Rescue Plan Act funds in 2023 to expand the reach of the program, but those funds have run out. 
Gov. Tony Evers had requested seven positions and more than $1.1 million to help support the program, but Republican lawmakers stripped that proposal from the state budget. Those seven positions were set to expire in October without the additional funds, though the cuts have already taken effect with the state Department of Veterans Affairs reducing the number of regions under the program from 16 back to 11.
The additional employees had helped the agency reach more veterans, provide support in a more timely manner and give veterans more individual attention, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. In 2023-24, the program provided services to 2,222 people — a nearly 70% increase compared to the prior year.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) called attention to the cuts during a press call on Tuesday, blaming Republicans for the failure to provide the needed funding. 
“I’m frustrated, and I’m devastated at the same time,” Hesselbein said. “As of today, these facilities are closed and the veterans they once housed have been relocated.” 
Hoey said at the hearing on the bill from Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) that the earliest the Chippewa Falls facility would be able to reopen is sometime after Oct. 1, 2026. The Green Bay location, he said, could be reopened relatively quickly if there was funding and depending on whether the federal government would approve a request for a change to its scope. 
Hesselbein noted that Evers and Democratic lawmakers have provided several opportunities for Republicans to keep the VHRP sites open and provide funding to VORP. 
Democratic lawmakers, led by Hesselbein and Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa), introduced a bill to provide funding for the VORP positions, but it hasn’t received a hearing in the Republican-led Legislature. No Republican lawmakers have signed on to it, nor have they introduced their own version that would provide the funding.
A separate bill, authored by Wall, Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) and Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Clare), would provide the necessary funding for the VHRP sites. It previously would have provided $1.9 million, but an amendment to the legislation increases that to $2.6 million, which, Wall said, would be necessary to restart the programs. 
“My disappointment is with the leadership of legislative Republicans that has not made this program, has not made that bill, has not made homeless veterans a priority over the last few months,” Wall said. “They’ve run out the clock until here we are on Sept. 30, with the funding going away now. It’s possible to revive these programs… but it’s going to take a little bit more money and a lot more time. In the best case, we’re looking at next fall before we can stand up these programs again.” 
Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) blamed Evers for the closures, again, in a statement on Tuesday, claiming that there is money available to fund the programs.
“The Legislature appropriated enough funding to support the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program,” Wimberger said. “Evers simply refused to spend it. The closing of veterans’ homeless shelters is his decision alone, and he quite literally is refusing to use available funding in the exact same manner as he did last year to run those facilities.”
Evers has previously rejected Wimberger’s claim, noting that a paper from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau to the Joint Finance Committee warned lawmakers that additional funds were needed for the program. 
A letter from Republican lawmakers also noted that there has been a balance that the Department of Veterans Affairs  returns to the state treasury at the end of the year, though Hoey has noted that the agency is “only allowed to spend the money [the Legislature] tell[s] us to spend.”
Wall made a similar point during the press conference, saying that “we don’t just write a blank check to the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other part of the state budget. What we do is say that there’s so much money in this budget line for this program and so much money in that budget line for this other program, and so the fact that the Department of Veterans Affairs had surplus money and other budget lines doesn’t mean that they could just willy-nilly take that and spend that any way they wanted to for the benefit of this program.”
Hesselbein said this is a continuation of Republicans’ “strange finger pointing.” 
Hesselbein used the deadline for the closures and cuts as an opportunity to talk about what Democrats would do if they were in the majority. Democrats are seeking to flip the Senate in 2026 and need to win two additional seats to do it.
“Republicans chose to do nothing,” Hesselbein said. “Rest assured in a couple of years, when I’m the majority leader, these kinds of antics won’t be tolerated in a Democratic majority, but unfortunately, while that day is on the horizon, it’s not here yet.”

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The rate of children in Idaho without health insurance rose the second fastest in the nation recently, a new report found. 
From 2022 to 2024, Idaho’s child uninsured rate rose from 5.7% to 8.1% — growing Idaho’s number of uninsured children from 28,000 to 40,000 kids, according to a report released earlier this month by Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. 
The report analyzed health insurance rates for children across the country as states started to remove people from Medicaid after pandemic-era enrollment protections ended. That process, called Medicaid unwinding, contributed to Idaho’s sharp rise in the rate of uninsured children, the center’s executive director, Joan Alker, said at a webinar earlier this month. 
“All it takes is one broken arm on the school playground to financially devastate a family already struggling to make ends meet,“ Ivy Walker, a policy associate at the health advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children, said in a statement. “The number of Idaho children going without health insurance should be a wake-up call for Idaho policymakers and the unfortunate truth is that children’s access to health care is about to get much worse.”
Idaho did Medicaid unwinding fast, and most Idahoans who lost Medicaid through the process were removed for not replying to the state’s requests for information, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Almost three-quarters of the nearly 50,000 kids who lost Medicaid were removed from the health insurance public assistance program for non-responses, Idaho Voices for Children said in a news release Tuesday. 
The group called on Idaho’s congressional delegation to help by extending enhanced premium tax credits families can use to buy discounted private health insurance through the state’s exchange. 
The credits are set to expire at the end of this year, and Congress hasn’t extended them. Without the credits, 35,000 Idahoans could lose health insurance because of steep premium hikes, the Sun previously reported.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee Democratic lawmaker is accusing the state’s attorney general of revising and withdrawing a legal opinion on National Guard deployment, enabling the governor to send troops to Memphis in violation of the Constitution.
Reacting to Gov. Bill Lee’s decision to order Guard personnel to Memphis at the request of President Donald Trump, Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville questioned the moves of both leaders, in addition to Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s deletion and then changing of a legal opinion in April 2024. 
“That is not just reckless but seemingly lawless,” Yarbro said. “The reason that Americans are not used to seeing troops in combat fatigues patrolling American cities is not because nobody’s ever thought of it before. It’s because it’s illegal.”
Yarbro said the prohibition on military involvement in police work dates back to Tennessee’s 1796 Constitution. A change in 1870 further limited the governor from deploying National Guard troops in a public safety operation to “execute the laws” or be part of a domestic law enforcement agency.
“You either have the rule of law or you don’t,” Yarbro said.










The reason that Americans are not used to seeing troops in combat fatigues patrolling American cities is not because nobody’s ever thought of it before. It’s because it’s illegal.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville


Lee announced last week Tennessee National Guard troops would be sent to Memphis as part of a crime-fighting effort made up of local, state and federal authorities. Guard personnel are to be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Services but are not to be armed or make arrests unless Memphis Police request it.
Yarbro said the attorney general’s website shows a blank page where it once held an opinion by former Attorney General Herbert Slatery about the constitutional requirements for deploying Guard troops. 
A different opinion by Skrmetti from January 2024 acknowledges the National Guard of Tennessee is “a militia for purposes of the Constitution,” Yarbro said. But an April 2024 revision says the Guard is a militia “only for purposes of federal law.”
Yarbro said he considers it “deeply problematic” for the attorney general to shift advice, especially when it involves sending troops into cities.
“When we’re not following the law and still exercising power, the technical word for that is tyranny,” Yarbro said.
The senator sent a letter to Skrmetti saying state law doesn’t authorize backdated revisions or undated withdrawals of formal attorney general opinions. Opinions are to be changed or omitted only when the legislature passes new laws or a court makes a conflicting ruling, according to Yarbro.
Sen. Yarbro Letter to Skrmetti re Opinions 21-05 and 24-01 (9.29.2025)
Skrmetti responded Tuesday by saying attorney general opinions aren’t legally binding. He said Slatery’s opinion was withdrawn in April 2024 because it didn’t “accurately reflect the state of the law.” He added that the office withdraws opinions when it finds the state of the law has changed or the analysis was incorrect.
“If the folks at the press conference are insinuating my office withdrew the opinion six months before the election to pave the way for Trump policies a year and a half later, they have bigger problems than this legal question,” Skrmetti said in an email. “If I could see the future like that, I’d be neck deep in Bitcoin and Pokemon cards.”
Yarbro, though, said the attorney general and governor don’t get to choose which state laws apply.
“If the attorney general of Tennessee wants to issue an opinion saying that this deployment is valid, that the Constitution of Tennessee does not apply to the Tennessee National Guard, he should have the guts to actually say that,” Yarbro said.
Republican Sen. Mark Pody, who represents Wilson County and part of eastern Davidson County, said Tuesday he believes the deployment is legal because the National Guard is “under the governor’s purview.”
If the federal government were to take action without the governor’s permission, that would raise constitutional questions, Pody said.
At least one court ruled Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in California without the governor’s approval was illegal.
Pody said he believes Skrmetti would have considered the legality of removing the 2021 opinion before putting out his own opinion.
The opinion by Slatery said only in cases of rebellion or invasion is the governor permitted to deploy the militia, a move the legislature must approve. Yarbro said he believes the legislature should have voted on this decision too.

Patrick Morrisey and state lawmakers to eliminate the state’s tax on overtime and tips. (Photo by JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images)West Virginia State Treasurer Larry Pack on Tuesday called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and state lawmakers to eliminate the state’s tax on overtime and tips. Pack asked officials to consider taking up the matter during a special legislative session.
“President Trump promised to abolish the tax on overtime pay and tips, a centerpiece for his tax policies,” Pack said in a news release. “The goal was to help blue-collar and service industry workers who often rely on overtime and tips to make ends meet. Combined with the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, President Trump has delivered, and then some, by enacting some of the largest federal tax cuts in history.”
Pack also spoke about the proposal during an interview with Talkline on West Virginia MetroNews. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law this summer, cut federal taxes on tips and overtime. According to the IRS, workers of certain occupations can deduct tips up to $25,000 annually during tax years 2025 through 2028.
Workers who receive overtime pay may also deduct the pay that exceeds their regular rate of pay — for example, the “half” in “time and a half” pay, up to $12,500 annually or $25,000 for joint filers. 
According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the nonpartisan Urban and Brookings institutes that aims to improve tax and fiscal policy, while the tax cuts are popular, few will actually benefit from them. 
Only about 3% of households will benefit from the deduction for tipped income in 2026. Their average benefit is $1,400, but the average for all households is $40, according to the center.
About 9% of workers will pay on average $1,400 less on their overtime as well, according to the Tax Policy Center. The average reduction for all households will be $130. 
In a statement Tuesday, Kelly Allen, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the state should focus on policies that strengthen the economic security of all workers, but called eliminating the tax on overtime and tips a “gimmick.”
“These policies help employers — not workers — by pushing more sectors to move to tips, which lowers costs for businesses while reducing economic stability for workers and costing consumers more,” Allen said. “We are all frustrated by the increasing number of transactions in which we are encouraged to tip, and these policies only exacerbate the issue. 
“Similarly, no tax on overtime helps employers, not workers, by encouraging excessive hours of work and putting downward pressure on base wages,” she said. “Workers shouldn’t have to work more than 40 hours per week to provide for their families.”
Pack’s proposal to eliminate tips and overtime from the state income tax comes as the state is already grappling with a potentially rocky future financial outlook. While the state ended fiscal year 2025 with a revenue surplus, growing expenses — from the Public Employee Insurance Agency, the Hope Scholarship and potential federal budget cuts — could pose challenges.
The state is also still settling financially after implementing several cuts to personal income taxes in recent years. In 2024, according to the state budget office, West Virginia reported $826 million in surplus. 
Fiscal year 2025 ended in July, with the state reporting about $338 million in surplus, according to a news release from Morrisey. But most of that money was already spent and committed by the time the fiscal year ended due to supplemental appropriations passed in the 2025 regular session.
In an emailed response Tuesday regarding Pack’s request, Drew Galang, deputy press secretary for Morrisey, said the governor’s administration is “making the tough decisions to put our state in a great place to return money back to our people.
“We did the hard work of paying for the last set of tax cuts during the last legislative session and have begun to put our state on a solid long term financial trajectory,” Galang wrote. “This will position the governor and the Legislature to provide significant and broad based tax relief for West Virginians during the upcoming legislative session.”

The new rules extend the work requirements to able bodied adults ages 18 to 64. Previously in Tennessee the work requirements – which can also be fulfilled by volunteering or attending job training — ended at age 54. The rules also require parents of children 14 and up to work, volunteer or attend training. Previously parents of children 16 and up were exempt.
More than 700,000 Tennesseans — or one in every 10 state residents – rely on the SNAP program to feed their families.
The new age requirements are part of an overhaul of the federal food assistance program under the Big Beautiful Bill Act, which makes the largest ever cuts to the federal anti-hunger program.
One Big Beautiful Bill Act food assistance cuts come with hefty price tag for Tennessee taxpayers

The law also shifts a significant portion of the financial burden for the program from the federal government to states. 
Until now the federal government has paid half of the $128 million in administrative costs Tennessee incurs to run the program and picked up the tab for the entire $800 million in cash benefits, according to 2023 data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Under the new law, Tennessee will have to pick up 75% of the administrative costs and about 10% of the cash benefits. A recent analysis by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth concluded Tennessee taxpayers may be responsible for an additional $110 million annually for the program.
The Tennessee Department of Human Services, which oversees SNAP, has set an Oct. 31 deadline for individuals to submit documentation showing they meet an exception to the work requirement rules. The exceptions include being pregnant or “medically certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment.”
SNAP recipients may submit their documentation electronically, access resources to find jobs or receive training and review the new requirements on the department’s website.

Members in the Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, meaning many major federal government operations will cease beginning Wednesday. 
None of the dozen government spending bills have passed Congress, which is different from previous shutdowns, when some of those appropriations bills passed and funded certain parts of the federal government. The last government shutdown occurred during President Donald Trump’s first term and lasted 35 days, from late 2018 into early 2019. The current shutdown could last longer and have a wider effect.

Republicans in the Senate need some Democratic support to pass a funding measure, but Democrats have refused to support the measure that passed the House without changes to Affordable Care Act tax credits. 
U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted on Tuesday against the Republican measure, which had previously passed the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Hickenlooper said in a post on X that while Republicans need seven votes to pass their funding measure, “Coloradans need their health care,” and he won’t vote for a bill that does not lower those costs. 
Senate Democrats had introduced their own continuing resolution, which would have extended Affordable Care Act enhanced premium credits. Republicans blocked the measure. Health insurance premiums in Colorado next year will increase an average of 28% for people who buy plans on the individual market unless Congress extends those tax credits, Hickenlooper said in a statement Tuesday.
Bennet in a post on X blamed Trump and Republicans for “refusing to negotiate with Democrats to prevent healthcare costs from skyrocketing and avoid a government shutdown.”
“If President Trump and Congressional Republicans allow the Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire, rural families in Colorado will see premiums soar by more than 300%,” Bennet said in a statement Tuesday night. “In total, more than 24 million Americans could see their health insurance premiums double.”
House members
All four of Colorado’s Republicans in Congress — U.S. Reps. Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton — voted in support of the measure when it passed the U.S. House earlier this month. 
Boebert said Democrats caused the shutdown and will use it “to try and show their rabid base that they’re ‘fighting’ Trump.” 
“They have a giant wishlist of demands totaling $1.5 trillion that they’re never going to get us to agree on,” Boebert said in a post on X. “It’s all a show so they can send out fundraising emails and act like they’re fighting.”
Evans said in a post on X that Democrats want a shutdown “because we won’t fund their extreme priorities like taxpayer funded benefits for illegal immigrants.” He released a statement Tuesday morning requesting his pay be withheld until the government reopens.
“If Senate Democrats force our troops to work without pay, Congress should be held to the same standard,” Evans said in a statement.
Republicans control both chambers of Congress, as well as the White House.
All four Democrats in the House from Colorado — U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Centennial, Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood — voted against the measure. 
Crow said the Republican budget cuts will cause health care costs “to soar” and said the bill is funding “the dismantling of our democracy by this administration,” which he said he refuses to be a part of. He said because Republicans control the White House, House and Senate, they are to blame for the shutdown. 
Neguse told MSNBC that Trump has been dismantling the federal government over the last nine months and said it’s “ridiculous” to expect Democrats to support a Republican budget bill “that exacerbates the cost of living crisis that they have created.”

The plaintiffs are seeking a class action designation to add more parties to their case.
Filed in the District of Columbia, the complaint alleges the Department of Homeland Security has created an illegal national citizenship database through its Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system. At least four states are using SAVE data to review voter rolls, even though it relies on Social Security data the agency considers unreliable, the lawsuit alleges.
The first state to plug into the SAVE system was Louisiana, where Secretary of State Nancy Landry announced Sept. 4 that she used the new database to scour state voting records going back to the 1980s. Her review found 390 noncitizen registered voters, including 79 who she said voted in at least one election over the past several decades. 
The 390 voters in question represent 0.01% of all registered voters in Louisiana, though Landry acknowledged the possibility that some of her findings could be in error or attributed to outdated information.
“The consolidation and unlawful use of Louisianans’ sensitive data without our knowledge is alarming and terrifying,” M. Christian Green, president of the League of Women Voters of Louisiana, said in a statement. 
Green’s chapter, its counterpart in Virginia and the national League of Women Voters are plaintiffs in the lawsuit with the Electronic Privacy Information Center and five individuals identified as J. Doe.

J. Doe 4 is a Louisiana voter who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014, according to the lawsuit. The court filing also claims that Social Security records incorrectly state that J. Doe 4 is not a U.S. citizen.
Defendants in the case are the Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, the Social Security Administration and its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, the U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Trump administration officials have yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs say the Trump administration has violated multiple federal laws by combining various government sources to form a national “Data Lake” under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a subagency of Homeland Security. In addition, the lawsuit claims the separation of powers provision in the Constitution was violated when the executive branch chose to usurp Congress’ authority over elections. 
The alleged violations include the Privacy Act, approved in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amended in 1988 through the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act. The advocacy groups say the Trump administration has ignored prohibitions against disclosing, combining and comparing data from different federal agencies beyond allowed exceptions.
“Unfortunately, the Defendants in this case are ignoring these laws to create comprehensive databases of American citizens’ data …” the lawsuit reads. “The Plaintiffs in this case include a proposed class of millions of American citizens and permanent residents whose records have been unlawfully pooled into new or revised centralized records systems.”
Louisiana election investigation finds 79 noncitizens have voted since 1980s

The alleged violations began with the formation of the Department of Governmental Efficiency through an executive order from President Donald Trump, according to the lawsuit. DOGE initiated a “government-wide consolidation of sensitive personal data” that culminated with the approval of the SAVE system. Subsequent executive orders from Trump prompted states to begin sharing their voter data with federal agencies, the plaintiffs argue.
Without evidence to support his claims, Trump has repeatedly alleged widespread fraud took place in the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. The states that have willingly joined the president’s SAVE campaign are Republican led, while Democratic state leaders are fighting the Justice Department’s attempts to compel them to share voter data.
The lawsuit filed Tuesday calls for the federal court to stop the Trump administration from compiling information illegally and for the new database to be dissolved.

(Getty Images)Absentee voting has quietly served Idaho for decades. It gives seniors, rural residents, working families, and military members a trusted way to cast their ballots. For many, it’s not just convenient but essential. And for our active-duty service members in the U.S. and abroad, absentee voting isn’t simply a matter of convenience it is the only way their voices can be heard.
A soldier serving away from home should never lose the right to vote for the leaders who shape the policies that affect their service. All veterans should always have a voice in the very democracy they helped defend. Absentee voting ensures that the men and women who have given so much for our country continue to have a say in its future.
Absentee voting isn’t mail-in voting. One common misunderstanding is confusing absentee voting with universal mail-in voting. They are not the same.

In Idaho, absentee ballots are available only to registered voters who request them in advance. Each request is verified, and ballots must be returned by strict deadlines.
Universal mail-in voting, on the other hand, automatically sends ballots to every registered voter, whether they asked for one or not.

Idaho does not use universal mail-in voting. Our absentee system is controlled, request-based, and full of checks that protect security and accountability.
Idaho has recently strengthened absentee voting even more:

Online ballot requests require either a state-issued ID or the last four digits of a Social Security number; but you must have first registered with your Idaho driver’s license or state-issued ID card number to request an absentee ballot.
Requests must be made annually.
Returned ballots must have signatures that match voter records, and county clerks carefully verify them. County election offices must have annual training on signature verification.

These steps are straightforward, transparent, and build public confidence. They also ensure that when a ballot is sent to a Marine in the Pacific, an airman in Europe, or a soldier stationed in the Middle East, that vote is every bit as secure as one cast in person at the polls.
Much of the handwringing about absentee ballots simply isn’t based on fact. Idaho election officials, Republican and Democrat alike, have testified that fraud is extremely rare. Paper ballots, signature verification, and post-election audits already safeguard the process. And in Idaho, when fraud does occur, it is prosecuted. The evidence shows absentee voting is secure and reliable.
Idaho has also put an end to ballot harvesting. Only the voter, or a close contact like a family member or caregiver, can return a ballot. No one can legally drop off a stack of ballots at the elections office. That safeguard further protects the chain of custody.
These reforms haven’t gone unnoticed. In 2024, Idaho improved its standing on The Heritage Foundation’s Election Integrity Scorecard, joining states recognized for significantly strengthening election security. The Honest Elections Project also praised reforms like requiring voter ID for every ballot and securing early and absentee voting, which Idaho has already put into practice.
The impact goes beyond rankings. In places like Kootenai County, absentee voting helps ease poll-day congestion, reduces pressure on poll workers, and keeps lines shorter. That makes Election Day smoother and more efficient for everyone. But above all, absentee ballots protect the voices of Idaho’s veterans and active-duty military, a group that above any other has earned right and expectation, that their vote will count.
At its heart, absentee voting is about access. It gives every eligible Idahoan a secure way to vote, no matter their circumstances. When politicians add hurdles just to look tough on elections, they aren’t protecting democracy, they’re getting in the way of legitimate voters.
 Idaho should continue building on this quiet success story by keeping access strong while making smart, thoughtful improvements.
Absentee voting in Idaho is secure, tested, and improving. More importantly, it keeps faith with every Idahoan, including those who have worn the uniform and stood watch so we can remain free to cast our ballots at home.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-01 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Southern Poverty Law Center president warns of Trump crackdown on civil rights groups,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/01/splc-trump-crackdown-civil-rights-nonprofits-mississippi/,Fair spoke to Mississippi Today in an exclusive interview on the heels of President Donald Trump signing a memorandum directing federal law enforcement agencies to investigate what he claimed were wealthy donors and organizations funding left-wing political violence around the country.,"Civil rights organizations around the country are preparing for the Trump administration’s crackdown on progressive-aligned groups, Bryan Fair, President of the Southern Poverty Law Center, told Mississippi Today on Tuesday.
Fair spoke to the news outlet in an exclusive interview on the heels of President Donald Trump signing a memorandum directing federal law enforcement agencies to investigate what he claimed were wealthy donors and organizations funding left-wing political violence.
The memo could be used as a pretext to target civil rights organizations perceived to be enemies of the Trump administration and Republican causes in states such as Mississippi, Fair said.
“The charge from the administration, the most recent memorandum, seems to go after one type of organization — organizations that are critical of this administration, or that promote equality of opportunity for all,” Fair said. “We see this as a partisan attack on progressive nonprofits that seek to lift up due-process rights, First Amendment rights and the equal protection rights of all persons.”
The Southern Poverty Law Center — one of the nation’s most well-known civil rights organizations that rose to prominence by filing legal cases against white supremacist groups in the post-Jim Crow South — will remain undeterred from its mission, Fair said. But Trump’s memo last week and his administration’s vows to attack the financial and organizational networks that support progressive causes have sent many groups bracing for impact.
The center is part of a “civil rights ecosystem” that includes organizations such as the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, the ACLU, the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund and Democracy Forward. All of these groups believe that the administration plans to target civil rights groups, Fair said. The SPLC has long attracted the ire of Republican politicians and groups who see the organization as biased against conservatives.
The organization’s work classifying “hate groups” is a particular point of contention, with critics saying the organization lumps mainstream conservative groups together with white supremacists and neo-Nazis.
Anger from Trump and his supporters toward progressive groups intensified after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Trump administration officials and allied media figures have claimed, largely without evidence, that progressive groups have encouraged physical violence against conservatives. Some conservative critics have trained their attention and large social followings on the center by name.

Fair said his organization condemned Kirk’s murder and has never condoned political violence of any sort.
“For 55 years, SPLC has been on the front lines of fighting hate and extremism in this country,” Fair said. “We were founded to fight for the civil rights of all persons, and that’s what we do every day. We believe that everything that we do is protected under the law.”
Fair said threats from the Trump administration against groups such as the center have arrived at the same time these organizations are working to blunt the impact of deep federal spending cuts approved by congressional Republicans.
Fair was in Jackson on Tuesday to kick off a “Truth, Poverty and Democracy Tour” around Mississippi. The multicity, week-long tour will connect Mississippians to advocates and resources that “address systemic barriers to health care, housing, education and voting rights,” the organization said.
Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the country, and Fair said the center plans to wage a “war on poverty,” harkening back to President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 State of the Union Address.
Three years after that speech, Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy toured the Mississippi Delta to learn more about the region’s life-shaping poverty, a seemingly intractable problem that still persists.
The center’s plans to emphasize poverty-related issues — such as the Republican-pushed “big, beautiful bill” cuts to Medicaid and food assistance — represent a new strategy for the organization.
“We’ve adopted poverty as a new pillar of our work,” Fair said. “Historically, we have not done great work in that space, but we’re trying very intentionally to shift our focus so that we’re on the ground.”
Democratic state lawmakers said at a press conference later on Tuesday that they would continue partnering with groups such as the center on shared efforts to strengthen social safety net programs.
“I’m done trying to change the minds of some of the people in this Capitol building or change the minds of the people in Washington who are in control,” said House Minority Leader Robert Johnson. “Our job is to get them out. So this partnership will continue whether Trump funds it or not.”
While the shift to a full-throated focus on poverty-related issues might be a departure, Fair said the center would not change its tactics in response to federal pressure. 
“We have no intention of being silenced by this administration or any administration,” Fair said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/30112728/3X0A9903.jpg,,,2025-10-01 06:58:26.851998

Low-income Kentuckians getting much-needed cash payments through the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (or KTAP) will get less help starting in November. 
Dr. Steven Stack, the secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said last week that the “program grew more quickly than projected” after an overhaul two years ago. The number of participating families increased from around 10,026 in the 2023 fiscal year to 15,117 in 2025. 
In the program’s first update since 1995, Kentucky in 2023 increased KTAP payments and  raised income eligibility levels, meaning more families could receive assistance. The state also raised the asset test from $2,000 to $10,000, a change that helped older caregivers raising children on retirement savings. 
Lower monthly payments coming in November are “still higher than the amounts prior to 2023,” Stack said. 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear announced the cut in benefits during his weekly news briefing on Sept. 25. Beshear and Stack cited a strain on cabinet finances caused by an increase in the number of children entering foster care and the severity of their needs. 
“Not only did we see an increase in the number of children entering foster care, but the cost of their care also increased,” Stack said. “We have children in foster care who at times can’t be placed right away because the services they need simply are not available. In those situations, our DCBS (Department for Community Based Services) social workers have stepped in to provide around the clock care to make sure those children are safe. That has meant significant spending in staff overtime, security and other emergency supports.”
Advocates are criticizing Beshear’s administration for the move, saying the General Assembly should have been looped in either during the 2026 session or in a special session to address the issue.

“Clearly, the precedent is to involve them,” said Terry Brooks, the executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates. “It’s intriguing in the sense that Gov. (Andy) Beshear places a high emphasis on legislative and executive branch collaboration, unless he doesn’t want to collaborate.” 
The Lantern asked the cabinet for more insight on the decision to move forward with the cut without engaging the General Assembly. 
KTAP, which comes from federal funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, benefits low-income families for a maximum of 60 months over the course of a lifetime, which do not have to be consecutive. Families are eligible for this assistance if they are low income, a Kentucky resident, a U.S. citizen or qualifying immigrant and a caretaker or parent of a child. The program also provides transportation assistance and has work and education requirements. 
Families getting $300 from the government “may not sound like a lot,” Brooks said, but “for these families, it’s a significant hit.” 
“​​It’s diapers and formula and clothes and cribs and medical expenses and school supplies,” he said. “None of those come cheap.” 
About 19% of Kentucky children lived in poverty last year, according to the American Community Survey (ACS), released by the United States Census Bureau in mid September. More than 500,000 Kentuckians participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
The lower KTAP payments will be especially challenging for kinship care families in Kentucky, Brooks said, who are already making a “significant economic sacrifice” to raise minor relatives and keep them out of traditional foster care. If they can’t make ends meet on their own, they can’t remain kinship caregivers, he said. 
​​About 42% of kinship families in Kentucky receive KTAP support, reports Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
“I’m a grandpa,” Brooks said. “And when I think about any grandparent being faced with the situation: ‘I can’t make it economically, and therefore I’m going to have to relinquish my grandchild to the state,’ that’s heartbreaking.” 
A ‘blow’ to ‘modest but vital lifeline’ 
Dustin Pugel, the policy director at the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, called KTAP benefits “a modest, but vital lifeline” for low-income Kentuckians who stand to suffer a “blow” in losing part of the help. 
Dustin Pugel
“To cut this benefit by a third in order to plug a budget hole without public input or regulatory approval is to rob Peter to pay Paul, and those who suffer the consequences are kids who can least afford it,” Pugel said. 
Prior to 2023, the benefit for a family of one making $742 a month was a maximum of $186, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. A family of seven or more was eligible for up to $482 in assistance if they made $1,462 per month. 
Also, before the 2023 changes, Kentucky families had to be so poor to qualify — an income of no more than $12,000 a year for a family of three — that participation in KTAP had fallen to 10,000 families compared to 72,000 families in 1995.
In addition to raising the income eligibility levels, the 2023 update roughly doubled the maximum benefit. On the low end of current benefit thresholds a family of one making $890 per month can receive a maximum of $372 and, on the highest end, a family of seven earning $1,754 per month can qualify for up to $964. 
Now, starting in November, Kentuckians getting the benefit will see about a 35% decrease, according to a letter obtained by the Lantern, which was to be sent to KTAP recipients. The Lantern has asked the cabinet to confirm the benefit amounts, which are, according to that email: 

A family of one is eligible for up to $242. 
A family of two is eligible for up to $293. 
A family of three is eligible for up to $341. 
A family of four is eligible for up to $426. 
A family of five is eligible for up to $498. 
A family of six is eligible for up to $562. 
A family of 7 or more is eligible for up to $627. 

‘Penny wise and pound foolish’ 
Food and housing insecurity are already high in Kentucky, and Brooks worries the changes to KTAP will only worsen both. 
“I worry a lot about what it means for food insecurity, housing stability, all of those factors,” Brooks said. “We know that those are the exact issues that cause young people to have those adverse childhood experiences. When we’re creating instability in any way today, we’re going to pay for that in very real ways tomorrow.” 
Adverse childhood experiences, more commonly known as ACEs, refer to traumas or stressors in a person’s life before their 18th birthday. Adverse experiences in childhood and their lasting consequences cost Kentucky nearly $300 million a year, the Lantern has reported. 
“In a lot of ways, this decision could backfire, and it could be that we’re penny wise and pound foolish,” Brooks said. 
Stack stressed that families aren’t being punished.

“This is not a penalty for families receiving KTAP or for those participating in the Kentucky Works program, this change is the result of circumstances that go beyond any one program or household,” Stack said Thursday during Gov. Andy Beshear’s weekly press briefing. “We recognize that these reductions will result in added burdens, and we are committed to helping families connect with other resources where possible.” 
Stack said any people affected by this “difficult news” can call 1-855-306-8959 for help locating other assistance. The changes go into effect Nov. 1. 
“Changes like these are not easy, and they are never welcome,” Stack said. “When financial resources are available, we are committed to directing them to support Kentuckians. Unfortunately, the other side of the coin is that when demand increases or funding is reduced, programs must be adjusted to stay within the designated budget allowed.” 
Pugel with the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy said the executive branch should work with the General Assembly to “return to the lawfully set benefit levels in KTAP while also fully funding vital services for vulnerable children in foster care.” 
“When there are budget holes, the answer is not to raid flexible funds already being used to care for the poorest children in Kentucky, but to engage the General Assembly,” Pugel said. “These children are not in competition. They are among the Kentuckians who can least withstand the deeper hardship this decision brings.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Clean energy jobs continued to grow in Kentucky last year, though at a slower pace, according to an annual report focusing on the economic impact of such jobs. 
Kentucky ranked 28th in the country for clean energy employment with more than 40,000 jobs; it ranked 11th for “clean vehicle” jobs with more than 9,000.
The report published in September from E2 — which  describes itself as a nonpartisan organization advocating for “smart policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment” — analyzed federal data from 2024 finding that clean energy jobs across the country grew by 2.8%, outpacing the growth of the U.S. economy and adding nearly 100,000 jobs.
The annual report found Kentucky’s clean energy jobs grew  by 2.4% in 2024, a significantly slower pace than recent years when Kentucky was among the fastest in growth in clean energy jobs. The pace of clean energy job growth nationally was the slowest since 2020, the report said.
E2’s definition of clean energy jobs is broad, including employment connected to renewable energy generation, electricity storage and transmission upgrades, electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades. 
E2 stated that policy moves by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress this year are not reflected in federal employment data from 2024, but that the moves threaten “future growth and, increasingly, the health of the U.S. economy at-large.” 
The E2 report found Kentucky was among the top 10 states last year for growth in jobs connected to renewable energy generation, energy storage and modernizing the electricity grid. 
Renewable energy generation jobs in Kentucky grew by 6.1% with more than 2,200 of the state’s jobs in that category coming from solar energy. Jobs related to energy storage including utility-scale batteries and modernizing the electric grid in Kentucky grew by 11.1%. 
Congress accelerated the phase down of tax credits benefiting clean energy production and electric vehicles through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July, despite warnings from the renewable energy industry that hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost nationwide.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year, Republican Kentucky U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie said as the OBBBA was moving through Congress the legislation would end spending on “Green New Deal-style waste” and “reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”
The federal $7,500 tax credit encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles ended at the end of September due to the passage of the OBBBA. Across the country, automakers are largely leaning into producing gas-powered vehicles under the Trump administration, though Ford Motor Co. announced in August it was converting a Louisville plant to manufacture electric trucks. 
BlueOval SK, an electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant that’s a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea-based SK On, started production in August with more than 1,400 employees. The plant is one of two planned in Hardin County with Ford Motor Co., with Ford Motor Co. previously deciding to delay battery production at the second plant.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Earlier this year, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston announced the city faced a $200 million budget deficit for 2026. To address the deficit, the mayor declared that there would be budget cuts and layoffs to make up for the lack of resources.
On Aug. 18, the first of these actions was felt with the layoff of 169 city workers, with most of the losses coming from the Office of Human Rights, Office of Child Services, and Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. Notably, the Department of Public Safety received zero layoffs despite consuming the vast majority of the city’s budget.
As if a slap in the face, mere weeks later the mayor announced that Denver police would receive a 15% raise over the next three years. By comparison, one of the most notable worker strikes this year saw waste management workers in Philadelphia refusing to collect garbage for several weeks as they held out for a cost of living raise. The workers were required to live in the city, but their wage wouldn’t allow for it. They won a 3% raise over the next three years. Denver police also received cost reimbursements for uniforms and other benefits, all in the wake of the largest layoffs Denver had experienced since 2011.

Johnston is not solely to blame for the budget difficulties Denver is experiencing — after all, the city’s problems reflect a number of mayoral administrations that have mis-prioritized and misspent our budget for decades, dating back to then-Mayor John Hickenlooper embracing the wave of development, urban renewal, and gentrification inspired by the 2002 book “The Rise of the Creative Class,” by Richard Florida. Under Hickenlooper, two of Denver’s most expensive development projects began: the Denver jail and the Convention Center hotel. This contrast and priority in investment would establish a direction that Denver continues in 2025: funding for jail and police for local residents and luxury, high-end experiences for visitors. 
While he’s not solely to blame for the budget crisis Denver faces, Johnston is largely responsible for it. Through a combination of high-cost development projects, rebranding of the downtown area, and niche ideas such as House1000, All In Mile High, Roads to Recovery, and the Office of Neighborhood Safety (all of which have failed to address core causes and solutions of our mental and behavioral health crises), city staff and residents are struggling to keep up with the mayor’s ideas — and struggling to pay for them. 
Johnston’s actions to address the budget crisis have met immediate and harsh criticism. Council member Stacie Gilmore was pointedly critical of the layoffs, with her husband being one of the 169 city workers who were dismissed. Upon the release of the proposed budget recently, City Clerk and Recorder Paul López called the mayor’s budget decisions “a threat to democracy” given the divestment of polling places and election judges. Denver Auditor Tim O’Brien also criticized Johnston’s proposed budget, warning the mayor to stop interfering with it.
Among the highest concerns from City Council were the planned funding cut to the Denver Support Team Assisted Response program, which almost reaches $1.5 million. The STAR program is already underfunded, responding to only 50% of the 911 calls that are eligible for it. As a representative of the STAR Community Advisory Committee, I believe that any divestment from STAR would result in direct harm to people in crisis. 
Launched in 2020, the Denver STAR program inspired hundreds of cities to explore similar programs and promised a more effective, appropriate response to certain 911 calls while saving the city money. But the city has never allowed the program to be fully implemented, blurring Denver’s various responses with redundant programs that involve a police response, such as the Street Enforcement Team, Homeless Outreach Team, and the failed Substance Use Navigators, which will be relaunched under Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. 
By contrast, the Albuquerque Community Safety Department, started the same year as STAR, has three times the budget of STAR. The Seattle CARE program is set to receive another $9.2 million. And other programs like Atlanta PAD and Durham HEART have received proper investment to succeed. All of these programs were represented along with other premier alternative response programs and national leaders in a letter to the mayor urging support for STAR. 
In 2020, there seemed to be a near-consensus that policing in the United States needed major reform and many cities conceded that new interventions in crisis response and public safety were needed outside of policing. Yet, the Johnston administration has doubled down in investing more into policing through the absence of cuts and layoffs to Public Safety in the midst of massive cuts everywhere else in the budget, increasing police pay, a $74 million line item in the Vibrant Denver bond for a new training facility, inundating 16th Street and downtown with security and police, and the allowance of the police policy of “Education-Based Development,” designed to circumvent existing disciplinary measures for officers. In short, these policies are reflections of a national environment fostering expansions of police, including executive orders from President Donald Trump to remove accountability, criminalize homelessness and mental health, and take over major cities with federal law enforcement and National Guard.
Meanwhile, longstanding businesses are shutting down due to widespread construction, roads are increasingly difficult to navigate due to constant road closures, and large investments in development projects are stripping Denver of desperately-needed funding in other areas. It’s now up to City Council to offer their priorities and proposals.
As it relates to STAR, City Council unanimously approved a proclamation earlier this year committing “to scaling this model in alignment with the program’s original vision.” But it’s clear that Denver cannot afford the decisions of this mayor — literally. And residents are paying for a city they may never get to see and enjoy.

The group has just four meetings left to come up with three possible school district maps for state lawmakers, and anxiety among members is mounting.

The school redistricting task force, now at its halfway mark, began its review of a draft map for the first time since launching in August. The group is tasked with proposing up to three possibilities to the Legislature by Dec. 1.
During the task force’s fourth meeting on Monday, Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and Dave Wolk proposed a map of 14 school districts that nearly mirror the state’s 15 career and technical education regions, each identified by the technical education center that anchors it.
One of the hypothetical school districts would combine the boundaries of two service regions in northwest Vermont, those encompassing Cold Hollow Career Center in Enosburg and Northwest Career & Technical Center in St. Albans.
Wolk is Gov. Phil Scott’s appointee to the board. He is a former state senator and the longtime president of Castleton University. Beck works as a classroom teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy, a private school that operates a center for career and technical education.
Prepared with the help of Agency of Education officials, the proposal would create districts that “span a greater variety of communities” and that “eliminates artificial barriers to ensure that students have the same opportunities to succeed, regardless of where they live,” the proposal reads.
During the meeting, Beck called it a “rough-edged proposal,” telling fellow task force members that the goal was to put the proposal forward to jumpstart the process.
“There’s a whole bunch of different decision points, a whole bunch of different things to consider,” Beck said. “This is a first pass at what something like this might look like.”

‘Running out of time’
The school redistricting task force is confronting a gargantuan task under a tight timeline. The 11-member task force, made up of legislators, former superintendents and other experts, was created under Act 73 to craft new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system in time for next year’s legislative session, which starts in early January.
The goal is to create three map configurations to consolidate the state’s existing 119 school districts — currently contained within the 52 supervisory districts or supervisory unions — into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
But with four meetings left, and a Dec. 1 deadline to submit those three maps to the Legislature, task force members on Monday said they were feeling the pressure.
“We’re running out of time to put out ideas,” said Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Windsor Orange-2, a member of the task force.
Much of the state’s public education system is feeling the anxiety as well. 
Jay Badams, a former superintendent and a task force member, cautioned the board that they “need to be super sensitive to the fact that we’re creating huge public anxiety around this.”
“And it’s because we’ve got this deadline,” he said. “We’re going to build this foundation in three more meetings, that we’re going to build a whole house on, and it’s going to serve the children of this state for decades? I’m sorry, I feel a lot of pressure to get it right.”
Rep. Edye Graning, the co-chair of the task force, addressed the “frustration and concern that is bubbling up in every single community across the state” as education leaders wait on the task force’s work.

“I really want to reassure the public and reassure everyone here that we are working really hard to get up to three maps that will work for the state,” she said. “It takes time, it takes a lot of effort, and the work that we do, we hope the Legislature will take very seriously and use in its work over the next session.”
‘Elephant in the room’
Task force members appeared sympathetic to using career and technical education regions as the organizing principle behind at least one of their map proposals, though many questions remain unanswered.
The proposal was “still very much in its early stages,” Toren Ballard, the communications and policy director with the Agency of Education, said at the meeting.
For one, that map, as presented, would be lopsided, with the Burlington Technical Center and the Center for Technology in Essex representing one district with more than 22,000 students.
The second largest district, home to the Stafford Technical Center in Rutland City, would have more than 7,000 students. Nine districts, Stafford included, would have between 4,000 and 8,000 students, as suggested in Act 73’s language. Five districts would fall below the 4,000 threshold, with the lowest student count in a district anchored by Bradford’s River Bend Career and Technical Center, with just over 2,000 students.
Another unanswered question — the “elephant in the room,” as task force member Jennifer Botzojorns put it — was the question of how these hypothetical districts would be governed. Specifically, which district governance model would be used, supervisory districts or supervisory unions. 
Supervisory unions and supervisory districts both provide back office functions such as accounting and payroll and may oversee the provision of special education services and curriculum coordination. But the two systems differ in their structure: supervisory unions are made up of school districts that each have their own board of directors, while supervisory districts have only one governing board.
“I think that that needs to be encapsulated in our drawing of maps and moving forward,” Botzojorns, a retired superintendent for the Kingdom East School District, said.
In addition to continuing work on the career and technical education draft map, task force members on Monday agreed to propose a map at a future meeting that centered on existing county boundaries, and another that centers on establishing comprehensive, regional high schools.
Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, a co-chair of the task force, said whatever plan they put forward for regional high schools “has to include some kind of construction aid.”
“It has to look that idea and that problem in the face,” she said. “We cannot ignore it anymore.”
Task force members also agreed to work on a map organized around regional BOCES, or a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, a type of educational governance entity used to help school districts collaborate on services such as special education and transportation.
The Mountain Views Supervisory Union in August became the first public school governing body in Vermont to adopt such a structure. Sherry Sousa, the superintendent of the supervisory union, gave a presentation to the task force about the structure on Monday.
More maps will likely be proposed at the task force’s next meeting on Oct. 10. Graning, the co-chair, cautioned members that “there will be many details that we can’t figure out in the next four meetings.”
“But we’re not creating the law,” she said, “we’re creating a map.”

(Photo courtesy of the Smithsonian)One of Virginia’s crown jewels of tourist attractions, the Discovery Space Shuttle, could be blasting off somewhere else as U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine seek to prevent the move from its home in Virginia to Texas. 
The effort to relocate the space shuttle comes as support has increased for moving it to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, which is considered central to the United States’ human spaceflight program. Republican U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both from Texas, are pushing the relocation effort. The ship has been at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly since 2012.
Last week, the senators wrote a letter to Senate appropriators, hoping to block federal funding included in the Big Beautiful Bill Act for relocating the shuttle, arguing that it would waste taxpayer dollars, put it at risk of damage and diminish public access. 
The Smithsonian estimated that transporting Discovery could cost more than $50 million, with another $325 million needed for planning, exhibit reconstruction and new facilities, the letter states, exceeding the $85 million appropriated in the Act.
“From a public access standpoint, the Udvar-Hazy Center, located in the Washington, D.C. region, offers free public admission and draws millions of visitors annually, including students, veterans, and international tourists,” Kaine and Warner wrote. “The Smithsonian provides Discovery with professional stewardship and global visibility. The Smithsonian is unique among museums for providing visitors with access to a national treasure meant to inspire the American public without placing economic barriers.”
The center has become one of the top 20 most-visited museums in North America, garnering more than a million visitors per year, according to the Smithsonian. 
Between 1984 and 2012, Discovery orbited the Earth almost 150 million miles more than its two predecessors, flying 39 missions. The ship, named for renowned sailing ships of exploration, was transferred to the Smithsonian by NASA in April 2012.

Recently, the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum announced plans to expand the center in Northern Virginia, following the last major construction project in 2003. The project will enable the Smithsonian to showcase more artifacts and new acquisitions, likely enhancing the shuttle and the center’s offerings. 
Construction is expected to be finished by the end of 2028.
In an August interview, Cornyn said the then-NASA Administrator and former Discovery astronaut Charles Bolden Jr. gave Houston “short shrift” when it came to considering the city as one of the homes for four retiring shuttles in 2010. Bolden assigned the remaining three shuttles to California, Florida and New York.
However, Cornyn believed the Johnson Space Center is “a natural place” for the ship to be located, as it is the home of human spaceflight. 
As part of the process to have Houston reconsidered, the Act required the current administrator to make a new determination, which favored Houston. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, nominated by President Donald Trump, is serving as the acting administrator. 
Cornyn said he hopes that when current and future generations see the shuttle, they will find inspiration in subjects related to the space industry.
“Seeing this firsthand and understanding its significance will hopefully make a very positive influence on them and their life, and it would be great for tourism and the economy,” Cornyn said. 
In a statement to the Mercury, the Smithsonian said it owns the Discovery and holds it, along with all its collections, in trust for the nation.
“The Smithsonian has a unique responsibility to properly manage, preserve, and make accessible the collections in its care for current and future generations to appreciate, enjoy, and study,” the research institute stated. “The Smithsonian carries out its stewardship responsibilities through systematic collections management policies, procedures, and plans based on professional and discipline-specific best practices. The Smithsonian will carefully evaluate any request to move Discovery in light of these obligations.”

This crushing reality has defined my life for the past two years and, unfortunately, other Virginians may be experiencing the same thing. 
Health insurers rely on a mechanism called prior authorization when reviewing claims. While companies claim this process reduces wasteful spending and unnecessary procedures, prior authorization has devolved into a profit-driven tool that too often puts necessary medical care out of reach. The numbers tell the story: care denials increased an average of 20.2% for commercial claims between 2022 and 2023 alone. Some corporate insurers are now misusing AI and automated processing to categorically deny patients’ claims.
Unfortunately, my experience with prior authorization from insurance companies is not unique. Here in the commonwealth and across the country, countless people face care delays and coverage denials that raise costs for patients and hospitals, putting lives at risk while boosting profits for corporate insurers. If lawmakers do not hold corporate insurance companies accountable for stripping patients of vital care, we all will continue to suffer the consequences. 
Two years ago, my world looked entirely different. I was launching my legal career and living life like any other woman in her 20s. Then, in 2023, I was diagnosed with immune-mediated small fiber neuropathy, a condition that subjects my body to relentless, burning-like pain, as though my body were on fire. Every aspect of daily life became a struggle, turning simple tasks into ordeals and basic, everyday movements into agony. 
To treat this debilitating condition, my specialists recommended intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions, hoping to provide relief from my near-constant suffering. While they acknowledged that patients don’t always respond to IVIG, they believed it was worth trying, despite the steep price tag of over $10,000 for a single infusion every four weeks until my disease was in remission.
Before the infusions, I lived with constant pain levels hovering around seven out of 10. When I finally received IVIG, it transformed my life, dropping my pain most days to between two and three. This was the first time in roughly two years I had experienced such relief. After two years of suffering, I had found what I desperately needed. I was living proof that this treatment was medically necessary for my condition.
However, my insurance company saw things differently. They repeatedly denied coverage, claiming the treatment wasn’t “medically necessary” despite my doctors emphatically insisting otherwise. The Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance, the state agency responsible for resolving prior authorization disputes, upheld every denial with troubling deference to the insurer’s position.
Rather than independently evaluating the medical evidence, regulators seemed to simply rubber-stamp the insurer’s definition of medical necessity. Even during peer-to-peer reviews where my doctors spoke directly with insurance representatives, my insurance company was still unwilling to discuss the merits of IVIG. During one peer-to-peer review, a representative insisted on reading the denial letter, refusing to do anything else other than repeating the letter my doctor and I had already received.
Hoping to strengthen my case with insurers, my doctor and I agreed to do a trial run of IVIG, where I would access treatment by paying out-of-pocket. Meanwhile, if my treatment proved helpful enough, my doctor would once again attempt to get insurance to cover IVIG, this time by citing my reduced level of pain.
The financial reality was crushing. Without insurance coverage, each treatment costs over $10,000 — an astronomical sum to pay repeatedly, especially when I’m already spending more than $600 monthly in insurance premiums. To help cover these costs, my parents have been draining their retirement savings. The financial sacrifice of my family, combined with the repeated denials, took a profound psychological toll. I began to see myself as a burden on everyone and everything around me. These situations strip patients of more than just medical care; they rob us of hope, dignity and autonomy.
My experience reflects a systemic failure embedded deep within America’s corporate insurance industry. The system creates a bureaucratic maze of endless forms, appeals and peer-to-peer reviews designed to discourage patients from fighting back, and it works. 
On average, only one in every 500 prior authorization denials is even disputed and nearly 90% of physicians report personally witnessing insurance company policies negatively affect their patients’ clinical outcomes. I wasn’t denied because my treatment was ineffective or inappropriate – I was denied because a third party presumed to know better than my doctors.
My story echoes that of thousands of patients across America. The number of cases where doctors’ medical judgments are overruled by algorithms continues to climb. Mass coverage denials and delays don’t just drive up costs for patients and hospitals; they also put lives at risk while padding the pockets of corporate insurance companies. 
Recent months have generated public outrage over prior authorization delays and denials, placing corporate insurers under greater scrutiny. The health insurance industry has promised reform, but I remain skeptical. Even if these promises materialize, I question whether change will come quickly enough for patients like me who endure constant pain or for those in need of immediate lifesaving treatments. 
Our stories demand immediate reform at both the state and federal levels. Regulators must stop blindly deferring to insurers’ narrow definitions of medical necessity. No one should be forced to choose between unbearable pain and depleting their parents’ retirement savings. I’m speaking up not just for myself, but for every patient who’s been told to wait, suffer, or simply give up.
The system is broken, and we are paying the price: in pain, in hope and in dollars we don’t have. It’s time for that to change. Policymakers, at the state and federal level, need to scrutinize insurer practices and regulate them to ensure Americans get the care they need.

RICHMOND, Va. — The upcoming Virginia gubernatorial election will make history, with the state’s first female governor poised to take office in January, but it is not generating as much money as some past races.
Republican nominee and current Lt. Gov Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger are making their final pushes to voters before they fill out their ballots.
Even with the historic implications, total fundraising for this gubernatorial race is substantially down from other recent elections, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

 Why the fundraising decrease?

Political Action Committees, or PACs, are tagged as the industry that gives the most money in Virginia statewide races. As of Sept. 29, just over $16 million has been donated from PACs on both sides of the aisle, a notable decrease from the $40.5 million donated in 2021 and the $36 million donated in 2017, although money is still coming in, according to VPAP.
This year’s numbers are lower than recent elections, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the election is not drawing interest, according to Richard Meagher, professor of political science at Randolph-Macon College.
“Sometimes it’s an outlier, like in 2021 you have a very, very wealthy individual, Glenn Youngkin, running against a very, very well-connected fundraiser, Terry McAuliffe,” Meagher said.
Because the last election raised such high financial numbers, it may be skewing ideas of what to raise in future elections, according to Meagher.
Outsider Funding
Both nominees have garnered a substantial amount of funding from individual donations outside of Virginia, according to VPAP. Spanberger has seen nearly 42% of her individual donations come from out-of-state contributors, while Earle-Sears has received 36% from such donors..
“That’s more and more the trend,” Meagher said. “Being a Democrat in Virginia matters much more to national Democrats than it used to.”
Virginia is 1 of 4 states in the country that hold odd-year elections outside the year of a national election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
This draws participation from both political parties nationally, as they may not want to wait until their next election to try and make a difference, according to Meagher.
 Miscellaneous groups provide major cash infusions

The second highest industry to donate to statewide candidates are labeled miscellaneous groups, according to VPAP. They have donated $14 million toward both political parties as of Sept. 29.
Within this industry, retirees top the charts in total money donated, with in and out-of-state donors. In a close second, nonwage earners have contributed several million dollars to nominees in this race.
Donors within this category do not list their occupations or backgrounds, so it cannot be determined what industry they would align to, according to a VPAP representative. Thus, they are listed as nonwage earners.
 Advocacy groups

Single issue groups claim the No. 3 spot for statewide candidate donations.
Donations tagged environmental groups lead at $3.6 million, with most coming from nonprofit Clean Virginia, which now competes against Dominion Energy with political donations.
Miscellaneous single issue groups such as veteran groups are in the second top donors under this category, followed by abortion rights and gun control.
  Real estate, gaming industries contributing more 

Real estate is the No. 4 top by industry, with $5.8 donated so far.
Developers lead the fundraising charge within the real estate industry, with over $2.1 million donated, according to VPAP. Several of the top donations are to Republican candidates.
“Real estate developers always donate money,” Meagher said. “They’re always a kind of powerful interest. Sometimes they focus more on local constituencies … they might work in local elections because they think they can get something out of it.”
Also paying into the political pot now is gaming, notably sports betting. Gaming has only been legal for a handful of years in Virginia, but it has been a large player within the state’s economy. The state has made nearly $2 billion in revenue from sports betting within the state since the first legalized bets were accepted in January 2021, according to numbers from the Virginia Lottery.
The rise of the gaming lobby in Virginia is a result of new casinos and legalization of online sports betting.
“That’s why you’re seeing more and more money being thrown around,” Meagher said.
 Grassroots fundraising a ‘good sign’

Since Virginia’s last gubernatorial election, Spanberger has received a higher amount of cash contributions of $100 or less and from a greater number of donors than her opponent, Earle-Sears, according to VPAP.
“If you’re looking at the strength of a candidate, you don’t want to just look at their dollar amount totals, you want to look at the number of contributions they get,” Meagher said.
This number heavily favors Spanberger, which suggests support for her campaign is deep, and is more of a grassroots effort than Earle-Sears.
“I think one of the reasons that people are really bullish on the Democrats’ chances this year is it’s not just that the money is coming in from big money donors in the national Democratic groups, it’s that the money is coming in from individuals,” Meagher said. “People are fired up to give their $20, their $10, their $50 to Spanberger.”
 Money isn’t everything

Even though the financials seem to heavily favor Spanberger, this does not mean she is guaranteed to win. All polls have Spanberger ahead of her opponent, but there is no victor until all the ballots are officially counted.
“Just because you have more people than the other side who are going to cut you checks doesn’t mean that those people are all going to vote, or that they translate into the same amount of votes,” Meagher said.
Early in-person voting is open until Nov. 1. Election Day is Nov. 4, with polls open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.

(Stock photo by John Fedele/Getty Images)“You always need to be thinking about how to protect yourself; you never know what you might be accused of.”
This was a piece of advice given to me by the OB-GYN physician I was working with as an aspiring medical student.
After leaving the ultrasound room of a patient who was just informed that her pregnancy was no longer viable, I was learning the hard truth about what it meant to be an OB-GYN in South Carolina.
When medical care after a miscarriage can so closely mirror medical care during an abortion, and laws are written by individuals with no medical training, physicians are left in fear of being criminalized for providing medically necessary care.
This fear and hesitation leads to subpar care and worse outcomes for patients in South Carolina. As a born-and-raised South Carolinian about to begin my medical education, it was then that I realized I would have to leave the state.
Restrictive abortion bills such as S.323, which will be heard Wednesday by a Senate Medical Affairs subcommittee, are harrowing to medical students and physicians in training.
With no exceptions for rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomaly, it is one of the most restrictive abortion bans ever introduced.
The bill even criminalizes providing information about how to receive an abortion.
Medical providers who perform abortions outside of life-threatening circumstances face loss of licensure and prison sentences of up to 30 years.
Current South Carolina abortion law, which is already one of the most restrictive in the country, defines an exempted medical emergency as a “condition which, on the basis of the physician’s good faith judgment, so complicates a pregnancy as to necessitate an immediate abortion to avert the risk of her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function.”
When physicians may have to prove to a court of law that their pregnant patients were at serious risk of injury or death, complications which could have been averted are forced to progress. Uncertainty and hesitation when making life-or-death decisions directly harms patients facing emergency situations.
For many providers, this risk is too great to take on.
More than 45% of physicians who completed residency training in South Carolina from 2014 to 2023 left the state to practice. That’s a higher proportion than the nationwide average, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges’ 2024 Report on Residents.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson decision, studies indicate a pattern of doctors and trainees leaving states with restrictive laws or deciding not to train there at all.
With fewer health care providers left behind, shortages are felt most acutely in small, rural communities.
South Carolina consistently falls below the national OB-GYN physicians per capita, and the shortages are projected only to worsen as the population ages and demand increases.
Within the state, six counties already have no obstetric providers and no hospitals or birthing centers providing obstetric care, according to the March of Dimes’ 2024 report.
S.323 threatens to turn these shortages into a full-blown crisis for anyone who needs prenatal care, emergency treatment, or routine gynecologic services.
Lawmakers who insist they are protecting life need to grapple with the reality that these policies are pushing critical providers and students outside of South Carolina.
If the goal is healthier mothers and babies, we cannot afford to drive away the health providers who can make that goal possible.
I have lived in South Carolina for my entire life. I attended high school, completed my undergraduate degree, and am working towards earning my medical degree in South Carolina with plans for a career in primary care.
Before the current abortion law passed in 2023, I was dedicated to remaining in my home state to practice, hoping to do my part to improve the state’s physician shortage.
However, lawmakers are pushing me and many other future physicians away. South Carolina needs to consider whether or not the health of the state is truly a priority.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)This past summer, one of Dr. Amy Boutwell’s patients needed an imaging test done, but Lahey Hospital and Medical Center, which is down the road from her practice in the Boston suburb of Lexington, Massachusetts, told her it would be a five-month wait.
“And I said, ‘Gosh, there’s got to be a better way,’” Boutwell said. “The question that came to my mind was, ‘Isn’t there some sort of independent imaging center where I don’t have to send her through the big, expensive, and busy health care system?’”
Her search turned up nothing nearby in Massachusetts. But located 30 miles north, just over the state line in Nashua, she found Tellica Imaging. She learned the newly opened independent imaging center could take her patient the next day and at a much lower cost. It worked out so well, she began sending more patients there. Boutwell’s status as an independent doctor made it possible. Doctors working in big health systems, she said, typically send patients to the imaging facilities within their own system.
“We live in Metro Boston. We’re used to using large health care systems,” Boutwell said. “This patient might have said, ‘I know and trust the health care infrastructure of Massachusetts,’ but instead, I think it’s really telling in this day and age, patients want access. They want transparency around pricing. They want easy and convenient. Of course, we need to know that the quality is going to be high and trustworthy. But for me as a doctor, and for my patient, in this case, we both were really compelled by, ‘It’s quick and it’s easy and it’s inexpensive,’ so let’s go to New Hampshire.”
For the longest time, Boutwell was perplexed as to why she couldn’t find centers like Tellica closer to her.
“I just thought, how’s it possible here in the medical mecca of the world, I don’t have an independent imaging center?” Boutwell said. “And I didn’t really know why.”
Many point to a primary culprit: “certificate of need” laws, which require health care providers to seek permission from state regulators for any new services they’d like to provide. 
Under the laws, providers must prove to regulators that any new proposed services are necessary. Certificate of need laws also allow would-be competitors to weigh in and contest applications by arguing they already offer the service and, as such, a new provider is unnecessary. 
The laws have been in place in some states since the 1960s, but the 1974 National Health Planning and Resources Development Act mandated every state institute them. Proponents believed the laws would restrain health care costs, increase quality, and provide better access to care for traditionally underserved communities. However, many experts in the field argue they’ve done the opposite. Congress repealed its federal certificate of need mandate in 1986, but 35 states, including Massachusetts, still have the laws on the books, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy. The laws vary based on what types of care are subject to the laws and how the process works.
New Hampshire is the only New England state without certificate of need laws. 
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, a direct primary care physician in Salem, Massachusetts, is another Bay State doctor who sends patients to independent New Hampshire imaging centers. He said Derry Imaging, which is roughly 45 miles away from his practice, might charge around $700 for an MRI. However, Gold said that at one of the large health systems in Massachusetts, such as Mass General Brigham, “you’re shooting a dart in the wind.” He said a patient won’t know exactly what they’re being charged until after the x-ray is complete. In some cases, Gold said, once insurance and the health system finish negotiating the patient could be asked to pay roughly $1,500 (while insurance pays another $1,500).
Gold provides a unique type of care called direct primary care, where patients pay a monthly fee out-of-pocket for unlimited access to his services. He said this allows him more time with patients and to consider patients’ costs, among other things. He often advises patients to go to independent imaging centers in New Hampshire, even if their insurance won’t cover it, because paying Derry Imaging out-of-pocket is often cheaper for patients with high-deductible insurance policies. Though he notes he can sometimes get good prices at private orthopedic centers for some services, those facilities are increasingly being purchased by larger health systems.
In Massachusetts, Gold argues certificate of need laws have constrained the free market because when big health systems like Lahey and Mass General already offer imaging, it makes it harder for smaller providers to prove their services are needed. However, New Hampshire repealed its certificate of need laws in 2016 and so this phenomena hasn’t occurred here.
Indeed, analysis from the Mercatus Center, a think tank based at George Mason University, estimated in 2020 that Massachusetts nonhospital providers would’ve likely performed 80,388 MRIs annually if the state had no certificate of need laws as opposed to the 58,960 it did perform. The organization also estimated that without certificate of need laws, nonhospital providers would’ve performed 758 PET scans as opposed to 420. The researchers found no statistically significant change for hospital providers, suggesting the laws could be protecting hospitals from competition. The analysis estimated that, across all services subject to certificate of need laws, annual health care spending would’ve fallen $320 per capita without the laws.
“Neither theory nor evidence suggest that CON (certificate of need) laws work as advertised,” researcher Matthew Mitchell wrote in a 2024 report in the academic journal Inquiry. “While advocates for the regulation have offered several rationales for its continuance, the balance of evidence suggests that the rules protect incumbent providers from competition at the expense of patients, payors, and would-be competitors.”
In New England, this has created an interesting dynamic. Patients in southern New Hampshire often travel to the Boston area for treatment at larger hospitals. However, as costs and wait times rise in Massachusetts, doctors say it makes sense to go the opposite direction for certain services. Boutwell said the “cost of care in Massachusetts and access to care in Massachusetts is at an all time high and an all time low.”
“This is not a story of people who can’t afford care going to New Hampshire,” she said. “With the classic cycle of people from the north coming into Boston, you might think, ‘Well, maybe people who are price sensitive will be people who don’t have access, you know, people who don’t have the money.’ But in this case, we’ve got all the benefits of who we are, and we’re making an educated choice to say, ‘You know what? Let’s go to New Hampshire.’”

(Photo by Steven Senne/The Associated Press)One morning earlier this year, as Deb Capistrano came on duty for her shift as a nurse in her hospital’s stroke unit, her colleagues from the night shift warned her that one of her patients for the day was a man who’d been threatening to harm them.
Capistrano has been a registered nurse for 17 years. Threats of violence aren’t new to her. Across the nation, hospitals have become some of the most violent workplaces in America, where health care workers experience workplace violence at triple the rate of all other private industries combined, federal statistics show.
For Capistrano, the worry that she could be hurt while doing her job is always in the back of her mind.
But in California, where she works, robust state law requires hospitals to create detailed violence prevention plans specific to the needs of each hospital unit, with input from frontline workers like nurses.
When Capistrano arrived on duty, nursing management already had a plan to keep her safe. For example, every time Capistrano entered the patient’s room she had an escort, and hospital security did their rounds more frequently on her unit.
“In that moment, I felt really safe,” she told Stateline. “There were a lot of different things in place that day to prevent any harm. I think that’s largely due to having that law in place.”
Health care workers such as Capistrano make up just 10% of the American workforce but experience 48% of the nonfatal injuries from workplace violence, according to federal data.
And the threat is increasing. The number of health care providers who reported harassment at work from patients, patients’ families and colleagues more than doubled between 2018 and 2022, according to the latest data available from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Research has found workplace violence in health care is increasingly common due to a number of factors. Some are organizational: not enough staffing, long patient wait times or lack of appropriate security. Patients’ expectations about how fast or easy it should be to access care appear to have increased in recent years, as the costs of health care have gone up.
Researchers have also found that public attitudes are being shaped by politicians who might promote or undermine health services for political gain, particularly relating to contentious topics such as vaccination, masking or abortion.
With threats against nurses, physicians and other staff on the rise, state lawmakers and hospital officials are scrambling to put stronger protections in place. Those include increased criminal penalties, armed security guards and violence prevention plans.
This year, Ohio, Oregon and Washington enacted laws designed to curb workplace violence in health care spaces by requiring employers to create and carry out detailed violence prevention plans. Such plans can include risk assessments specific to each hospital unit, staff training on de-escalation techniques, increased security and a clear policy for reporting incidents.
Dozens of states — including California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine and Texas — have enacted laws aimed at curbing violence in hospitals and clinics, the vast majority of them in the past decade. Legislators in other states, including Alaska, Massachusetts, New York and Wyoming, introduced similar legislation in their most recent sessions.
Prevention and punishment
A few years ago, during a shift in the emergency department at a hospital in Maine, nurse Meg Sinclair was tending to an older patient who became increasingly agitated. The patient grabbed both sides of her stethoscope and tried to strangle her.

Sinclair, who now works at Maine Medical Center in Portland, has been a nurse for 11 years. She’s spent most of that time in hospital emergency departments, where the potential for chaos never feels far away. A fellow nurse recently told her about getting her nose broken by a patient.
“It’s kind of crazy because nurses unfortunately normalize these horrific things that happen to them,” Sinclair told Stateline.
“You’re feeling scared in an environment where you shouldn’t have to, in your workplace where you’re trying to help people.”
In Maine, a 2023 law toughened the punishment for assaults that occur in a hospital emergency department.
To Sinclair, the law felt performative. She believes adding harsher penalties doesn’t do much to prevent assault from happening in the first place.
“It’s just not effective because it’s reactionary,” she said. “It’s frustrating, because the last thing I’d want to do is blame the patients. They’re often sick and scared, and not in their right mind.”
But proponents of such laws have said they’re needed to help law enforcement hold offenders accountable. Other states, such as Georgia, also have increased criminal penalties for assaults on nurses and other health care workers.











You’re feeling scared in an environment where you shouldn’t have to, in your workplace where you’re trying to help people.


– Meg Sinclair, an emergency nurse in Portland, Maine



Maine Democratic state Rep. Holly Stover introduced a bill this year to extend her state’s harsher penalties to assaults on all health care workers, not just those working in the ER. She told Stateline that the penalties would only apply to people deemed competent to face such charges, not those unable to understand the consequences of their actions.
Her bill passed the House but was indefinitely postponed in the Senate in June. While Stover will leave office next year due to term limits, she hopes another lawmaker will reintroduce the bill.
“I’ve seen workers who have had broken cheekbones, broken noses, broken jaws,” said Stover, who has worked in health care and social services, and serves as a trustee for her local hospital.
“Any legislation that can better address the prevalence and potential for violence in health care settings is going to be critically important.”
Other states have focused on stepping up hospital security. A 2023 North Carolina law, for example, requires hospitals with emergency departments to have a law enforcement officer — not just unarmed security guards — on campus at all times.
But many hospitals have already gone down that road.
Hospital police forces
In September, WellSpan Health, a nine-hospital system in southern Pennsylvania, announced it would create its own private police force, adding armed officers to supplement its unarmed security team. The system will also be increasing its weapons detection equipment at hospital entrances.

WellSpan is in the same region of Pennsylvania where, in February, a gunman entered the intensive care unit at UPMC Memorial Hospital and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police. The shootout left one officer dead, and it wounded a doctor, a nurse, a hospital custodian and two other officers.
A growing number of hospitals are launching their own police forces, said Tony Pope, the chief of police and emergency preparedness at Columbus Regional Health in Columbus, Indiana, south of Indianapolis.
At least 29 states allow hospitals to create their own police forces, with officers who can carry firearms and make arrests, according to the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety, a professional association for safety and security directors at health care facilities. Pope, who is president-elect of the association, said the levels of authority and jurisdiction for such officers can vary from state to state, but they’re able to carry firearms and make arrests.
At Indiana’s state police academy, health care is the fastest-growing contingent of police officers in the state, Pope said.
High-profile incidents nationwide have prompted more health systems to beef up their security. In 2023, a man opened fire in the waiting room of an Atlanta medical practice, leaving one woman dead and four others wounded. A few months later, a visitor at an Oregon hospital opened fire and killed a security guard, and a doctor was shot and injured at a Dallas-area medical center. The year before, a man killed his surgeon, another doctor, a receptionist and a visitor at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office.
Workplace violence cost hospitals an estimated $18 billion in 2023 alone, according to a recent report from the American Hospital Association.
Pope said his force in Columbus has seen a 56% reduction in violent incidents since 2023.
And police forces aren’t just for the big systems anymore. Smaller hospitals, too, are testing the waters. In July, the 25-bed Perry County Memorial Hospital in southern Indiana announced it would begin hiring officers for its new police force this fall.
Scrubs and security
Sinclair often talks with other nurses about their workplace needs as a member of her local nurses union. She believes the best action state legislators could take to combat violence in health care is to require hospitals and other clinics to maintain certain nurse-to-patient ratios and penalize employers that exceed them.
When hospitals buy physician practices, prices go up

“When we’re short-staffed and someone’s begging for help and you can’t get to them because you’re running between eight different rooms putting out fire after fire, then you get the verbal assault, the hair pulling,” said Sinclair, who said she’s experienced all of those things.
“You have to meet people’s needs or else they resort to things they otherwise wouldn’t do.”
Nursing groups have for years requested nurse-to-patient ratios. Only a handful of states, including California, have passed such laws.
Hospital systems and other employers argue ratios don’t give them needed flexibility in hiring, and could threaten the financial safety of some institutions that might be forced to close units if they can’t meet the ratios.
Pope said that in his experience, hospitals and other health employers likely need several different laws and policies in place, from prevention plans to added security measures.
“When it comes to addressing workplace violence, it really is important for health care facilities and systems to have that multipronged approach,” he said.

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)Ohio Statehouse lawmakers missed their first deadline for congressional redistricting, with Republican lawmakers defending the move to kick the process over to the Ohio Redistricting Commission without them ever introducing or negotiating on a map.
The constitutional amendment passed by Ohio voters in 2018 required lawmakers to negotiate in good faith and attempt to pass a bipartisan map by Sept. 30 before the process went to the redistricting commission.
The Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting met Tuesday in the House Finance Committee room for their second meeting of the month, on the day of the first deadline mentioned in the Ohio Constitution for passing a bipartisan map.
The committee began with Senate Leader Nickie Antonio supporting the Democratic map proposal, which is still the only map that has been formally introduced by either side of the General Assembly.
The congressional map proposed by Ohio legislative Democrats at a Tuesday press conference.
The Democratic map presents a breakdown of eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts in the congressional delegation, which they say came from taking an average of the last decade of voting results.
That average means a state ratio of 56% Republican to 43% Democrats.
The current map has 10 Republican districts and five Democratic, for 66% Republican control.
Republican lawmakers during the meeting argued that an average of the last decade of voting trends is not required by the constitution for congressional redistricting.
Amid Antonio’s testimony and questions from legislators, it was once again made clear that the process would be continuing into October and a vote would not be held on the Democratic map.
“I’m pragmatic enough to know … that (lawmakers passing a map with bipartisan support) is not only unlikely but impossible,” Antonio said. “We do not have a session today.”
“If needed” sessions that had been scheduled for both the Ohio House and Ohio Senate were cancelled before the Tuesday meeting, indicating the committee wouldn’t be holding a vote on a map.
State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, claimed Antonio’s mention of the Sept. 30 deadline omitted the clauses of the Ohio Constitution that come after it.
“Can we just basically agree there are two options here in the constitution, and not passing a map by Sept. 30 is in no way a violation of any deadline, correct?” Stewart asked.
Antonio countered, saying the people “really wanted us, in this first step, to take the opportunity to work together in a bipartisan way.”
According to the constitution, if a bipartisan map isn’t adopted by the end of September, the process moves to the Ohio Redistricting Commission with an Oct. 31 deadline.
If no bipartisan map comes out of the commission, the decision-making returns to the General Assembly.
The map can be passed without bipartisan support at that point with a simple majority vote by Nov. 30.
At last week’s committee meeting, committee co-chair Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, agreed that while the September deadline is in the constitution, though he said the existence of the other deadlines opens up opportunities for passage “in the next couple of months.”
“I know that everybody wanted something done by today,” Bird claimed, “but we’ve still got a couple of months and we’ve still got time to keep talking.”
Co-chair state Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Twp., also maintained an argument she made in the last meeting, that though the Democratic lawmakers are seeking a “fair map,” fairness is not a word used in the constitutional process of redistricting.
“The word ‘fairness’ is not in the constitution (with regard to redistricting), right?” Timken asked, eliciting laughter around the committee room.
Antonio said it’s difficult to talk about representation in drawing districts without taking fairness into account.
“Fairness was a part of the will of the people, and so through that lens, we used a fair measurement to be able to see how the people are voting, especially in national elections,” Antonio said.
Ohioans who spoke in support of the Democratic proposal noted the lack of opposition testimony to the Democratic map and once again accused the committee of a lack of transparency.
Math teacher and Columbus resident Tom Reardon counted the more than 140 testimonies submitted at the last meeting.
“What percentage of the testimonies were for gerrymandering, which is being done right now in our state? The answer is zero,” Reardon told the committee. “No one came and supported what you’ve been talking about.”
There was one person who came to Tuesday’s meeting who didn’t support the Democratic map.
Paul Miller was active in the last round of congressional redistricting, presenting his own proposal and accusing “liberal activists” of messing with the process.
His testimony submitted on Tuesday continued that message, with him claiming “Democrat activists were being entirely disingenuous.”
“In any case, the real issue persists with the present incarnation of their plan to flip Republican seats in the fact that they’re doing it at all,” Miller told the committee in his written testimony. “Instead of pitting Republicans against each other in primaries, now they just want to take them out right before the actual elections.”
Columbus resident Pari Sabety said the hour-long discussion that had already happened before she spoke hadn’t changed her mind about how the process was going.
“There’s no transparency here,” Sabety said. “Let’s be clear, you hold the reigns in this process, you are the supermajority and you have managed to rig this process to suit your end goal.”
 No negotiations
On claims from Republican lawmakers that Democrats are trying gerrymander through their proposal, Antonio referenced comments from Assistant Minority Whip Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, at last week’s meeting.
“The minority does not hold any legislative power or majority, let alone the ability to gerrymander,” Antonio said.
Republican committee members also pointed to comments they said indicated the Democrats wouldn’t agree to a map that was less than 8-7.
“The Democrats said ‘8-7, take it or leave it,’ firm offer,” claimed state Rep. D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron. “So what are Republicans supposed to do … after we hear something like that?”
Antonio denied having said “take it or leave it,” and said she was “saddened that I didn’t communicate as well as I thought I did … that we were open for discussion.”
“I am always, and have been from the beginning, open to discussion,” Antonio said.
In fact, Antonio said, she reached out to Republican leadership before the process began to ask about a plan.
“I did knock on the door, quietly, respectfully, individually,” Antonio said. “…I got a response that was ‘It’s coming, there’s something coming.’”
Bird and Timken told reporters after the meeting adjourned that with no action that they don’t know of any discussions by their respective Republican caucuses about the drawing of a map.
“There’s not a map that I know of,” Bird said.
Timken said the caucuses plan to follow the process “through to the end of November.”
This indicates Republican lawmakers expect no bipartisan agreement from the Ohio Redistricting Commission before Oct. 31.
Bird was unmoved to see only one opponent of the Democratic maps come to the two meetings, pointing to a push from the Democratic Party to bring in supporters.
“I think we’ve all seen there’s been many calls and social media from the Democratic Party to have people come and testify,” Bird told reporters. “You’ve not heard that from the Republican Party. I don’t know that that’s good or bad, but we’ve heard a lot of testimony and, like you said, mostly one-sided.”
Now that the first legislative deadline has passed, the Ohio Redistricting Commission will need to be reactivated by Gov. Mike DeWine.
The governor is required to also serve on the commission, along with the state auditor and secretary of state. The General Assembly will be represented with two Republican legislators and two Democratic legislators.
Whenever the map is adopted along the way, if a court challenge is presented to it, the Ohio Supreme Court will have jurisdiction over lawsuits against the map.
Republicans added party labels to Ohio Supreme Court beginning in 2022 and now control the court 6-1.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-01 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As Trump calls for $100K H-1B visa fee, CT employers face uncertainty",P.R. Lockhart and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/01/trump-h-1b-visa-fee-ct-employers/,"Many CT companies use the H-1B visa to hire specialized employees, but the new policy could make that financially unfeasible for some.","On Sept. 19, Tariq Islam was starting off the weekend at a wedding in Hartford. But late in the afternoon, as the celebration picked up, text messages began to flood his phone. Islam’s work colleagues — fellow executives of the engineering firm run by Islam’s father — had a concern that could not wait.
Without warning, the federal government had announced a new national immigration policy affecting high-skilled temporary workers. In a proclamation, White House officials said they sought to “impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program.” The changes were intended “to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.” 
Specifically, a $100,000 fee for each new employee seeking an H-1B visa was set to take effect in less than 48 hours. 
The announcement threw Islam’s weekend into chaos. “I just started seeing massive emails from a lot of panicked employees,” said Islam, who serves as chief of staff for AI Engineers Inc., a Connecticut-based engineering consultancy. 
The company’s immediate concern was that employees who were traveling internationally wouldn’t be able to get back into the U.S. unless the $100,000 fee was paid. “We have several employees who are maybe visiting family in India, Nepal, China,” he said of discussions that weekend. “We needed to tell them to get a flight back to the United States, like, ASAP.”
That Saturday, the Trump administration made attempts to clarify things. The new fee, which took effect on Sept. 21, would only apply to employees who received a first-time H-1B visa in the upcoming 2026 lottery. Employers would only be required to pay the fee once, and new workers would not be able to enter the country if the $100,000 hadn’t been paid. Current H-1B visa holders, like the roughly two dozen visa holders employed by AI Engineers, would be able to reenter the U.S. with no problem. 
But the proclamation still left many unanswered questions and raised concerns about what the change might mean for skilled foreign workers already in the country. Islam’s family-run business, which employs some 350 engineers that work on transportation and infrastructure projects, uses the H-1B visa to hire highly specialized design engineers, workers whose knowledge, skills, and experience are vital to the company. 
The new policy, Islam said, makes that “financially unfeasible.” 
The move by the Trump administration comes amid a broader crackdown on immigration. The specific focus of this restriction — the H-1B visa program — marks the administration’s biggest move yet to rein in skilled migration, a prominent contributor to the ranks of America’s tech workers, entrepreneurs, researchers and physicians.
The short- and long-term effects of the change are unclear. But economists and immigration experts say they could be widespread. 
In Connecticut, the change could reshape the workforce in sectors that rely on highly skilled temporary employees, shaking up the state economy at a time when businesses are already struggling to fill open roles and grow their labor force.
“The risk to the Connecticut economy is that you lose not just these individuals, but the ecosystems that they ultimately support,” said Dustin Nord, director of the CBIA Foundation for Economic Growth and Opportunity. 
Connecticut’s H-1B workforce, by the numbers
H-1B visas allow highly-skilled workers temporary employment in the U.S for up to three years, with the possibility for an additional 3-year extension. Workers fill a variety of roles, but the program has been most closely tied to America’s tech workforce, particularly computer programmers and IT workers. 
To obtain an H-1B visa for an employee, privately-held companies must enter a lottery process to receive application slots. Successful companies then submit completed applications for the selected workers. Nationally, there are roughly 85,000 visas available each year: 65,000 of those are for workers in specialized fields, with an additional 20,000 visas available for workers with advanced degrees from a U.S.-based institution.
Prior to the fee changes earlier this month, H-1B applications cost between $2,000 and $5,000, with additional fees and potential costs for legal assistance pushing the total as high as $10,000 per employee for some companies.
Connecticut’s H-1B workforce is largely concentrated in the state’s largest cities, including Hartford, New Haven and Stamford. But Nord said H-1B workers can be found in positions across Connecticut, spanning the majority of the state’s towns and cities. Limited federal data makes it difficult to know exactly how many H-1B visa holders are currently in the state and how many visas are ultimately used by each company, but estimates suggest that somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 workers could be present.
There is more data available on the number of visa applications and approvals, although it doesn’t show exactly how many visa holders actually complete the H-1B process and start work. In fiscal year 2024, Connecticut companies were approved for 453 new H-1B workers. After petitioning for a spot in April 2023, these workers were selected in the lottery process and approved for work in the U.S.
Recipients of the visas are mostly clustered around Hartford and parts of Fairfield County. The majority of visa holders’ positions were in science, engineering and technology. 
In 2025, hundreds of H-1B applications have already been submitted in the state. The visa process for the year will be completed in October, when new visa recipients officially receive H-1B status. 
While a range of companies employ H-1B workers in Connecticut, there are three areas in particular that would be most affected by the recent changes: entrepreneurs and startup founders, university-employed researchers and professors, and health care workers — particularly physicians. 
“We already have a shortage of doctors, nurses and health care workers,” said Dana Bucin, a Hartford-based immigration attorney whose firm helps businesses with H-1B applications in a handful of states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey. 
“After we cut the access to H-1B for these professions,” she added, “it may be at a crisis level.”
A source of doctors, researchers, and innovators
As the data shows, Yale University is one of the leading employers of H-1B workers in Connecticut. The visa holders are typically employed in university departments as tenure-track faculty, making them a vital source for academic advancements and student support. The changes could cost the university millions in fees if it were to maintain its current number of visa workers.
So far, Yale has offered little public comment on what the policy change might mean. A news release, published on Sept. 20 by Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars, said the changes would not affect already granted visas. The notice said the school “will update our guidance as we gain more clarity about H-1B change of status or amendment petitions.” 
Representatives for the university declined to offer additional comment on the potential impacts of the $100,000 visa application fee, referring only to this previous statement. 
The University of Connecticut, another institution that applies for many H-1B visas, also did not offer a detailed comment when asked about the visa changes and their potential effects for university employees. Spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said in an email, “UConn is currently assessing the federal directive and its potential impacts on university programs.”

Many universities employ H-1B visa holders as faculty, researchers and doctors. It is currently unclear if higher education will receive any sort of exemption from the fee. 
But the labor force effects could stretch beyond universities. The changes could also hit the state’s health care workforce, reducing the number of available physicians and nurses at a time when the state is already struggling to fill positions. 
“The H-1B visa program is essential to helping hospitals recruit highly skilled physicians and other health care professionals to meet the care delivery needs of patients — including those in rural and underserved areas — as we work to grow and train the future health care workforce,” a spokesperson for the Connecticut Hospital Association wrote in an emailed statement. “At a time when the health care workforce nationwide is experiencing shortages, we stress the importance of ensuring that federal policies do not make it more difficult to attract and retain health care professionals.”
Mariam Hakim-Zargar, an orthopedic surgeon in Torrington and the president of the Connecticut State Medical Society, said the $100,000 visa fee could escalate these difficulties even further. “We definitely have a hard time recruiting and retaining doctors in our state, and this is just going to add an extra financial burden,” she said.
Hakim-Zargar added that while national organizations, like the American Medical Association, have recently called for the Trump administration to create an exemption that would protect health care employers from the visa application fees, the damage may already be done. 
“Why would somebody want to come to the United States for training with all this uncertainty?” she said. In the coming months, Hakim-Zargar added, it’s possible that medical professionals utilize incentives “to go to other countries, Canada, European countries, for their training instead.” 
As policy changes go into effect, concerns of a deeper economic impact
With the visa changes still so new, many employers in Connecticut haven’t yet figured out exactly what they’ll mean for their businesses. And the changes have amplified an already deep sense of uncertainty for those facing changing trade policy. Raising the visa fee for skilled workers so significantly changes the cost structure for employers across sectors. 
Economists said H-1B visas have become an important facet of the nation’s immigration system, allowing the country to attract high-skilled workers that complement America’s workforce. 
“It’s the main bridge between university educated, bachelors, masters, PhD workers with specialized skills around the world and the US economy,” said Michael Clemens, a professor at George Mason University and a fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “This is the bridge that they’re dropping multiple bombs on.”
If the fee drives down the number of H-1B applications significantly, there is a concern that some industries could face a short-term decline from a reduced number of available workers. 
But more than that, economists worry there could be a longer term economic impact, as some companies turn to offshoring and remaining domestic employers struggle to fill positions left vacant for an extended period. 
“Immigrants to a country tend to have a different distribution of skills, and because they have slightly different skills from the native born, that allows everyone to specialize more and in what they’re good at,” said Jennifer Hunt, an economist at Rutgers University. “And when people specialize more in what they’re good at, the economy is more efficient.”
The $100,000 H-1B visa fee, she said, “could shut down the H-1B program almost entirely.”
Those effects could be potentially magnified by the fact that the administration has not yet made many aspects of its policy clear. Bucin, the immigration attorney, said while the policy has already taken effect, employers aren’t clear on how to actually submit the $100,000 application fee or how the process will be managed.
“There are things wrong with the H-1B program, but when you get a sprained ankle, you don’t cut off your leg.”Michael Clemens, George Mason University
Kris Klein Hernández, a history professor at Connecticut College, said the administration has not explained its plan to replace the loss of highly skilled migrant workers. “It’s not helpful,” he said of the recent policy change. 
“If you’re going to charge to bring in outside talent, then there needs to be some sort of program for Americans to get the proper training, then to get hired into the roles that weren’t being filled with Americans in the first place,” he said. “I don’t see that in the policy.”
So far, the Trump administration has maintained that the changes are necessary to curb abuses in the visa system, arguing that the H-1B visa has been used to hire lower-skilled workers for far less than an American employee would demand — tying these workers to companies that then exploit them.
The visa program has also been criticized for lacking proper guardrails, with politicians on both sides of the aisle seeking reforms over the years. In 2024, a report from Bloomberg found that staffing companies had been able to submit multiple visa applications for the same employee, gaming the system to receive higher amounts of visa slots. 
In August, the conservative Heritage Foundation argued that the current visa lottery program “disproportionately benefits large tech firms and — mostly foreign — outsourcing companies, often at the expense of smaller employers.” 
Clemens said those concerns should call for additional reforms to the system rather than the $100,000 fee the administration is now using. “There are things wrong with the H-1B program, but when you get a sprained ankle, you don’t cut off your leg,” he said. 
Islam, the AI Engineers executive, said that in the future his firm will likely stop pursuing new H-1B applicants. “It doesn’t make sense to pay 100K to bring them over,” he said. 
As a result, Islam expects the workload for the company’s current engineers to increase. With regional competition from larger markets in New York City and Boston, and industry organizations highlighting a shortage of civil engineers in the U.S., there aren’t many workers who can immediately fill the sort of bespoke design engineering roles his firm needs, he said.
With the visa changes being so recent, the exemptions to the fee undecided, and the first affected employees not entering the lottery until next year, it will be some time until the exact effects of the H-1B changes on Connecticut — and the nation at large — are apparent. But for now, the visa change has fueled concerns about the future of the nation’s economy and one portion of the workforce that helps drive it. 
“The business world functions on predictability,” said Bucin. “Volatility is not good for the economy, or for employers.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-Engineers-scaled-e1759268439113-1024x707.jpeg,,,2025-10-01 05:57:16.071405

The Rail Commission approved: 

A $350,000 grant to First Quality Tissue Midwest, LLC for installing rail infrastructure to help the company’s new plant in Defiance. 
A $1.2 million grant to rehab a bridge on Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway’s Rook Subdivision in Tuscarawas County.
A $174,000 grant to Wilmington Iron & Metal Company (Clinton County) to grow its on-site rail capacity. 
A $497,875 grant to RJ Corman Railroad Company to support a project rehab part of the St. Marys Subdivision in Mercer and Auglaize counties. 
A $150,000 grant to the Kraft Heinz facility in Fremont (Sandusky County). 

“These five projects represent a significant commitment to improved safety and economic development in the state,” Ohio Rail Development Commission Executive Director Matthew Dietrich said in a statement. “Together these projects demonstrate just how important rail is to Ohio’s economy.”
Passenger rail 
The first round of the Federal Railroad Administration’s Corridor ID Program was announced in late 2023 and 69 routes were selected, including four Ohio routes. The program involves intercity passenger rail planning. 
Ohio’s four routes are 3C&D (Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, Cleveland); Cleveland – Toledo – Dayton; Midwest Connect (Chicago – Ft. Wayne – Lima – Columbus – Pittsburgh); and Amtrak Cardinal enhancements.
The Ohio Rail Development Commission is sponsoring studies for the 3C+D Corridor and the Cleveland-Toledo-Detroit Corridor.
The initial 3C&D Corridor proposal includes three daily round trips; and it could add 1,100 jobs and add more than $100 million to Ohio’s economy, according to All Aboard Ohio, a nonprofit that advocates for public transportation and passenger rail.
Midwest Connect is sponsored by the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission. It envisions two to four daily round trips, according to the Ohio Rail Plan.
Amtrak’s Cardinal route connects New York to Chicago with stops along the way in Washington, D.C., Charlottesville, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. It currently runs three times a week, but it could possibly run everyday. 
Despite the efforts at the federal level, All Aboard Ohio was disappointed there was not more about passenger rail in the Ohio Rail Plan, said All Aboard Ohio Executive Director John Esterly. 
“Since these projects are so large scale, and since it’s something that has been very clearly demonstrated to be a priority for many Ohioans, it seemed like a bit of an oversight that there wasn’t more in there about passenger rail,” Esterly said. “It is almost exclusively a document describing freight rail and freight rail expansion in Ohio.”
There is a 13-page chapter in the Ohio Rail Plan on passenger rail. 
“I’ll be honest, it was a little puzzling to me because there’s an entire chapter,” Dietrich said. “It’s a very prescriptive format that we have to follow to be federally compliant.”
The Rail Commission submitted the first step for their two routes over the summer and the next step is when detailed planning and design happens. Amtrak also submitted the first step for the Cardinal route. 
“The next step in the process that we’re waiting for approval from the FRA is to develop those studies,” Dietrich said. “And those studies will develop something called the Service Development Plan, which will provide capital cause from ridership estimates, equipment needs (and) scheduling.”
Slightly more than three quarters (78.4%) of Ohioans say enhancing the rail network is important or very important, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation’s 2024 Transportation Preference Survey.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)This past weekend more than a hundred Ohioans demonstrated outside the Statehouse against a pair of bills that could effectively outlaw some immigrants from owning land in the state.
Ohio House Bill 1 and Ohio Senate Bill 88, prohibit citizens of countries designated “foreign adversaries” from owning land within 25 miles of “critical infrastructure.”
Although people from a variety of backgrounds spoke at the event, the effort is being led by people of Chinese descent. They note that the measure is meant to restrict their ability to own a home or a business.
Ying Wu described herself as a mother from Dublin, and “an Ohioan by choice.”
She explained that after her husband finished his medical training, they had several options on where they could live. They chose Ohio because they saw it as a good place to raise a family.
“This is not just where we live, it’s who we are,” she said. “But lately, this promise feels fragile.”
“Bills like HB 1 and SB 88 don’t see the life we built,” she went on. “They look at our family and see a label. They listen to our story, and they hear an accent. They send a message to us: You will always be other. You do not belong.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bills’ sponsors pitch their plan as a national security consideration, but critics like Wu say the proposals attempt to codify racism.
For instance, state law defines critical infrastructure so broadly — extending to power lines, telephone poles, and sewage pipes — that effectively the entire state would be off-limits.
Opponents see Ohio’s proposal, and similar efforts in states like Florida, as a return to the so-called alien land laws that sprung up in 1900s.
Those laws employed seemingly neutral language, applying to individuals “ineligible for citizenship,” to target Asian immigrants and bar them from purchasing land.
“While these laws did not explicitly target Asians, the purpose behind them was very clear,” explained Abby Chin, past president of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Central Ohio.
Chin and others say Ohio’s “foreign adversaries” provision is another broad framing calibrated to achieve targeted ends.
Although the restrictions would likely apply to citizens of Iran, North Korea, and Russia, the sponsors make no secret that their primary concern is immigrants from China.
“The People’s Republic of China, Communist China, has not hidden the fact that their goal is not just to compete and outperform the United States, it is to take over the world — they actually meant this,” the bill’s sponsor state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, claimed in a February committee hearing.
The Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment restricts the government from discriminating based on several protected classes, including national origin and alienage.
In February last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put Florida’s law barring foreign land ownership on hold.
In a concurrence, Judge Nancy Abudu specifically cited the Equal Protection Clause.
Rev. Dan Clark from the United Church of Granville called Ohio’s proposals “legalized xenophobia.”
“It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is unfaithful and it is immoral,” he said. “Our Constitution promises more than this. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process. The 14th guarantees equal protection. The Fair Housing Act outlaws discrimination based on national origin. HB 1 and SB 88 tramples all of these protections.”
In addition to their dubious legality, Chin said the measures are misguided.
Taking a broadbrush approach ignores nuance. Immigrants in Ohio could be refugees or dissidents from a designated country, for instance, he noted.
“These bills equate innocent individuals with the governments of countries that they come from,” she said. “In other words, it sets restrictions without any evidence that the individual has done anything wrong.”
Because Bowling Green State University Professor Louisa Ha is a citizen, the proposals won’t affect her ability to own land. But she’s still worried about how the bills target immigrant communities.
She’s specifically concerned that the Ohio Secretary of State would regularly update the list of foreign adversaries.
“Depending on politics, any other country can be added to that list,” she said, “so all immigrants are vulnerable.”
Far from making the state more safe, Ha said, laws that single out specific communities breed mistrust and hostility.
“As an immigrant, I don’t want to live in a community that sees immigrants as enemies,” Ha said. “I don’t want my children, who grew up and (were) born here and speak English as their first language, (to) be seen as perpetual foreigners in their own country.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohioans will need to bare it all in order to watch online pornography, now that the state’s age verification requirement went into effect on Tuesday.
With thousands of pages of policy reform, the state’s massive operating budget, which includes the porn changes, impacts everyone.
Immediate changes
You will need to submit your proof that you are an adult to watch internet pornography.
“We’re gonna preserve and protect the innocence of our kids here in the state of Ohio,” state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, said.
Age verification would be done by submitting a photo of your state ID or by entering your personal information into a third-party system that will then run your details through other online or government databases — it could also use facial recognition technology, capturing photos of users.
Companies would be penalized if they don’t comply.
The provision states that an establishment primarily centered on explicit content and generating a significant amount of revenue from such content must comply with this law.
However, others that host pornography may still be subject to the law.
News media organizations, as well as cable and streaming providers, have an explicit exemption.
Williams said that this won’t impact social media sites like X (formerly known as Twitter) and Reddit, even though both of those platforms contain easily-accessible pornography.
Clevelander Mallory McMaster fears that data could be leaked.
In 2024, hackers have stolen medical, financial, and legal data from at least hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at both the state and local levels. Many of the reported cyberattacks do not state how many consumers have been impacted.
“Creating a log of the pornography that we watch is not a direction that we want to go in as a country,” McMaster said.
It’s also likely that explicit video giant PornHub pulls out of providing content to Ohio. The company has removed some of its sites in states with age verification laws. As of publishing, they have pulled out of 17 states.
Another change taking effect Tuesday involves the driver’s license process.
Under state law prior to Sept. 30, 18-year-olds and older can simply apply for a license, bypassing the majority of training requirements, like classes. But soon, drivers under 21 will be required to complete the same training that minors do.
“Inexperience is really the number one killer,” Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday. “It’s the number one cause of crashes.”
The Ohio Chamber of Commerce’s Tony Long warns that this policy could impact the economy, as 18- to 20-year-olds could be bumped out of the job market.
“One of the hardest things for the workforce is finding adequate transportation, so this adds to that,” Long said.
Goes into law, but delayed results
Although it goes into law on Tuesday, you won’t see some budget provisions change for a few months, like with the state’s income tax.
The state is moving to a 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
This will be phased in over the next few years; however, those earning $100,000 or more will see the decreases reflected in their next filing period.
The bracket will go from 3.5% to 3.125% in 2026 and down to 2.75% in tax year 2027.
“We are making Ohio more competitive, more open for business,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, claimed.
This law also allowed the Cleveland Browns to receive $600 million in unclaimed funds for a new stadium in Brook Park.
Lawmakers also adjusted the state’s Art Modell law so that current Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam, prominent campaign donors, could move the team out of the city of Cleveland.
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship has been kept by the lawmakers, guaranteeing admission to a public university for each high school graduate in the top 10% of their graduating class. The students would also get $5,000 each year in financial aid.
However, new this year, the bill requires students to sign a “statement of commitment” to stay in Ohio for three years after graduation.
High-performing public schools will have the opportunity to gain some additional school funding. If a school earns a 4- or 5-star ranking on its report card, it becomes eligible for additional funding.
Won’t be going into effect
A provision that changed the makeup of the state teachers’ retirement system board did not go into effect on Tuesday.
Currently, a Columbus court has temporarily blocked lawmakers from removing the majority of educators from the board.
“Right now with the educators on board, I know that decisions are made because they’re really thinking about what’s gonna happen not only to the future of others, but to their own future,” retired teacher Mary Binegar said.
“When you take that factor out of those decisions and it’s made by people that have nothing to do with that system, then I think it’s a whole different perspective.”
A last-minute provision in the state budget changed the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected, after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for active educators, and only one retiree seat will be available.
Republican leaders note that additional blocked provisions could take effect soon, as lawmakers continue to debate overriding the governor’s vetoes on school-related property tax items.
“We shouldn’t be seeing these unanticipated, unexpected spikes in property taxes the way we are,” Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said. “We need to fix the system.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)“Don’t take Tylenol!” I overheard one of my nursing students say as I returned after a break to the class. This was after a physician had shared that one of his patients told him to learn more the risks of Tylenol.
Confusion about Tylenol, which is considered a Pregnancy Category B substance safe for use throughout pregnancy, has surged after President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested at a news conference that there might be a correlation between the medication and autism spectrum disorders. To date, no consistent association has been found.
A study on the subject comes from some of the country’s premier researchers, including Andrea Baccarelli from Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health. In this paper, a new method called Navigation Guide Methodology uses meta-analyses and other statistical analyses to scrutinize existing evidence. Their results suggest that pregnant women limit Tylenol use. Their method uses data to fast-track development of recommendations that help prevent harmful exposures of humans to environmental agents in the environment.
Establishing a causal association has been difficult in this situation. First, conducting randomized controlled studies — in which participants are randomly given a drug or not and variables in the environment are controlled — on pregnant women is not feasible and ethically abhorrent. Second, laboratory research on this topic is still scant and unclear. One theoretical study suggested that the NAPQ1-breakdown product of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) can cause in utero mitochondrial damage.
However, many of these newer studies exhibit the same limitations as earlier research. That is, reliance on maternal self-report; lack of detailed data on dosage, duration and timing of exposure; as well as failure to control for genetic and familiar confounders.
While existing studies suggest an association between heavy use of Tylenol and autism spectrum disorders, a causal relationship remains to be established. Tylenol use in mice has been shown to cause defects in cartilage development by negatively affecting genes that control limb development. Cartilage malformations have also been noted in zebrafish embryos exposed to Tylenol. Some researchers point to the presence of hypermobility and abnormal gait in people with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD as a corollary to Tylenol exposure in the womb.
Another animal study treated pregnant mice with 100 or 400 mg/kg a day in the second trimester, or 400 mg/kg a day in the second or third trimester and examined maternal fetal blood phenotypes, pregnancy results and organ development. It found that some lipids, enzymes and hormones were changed. Researchers also observed that Tylenol administration stunted the formation of connections in the developing hippocampus.
There was an observational follow-up study on 2.5 million children in Sweden born between 1995 and 2019. This study used sibling control analysis — looking at and controlling for factors such as genes and the environment shared between families — and found that previously reported associations were absent.
This indicates that any associations were likely the results of familial confounding: when families share genes and the environment. For instance, a mother’s genetic risks for ADHD could also predispose her to headaches and infections that might require Tylenol use. People would likely link the ADHD in the child to Tylenol, use even though it was the mother’s ADHD that led to her use of the drug.
What happens if you do not treat high fever during pregnancy? In fact, high fever during pregnancy, even hot temperatures from saunas and bathtubs, can cause severe damage to the developing fetus, including neural tube defects, craniofacial deformities and congenital heart defects.
Public health experts and medical bodies are resisting. The American Academy of Pediatrics denounced the announcement linking Tylenol with autism. FDA Commissioner Martin Makary downplayed the warnings from Human and Health Services in a letter to American physicians that encouraged minimization of use during low-grade fevers and stressed the lack of any causal relationship as well as the fact that Tylenol remained the safest painkiller during pregnancy.
However, a concerning development is the decision by the FDA to change labels on products that contain acetaminophen, which remains the only over-the-counter drug to treat fever during pregnancy.
Association does not mean causation. More research data will be needed before recommending that pregnant women avoid Tylenol to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders in the newborns.

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Five years ago, as I prepared to leave my Army uniform behind, I faced two life-defining decisions. First: where to raise my young family. My wife and I knew we wanted our girls to grow up where we had, surrounded by family and Nebraska’s “Good Life.”
The second proved harder: What career would let me serve? In energy work, something clicked. As a soldier who’d served in places where reliable power wasn’t guaranteed, I understood the fundamental link between energy and prosperity.
But Nebraska’s energy future faces a critical threat: Washington’s broken interconnection process. If we want to power our homes and family farms and next-generation AI data centers, we need to drag this decades-old system into the 21st century.
News focuses too much on the sources of our power — natural gas, nuclear and renewables like wind and solar — and not nearly enough on how those power sources actually connect to the grid to send power to the places where it’s needed.
That process is called interconnection. And, as you would expect from something dominated by nearly century-old federal rules and regulations, it’s slow, difficult and expensive — and in need of serious reform.
Consider that the average wait time for new generation projects to connect to the grid has grown from less than 2 years in 2008 to nearly 5 years for projects completed in 2023. As of late 2023, roughly 2.6 terawatts of proposed generation and storage — more than twice the entire current U.S. installed capacity — sits trapped in interconnection queues nationwide.
In our part of the country, the problem is acute. For projects submitted between 2018-2020 across the Southwest Power Pool, completion rates fell below 10 percent. In other words: More than 90 percent of proposed energy projects never come online, largely because of delays, compliance costs and regulatory uncertainty, according to the 2024 Advanced Energy Interconnection Scorecard.
This bottleneck threatens to become catastrophic as demand for electricity climbs faster than it has in decades. Data centers, AI, electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing are reshaping America’s grid.
Here in Nebraska, the Omaha Public Power District is planning for roughly 100 megawatts in additional demand each year — an enormous jump from the handful of megawatts we previously added annually.
When we can’t connect new, cheaper power sources quickly enough to meet growing demand, we’re forced to rely on more expensive alternatives, especially during peak times. That’s a key reason why Nebraska families have watched their utility bills tick upwards over the past few years.
While federal regulators have attempted some piecemeal reforms, the backlog remains massive, and the process still moves too slowly for the growth we expect.
Solutions aren’t complicated. First, FERC must ensure its new cluster-study deadlines are met and enforceable. Projects that meet technical requirements deserve timely decisions, not indefinite delays.
Second, American interconnection should transition to a “connect and manage” approach, similar to those used in Europe – where ready projects can connect to the grid while system upgrades proceed in parallel, with clear operating constraints to maintain reliability.
Third, Nebraska should lead a coalition of states to demand prioritization of shovel-ready projects. If a project has secured financing, ensured site control and received local support, it should move forward.
Nebraska enjoys abundant access to diverse energy resources. We have a skilled workforce, and we’re grateful to have something no other state can claim: A 100 percent public power system that puts ratepayers first instead of shareholders.
But those advantages mean nothing if federal red tape prevents us from connecting new power to the grid. It’s time to push back against broken processes and embrace a streamlined, practical approach that ensures lower rates and greater reliability.
My daughters, and every other member of Nebraska’s next generation, deserve nothing less.

DemasIn the thick of a government shutdown that lasted just one hour, the Michigan House and Senate passed a continuation budget to hold the state over for the next eight days – a move that was described as giving legislative staffers some cushion to finish drafting the final budget deal hammered out into the small hours of Wednesday morning.
The continuation budget is a modified version of the House’s government shutdown avoidance plan passed in March, offering to fund the state at just a fraction of the previous fiscal year’s spending. The hold over budget would fund the government over the next week at $1.56 billion with $272.3 million from the General Fund.
In many ways, the plan was designed by the Republican-controlled House for the very situation that the Legislature faced this week and for the few months that preceded it: A divided government unable to see eye-to-eye on key priorities; a House that took forever to pass its own budget; and a Senate that couldn’t get its road funding plan in order until just before the end of the fiscal year.

Although House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and his caucus said in March that the plan was simply a “break glass in case of emergency” tool, the Democrats in the House predicted that the plan signaled Republicans’ zeal to see the government shut down in some fashion.
But as the situation worsened over time, plenty of blame was to be shared among Republicans and Democrats when, on Tuesday afternoon, the respective chambers were still negotiating and working out the loose framework they agreed to last week.
An announcement from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Hall and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) later on Tuesday evening said a final budget had been agreed to and all that was needed was to draft the bills and put them up for a legal review.
That takes some time, and it was impossible to expect that to be completed by the end of the fiscal year at midnight on Tuesday.

Whitmer also made the rather bizarre proclamation that the government would not shut down, but offered no real details on how she would keep it open. There was much speculation around whether the governor would issue an executive directive to keep spending, but at what levels of the now-lapsed fiscal year was unclear.
Many surmised that the move would be unconstitutional seeing as how a provision in the state Constitution dictates that no government spending could commence without an appropriations bill in place for the next – or in this case, the new current – fiscal year.
Eventually, the fiscal year ended, and on Wednesday at 12:01 a.m., both chambers adjourned, resumed session and went back into caucus meetings as the government was, constitutionally speaking, shut down.
Soon afterward, it became apparent that there was no longer a need for any Whitmer executive spending action.
The Senate announced that it would discharge House Bill 4161, which was now properly labeled as a stopgap to avoid a prolonged government shut down, from the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Reconvening at 12:30 a.m., the upper chamber quickly entered recess before returning just before 1:30 a.m. to take up a substitute for the stopgap bill providing funding until Oct. 8.
After adopting the substitute, the Senate approved the measure 31-2.
Sens. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) and Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) voted against the bill, while Sens. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) and Michelle Hoitenga (R-Manton) did not vote at all. The chamber granted the bill immediate effect.
Following the vote, Brinks told reporters the measure would last for a week to give the Legislature time to finish writing the final budget bill. 
“We do have a budget agreement,” Brinks said. “We’ll get the bill written, and we will vote it out as soon as possible, after it’s ready.”
While Brinks said there was a strong framework in place last Thursday, there were a number of details that needed to come into place, and the bill simply wasn’t ready for a vote leading into the deadline.
“I certainly wish that we weren’t here at this moment tonight, but I think the important thing to remember is that we were able to come to an agreement, even in a time like this, with divided government,” Brinks said. “We will be keeping government services open. The people in Michigan can still get what they need from their government for the next week, despite this minor delay.”

The bill then moved to the House. 
After taking leave to caucus, Democrats and Republicans reentered the House chamber and passed the bill on a 103-4 vote. The only no votes came from Republican Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, Jim DeSana of Carleton, Tom Kunse of Clare and Jaime Greene of Richmond.
Democratic Reps. Peter Herzberg of Westland, Regina Weiss of Oak Park, and Karen Whitsett of Detroit did not cast votes for the bill.
Democratic Minority Leader Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said that it went without saying that the whole budget process this year was “highly unusual.”
“The House Democrats were excited to be able to play a role here to make sure that we’re getting this state one step closer to making sure our departments and our employees have some certainty in the process,” Puri said. “House Democrats are committed to showing up day in and day out, no matter how long this process is drawn out, and to making sure that we’re advocating for the values that our state needs.”

State Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said that those watching closely clearly saw that votes from House Democrats were needed to get the stopgap spending bill across the finish line and avoid a full government shutdown while the work continues.
“That’s been constant since last week heading into negotiations. Our votes and our caucus participation has been, I think, crucial to making sure we’re avoiding a full blown shutdown,” Farhat said. “And if you see what’s happening in D.C. right now, where they’re not even able to work together, I think in Michigan, we’re showing a new path forward and showing a way that we can come together on bipartisan common sense wins – whether that’s quality public schools, that’s long term road funding, and that’s making sure we’re funding our public safety.”
Republican Majority Floor Leader Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) said the base budget is done and agreed upon, and that they’re now in the processing phase. He expected the chamber to vote on the conference committee budget on Thursday.

The Senate is set to return from recess at 10 a.m., with the Senate Appropriations Committee meeting at noon to discuss a host of legislative spending requests – also known as earmarks or pork projects. The hearing is  required by new transparency rules put in place by the Senate earlier this week, mirroring those put in place by the House earlier this year.  
The House is slated to return at noon and has no plans to take any votes on the final budget, but may act on policy issues or other vehicle bills for the incoming final plan.

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/10/01/maryland-lawmakers-briefed-on-potential-effects-of-government-shutdown/,Maryland lawmakers were warned Tuesday of the potential of tens of millions in lost economic activity and revenue under the federal government shutdown that began at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.,"The U.S. Capitol building at night. (File photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Maryland lawmakers were warned Tuesday of the potential of tens of millions in lost economic activity and revenue under the federal government shutdown that began at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele, in a briefing before the Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee, estimated that the state could lose $700,000 per day — possibly more — in tax revenue in a shutdown.
More than that, Schaufele warned that a shutdown compounds the state’s current economic instability that stems from President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to shrink the number of federal employees, agencies and spending.
“I think what is missing in all of this analysis I’ve given you here is that this is one more level of instability on top of what our federal ecosystem is going through right now … and how that amplifies the downsides of what our families and businesses are going through is very uncertain,” Schaufele said.
None of the estimates take into account the potential for massive firings of federal employees during a shutdown that Trump has threatened. Also, the estimates do not include federal employees who opted to take a buyout earlier this year and leave their jobs this fall — so-called “fork in the road” employees.
Annual federal spending in Maryland exceeds $150 billion. It is an amount that includes wages, retirement payments, contracts, grants, and other direct payments. About 13% of all households in the state have at least one person who receives a paycheck or retirement income from the federal government.
Federal government shutdown begins, with no easy exit in sight

The last federal shutdown — which began at the end of 2018 and ended in 2019 — lasted more than a month. Nationally, the event curtailed an estimated $3 billion in economic activity, according to Schaufele, citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis.
Maryland would account for about 15% of that figure or roughly $13 million per day, he said. “if you make various assumptions about how that flows down into our revenue stream, that could be about $550,000 of lost revenue per day of government shutdown” last time, Schaufele said. Accounting for inflation since 2019, that would be about $700,000 today.
“It’s worth noting that that 34-day most-recent shutdown was not a complete shutdown, as this one would be,” Schaufele said.
But he told lawmakers “I think the risk is to the upside there that if anything, this one could be a bit more significant given what has taken place prior and the words that are coming out of the current administration.”
Even so, Schaufele said the lost revenue in 2019 was about 1% of what Maryland collected.
“So, while these things are intimidating and significant and they create uncertainty and distortions, the ending fiscal effect is not always as severe as the psychological effect, and I think the long-term economic effects,” he said.
“I think the irony of these federal government shutdowns is that they are likely to drive up federal costs over the long run,” Schaufele said. “The uncertainty is the worst aspect of this from a business point of view, from an employee point of view, uncertainty drives risk. Risk drives increased costs.”
The briefing to lawmakers Tuesday came less than 10 hours before the midnight deadline for a shutdown, when there was still a remote chance the Senate Republicans and Democrats might reach a deal to keep government open.

“I believe in miracles, and that miracles do happen, but if the government does shut down, please note this, today’s conversation won’t be the last,” Miller said at Tuesday’s hearing.
Matthew Verghese, the state’s federal lobbyist, painted a more pessimistic picture of the final hours.
“We are essentially in the twilight hour of funding of the federal government today and without action by the Senate – the U.S. House of Representatives is out of session today — we will shut down for the first time in seven years,” Verghese said. “We are heading towards a full federal government shutdown.”
Verghese added that “very large differences” between Republicans and Democrats “continue to exist and show us why we’re barreling towards a shutdown today.”
The House, with its Republican majority, passed a bill Sept. 19 that would fund the government through Nov. 21.
That plan stalled in the Senate. While Republicans hold the majority in the chamber, they need the votes of a small number of Democrats to reach a required 60-vote threshold needed to head off any filibusters.
Senate Democrats are holding out for their own version of a budget extension that restores health insurance subsidies that are part of the Affordable Care Act. The program was cut this summer as part of a tax cut package backed by President Donald Trump.
Senate President Bill Ferguson said if the program is not restored, Maryland residents could see insurance premiums jump by as much as 20%.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) called on Gov. Wes Moore (D) to encourage Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks to not use healthcare premiums as an excuse to force a shutdown.
“I mean, that’s a policy issue, and this committee, and as well as some other joint committees that we have here in Maryland are discussing Medicaid and the effects of that,” Hershey said. “But at the end of the day, this is a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open. Why are those issues being brought into this negotiation, rather than…the bipartisan support that’s needed and has been achieved every other time in order to keep the government open?”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland opened the door Tuesday to a program that could fast-track energy projects through the state’s regulatory process in hopes of boosting the amount of power generated in the state.
For the next 30 days, the Public Service Commission will accept applications for large-scale power projects or “dispatchable” generation, which can provide energy quickly during periods of peak demand.
Selected applicants will get an expedited PSC review that could lead to a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity — a green light for construction — in 295 days, or nine to 10 months.
Lawmakers, utilities and energy companies are expected to watch the 30-day application window closely, with Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) at an event last week calling it a litmus test for the future of energy generation in Maryland.
“That will be very indicative as to what the market may look like for domestic generation here in Maryland,” Ferguson said. “We will learn a lot from that open auction to see what merchant generators will put forward.”
But few, if any, said they are expecting major new projects to enter the fray, such as a gas-fired power plant, in part because the new law does little to change the challenging economic conditions for the industry.
“It doesn’t change the fundamental economics of building a power plant, right?” said Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp. “And those economics are probably not good in Maryland, because we’re not near big sources of gas, like in Pennsylvania.”

The expedited review is one part of the energy legislation, called the Next Generation Energy Act, developed by Democratic leadership and pushed through the General Assembly this year in response to high gas and electric bills, amid intense concern from consumers.
Leading lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) have said they believe that Maryland must generate more energy in-state in hopes of reducing consumers’ bills, as power demand is projected to soar in the 13-state electric grid that includes Maryland — chiefly because of artificial intelligence and data centers.
PSC Chairman Frederick H. Hoover said in a news release Tuesday that the fast-track procedure “provides a pathway to encourage new generation development and improve resource adequacy in Maryland without the State or ratepayers making a financial commitment.”
Moore said in June that he felt the Next Generation Energy Act “didn’t go far enough” to attract new power generation, calling on lawmakers to further incentivize nuclear power in particular. More recently, he has softened his tone.
“I do think the Next Generation [Act] that the General Assembly worked on and passed was an important piece of legislation,” Moore said. “And I do know that we are going to be working together, not just in this next upcoming session, but in this session going forward, to ensure greater relief for our ratepayers.”
Only certain types of power generators are eligible for the expedited review, under the Next Generation Energy Act.
One criterion is Effective Load Carrying Capacity, which measures a resource’s ability to contribute energy to the grid during peak demand periods. Projects seeking fast-track approval must have an ELCC rating at or above 65%, according to the most recent ratings developed by PJM Interconnection, the power grid operator for Maryland and 12 other states. And they also must have greenhouse gas emissions lower than coal or oil.
That list includes nuclear, various types of natural gas-fired power plants, offshore wind, steam and certain types of battery energy storage. The list excludes solar and onshore wind, among other power projects.
But all large-capacity projects — at least 20 megawatts — are eligible, so long as they have also applied to connect to the PJM grid.
Lapp, who represents utility ratepayers, has expressed skepticism that more in-state generation is needed, adding that planned transmission upgrades will ease some of the burden. He argues that most of the projected demand increase from data centers comes from outside Maryland, calling into question the need to impact Marylanders with power plant development.

Eligible projects currently in PJM’s queue include a large amount of solar projects coupled with battery storage, in addition to a gas plant upgrade, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, a coalition of utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage developers in the mid-Atlantic.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if there isn’t a lot of response to this procurement, because we know which projects would be reasonably positioned to respond to it, and I can say on behalf of my members that, generally speaking, the CPCN process has been relatively time-efficient,” Vaughan said. “Utility-scale solar developers are not seeing the CPCN process as the primary barrier to deployment in Maryland.”
Vaughan said some of his members may prefer to apply to a separate solicitation created by the General Assembly, for front-of-the-meter transmission energy storage devices, to be issued by January 2026.
And since state lawmakers gave final approval to the energy package in April, Ferguson noted, the market for renewable energy generators has changed, with passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminated substantial Biden-era tax credits for clean-energy projects.
“The evisceration of credits for renewable energy projects has changed the landscape dramatically,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson said that large renewable energy projects are in a “near-halt” position because of the new law, which may force the General Assembly to adjust its strategy.
“That’s something we’re going to have to take into consideration as we approach next session,” Ferguson said. “Now we’re working in a different financial landscape, where half of the energy projects that are the cheapest to build have been taken off the table.”
There could be a short-term increase in the pace of development, Vaughan said, as companies race to begin construction before July 4, 2026, when the tax credits lapse. It’s possible that some developers could try to use the fast-track before the PSC to try and meet that deadline, he said.
“This accelerated CPCN fast-track really could provide a make or break opportunity for those projects to get their CPCN if they feel that they’re at risk,” Vaughan said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Two state education boards approved additional metrics Tuesday to improve student achievement, including measures to shrink the achievement gap between student groups, but they didn’t set a timeline for meeting that goal.
It was the second meeting this year between the Maryland State Board of Education and the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Accountability and Implementation Board. More than a year ago, the two boards approved “ambitious” goals on student achievement, attracting and retaining a diverse teacher corps and reducing chronic absenteeism.
The measures approved Tuesday deal with student groupings such as race and ethnicity, disability and language. Although results this spring from the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program test showed modest gains overall in language arts and math, achievement gaps between various student groups was substantial.
About 75% of Asian students and 68% of white students were proficient in language arts, for example, but only 39% of Black students and 34% of Latino students reached proficiency. Percentages were lower for students with disabilities (15%) and multilingual learners (11%). About 34.5% of “economically disadvantaged” students were proficient in language arts.
Minor gains made in Maryland test scores, but wide demographic gaps remain

Math proficiency scores were even lower for those students:

Blacks: 14%
Latinos: 13.8%
Economically disadvantaged:13.1%
Students with disabilities: 7.6%
Multilingual learners: 7.2%

State Superintendent Carey Wright said it will take more work than just looking at an entire subgroup of students to make gains.
“When you get your data back in, you look to see who’s doing well, who’s not,” Wright said to reporters after the meeting’s morning session. “We continue to do that work with the schools, but I think that you can’t just look at a whole subgroup and assume that one intervention is going to be the same for all kids in a subgroup. You better really look at each individual student.”
One way to help those students is through implementation of a goal approved last year to cut chronic absenteeism by half, from 30% reported in 2022-23 school year to 15% during this school year. Any student who misses 10% of school days is considered chronically absent; the current chronic absenteeism is 25%.
“If the kids are not in school, it is difficult to ensure that they get the kind of instruction that they need. So we are looking at those things comprehensively,” Blueprint board chair Isiah “Ike” Leggett told reporters.
The state formed an attendance task force and is partnering with a nonprofit called Attendance Works to come with up solutions, such as having all 24 school districts have a group “responsible for implementing the systemwide attendance strategy and supporting school attendance teams.”
No specific goal was set on how much of an improvement the state is looking to see in those student groups.
At least two goals established Tuesday are to increase kindergarten readiness rates for each student group and decrease achievement gaps among those students, with some data anticipated by December.
Geoff Sanderson, deputy state superintendent of accountability for the State Department of Education, said a data dashboard will be presented to state board of education next month.

Several education advocates, who support the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan and serve as members of the Blueprint Coalition, said more work must be done to improve student achievement.
sharlimar douglass, lead advocate and education policy analyst for the Maryland Alliance for Racial Equity, said Blueprint implementation should focus on racial equity.
“This means prioritizing investments in high-quality instruction, early literacy supports, rigorous and relevant math curricula and culturally affirming learning and guidance,” she said during public comment to both boards. “If we are not centering children’s humanity through love, there is no strategy, no professional book, or instructional method in the world that can prepare the teacher to elevate the child.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Joshua-Michael-Ike-Leggett-and-Brit-Kirwan-9-30-2025-1024x623.jpg,,,2025-10-01 01:57:56.669400

How many people know that during World War II the U.S. government funded childcare and school meals for hundreds of thousands of children. During the war millions of women were called from their homes to work in factories and production lines.  Women could not perform these essential jobs without childcare. Children’s care and nutrition was rightly seen as essential. In response, a nationwide network of childcare centers was established.

Credit: Carol Williams
In 1943, my mother was asked to set up and manage the childcare network for Evansville, Indiana. She insisted that every child receive a hot school meal. The result: in Evansville and across the United States was the most comprehensive childcare system ever created in this country. It is estimated that at its peak, 3,000 centers across 49 states served up to 600,000 children ages 2–12. Open year-round, often 12 hours a day to coordinate with factory shifts, these centers offered meals, education, recreation, and health care —a true whole-child approach. After the war, returning men reclaimed factory jobs, and women were pressured to leave the workforce. By 1946, funding was eliminated and the system collapsed.
Fast forward to 2025: more women than ever are working, often out of necessity in the face of skyrocketing living costs. Connecticut has taken a bold step with the Early Childhood Education Endowment, aiming to build a comprehensive childcare system for pre-K to six that includes school meals but there is still no plan to provide free school meals for all children.
Universal, nutritious school meals are not a luxury. They improve student health, reduce the risk of chronic illnesses like obesity and diabetes, boost learning and academic achievement, reduce stigma for children, and mitigate the stress of food insecurity for families.
Meanwhile, federal support that helps feed needy children is under threat. Food banks have already experienced deep cuts. Covenant Soup Kitchen in Willimantic is receiving 400 pounds a day less food due to these cuts. It is likely in the near future that there will be cuts to SNAP and reductions in school meal subsidies that will leave thousands of children hungry. Connecticut cannot wait.
Our governor and legislative leaders must act now, in the upcoming special session, to ensure free school meals for all children.  We succeeded during World War II. Surely, in one of the richest states in the nation, amid record-high food prices, we can provide healthy breakfasts, lunches, and snacks for every child.

Laws can take effect immediately upon being signed, on July 1 with the start of the state’s fiscal year, on Oct. 1, or even on Jan. 1.
Many of the laws that take effect today change the state’s criminal or civil statutes.
Here are some of the more interesting statutory changes the Legislature passed in the spring and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law that take effect today.
 SB 150 Trooper’s Law

The story of how Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Orlando Morales found an abandoned dog along Interstate 75 as Hurricane Milton advanced tugged at heartstrings and made headlines. The Leon County Humane Society, where the rescued dog was transferred, named the bull terrier “Trooper” to honor  Morales, who found the dog after responding to a report of an animal in distress. 
“It took several loops, but I thank God that He gave me the right time and right place of where to be, and after the second or third loop, I was able to find a dog clearly in water, in distress,” Morales said. “And it was a horrific moment to be in.”

Trooper’s owner, Giovanny Aldama Garcia, 23, was arrested on Oct. 14 2024.
Sen. Don Gaetz, a former Senate president, moved quickly to file the legislation (SB 150) that makes it a third-degree felony to restrain and abandon an animal during a natural disaster.
 SB 168 the “Tristin Murphy Act”

Among other things, this new law requires the state’s Northwest Regional Data Center to develop a behavioral health care data repository to create, collect, and analyze existing statewide data related to behavioral health care in the state. The results are intended to clarify the scope of and trends in behavioral health services, spending, and outcomes. plus the relationship between behavioral health, criminal justice, and incarceration.
The center is required to collaborate with the state Commission on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder to develop and submit to legislative leaders by Dec. 1 a data collection and analysis implementation plan and proposed budget for the work. The center is required — beginning  Dec. 1, 2026 — to annually submit a report to the governor and legislative leaders on the trends it finds.
 HB 253 No flippers in Florida

Florida has joined the likes of Texas, Washington, and Tennessee in making it illegal to sell or manufacture license plate flippers, devices that allow drivers to obscure or conceal their license plates at the press of a button. While they were traditionally used at auto shows, allowing cars to switch between custom and decorative plates, the flippers can also be used to hide license plates from law enforcement, toll systems, or automated speed cameras.
Possessing a license plate flipper is a second-degree misdemeanor under the new law while selling or manufacturing a flipper is a first-degree misdemeanor.

 HB 437 Electronic monitoring

Rep. Dan Daley’s legislation increases the criminal penalties for tampering with electronic monitoring devices and mandates termination of pretrial release for anyone who interferes with their electronic monitoring device.
Daley, a Democrat from Coral Springs, is an assistant state attorney in Broward County. On the House website, Daley says he filed the legislation to “enhance the integrity of our criminal justice system.” 
“By removing these devices, offenders could disappear and potentially commit more crimes while avoiding accountability,” Daley’s statement says.
The new law also alters the penalties a court can impose upon adults for intentionally removing, destroying, or tampering with an electronic monitor, tying the level of the new offense to the severity of the underlying crime.
 HB 693 Capital felonies and the death sentence

Beginning today, juries can take into consideration whether a crime victim was gathered with one or more persons for a school activity, religious activity, or public government meeting as an aggravating factor in determining whether a defendant who has been convicted of a capital felony is eligible to receive a death sentence.
The list of aggravating factors before the changes in the new law required the jury to make one or more of eight findings, stemming from the capital felony being committed by a convicted felon, to the defendant knowingly creating a great risk of death to many people, to a capital felony being committed for pecuniary gain.
 HB 757 Lewd lascivious images/child porography

Possession of a lewd or lascivious image with intent to promote the image now is a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison, 15 years of probation, and a $10,000 fine. 
Possession of a lewd or lascivious image without the intent to promote it is now a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
The new law makes it a third-degree felony to solicit child pornography. It adds to the list of third-degree felonies willfully generating an altered sexual depiction, soliciting an altered sexual depiction, and possessing any altered sexual depiction with the intent to maliciously promote without the consent of the identifiable person.
The identifiable persons who didn’t consent to their image being promoted can now sue for damages up to $10,000 or actual damages incurred, as well as reasonable attorney fees and costs.
 SB 948 Rental rights

Landlords are now required to give tenants and prospective tenants information regarding flood risks and past flooding of their rental properties. Tenants who do not receive the mandated disclosures who suffer substantial damages due to flooding can terminate their leases and are entitled to a refund of their deposits under the new law.
 HB 1121 Drones and contraband

Taking a page out of Georgia’s experience with a drone-based contraband operation at prisons, the Florida Legislature passed a bill this spring that increases penalties for a person who operates a drone over or near a critical infrastructure facility or operates or possesses a drone with an attached weapon or firearm.
Specifically, the new law increases the penalty from a second-degree misdemeanor to a third-degree felony if the drone is operated over a critical infrastructure facility, including detention centers, unless the operation is authorized in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.
Bill sponsor Rep. Jennifer Canady says on the House website that Georgia arrested 150 people in the Operation Skyhawk sting, which focused an alleged drone-based contraband operation in Georgia prisons.
“Every type of contraband, from cellphones and drones to drugs and weapons, were confiscated. Florida needs to be forward-thinking in the oversight of technology that can be used for harm.”
The new law prohibits a person from possessing or operating a drone carrying a weapon of mass destruction or a hoax weapon of mass destruction. A violation is punishable as a first-degree felony. 
“By enacting these changes, Florida will take a proactive stance in curbing the misuse of unmanned aircraft systems, helping to safeguard critical infrastructure, improve prison security, and protect the public from potential domestic threats,” Canady’s statement says.
 HB 1351 Sexual predators, offenders, and reporting requirements

Sexual predators and offenders now have to report where they work and their work phone numbers under a new law that takes effect today. The law requires local law enforcement officers to verify a sexual predator’s address four times a year and once per year for sexual offenders. 
There is no definition in statute of sexual offenders but there are legislative findings that describe repeat sexual offenders and sexual offenders as people who prey on children and who present an extreme threat to the public safety.
 “Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant,” the statutes say.

 SB 1386 Protecting power workers

Florida residents know hurricanes can bring power outages and that can make folks overheated and angry. To protect line workers and others from irate residents, regardless of whether it’s hurricane season, the Legislature passed SB 136. The law reclassifies criminal charges for knowingly committing an assault or battery against a utility worker while he or she is engaging in work. 
The staff analysis of the new law notes there “have been several reported instances of assault or battery against a utility officer in Florida over the past few years.”  They include a Hillsborough County resident who in a fit of anger “backed his vehicle into the utility pole and then threatened to shoot the utility workers who attempted to prevent him from fleeing the scene. Another instance took place in February 2025 involving a woman from Polk County who released her dogs on two utility workers who were investigating possible utility theft.”

Newsroom employees at the News and the Peninsula Clarion submitted their resignations on Monday, Sept. 29, 2025, to protest the actions of the newspaper's ownership. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Reporters and editors at the Homer News and Peninsula Clarion announced their resignations on Monday, citing a decision by the papers’ corporate owners to bow to political pressure to amend an article about a vigil for the slain far-right activist Charlie Kirk.
The resignations, which include two editors and two reporters based in Homer and Kenai, were scheduled to take effect in two weeks, but managers at Carpenter Media Group fired all four immediately. 
Carpenter Media Group, an international chain, owns the News, Clarion and the Juneau Empire, as well as the Yukon News and hundreds of other newspapers in the Lower 48 and Canada.
The resignations follow a similar mass resignation at the Juneau Empire earlier this summer. 
When combined, both actions leave Carpenter Media Group with a single in-state Alaska reporter among its three newspapers.
Mary Kemmis, senior vice president of Carpenter’s publications in Alaska and Canada, did not return phone calls seeking comment on Tuesday, nor did Chloe Pleznac, the reporter who authored the original article.
Jake Dye, a former reporter for the Peninsula Clarion and one of the people who resigned this week, said by phone that Carpenter’s handling of the story was “problematic in a lot of ways.”
Charlie Kirk, a far-right commentator, free speech activist and Christian nationalist who was an ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed on Sept. 10 at an appearance in Utah. One person has been arrested and charged with his killing and is awaiting trial.
Since his killing, conservatives, including many Republicans, have held rallies to memorialize Kirk.
After a vigil in Homer, Pleznac published an article describing Kirk as a “far-right political activist and Christian-Nationalist icon,” and went on to describe his “often racist and controversial views” before going on to detail the vigil.
Soon after the article was published, Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, published a letter on official state legislative letterhead that criticized the characterization of Kirk and the Homer News coverage and said in part, “If the paper continues to treat community events as opportunities for partisan spin, the consequence will be financial as well as reputational.”
After the letter, which was reprinted on her legislative Facebook page, Carpenter officials rewrote the article without consulting editors or reporters at the Homer News, according to the resigning staff, according to the staff who resigned.
Afterward, Vance thanked the newspaper’s owners for the change.
Vance did not answer a phone call and text message Tuesday asking about the incident.
In their resignation letter, Carpenter’s Alaska reporters and editors said they don’t have an issue with Vance’s perspective but “what we do have a problem with is Carpenter Media management changing a story at the behest of an elected official. We believe this destroys the credibility the public has placed in us as reporters and editors.”
The worry, the resigning staff said, is that having once caved to political pressure, Carpenter Media will invite further attempts to steer news coverage by political officials and people who are part of the story.
“We cannot do our jobs knowing that pressure from an elected official can mean our stories are edited without prior consultation with us,” the resignation letter says.
Vance’s letter to Carpenter Media comes amid nationwide pressure by Republican and conservative officials to clamp down on language deemed critical of Kirk. Some states have launched investigations of university officials and other public employees for comments made on social media.
The three publications were owned by Georgia-based Morris Communications until 2017, when they were purchased by New Jersey-based GateHouse Media. Later that year, they were sold again to Washington-based Sound Publishing, a division of Canada-based Black Press.
Carpenter Media Group bought Black Press in 2024.
In Juneau, the entire reporting staff of the Juneau Empire — including seasonal interns — resigned simultaneously amid complaints about low pay, benefits and a lack of institutional support. 
The former editor of that newspaper has since gone on to help start an independent, nonprofit newsroom for capital-city news.
Dye, by phone on Tuesday, said he’s not sure what’s next for either himself or the Peninsula Clarion. Journalism in Alaska as a whole is in a dim spot amid budget cuts to public media, he said, but he’s trying to stay optimistic.
“There’s not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel, but I guess I truly believe that somehow, things are going to work out for the state and for us,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15-Homer-News-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-30 23:57:33.773472

(Photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Holly Hugunin/U.S. Coast Guard)After months of uncertainty amid the Trump administration’s deep cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the council that manages commercial fisheries in federal waters off Alaska now has all the federal funding that had been allocated to it for 2025 operations.
But the North Pacific Fishery Management Council now faces a new source of uncertainty: the federal government shutdown.
The funding and shutdown complications have reshaped the council’s October meeting, underway this week.
The meeting is being held entirely online, based on a decision made in June when officials were unsure if they could pay for an in-person event in Anchorage, the usual meeting site.. At the time, the council had received less than half of its grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for 2025 operations.
Later in the summer, the council got assurances that it had its full operational grant, said executive director Dave Witherell.
“The good news is that in July, we received an additional allotment of grant funding, and in August, we received the remainder of the 2025 grant funding,” Witherell said by email.
The news about funding came too late for the council to change its plans and switch to an in-person event.
The meeting agenda, meanwhile, has been hastily revised because of the likely absences later in the week of many federal scientists who normally present to and advise the council.
Ian Stewart, co-chair of the council’s Scientific and Statistical Committee, advised his colleagues of the late agenda switches as the shutdown loomed.
“We have got some fairly major schedule changes today in order to make the best use of our time with the federal employees while they’re with us,” Stewart said on Tuesday, the second day of that committee’s meeting.
North Pacific Fishery Management Council meetings start with meetings of the organization’s Scientific and Statistical Committee and Advisory Panel. The full council starts its proceedings a few days later, using advice from the affiliated committees. This week, the full council is scheduled to start its meeting on Thursday.
The impacts of both the budget uncertainties and the shutdown create a less-than-ideal situation, officials said.

	Witherell said in-person meetings are “highly preferable” for the council because they allow for conversations and information exchanges between advisers, scientists, council members, council staff and the public, he said.
The public can still tune in to the online meeting and give oral testimony, though the deadline for written comments has passed.
“In-person meetings also build trust and relationships as people get to speak to each other during breaks and before and after the meetings,” he said by email. “One could make the case that more informed decisions lead to better outcomes.”
The shutdown challenges now threaten to force postponement of some of the work the council had expected to do at the current meeting, Witherell said.
Among the items on the agenda at this meeting are decisions about Bering Sea snow crab and red king crab management. Those are high-profile issues because key harvests have only recently resumed after being shut down for consecutive seasons because of stock crashes.
Also on the agenda, and due for a final council vote, are adjustments to rules for what is called the “maximum retainable amount,” a metric used for the incidental catch of untargeted species by commercial fishing vessels. The changes being contemplated could apply to all commercial vessel types operating in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska.
Wetherell said the proceedings are being adjusted to account for the possibility that federal scientists might not be able to participate.
If scientists from NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service are not available to answer questions, the council’s members will have to decide whether they have enough information to proceed with action, Wetherall said.
One agenda item that will be dropped if there is a shutdown is discussion of what is known as Essential Fish Habitat, or EFH, Wetherell said. Identification of Essential Fish Habitat informs fishery plans.
A federal government shutdown threatens to limit the availability of fish stock information used to guide harvest management, the executive director of NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center said Tuesday.
Bob Foy, who heads the center, said there is a contingency plan in place for a federal government shutdown.
If the shutdown lasts for fewer than five days, “then we would plan for all the assessments to be completed as scheduled for the current year,” he told the Scientific and Statistical Committee.
But impacts of a long shutdown could be serious, Foy said.
“If we go greater than 15 business days, that’s going to dramatically impact our ability to produce our stock assessments in time for our internal and your review deadlines. We would not likely meet any of those deadlines,” he said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A woman sentenced to life in a Georgia state prison has been convicted of manufacturing and sending bombs to federal courthouses in Anchorage and Washington, D.C. while incarcerated.
No one was injured by the incendiary devices, which were detected and defused. 
Lena Summerlin, who is transgender and is identified in court records by her birth name, David Cassady, pleaded guilty to two federal felonies and was sentenced last week to two concurrent 40-year terms in federal prison. She is already serving a life sentence in state prison for a variety of crimes.
Three other charges were dismissed as part of a plea deal signed in March.
Summerlin’s sentence, announced last week by prosecutors in South Carolina, was covered by Court Watch, a national newsletter covering events in federal courthouses across the country.
According to court documents, in January 2020, Summerlin sent two crude devices consisting of batteries and alcohol-based hand sanitizer to the U.S. Justice Department in Washington, D.C. and the federal courthouse in Anchorage.
“My plan, under no circumstances, was to impose harm on anyone,” Summerlin said in a sentencing document. “It was simply to obtrude awareness of the downtrodden, murderous conditions at Georgia State Prison.”
Summerlin has repeatedly alleged that conditions in Georgia prisons are violent and did not provide adequate protections for LGBTQ individuals. In 2018, she won a financial settlement after physical and sexual assault by other inmates and a prison guard.
As part of her plea deal, she requested that she serve her sentence in a federal prison, where she believes conditions are better for transgender inmates.
Sentencing documents were unclear as to why Summerlin chose to send a bomb to Anchorage, and federal officials familiar with the case did not answer questions about the incident.
According to court documents, the device Summerlin sent to Anchorage was opened by a clerk who triggered a panic alarm when she noticed wires in the package.
U.S. Marshals evacuated the courthouse, contacted bomb technicians and authorities.
Summerlin manufactured three other similar devices that were not sent through the mail. When the devices sent to Anchorage and Washington, D.C. were not immediately discovered, she announced her plans to prison officials in Georgia. 
It was not clear why federal prosecutors waited four years after the 2020 incident to charge Summerlin with a crime. The case was filed in Georgia’s southern U.S. District Court but prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in South Carolina.
In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors wrote that regardless of Summerlin’s reasons for sending the devices, they “cannot mitigate or alleviate the seriousness of this case. The Defendant put innocent people in harms way who had no contribution to any alleged mistreatment in prison.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC08582-straightened-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 21:56:54.570728

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said her constituents are “standing on a health insurance cliff right now” and she will not support a Republican funding proposal until GOP lawmakers agree to extend the health insurance subsidies.

Annual insurance premiums could double on average in 2026 if the subsidies expire at year’s end, according to an analysis published Tuesday by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF.The enhanced premium tax credits were extended through 2025 under the Democrat-led budget reconciliation law in 2022, otherwise known as the Inflation Reduction Act.

They asked Chief Judge Timothy Brooks of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against six of the laws they are challenging while the lawsuit is ongoing.

Canvassers must now inform signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense, request a photo ID from potential signers, and ensure the potential signer reads the petition’s ballot title or has it read to them, with failure to do so resulting in a misdemeanor charge. Another 2025 law prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. 
Another recent law the plaintiffs are seeking to halt requires ballot question committees to submit all the names and addresses of canvassers to the Attorney General’s Office in advance of certification, a provision the plaintiffs’ attorneys argue would essentially make public sensitive private information that bad actors could take advantage of, as the records are subject to public disclosure under the state’s Freedom of Information Act. The law also gives the attorney general discretion to toss out signatures if canvassers did not disclose their names and addresses prior to submitting the petitions.
A 2023 law also being challenged by the plaintiffs in Pulaski County Circuit Court forces canvassers to collect signatures from voters in 50 counties, as opposed to the previous 15-county requirement.
Brooks did not indicate which way he intended to rule, but emphasized it will take time to come to a conclusion after nearly four hours of debate, in addition to hundreds of pages of court documents and affidavits he accepted into the record on Tuesday. 
“There’s a lot for the court to consider,” Brooks said. “But we will issue a written judgement as soon as we can.” 
In comments immediately following the hearing, Miller told the Arkansas Advocate she was “feeling good” about the afternoon’s proceedings. 
“This has been something that we’ve been working on for a really long time, so it was wonderful to be in court today,” Miller said. “We’re hopeful that we can get some relief because we’re out collecting signatures right now.”
David Couch, attorney for the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, also took a positive view.  
“I feel just as good coming out as I went in,” Couch said immediately after. “I think these laws are unconstitutional. I think we clearly showed that to the judge today.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders Tuesday for setting a special election to fill her father’s seat for next June, leaving his district without representation during the 2026 fiscal session.
Speaking at a press conference at the state Capitol called by Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, Amber Sullivan said her efforts to get answers about the timing of the special election have gone nowhere. She urged Arkansans to contact Sanders’ office and state legislators.
Stubblefield died Sept. 2. Sanders declared the seat vacant on Sept. 15.
“My father represented his people. He loved his state, loved his country and he loved Franklin County,” Sullivan said. “His seat should not go unrepresented for eight months, nine months — it shouldn’t go five months unrepresented.”
After resistance, Sanders revises election date to fill vacant Arkansas Senate seat

Arkansas law requires governors to call a special election to fill a vacant legislative seat within 150 days, unless they find it impractical or too burdensome to do so. Jan. 30 would be 150 days from Stubblefield’s death; Feb. 12 would be 150 days from Sanders’ declaration of a vacancy.
Last week Sanders said she set the special election dates to coincide with next year’s midterm elections “to save taxpayer money,” streamline the election process and maximize voter turnout. She later revised the schedule after bipartisan outcry, but the general election will still fall after the conclusion of the 2026 fiscal session.
The special primary currently coincides with the midterm primaries on March 31, 2025. The special general election will be June 9. The Legislature’s fiscal session starts in April and ends May.
Sullivan said the need for a more immediate election is about more than having a voice on the controversial Franklin County prison project, which her father and many in Senate District 26 strongly oppose. The voters in District 26 “deserve a voice” in legislative debates on matters such as health insurance and education that will come up between now and next June. She called on Sanders to move the election up.
King excoriated the scheduling move by Sanders, comparing her revised decision to hold the special general election next June to voter fraud. He said the governor was intentionally trying to deprive District 26 of a legislative voice. One vote in the Senate, he said, “can impact millions of dollars.”
“This governor believes that [District 26] should not have representation during one of these crucial times,” said King, who has been, like Stubblefield, a vocal opponent of the prison site chosen by Sanders’ administration. “These people in Franklin County, who are going to be the most possibly impacted for decades, are not going to have a voice down here.”
Feds considering immigration detention facility at Franklin County prison site

Sanders spokesperson Sam Dubke on Tuesday repeated Sanders’ assertion that the election-date decision was meant to save the state money.
“Following conversations with election officials, the Governor decided that holding the primary for District 26 on the statewide primary date and holding the special election on the soonest possible primary date afterward saves taxpayer dollars and ensures the election is free, fair, and secure,” Dubke wrote in a text message.
The cost of holding an election entirely separate from the regular dates ranged from $41,000 to $55,000, depending on if poll workers were hired, according to a spokesperson from Secretary of State Cole Jester’s office. Under the current schedule, that means the state stands to save $20,500.
King invoked former President Theodore Roosevelt and said the idea that an election could not be held sooner was “bullfeathers.” He pointed to the 2021 special election to replace former Republican Sen. Lance Eads in District 7. Eads resigned at the end of October 2021. His replacement was elected at the beginning of February 2022.
“You’re basically allowing stolen representation,” King said.
Samantha Boyd, Jester’s spokesperson, said state and federal law contained “minimum timeline standards” for overseas voters and members of the military that made June the earliest possible date for the general election with a March primary. She also said under current law, absentee ballots must be prepared by a county election board at least 47 days in advance of a primary or general election.
Appropriations bills, including $750 million in funding for the Franklin County prison’s construction, require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, or 27 votes.

During the closure, police searched the Elvey Building and surrounding areas.
Just before 10:40 a.m., the university police department issued an “all-clear” message saying that they found no explosive device. The campus reopened, classes resumed, and employees returned to their offices.
Police say the threat remains under investigation.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday he is hopeful the Trump administration will come up with a plan to “improve morale among farmers” in response to the apparent loss of the Chinese soybean export market. 
China is historically the largest foreign buyer of U.S. soybeans, but after leveraging retaliatory tariffs in response to those imposed by President Donald Trump, the country has turned elsewhere for its soybean shipments this year. 
According to reporting from Reuters, China bought roughly 1.3 million tons of soybeans from Argentina. The same week, the Trump administration announced a $20 billion bailout deal with Argentina. 
Grassley, during a call with reporters Tuesday, reiterated his previously expressed “resentment” at the Argentinian bail-out that coincided with the country lowering its export taxes and China swooping into make a deal.
“You can’t blame China for jumping in to save their own money and get their own products cheaper,” Grassley said. 
The Iowa Republican said he has been in conversation with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins about the situation and said she is working on a solution to help farmers “without getting money from Congress.” 
Grassley said Rollins and the president have mentioned using money from U.S. imposed tariffs to support U.S. soybean farmers, but he said “nothing’s put together yet.” 
Grassley said the challenges associated with the loss of market for soybean farmers are “reminiscent” of farmer struggles during the farm crisis of the 1980s. 
Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in an article published by the association that the federal government’s “lifeline to Argentina” was “poorly timed and inexcusable.” 
“This is especially true considering the much-publicized financial pain U.S. ag has been experiencing due to an ongoing trade war with our country’s most reliable and significant purchasers of soybeans,” Adam said in the article. “With harvest underway in Iowa and throughout key soybean growing regions around the country, now is the time for making U.S. soybean sales, not empowering our competitors.” 
Iowa Soybean Association’s senior director of market development, Grant Kimberly, said the amount of beans China will be able to purchase from Argentina could be enough to “sustain its needs for soy” until Brazil harvests its soybean crop in January.
China first turned to Brazil for soybeans during the trade wars of Trump’s first term in office. The trade war in 2018 caused serious market loss for U.S. farmers and resulted in more than $23 billion paid to farmers, from the federal government, for relief. 
Grassley said the best thing the president can do for U.S. farmers is to reach a settlement “very quickly” with China.
“I want the bottom line to be that farmers don’t want to get money from the federal treasury, they want to get it from the market,” Grassley said. 
Grassley criticizes Dems as shutdown appears imminent
Congressional Democrats are standing firm on a series of demands, that Republicans disagree with, on the stopgap spending bill that would prevent a government shutdown. 
Grassley said instead of passing the “clean” funding bill Republicans proposed that is “nearly identical” to one that passed six months ago, Democrats are instead appeasing “the radical activists in their base.” 
Midnight federal shutdown edges closer as US Senate fails to agree on spending bills

“Democrats voted 13 times for a clean, short term funding bill under President Biden,” Grassley said. “The only difference I see now is Democrats see a Republican in the White House.”
If the Senate does not pass a bill by midnight on Tuesday, the government will shut down and hundreds of thousands of government employees will be furloughed.  
Grassley said the holdup is that Democrats want to attach a “massive partisan spending bill” that will cost taxpayers “more than $1 trillion.” 
According to reporting from States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau, Democrats’ bill accounts for rising health care costs they assert have occurred from the Republican sponsored tax and spending cuts law referred to as the “one big beautiful bill.” 
“You’ve heard me say before, government is a service to the people,” Grassley said. “How can you serve the people if government is shut down? It costs money to shut government down, it costs money to open the government back up again. I hope my Democrat colleagues will drop their partisan proposal and work with Republicans to keep government open.”

Catherine Cortez Masto was one of only two Democrats voting with Republicans against a government shutdown Tuesday.
Cortez Masto was also one of ten Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans in March to avert a shutdown.   
“This administration doesn’t care about Nevadans, but I do. That’s why I cannot support a costly shutdown that would hurt Nevada families and hand even more power to this reckless administration,” Cortez Masto said in a news release Tuesday afternoon. “We need a bipartisan solution to address this impending health care crisis, but we should not be swapping the pain of one group of Americans for another. I remain focused on protecting health care for working families, and I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to tackle this problem.”
John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the other Democrat voting for a continuing resolution to keep the government operating for another seven weeks beyond Sept. 30. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Senate Democrats, also voted to keep the government open.
Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky voted with the majority of the Democrats in opposition to the resolution.
Cortez Masto’s office noted a shutdown would “force tens of thousands of Nevada military personnel, union members, law enforcement agents and military nurses to work without pay.”
Union contractors at the Nevada National Security Site would be out of work and would not receive pay in the event of a shutdown, according to Cortez Masto’s news release.

When her term expired at the end of […],"Sigal Chattah speaking at a Donald Trump rally in Minden in 2022. (C-SPAN screengrab)A federal judge Monday granted defense motions to disqualify Nevada’s Acting U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah in three felony cases brought by Chattah after her term as Interim U.S. Attorney expired in July. 
Chattah was initially appointed Interim U.S. Attorney by Attorney General Pam Bondi for 120 days. When her term expired at the end of July, Bondi appointed Chattah as Acting U.S. Attorney, a position that could keep her in the post indefinitely. 
A provision of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows the administration to fill a vacancy by appointing the first assistant as acting U.S. Attorney. However, Chattah never held the position of top deputy. 
“Alternatively, the President may direct either certain senior officials of the agency or any Senate-confirmed official to serve as the acting officer,” the act says. 
Only two of President Donald Trump’s second-term picks for U.S. attorney have been confirmed by the Senate.   
In a move designed to prevent Chattah from serving in the acting role, Nevada’s Federal Public Defender filed motions to dismiss three indictments brought by Chattah after her term as U.S. attorney expired. In the alternative, the public defender asked the court to “disqualify her (Chattah) and the attorneys she supervises.”
The Vacancies Reform Act, Judge David Campbell wrote in an order released Tuesday, “is a carefully crafted assertion” of Congressional power. “Its purpose would be defeated if the Executive Branch – the very branch Congress was trying to constrain – could choose whomever it wanted, whenever it wanted, and fill the vacancy simply by declaring that person to be first assistant.”
The administration’s position, according to the public defender’s motions, that it may “backfill anyone of their choosing into the first assistant role post-vacancy and thus elevate that person to the acting role — is wrong.” 
The minute order filed in the case says Chattah and her attorneys are disqualified from supervising the cases. 
The Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice, an organization of criminal defense lawyers, filed an amicus brief in the cases. 
“By bypassing the Senate and naming Sigal Chattah as an ‘acting’ U.S. attorney, it’s clear the Trump administration knows Ms. Chattah is unconfirmable,” Nevada’s senior U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement in July. “This unprecedented maneuver sets a dangerous standard and risks holding up critical criminal cases just so that President Trump can play political games. At the end of the day, my position remains the same: Sigal Chattah is unfit for this role.”
Also in July, U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen called Bondi’s appointment of Chattah as acting U.S. Attorney “an outrageous attempt by the Trump Administration,” adding the president “knows Chattah would be soundly rejected by both sides of the aisle,” if brought before the Senate for confirmation. She called on the legal system “to immediately remove her.” 
Last month, a federal judge ruled Alina Habba, the Trump administration’s pick for U.S. Attorney of New Jersey, has served “without lawful authority” since July 1, when her 120 day appointment expired. 
A panel of federal judges named Habba’s deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the post, in accordance with the law, but the Trump administration fired Grace and reinstated Habba. The administration is appealing the ruling that Habba’s tenure ended July 1. 
Nevada’s federal judges had the opportunity under the law to name a replacement for Chattah, but did not. In a July letter, 116 former jurists from around the U.S. urged the Nevada judges “not to entrust Chattah with authority we fear she will misuse.”
On Tuesday, Reuters reported Chattah asked the Department of Justice to launch an investigation into the 2020 election, and hopes the outcome assists Republicans in winning the Congressional seat held by U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford.
In August, Chattah told KLAS-TV that a federal election case is underway and dismissed questions about her potential conflicts of interest, given her partisan role as Republican National Committeewoman, which had unsuccessfully filed suits claiming Joe Biden’s 2020 defeat of Trump in Nevada was fraudulent. Chattah relinquished her RNC role after she was appointed U.S. Attorney.   
“We prosecute the crime, not the criminal. Period. End of story, ” Chattah said in the KLAS interview. said. “It’s a non-partisan issue. Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, or you know, you’re legally here, illegally here, whatever your crime is, we prosecute the criminal.”
The Reuters’ story reports Chattah is also seeking to exonerate six Republicans charged by Attorney General Aaron Ford with posing as fake electors in 2020 in order to cast Nevada’s electoral votes for Trump. The first case, filed in Clark County, was dismissed for lack of venue. That ruling is being appealed. Ford also filed a second case in Carson City.  
Chattah represented one of the men charged by Ford. 
“She is urging the Justice Department to pursue an investigation that she says is going to exonerate her former client,” Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told Reuters. “I believe that action on her part violates the impartiality regulation.”
During her unsuccessful run in 2022 for Nevada attorney general, Chattah declared her Democratic opponent, incumbent Ford, a Black man, “should be hanging from a f–king crane”; longed for fewer “pronoun badges” and transgender individuals in America, while describing them with an offensive slur; and invited comparisons with Sen. Joe McCarthy and former Pres. Donald Trump by calling for the imprisonment of political foes.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-3-28-25-at-2.00-PM-1024x543.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

The answer is no: The commission will miss that deadline by at least one week, in the wake of two resignations sought and received by Gov. Jim Pillen of liquor regulators who jointly served on the medical cannabis board.
The Medical Cannabis Commission confirmed the new timeline Tuesday at a meeting originally meant to approve the first cultivator licenses and move toward the first steps of a medical cannabis supply chain in the state. However, two of the five cannabis commissioners resigned Monday, both of whom served on a three-member team evaluating and scoring cultivator applications received by Sept. 23.
Now, the remaining commissioners will independently review applications by next Tuesday, when commissioners will meet to decide whether to award up to four cultivator licenses.

“We would just ask for your understanding that this is a situation that none of us created in this, where we’re at right here,” Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna said Tuesday. “We would just hope you understand that we’re working through this the best that we can to make sure that we get the licenses issued in a timely manner and evaluated and issued in time.”
Resignations impacted timeline
Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist who chairs the commission, had been on the initial evaluation team with former Commissioners Bruce Bailey of Lincoln and Kim Lowe of Kearney. The plan was to average out scores before this week’s meeting and then vote on whether to grant the first licenses.
Oldenburg, a May appointee of Pillen’s, has a narrower view of what the voters passed than Bailey and Lowe, such as on smoking. Bailey had the most permissive view of voters’ wishes.
Under a state law passed by about 67% of voters last November, with majority support in 46 of 49 legislative districts, the commission needed to, “No later than October 1, 2025, begin granting registrations to applicants that meet eligibility standards and other requirements established by the commission.” The guidelines were established by an early July 1 deadline set by voters.


Upcoming medical cannabis dates
Oct. 7, 2 p.m. — Meeting to approve first cultivator licenses (Nebraska State Office Building, 1st floor hearing room).
Oct. 15, 1 p.m. — Public hearing on proposed regulations (Nebraska State Office Building, Meadowlark Room).
Oct. 17, 5 p.m. — Deadline to apply for 1st and 3rd Congressional District vacancies on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, members of which also serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission (Apply online or by mailing an application to the Governor’s Office).
Oct. 31, 9 a.m. — Legislative hearing on the implementation of medical cannabis in Nebraska, pushed by State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Ben Hansen and Rick Holdcroft (Nebraska State Capitol, Room 1023).


Bailey and Lowe resigned Monday, tossing a major wrench into whether the commission would meet its Wednesday licensing deadline.
Pillen’s request followed the unsealing last week of federal corruption charges against former Liquor Control Commission Executive Director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe. Rupe has pleaded not guilty. The indictment did not implicate any member of the Liquor Control Commission.
While Pillen has rejected all of the pending Liquor Control Commission regulatory changes proposed under the former director, his staff has confirmed that he has no plans to shelve medical cannabis regulations.
Bailey had chaired the Liquor Control Commission and served since 2014. Lowe had served on that commission since 2021. Retired Judge J. Michael Coffey joined the commission in June, a vacancy created after Pillen had previously requested the resignation of a third commissioner, Harry Hoch Jr., in May.
Oldenburg, Mueting and Coffey will review applications on metrics that have not been publicly released. Passing applicants need to average at least 70 out of 100. Applications were entered into a “lottery” to randomly order submissions.
Pillen opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana and has said Coffey, Mueting and Oldenburg — all his appointees — will keep Nebraska’s medical cannabis system carefully regulated. He will appoint two commissioners to succeed Bailey and Lowe.
Licensing lawsuit likely
The commission also faces a potential legal threat from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers. His office has threatened to sue the commission once the first licenses are issued.
“This office has long held that any attempt to license entities to dispense marijuana in Nebraska violates the federal ban [on marijuana],” then-acting Deputy Solicitor General Zach Pohlman testified at a March legislative hearing. “If the Medical Cannabis Commission tries to do so, the Attorney General’s Office will challenge that action as preempted and unenforceable.”

The office has repeated the stance multiple times, including in a separate citizen-led lawsuit seeking to overturn the voter-passed laws, in which Hilgers and Pohlman say it should be the AG’s Office, not a citizen, to challenge the laws’ constitutionality. 
A spokesperson for Hilgers declined to confirm last week whether this remained the position of the Attorney General’s Office. A Pillen spokesperson, when asked last week whether the governor supported Hilgers’ efforts, directed questions to the AG’s Office.
A separate voter-passed law authorizes anyone with a health care practitioner’s recommendation to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in Nebraska. It passed with 71% voter support last November, including majority support in every legislative district. Nebraska became the 39th state to authorize a medical cannabis program.
‘We can get started today’
Troy Burgess, one of the cultivator applicants, said Tuesday that once a cultivator begins growing marijuana, it could be five months before anything is sent to a product manufacturer (another license type) and another 4-6 weeks before it is ready for sale at a dispensary (another license type). 
“These patients need relief. We need to get it to them,” Burgess told the commission. “We can get started today.”

The proposed regulations the commission is considering would cap the four licensed cultivators to no more than 1,250 flowering plants each at any one time. With two expected harvests in the year, that’s up to 10,000 harvestable plants, if all plants are grown successfully and are contaminant-free. The commission is anticipating an initial program to support about 20,000 patients.
All products would need to meet strict testing requirements as set by the commission.
A public hearing on the proposed regulations is set for 1 p.m. on Oct. 15 at the Nebraska State Office Building. The hearing could last up to three hours, with testifiers limited to two or three minutes apiece. 
Written comments can be submitted up to 11:59 p.m. on Oct 15 by mail to the Nebraska Medical Commission, PO Box 95046, Lincoln, NE 68509-5046; by fax at 402-471-2814 or by email to mcc.contact@nebraska.gov.
‘Integrity’
Dominic Gillen of Bellevue, who has worked with advocates of medical cannabis for more than a decade in Nebraska, spoke to the commission Tuesday about “integrity” and said the full weight of voter trust is on commissioners, not politicians behind the curtain “pulling the strings.”

“The integrity of a lawful election is being stolen by self-righteous politicians who beat their chests, trumpeting election integrity while quietly using you as a commission to undermine it,” Gillen said.
Many Nebraskans again urged the commission to approve of smoking, vaping and raw flower sales, which its proposed regulations reject. Angelica Marsaglia told commissioners they needed to implement the law, not rewrite it.
“That exceeds your authority, undermines the will of the voters and is unlawful,” Marsaglia said.
Gillen said Bailey was guilty of “honoring his commitment to the voters” and “should be hailed as a hero” for standing up for voters, such as pushing for more cultivators and a higher plant cap.
“The politicians have made their heartless choice,” Gillen said. “You, on the other hand, still have one.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission will meet next at 2 p.m. Oct. 7 in Lincoln.



What would the latest medical cannabis regulations mean?
If finalized, the state’s medical cannabis regulations would license up to four cultivators, four product manufacturers, 12 dispensaries and 12 transporters. The guidelines would also establish a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory” and also make Nebraska’s program essentially a low-THC variety.
Under the regulations, patients or caregivers could purchase up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in a 30-day period, which is about 142 grams. Of that, patients could purchase no more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the same dispensary within 90 days. Delta-9 THC is the part of cannabis most associated with a “high.”
The regulations would allow no more than 12 medical cannabis dispensaries statewide, arranged by judicial district. That could mean one dispensary in Douglas County (584,526 residents), Lancaster County (322,608 residents), Sarpy/Cass Counties (217,202 residents) and Buffalo/Hall Counties (112,979 residents), according to 2020 census data.
Dispensaries would not be able to sell smoking or vaping products or edibles of any kind. Oral tablets with a “thin layer” of flavoring to make the products easier to swallow could be sold.
Under current law, a patient or qualified caregiver with a recommendation from any health care practitioner can legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, in any form. But no licenses have yet been issued, so cannabis can’t legally be purchased in Nebraska yet.
The latest set of emergency regulations ends Dec. 7. Commissioners say that set of regulations can be extended for one additional 90-day period.
Once the Medical Cannabis Commission approves a more permanent set of regulations, commissioners will send the regulations to Attorney General Mike Hilgers for legal review and Gov. Jim Pillen for final approval.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe Michigan Legislature won’t be going home Tuesday night as a final budget plan is drafted and reviewed by legal experts before coming up for a vote – which could happen on Wednesday at the earliest.
That means it is very likely that the government could enter at least a partial government shutdown while the House and Senate work out a continuation budget that would fund operations in the short-term, a promise Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made to state employees earlier on Tuesday.
Few legislators who spoke to reporters at the Capitol wanted to call it a government shutdown, but it was clear by their statements that there was no solid timeline to vote on that continuation plan before the clock strikes midnight on the fiscal year.
The facts on the ground somewhat contradicted a joint statement put out late Tuesday afternoon by Whitmer, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), which indicated that they had a deal on a final budget plan.
There was also a continuation bill already in the Senate, as the GOP-led House somewhat anticipated that the situation would come to this breakdown months ago. The Senate has yet to pass that government shutdown avoidance plan.
After hours of meeting behind closed doors and with few details leaking through, the respective leaders of the Legislature and Whitmer said late Tuesday evening that they had finalized a budget deal that solidifies the loose framework brokered last week.
And while that was a positive development in the down-to-the-wire budget cycle, details on a hold-over budget to keep the government open weren’t readily available with less than six hours until the end of the current fiscal year.
State Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said the House was working hard to ensure that the budget was done as soon as possible. He said that no one in state government wanted to see any lapses in government services that people can count on. That included free school breakfast for K-12 students, Medicaid services, and more.
When asked how long the legal review and budget drafting process would take – if it could happen before midnight Tuesday to avoid a shutdown or the need for a continuation budget, setting up a vote on Wednesday morning – Farhat said they were exhausting every single option.
“‘Speaker Farhat’ would have had this done on July 1,” he said. “We have to get this budget done in the most responsible manner possible given the constraints we’re facing. So everything is on the table right now.”
When asked if, in his experience, between now and midnight was enough time to get that busy work done, Farhat said in his experience, the budget would have been done in July.
“These are uncharted waters, but we have the expertise and the membership to be able to handle this moment,” Farhat said.
That said, the intent was to keep representatives and senators in Lansing for as long as it takes, which could mean work into the early morning.
Farhat was asked if there will be at least a few hours gap between the end of the fiscal year and a continuation budget vote to keep the lights on, but he could not say if that was the case or how soon the chambers would pass such a bill.
“There’s been a deal that … they’ve come to and it’s being drafted,” Farhat said. “As soon as the drafting is done, we’ll have time to review it. We have time to be able to ask our questions and deliberate on it. We’ll take action, the clerks will do their job and it’ll get to the governor’s desk.”
State Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen), who also sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said that there already was a continuation bill sitting in the Senate.
“They can [vote on] that and we could be ready,” Roth said.
It’s still unclear if the Senate is considering that as an option, or if they’ll put up their own continuation budget, which would have to reach the House before it moves to the governor, further complicating the process.
Farhat was asked if he’s had any conversations with his Senate counterparts on moving that bill.
Negative, Farhat said. But minutes later, he was seen in the Senate chatting with state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, and state Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton). Reporters also saw Democratic senators passing around a large folder which appeared to contain a resolution, but it was unclear if that was the continuation budget resolution in question.
Democrats went into caucus soon afterward.
Roth said that despite the uncertainty of the evening, the Legislature was close to being done with the budget cycle. He said he was hopeful that a vote would occur sometime Wednesday, but there were indications that it could also be another long day or night.
“Tomorrow won’t be the fact that we don’t agree on things, it’s just, ‘can they get the paperwork done?’” Roth said. “We are not going to go forward until we get some more clarity. We’re going to go after midnight. And we won’t go home until we have something ready to go at 12:01 a.m. We’ll take a few hours, get some sleep, and come back as early as we can.”
While the drafting occurs and lawmakers sit waiting, several said they were upset that they still haven’t seen the details of the final plan or how they were going to move forward with keeping the government open during a partial shutdown.
“MI budget update: At some point in the near or distant future we should receive information on what may or may not be in the budget, which we hope to vote on sometime between last week and the end of October,” state Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Livonia) posted on social media.

The instruction came after BOP Director William K. Marshall III posted a message on the bureau’s website late last week, in which he wrote that the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.” He said it was “time for change,” and then thanked the president and Attorney General Pam Bondi for allowing him to make that change. 
“Today, I’m announcing the termination of our contract with CPL-33 effective immediately,” he wrote.
The decision reverberated in the 122 communities that house federal prisons around the country, including Connecticut.
This state is home to one federal prison, the Federal Correctional Institution Danbury, a low-security, mixed-gender facility where Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald J. Trump, once served a 4-month sentence for ignoring a subpoena in Congress’ investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
FCI Danbury houses 1,250 inmates, according to the prison’s website, and its employees are represented by labor union AFGE Local 1661.
The local negotiates its contract with the BOP as part of the national Council of Prison Locals. The union negotiates for job security, fair discipline and safety conditions. Pay and time off are set by Congress.
The current agreement between the federal prisons and their employees was slated to run through May 2029.
“By getting rid of our collective bargaining agreement, they’ve also invalidated all of our local agreements,” said Robert Curnan, president of the Danbury local. “So they can pretty much do whatever they want, as long as it’s not against the law.”
“They’re basically telling us they don’t believe we have any authority whatsoever,” he said.
In the message on the bureau’s website, Marshall said, “This isn’t about taking things away, it’s about giving you more,” adding, “The whole purpose of ending this contract is to make your lives better. Period.”
He said pay, benefits and civil service protections would remain the same, and that employees would not be fired or disciplined without cause and due process.

But the message concerned Curnan. He said the union pushes for critical protections. 
For example, the Danbury union advocated for seniority in job assignments; Curnan said he’s worried job placements could be made more arbitrarily now. Also, as a result of the BOP change, local unions no longer have the right to represent employees in disciplinary meetings, he said.
Curnan said that without union advocacy, employees could be moved off of their primary duties to cover staffing shortfalls more often. That could mean teachers being asked to serve as correctional officers, thus leaving educational programs understaffed.
Curnan said moves like this could lower morale and worsen the prison’s staffing shortage. “I have a feeling that conditions are going to decline and people are going to leave,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP24307090973664-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

The states targeted by the new restrictions all have refused to deploy law enforcement for federal immigration actions. Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark says that’s unconstitutional.

Vermont is among a dozen states pushing back against new restrictions placed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on emergency preparedness grant funding. The states facing the funding restrictions had all refused to allocate law enforcement resources for federal immigration activities.
State Attorney General Charity Clark joined her latest lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump’s administration, calling the new rules and grant allocations unconstitutional. Attorneys general from 11 other states, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New York, are also participating in the lawsuit. The lawsuit specifically names Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and top Federal Emergency Management Agency official David Richardson, both in their official capacity.
At issue in the lawsuit are two grant programs run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, one targeting homeland security, the other emergency preparedness. The former, the Homeland Security Grant Program, is FEMA’s largest grant program, allocating nearly $1 billion to states and municipalities each year. 
FEMA had previously notified the 12 states that they would receive $459 million through the Homeland Security program, according to a press release from Clark’s office. But on Saturday, the states were collectively awarded $226 million — a more than 50% reduction of what the states were promised. The administration also cut the period of time that all states are allowed to spend the allocated funds from three years to one. 
A FEMA press release announcing the reduced funding on Monday said, “Recipients of grants will no longer be permitted to use federal funds to house illegal immigrants at luxury hotels, fund climate change pet projects, or empower radical organizations with unseemly ties that don’t serve the interest of the American people.”
Vermont received all of its previously allocated funds, but now will have only one year to put them to use. The large majority of the federal grant money is awarded by the state to municipal subgrantees such as towns or water districts, which are often on different budgetary timelines. The shortened timeframe could pose significant hurdles to the funds’ implementation, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Vermont receives approximately $4.5 million through the Homeland Security Grant Program and approximately $2.75 million through the Emergency Management Performance Grant, according to the Attorney General’s Office. 
“The Trump Administration is trying to unlawfully reallocate federal homeland security funding based on a state’s willingness to comply with the Administration’s political agenda,” Clark wrote in a press release. 
“But under the Constitution, it is Congress – not the President – who has the power of the purse,” she added. “This reallocation also includes an unlawful attempt at drastically shortening the timeframe during which funds must be spent, effectively setting states on a race against time to use the funds before one year is up.” 
Vermont Emergency Management oversees the implementation of the grant funding in the state. In an email, Vermont Emergency Management spokesperson Mark Bosma relayed a message from the homeland security unit of the department, saying, “They are in the process of evaluating the award conditions for this grant, so it would be premature for them to discuss it.” 
Vermont has refused to use its law enforcement to assist in the federal government’s aggressive immigration crackdown. Gov. Phil Scott twice declined to send the Vermont National Guard to assist the Trump administration this summer. The first request was explicitly to assist the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its work. Also, Vermont law forbids local and state law enforcement agencies from participating in federal immigration enforcement actions. State lawmakers went even further to tighten the statute earlier this year.
The lawsuit argues that cutting congressionally allocated funding for political aims — such as punishing states that are not assisting the Trump administration in its immigration enforcement activities — is in stark violation of the Constitution. 
The changes made to the grant awards and timeframe also violate the Administrative Procedure Act, a statute that lays out specific protocols federal agencies must follow when changing regulations or programs, the lawsuit said. The law essentially aims to establish best practices in regulations and prevent this kind of political whim from dictating agency actions, as legal experts have outlined.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-30 23:27:55+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,‘No margin for error’: State economic check-in spotlights tricky balancing act,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/economy/no-margin-for-error-state-economic-check-in-spotlights-tricky-balancing-act/,"With the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and a state economic lag colliding, Massachusetts budget-writers weigh options to balance the outlook.","DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUND as Massachusetts barrels toward a roughly $650 million decline in tax revenues and a host of other federal funding impacts nine months into Trump 2.0.  
State budget-writers have been wringing their hands for months about the anticipated impact of the sweeping federal law enacted on July 4, and on Tuesday, they took the unusual step of hosting a mid-year checkup.  
The prognosis they heard — that a slowdown is likely but Massachusetts might avoid a full recession — could force action in the next few months to rein in spending on local projects, recalibrate revenue forecasts, or adjust the state’s tax code. 
“There’s really no margin for error,” Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said at the State House hearing he held alongside the Legislature’s two Ways and Means Committee chairs. 
Revenue Commissioner Geoffrey Snyder told officials his office expects the new federal law will shrink state tax collections this fiscal year by more than $650 million.  
The fiscal year 2026 state budget Gov. Maura Healey signed in July does not account for that estimated hit, which Snyder newly revealed during Tuesday’s hearing, and officials will need to adjust their approach several months into the cycle. 
“Obviously, $650 million at any point in time is significant and daunting, to say the least, for us as budget-writers,” said House Ways and Means Committee chair Aaron Michlewitz. 
That’s not the only upheaval on the way. The sweeping federal bill could also shrink federal funding for health care here by $532 million in federal fiscal year 2026, according to an analysis from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. If Congress decides not to extend pandemic-era tax credits that help Americans pay for health insurance, the Massachusetts Health Connector marketplace would need an extra $255 million from Beacon Hill to keep its most subsidized option available at current rates. 
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation president Doug Howgate said the billions of dollars in reduced federal health care spending on Massachusetts is a “challenge that’s going to cascade through the rest of the budget.” 
“These are ticking time bombs, and we know when they’re going to go off,” he said. 
Several of the experts invited to appear before policymakers offered a similar big-picture forecast: that the state’s economy will endure a sluggish period in the months ahead without fully tumbling into recession territory. 
“My sense, based on what we know today, is that we’re not going to be moving in the coming year into a recession, but that a slower-growth, higher-cost environment is going to be there,” said Michael Goodman, a UMass Dartmouth professor and co-editor of the state-focused economic journal MassBenchmarks. 
The Legislature has been happy in recent years to ramp up state spending, in part using newly available money from the surtax on high earners, with buy-in both from Healey and from former Republican governor Charlie Baker. Over the past decade, the bottom line of the annual state budget has grown by more than 58 percent. 
Now, federal pressures — including the prospect of an extended government shutdown — are colliding with the more routine ebbs and flows in state economic performance to darken the outlook. Job growth has been mostly flat for more than a year, and tax collections are middling apart from the surtax. 
A key indicator will come when the Department of Revenue publishes a report next week detailing how much the state collected in taxes in September. As of September 25, Snyder said, collections were “showing little to no growth versus last year.” 
Revenue Commissioner Geoffrey Snyder addresses Beacon Hill budget-writers at a September 30, 2025 event about the state’s economic outlook.
Beacon Hill has already built in a few bulwarks. Legislative negotiators left a more than $800 million cushion in their annual budget agreement to offset expected spending pressures or revenue drops. 
That could help absorb the sizable decline in tax collections, but officials suggested it might not be straightforward. Michlewitz said there are “more issues at hand than just what this potential revenue piece may be,” and his Senate counterpart, Michael Rodrigues, warned of “tremendous growth” in health care needs. 
“We understand that there’s $860 million on the balance sheet,” said Gorzkowicz, referring to the funding cushion lawmakers built into the 2026 budget. “How it’s used has yet to be decided, and there are many competing interests that have to be considered when thinking about how to apply that $860 million.” 
Snyder told lawmakers most of the state revenue loss would come from a handful of changes to the federal tax code. Top Democrats did not rule out legislative changes that would decouple the state tax code, essentially putting in place a Massachusetts-specific approach to some tax measures that diverge from the national standard, as a way of minimizing the impact.  
“We’re going to have to take all those options and consider them all at this point in time,” Michlewitz said. 
Healey’s office said in July that the administration would delay paying about $125 million in local earmarks that lawmakers wove into the state budget until the fall. Gorzkowicz said he still has not decided whether to release that money, and will weigh input from Tuesday’s hearing and the forthcoming September revenue report. 
The secretary has another choice to make in the next two weeks: by October 15, Gorzkowicz must certify that the state’s revenues are sufficient to cover its expenses for the fiscal year that runs through June 30, 2026. That might prompt the administration to downgrade Beacon Hill’s official tax collection forecast, which was developed before enactment of the federal megalaw. 
“That’s what today’s hearing was all about,” Gorzkowicz said when a reporter asked about the prospect of adjusting the so-called consensus revenue benchmark.  
Massachusetts has a sizable reserve on hand. The balance of the state’s “rainy day” savings account stood at about $8.6 billion in early September, according to the state comptroller’s office, more than six times as much as a decade ago. 
But policymakers, still smarting from a 2017 bond rating downgrade that chided the state’s approach to savings, are hesitant to pull from that source. 
“I would be hard-pressed at this time to suggest that we’re going to dip into the stabilization fund,” Rodrigues said. “We have other tools that are available to us, so I think we’d look at the other tools first.” 
Another idea Healey proposed would give her temporary expanded authority to slash state spending unilaterally, often known as 9C cuts, from more areas of the budget. 
Legislative leaders have shown little interest in ceding that power in the nearly three months since Healey included it in legislation. Michlewitz and Rodrigues on Tuesday said only that they continue to review the idea.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-30_economic_panel_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

Free.,"Federal government shutdown begins, with no easy exit in sight","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-government-shutdown-begins-no-easy-exit-sight,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — The federal government started shutting down early Wednesday after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year — resulting in widespread ramifications for hundreds of programs and giving the Trump administration an avenue to fire federal workers en masse.The U.S. Senate was unable to advance two short-term government funding bills Tuesday when Democrats and Republicans deadlocked for the second time this month, with just hours to go before the midnight Tuesday shutdown deadline.Senators voted 55-45 on Republicans’ bill that would fund the government for seven weeks and 47-53 on a Democratic stopgap proposal that would keep the lights on for a month and included several health care provisions that they said were needed for their support. Neither had the 60 votes needed to advance. Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with GOP senators on their stopgap bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted against it.White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a memo to departments and agencies Tuesday night after the Senate vote that “affected agencies should now execute their plans for an orderly shutdown.” Vought said federal employees should report for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake shutdown activities.The consequences of a shutdown will be sweeping in the nation’s capital and across the country, where states are bracing for the impact. About 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed, leading to a $400 million impact a day, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported. All federal employees would go unpaid until the shutdown is over.Additionally, the Trump administration plans to lay off thousands of federal employees, which would reshape the federal workforce. President Donald Trump again vowed Tuesday to undertake layoffs and a major government employee union filed suit in federal court in advance of such a move.More votes on GOP bill plannedSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said hours before the votes there wouldn’t be any talks with Democrats during a shutdown. “The negotiation happens when the government is open. So let’s keep the government open and then we will have the negotiations,” Thune said. “We’re happy to sit down and talk about these issues that they’re interested in,” he said. “But it should not have anything to do with whether or not for a seven-week period we keep the government open, so that this government can continue to do its work and that we can do our work through the regular appropriations process to fund the government.” After the votes failed, Thune expressed his frustration with Democrats during a press conference. “This is so unnecessary and uncalled for,” he said. Thune said he plans to bring up a vote on the continuing resolution again. He said as soon as Wednesday the federal government can be funded if five Democrats voted with Republicans. “Democrats may have chosen to shut down the government, but we can reopen it tomorrow,” Thune said. Republican Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming said the “cracks in the Democrats are already showing,” noting that three Democrats voted with Republicans Tuesday night. “There is bipartisan support for keeping the government open,” Barrasso said. “We’re happy to see that the Democrats are already starting to break from (Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer) and we’re going to continue to offer a clean (continuing resolution) on the floor of the Senate to open the government for the next seven weeks.”Health care tax credits at center of standoffThe disagreement isn’t entirely about GOP lawmakers writing their short-term funding bill behind closed doors and then expecting Democrats to help advance it in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major legislation.Democratic leaders have raised concerns for weeks about the end-of-year sunset of enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, arguing a solution is needed now ahead of the open enrollment period starting on Nov. 1.

Democrats have also grown increasingly frustrated with the White House budget office’s unilateral actions on spending, arguing Vought is significantly eroding Congress’ constitutional power of the purse. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday the Government Accountability Office should sue the Trump administration over its efforts to freeze or unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats need an agreement with Republicans to extend the enhanced tax credits. Schumer said people will begin getting notices in October telling them how much the cost of their ACA plans will increase during the next year, which he expects will ratchet up pressure on Republican leaders to broker a bipartisan agreement. “We’re going to be right there explaining to them it’s because the Republicans wouldn’t negotiate with us,” Schumer said, referring to consumers. “We’re ready to do it anytime. And there will be huge heat on (Republicans) on this issue.”People who buy health insurance on the ACA marketplace and receive subsidies through enhanced ACA tax credits could expect to pay on average more than double for annual premiums in 2026 if the credits expire as scheduled at the end of this year, according to an analysis released Tuesday by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. The analysis found premiums could increase from an average of $888 this year to $1,904 in 2026.Claims about immigrants Schumer also rebuffed GOP leaders saying that Democrats want to include people without legal immigration status in federal health care programs. “They say that undocumented people are going to get these credits. That is absolutely false. That is one of the big lies they tell, so they don’t have to discuss the issues,” Schumer said. “The federal government by law that we passed does not fund health insurance for undocumented immigrants in Medicaid, nor the ACA nor Medicare. Undocumented immigrants do not get federal health insurance premiums.” Immigrants in the country without legal authorization are not eligible for Medicaid, and neither are most immigrants with legal status, such as those with student visas or enrollment in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. Only immigrants with a “qualified status,” such as legal permanent residents, asylees and refugees, are able to get Medicaid benefits, and they usually have to wait five years before their coverage can even begin. Democrats explain why they voted with GOP Cortez Masto of Nevada wrote in a statement explaining her vote to advance the GOP stopgap bill that she could not support “a costly shutdown that would hurt Nevada families and hand even more power to this reckless administration.”“We need a bipartisan solution to address this impending health care crisis, but we should not be swapping the pain of one group of Americans for another,” she added. “I remain focused on protecting health care for working families, and I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to tackle this problem.”Pennsylvania’s Fetterman wrote in a statement of his own that his vote on the Republican bill “was for our country over my party.“Together, we must find a better way forward.”Collins said during a brief interview before the vote she is worried about the broad authority the White House holds during a shutdown and how the Office of Management and Budget has indicated it will use that power. “I'm much more concerned about OMB sending signals that there should be mass firings of federal employees who have the misfortune to be designated as non-essential, when in fact they're performing very essential work, they're just not being paid,” Collins said.  North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven, chairman of the Agriculture spending subcommittee, said lawmakers will have to sort through how various departments implement their contingency plans as well as the possibility of mass layoffs during a shutdown. “We'll have to work through those things and figure out how we do keep things going as best we can during this Democrat shutdown,” Hoeven said.West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Republicans are “unified in the belief that this is an easy choice” to fund the government with a stopgap bill that doesn't include any contentious or political provisions. Capito — who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that funds the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor — said there are several programs that will be “missed” during a shutdown. “And that's concerning.

Mike Rounds said he doesn’t expect a shutdown will end until after Democrats have sent a message to their voters. “I'm not optimistic that we're going to get a path forward until they've had a shutdown,” he said. Rounds, who negotiated a handshake agreement with the White House budget director this summer to preserve some funding for rural tribal radio stations after Congress eliminated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said that deal could be affected by a shutdown. “They're putting the administration in a position where they can pick and choose what they're going to do, and a shutdown is not going to be beneficial to these Native American radio stations,” Rounds said. Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said she wants Democrats and Republicans to negotiate on health care provisions.“I’ve been making the case constantly, that (it) is literally my obligation to try and fight for health care, and I’m willing to talk to anyone,” she said. “I’m willing to accept that I certainly will not get everything I want.”Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said that while Democrats agreed to help advance what’s known as a continuing resolution in March, they can’t now because of “what President Trump is doing to this country, particularly when it comes to health care costs for families.”  The shutdown will significantly affect the operations of the federal government as lawmakers have not passed any of the dozen full-year appropriations bills that finance agency operations. Oct. 1 is the beginning of the new fiscal year for the federal government.Shutdown plan for national parksDepartments began releasing updated contingency plans this weekend, detailing how many of their employees would work during a government shutdown and how many would be furloughed.The Interior Department, which includes the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, posted its updated plans late Tuesday. The National Park Service plans to furlough 9,300 of its 14,500 workers. The Trump administration will allow several activities necessary for the protection of life or property to continue, including fire suppression for active fires, permitting and monitoring First Amendment activities, border and coastal protection and surveillance, and law enforcement and emergency response.The contingency plan says that roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” but it adds that if “access becomes a safety, health or resource protection issue … the area must be closed.”Union files suitIn anticipation of layoffs by the Trump administration, labor unions representing more than 1 million federal workers filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California on Tuesday to block the Trump administration from carrying out mass firings. The suit argues that there is no statutory authority to fire federal employees during a government shutdown.“These actions are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious, and the cynical use of federal employees as a pawn in Congressional deliberations should be declared unlawful and enjoined by this Court,” according to the suit filed by the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.Ashley Murray and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-01 00:56:40.980032

Free.,Midnight federal shutdown edges closer as US Senate fails to agree on spending bills,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/midnight-federal-shutdown-edges-closer-us-senate-fails-agree-spending-bills,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate failed to advance two short-term government funding bills Tuesday when Democrats and Republicans deadlocked for the second time this month, with just hours to go before a shutdown that appeared nearly certain to begin at midnight. Senators voted 55-45 on Republicans’ bill that would fund the government for seven weeks and 47-53 on a Democratic stopgap proposal that would keep the lights on for a month and included several health care provisions. Neither had the 60 votes needed to advance. Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with GOP senators on their stopgap bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted against it.The consequences of a shutdown will be sweeping in the nation’s capital and across the country, where states are bracing for the impact. About 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed, leading to a $400 million impact a day, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported. All federal employees would go unpaid until the shutdown is over.Additionally, the Trump administration plans to lay off federal employees en masse, which would reshape the federal workforce. President Donald Trump again vowed Tuesday to undertake layoffs and a major government employee union filed suit in federal court in advance of such a move.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said hours before the votes there wouldn’t be any talks with Democrats during a shutdown. “The negotiation happens when the government is open. So let’s keep the government open and then we will have the negotiations,” Thune said. “We’re happy to sit down and talk about these issues that they’re interested in,” he said. “But it should not have anything to do with whether or not for a seven-week period we keep the government open, so that this government can continue to do its work and that we can do our work through the regular appropriations process to fund the government.” Health care tax credits at center of standoffThe disagreement isn’t entirely about GOP lawmakers writing their short-term funding bill behind closed doors and then expecting Democrats to help advance it in the Senate, where bipartisanship is required for major legislation.Democratic leaders have raised concerns for weeks about the end-of-year sunset of enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, arguing a solution is needed now ahead of the open enrollment period starting on Nov. 1. Democrats have also grown increasingly frustrated with the White House budget office’s unilateral actions on spending, arguing Director Russ Vought is significantly eroding Congress’ constitutional power of the purse. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday the Government Accountability Office should sue the Trump administration over its efforts to freeze or unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats need an agreement with Republicans to extend the enhanced tax credits. Schumer said people will begin getting notices in October telling them how much the cost of their ACA plans will increase during the next year, which he expects will ratchet up pressure on Republican leaders to broker a bipartisan agreement. “We’re going to be right there explaining to them it’s because the Republicans wouldn’t negotiate with us,” Schumer said, referring to consumers. “We’re ready to do it anytime. And there will be huge heat on (Republicans) on this issue.”People who buy health insurance on the ACA marketplace and receive subsidies through enhanced ACA tax credits could expect to pay on average more than double for annual premiums in 2026 if the credits expire as scheduled at the end of this year, according to an analysis released Tuesday by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. The analysis found premiums could increase from an average of $888 this year to $1,904 in 2026.Claims about immigrants Schumer also rebuffed GOP leaders saying that Democrats want to include people without legal immigration status in federal health care programs. “They say that undocumented people are going to get these credits.

Greg Dolezal has become the latest member of the Georgia Senate to launch a bid for lieutenant governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSen. Greg Dolezal of Cumming has become the latest member of the Georgia Senate to launch a bid for lieutenant governor, joining several other Republican candidates in a race that includes some of the most powerful figures in the chamber. Dolezal, a businessman, was first elected to the state Senate in 2018 and represents a district based in Forsyth County.
In an ad announcing his campaign Tuesday, Dolezal touted his hard-line conservative credentials, including his role as the lead sponsor of the Riley Gaines Act during the 2025 legislative session. The bill — which was named after a college swimmer who tied for fifth place with a transgender swimmer in a tournament at Georgia Tech — bans transgender athletes from playing on most sports teams that align with their gender identity at both K-12 and college levels, and requires separate restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping facilities for men and women at athletic events. 
Dolezal also promised to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs from “every government agency” in the state, “stop transgender indoctrination” in schools and universities, and oust prosecutors who are “soft on crime” in his campaign announcement.
Like many other GOP candidates, Dolezal has highlighted his loyalty to President Donald Trump in his pitch to voters, arguing that he “stood with President Trump when it mattered most.”
At a September rally for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Butts County Republican who is running for governor, Dolezal criticized Republicans who he characterized as fair-weather MAGA fans in his speech.
“In 2020, when President Trump needed allies, these politicians were silent,” he said.
He was also among the four Republican state senators in 2020 who called, unsuccessfully, for a special session to consider officially overturning the results of the presidential election in Georgia. 
On the Republican side of the lieutenant governor’s race, Dolezal will be competing against candidates including Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch of Dahlonega, President Pro Tem John F. Kennedy of Macon, Sen. Blake Tillery of Vidalia, House lawmaker David Clark of Buford and Georgia Department of Veterans Services board member Takosha Swan of Conyers. Sen. Josh McLaurin of Sandy Springs is the most high-profile Democrat in the race.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado lawmakers on Tuesday approved $7.5 million in funding to pay for a nutritional assistance program in October if the federal government shuts down. 
The government was barreling towards that shutdown on Tuesday afternoon as Congress failed to reach a deal to pass a short-term funding agreement. The federal government will begin shutting down Wednesday, the start of a news federal fiscal year, if a bill isn’t passed. 
That will affect an array of government programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC. The program is a federal grant program appropriated annually by Congress. Since Wednesday is the start of a new fiscal year, WIC will not have received any federal funds in the case of a shutdown.

“WIC serves more than 100,000 Coloradans each month, and is a vital lifeline for women, infants, and young children. A lapse in service could have severe consequences,” Gov. Jared Polis wrote in a letter to Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Democrat who is chair of the Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee.
A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.

The JBC will allow $7.5 million in general fund money to backfill WIC benefits in the state, with the expectation that the state  will then eventually seek reimbursement from the federal government. 
The JBC delayed a vote on the funding request from last week due to questions over whether it met interim supplemental requirements. The “unforeseen circumstance” that would allow such a request when the Legislature isn’t in session — in this case, a government shutdown — had not happened yet. 
“Given the frequency of averting a government shutdown at the last minute, the Office of Legislative Legal Services does not believe that a federal government shutdown is objectively certain to occur on October 1 of this year,” a JBC staff document about the request reads. 
Nonpartisan staff also raised concerns about the absence of clear statutory authority for the state to use its own money for WIC benefits. They noted, however, that there also isn’t a prohibition on it. 
The money will only be used if there is a shutdown. 
The JBC also gave permission for bill drafters to write legislation that would clarify spending authority and processes for funding during future government shutdowns.

(NC Newsline file photo)Members of the N.C. State Board of Elections argued Tuesday over state Auditor Dave Boliek’s hiring of a former GOP state director to work with local elections officials.  
Boliek told county board chairs last week that former state GOP executive director Dallas Woodhouse would be his “eyes and ears on the ground,” with duties to include shaping early voting plans, election policy, and election integrity.
Democrats on the state board argued that Boliek is giving Woodhouse responsibilities in the newly-created role that, under law, belong to state Board of Elections Director Sam Hayes. Democrats also questioned Woodhouse’s suitability as a former state GOP spokesman whose job it was to help elect Republicans. 
Boliek’s office did not respond to an email Tuesday evening, and Woodhouse did not return a phone message. 
Board member Siobhan Millen, a Democrat, described Woodhouse as a “highly-partisan figure who resigned his role” with the GOP as a bribery scandal was unfolding. Woodhouse was not implicated in the bribery case. 
Board Chairman Francis De Luca began to shout over Millen as she criticized Woodhouse’s hiring.

Before the meeting, De Luca said Woodhouse was a close friend whom he once hired to work at the conservative Civitas Institute. 
Woodhouse resigned his job as executive director of the state GOP in 2019 after chairman Robin Hayes was indicted in connection with a bribery case. Hayes pleaded guilty to lying to federal prosecutors and was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay a fine. President Donald Trump pardoned him in 2021. 
“It’s difficult to imagine a person who would be less suited to bringing election integrity…,” Millen said of Woodhouse before De Luca cut her off. 
“I don’t think it enhances public confidence,” she added, before De Luca pronounced the discussion a waste of time. 
A new state law gave Boliek the power to appoint the chairs of local boards of elections and members of the State Board of Elections. Until this year, the governor appointed state board members, but the law took that power away from Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, and gave it to Boliek, a Republican. 
The law does not give Boliek the power to run elections or set election policy, and having Woodhouse as a liaison creates confusion over who local boards should turn to for guidance, said board member Jeff Carmon, a Democrat. 
What appears to be a contentious midterm election is coming, Carmon said, and local elections officials need to know where to direct their questions and complaints, and whose policies they should follow.
“If anyone is calling the auditor’s office, it needs to stop,” Carmon said. 
Board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV, a Republican, said it’s clear that the board retains “legal, technical, and supervisory oversight” over elections, but Woodhouse may be helpful in securing funding from the legislature.
“Our county board members should take direction from this board,” Eggers said.

On Tuesday, the USDA approved more than $500 million in assistance for Georgia farmers affected by the storm. Grant Blankenship/GPB NewsIt’s been just over a year since Hurricane Helene ripped across the Southeast, killing 250 people and causing billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses.
In Georgia, the storm claimed 37 lives while its devastating winds and floodwaters led to at least $5.5 billion in damage to the state’s farmers and foresters, according to assessments from University of Georgia researchers.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the state will receive just over $531 million in federal funds for the Hurricane Helene Block Grant Program intended to cover future economic losses, infrastructure losses and timber losses caused by the hurricane.
Tyler Harper. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
In a statement, Georgia Agriculture Secretary Tyler Harper celebrated the funding, stressing that it was the most the state could get.
“This funding is absolutely essential to help our farm families bounce back from Hurricane Helene, and our team invested hundreds of hours into the negotiation process to secure the maximum possible amount of federal funding for our state and our producers,” Harper said.
According to the USDA, the money will come from a $30 billion disaster assistance relief effort set aside in the American Relief Act of 2025, signed late last year by former President Joe Biden. Under that program, USDA worked with Georgia and 13 other states to develop individual grants.
Administrative details including how to apply for funding have not yet been released but will be forthcoming, the USDA said in a release.
Brooke Rollins, who is the new U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, talks to reporters Wednesday. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
In a statement, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins touted other federal disaster assistance programs targeting farmers.
“The Trump Administration has our farmers’ backs and will ensure they have the resources they need to continue to produce the safest, most reliable, and most abundant food supply in the world,” she said.
As of last week, Georgia farmers affected by Helene have received more than $503 million from the USDA’s main disaster relief programs, according to the Georgia Department of Agriculture, with the block grants bringing the total to over $1 billion. That number could grow as the USDA disburses more money. The state has also pitched in for the relief effort, including by offering more than $300 million in emergency loans and grants.
Hard times
Agriculture groups welcomed the relief, though some stressed it comes as farmers and foresters are dealing with an especially tough economy beyond storm damage.
Cotton farmers, for example, are also dealing with new insects like the two-spot cotton leafhopper and competition from an uptick in cheap, low-quality synthetic fabrics worldwide.
Georgia’s cotton industry represents more than $1.3 billion in revenue for Georgia farmers, making it one of the state’s top crops, and it was one of the crops hit hardest by Helene. The storm caused significant damage to the state’s cotton fields last year, with UGA scientists projecting a loss of 500,000 to 600,000 bales of cotton, just under a third of the entire crop.
“We’re in a situation where we have remarkably low prices,” said Taylor Sills, executive director of the Georgia Cotton Commission. “We’re facing new insects, which is adding cost to producers in a time of low to negative return in the first place. But any assistance to support Georgia’s cotton industry is welcome news at the end of the day.”
Sills added that the response to Helene was quicker than those following previous storms.
“When you compare it to the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in 2018, it was a year and a half before Congress had even passed assistance in the wake of that storm, and here we are a year later, and all of these things have been not only passed through Congress, but been implemented,” he said. “So even though we’re in a bad situation as an industry, this assistance has come to people quicker than then.”
When Helene crossed Georgia, it blew through more than 8.9 million acres of forestland, causing an economic impact of $1.28 billion in the state, according to the UGA assessment.
Tree farmers report a tough economy, including rising costs, labor difficulties and weak markets. Since the storm, International Paper has closed mills in Savannah and Riceboro, dropping pulpwood prices further and making life more difficult for many tree farmers.
In an email alert to members Tuesday, the Georgia Forestry Association touted the latest block grants as a “significant opportunity to provide support to Georgia’s forest landowners who were devastated by this storm,” but were also pragmatic about the situation facing many members.
“Georgia’s forestry and farming families have endured one of the most challenging years in memory. Hurricane Helene left a path of devastation across our state, damaging fields, forests, and the livelihoods that depend on them. For many, the storm struck on top of already difficult conditions — high input costs, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and weakened markets — making recovery even more daunting.”

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvania enters its fourth month of budget gridlock as the only state in the country without some kind of spending plan in place for the coming year. And now, the commonwealth faces the unprecedented collision of a budget impasse with the delay or suspension of billions in federal dollars as a U.S. government shutdown looms.
“We are in uncharted waters,” said Annie Strite, mental health director for Cumberland and Perry counties. “It’s scary because we don’t know what we will need to cut. We don’t know how much revenue we’re going to have to work with.” 
Pennsylvania reported spending nearly $45 billion in federal funding in the most recent state audit for the 2024 fiscal year. 
That included about $3.6 billion in COVID-19 pandemic relief – the expiration of which already had provoked warnings from public finance experts well before lawmakers deadlocked this summer over finances in Harrisburg or Washington.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The commonwealth’s other federal funding totaled about $41 billion for the fiscal year that ended in June 2024, a Pennsylvania Capital-Star analysis shows. 
Of that, about $5.2 billion was federal pass-through money  – meaning it’s already marked for counties, school districts and other recipients. The funding isn’t subject to state discretion; however, the commonwealth must appropriate at least some of it via the state budget. 
Does that mean federal funding also stops flowing through the state during a budget stalemate? Not necessarily – at least, not all of it. 
Federal funding flow 
It’s  complicated to precisely track how much federal funding some recipients (including local government units like counties and schools) might’ve been losing out on in recent months due to the state budget impasse. 
There are a few reasons for that.  
First, the commonwealth must continue to make certain payments during a state budget impasse. 
And federal funds comprise a large share– between 30 and 42 percent annually during the last decade – of state general fund revenue, according to a Capital-Star analysis of state budget data. 
But the breakdown of state vs federal funds often isn’t clear to recipients because federal appropriations often “cannot be analyzed in isolation from state funds necessary to support a program or project,” according to state budgeting guidelines.
And there are inconsistencies in how the commonwealth handles federal funds during a state budget standoff, according to Snyder County Commissioner Joe Krantz.
“I’ve gotten a lot of mixed signals,” Krantz said. “Some people are telling us they can release federal funds. Some say they can’t. Some say they can choose what funds they can release. It’s frustrating, at best, because we just don’t know. I’ve been a commissioner long enough to remember [budget impasses] during Gov. (Ed) Rendell and Gov. (Tom) Wolf’s administrations. And there were different scenarios in each of those impasses that went on and on and on. In some of those years, federal funds were released – and in other years, they weren’t.” 
A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.

The commonwealth’s Office of the Budget outlines certain funding (such as commonwealth worker salaries and Medicare) that should continue to flow – yet the categories include some that would-be recipients say aren’t being paid as usual. Domestic violence prevention and survivor support funding, for example, is listed; however, organizations have received only one of multiple funding streams accounting for just 13 percent of revenues, according to Michael Waterloo, communications director for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence (PCADV).
Urgent needs
Federal pass-through payments tend to make up a relatively small percentage of funding for recipients (i.e., municipalities, counties and school districts rely much more on property taxes and state funding). 
As the state budget impasse wears on, smaller and smaller amounts matter more and more – especially for smaller entities or those with thin operating margins.
Nonprofit domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers are examples. They’re not counted among the “essential” services protected by rules to continue payment during a state budget impasse, according to the PCADV.
“The federal money has been allowing centers to stay open. If we didn’t have a combination (of state and federal funds) … they’d be closed already,” said Jenna Mehnert Baker, public policy director at PCADV. “We are desperate for both budgets to pass, or at least one of them.”
Federal funding pays for  specific needs, with some of them being urgent. 
For example, domestic violence survivors who need to leave home quickly rely on rapid rehousing money from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development funneled through the PCADV’s statewide network. That was $24 million last year for hundreds of households, according to Jennifer Beittel, the organization’s chief philanthropic and communications officer.

The scenario is particularly fraught in rural areas, where stretched law enforcement and health care deserts already leave programs without as much money to support survivors as might be available to agencies in more densely populated areas. 
Similarly, rural programs typically lack funding alternatives (such as larger local governments or philanthropic foundations) to assist during an impasse or federal government shutdown, Mehnert Baker said.
Pennsylvania also isn’t among the 20 states where lawmakers can use a continuing resolution to keep spending according to the past fiscal year’s budget until they agree on a new one. The federal government can do that, too. 
“It would be great if we could have that continuing resolution,” Mehnert Baker said. “We wouldn’t be in this situation.” 
Senate Republicans say their proposal from August was an attempt to do so. 
“That would have allowed state and federal funding to flow while all parties continue to discuss how to resolve our differences. The House could pass that bill at any time to prevent many of the negative consequences of the current impasse, if they so choose,” said Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) in a statement. 
Martin and his colleagues have since advanced a proposal to forgive the 4.5 percent interest on loans the state Treasury announced last week for Head Start providers and counties.

How counties compensate
Some counties  (Montgomery and Allegheny) say their federal pass-through money has been coming in as usual since the state budget impasse started. The lack of commonwealth funding is driving county leaders to act. They cut payments to contractors (Chester), furloughed workers (Northampton and Westmoreland), took on debt and missed would-be interest revenue earned on savings they’re dipping into. They’re also struggling to plan as they approach the end of their fiscal year Dec. 31. 
York County has been going without about $3 million per month in federal pass-through money (in addition to another $5.3 million of state funds) during the impasse, according to President Commissioner Julie Wheeler. 
The federal dollars cover services including lead abatement, emergency food assistance and programming for older adults. The county’s been using savings to keep them going so far – but that can’t continue indefinitely, Wheeler said.
“We’ll have to make a tough decision at some point,” Wheeler said. “Either raising taxes to cover the gap or shutting down programs. Which is something, personally, I don’t want to do.”
Cumberland County’s community mental health services block grant hasn’t been paid since the impasse began. That’s a $600,000 annual award, or about $150,000 during the past quarter of state lawmakers’ gridlock, according to Mental Health Director Annie Strite.
“So far, we can continue services,” Strite said. “But it won’t be long before we need to make some difficult decisions. Other counties are already making those cuts.” 
That first quarterly allocation should’ve happened around mid-August, but reimbursements are on hold for the 2025-26 fiscal year without a budget in place, noted Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania (CCAP).

In Berks County, leaders noted the impasse’s effect on pass-through funding – which accounts for about 5% of its revenues versus about 26.5% from the state – might not be apparent yet. 
There’s a lag of weeks, even months after funding is spent as reimbursements are processed and accounts reconciled, Berks interim Chief Financial Officer Laura Jones explained. 
Berks has been using savings to make up for funding shortages, losing an estimated $75,000 per month so far in anticipated interest revenue, according to Jones. 
Montgomery County’s in a similar situation: hanging on for now, but not without costs – which Commissioner Neil Makhija says they’re tracking closely. 
“I haven’t heard of any indication that a budget is going to be passed,” Makhija said. “This is also the most frank [communication] that I’m now starting to hear from legislators in saying that. Whereas earlier in the budget season, it was thought that there was a deal on the horizon. I think we’re all surprised and disappointed that it’s come this far.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/state-capitol-2-august-2025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 19:58:05.491807

Louisiana has issued an arrest warrant for a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Louisiana woman  (Photo illustration by Natalie Behring/Getty Images)Louisiana has issued an arrest warrant for a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Louisiana woman  — the latest legal volley in an ongoing fight between states with abortion bans and those that have enacted protections for abortion providers who use telemedicine to send abortion medication over state lines.
The existence of the arrest warrant, first reported by the Associated Press, was revealed in court documents filed earlier this month in a lawsuit that aims to push federal regulators to reinstate in-person dispensing requirements for mifepristone, rather than allowing it to be prescribed via telehealth. Mifepristone is used in combination with another drug, misoprostol, for medication abortions.
The woman, Rosalie Markezich, and Louisiana Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill are seeking to join that lawsuit. Markezich says in court filings that her boyfriend at the time ordered the drugs in October 2023 from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, using her email address.
Markezich claims her boyfriend pressured her to take the pills, and that she regrets doing so. She said she intended to throw up the pills, but was unable to. The abortion wouldn’t have happened if telehealth prescriptions were outlawed, she contends.
Murrill posted a statement on X on Monday evening calling it “dangerous, irresponsible, unethical, and illegal to distribute these pills to strangers in violation of the criminal laws of our State, without any relationship whatsoever to the individual who may ultimately be consuming them.”
“I’ll continue to pursue anyone and use any legal means available to us to hold them accountable,” Murrill wrote. “I will enforce and defend the laws of our State, including suing the governors whose shield laws purport to protect these individuals from criminal conduct in Louisiana.”
Coeytaux also is facing legal action in Texas. In July, a Texas man sued him for allegedly mailing his girlfriend abortion medication.
This year, Texas enacted a law that allows individuals to sue out-of-state providers who prescribe abortion medication to Texas residents. Louisiana also this year passed a law allowing abortion patients to sue providers.
Roughly a quarter of abortions nationwide by the end of last year were via telehealth prescriptions, according to the #WeCount report by the Society of Family Planning.
Twenty-two states, including California, have shield law protections related to reproductive health care that protect providers from out-of-state investigations and prosecution, according to the University of California, Los Angeles Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy.
Eight states, including California, have shield law provisions that extend protections to telehealth abortion prescribers who write prescriptions for patients in abortion-ban states, according to reproductive policy research organization Guttmacher.

Department of Corrections  is closing two prisons over critics’ objections,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/pa-department-of-corrections-is-closing-two-prisons-over-critics-objections/,"The process is expected to be carried out over four months, and estimates say it could save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The plan, however, drew mixed reactions from state lawmakers, unions and the communities surrounding the chosen facilities.","The Pennsylvania correctional institution at Rockview in Centre County is among four facilities recommended for closure. (Pa. Department of Corrections photo)The closing of two Pennsylvania correctional facilities, SCI-Rockview in Centre County and the Quehanna Boot Camp in Clearfield County, is moving forward despite opposition from local officials and prison staff.
The move to shutter the two prisons was proposed in February in Gov. Josh Shapiro’s 2025-2026 budget proposal, and was pitched as a cost-saving move amid declining incarceration. Now, following a final report from the state Department of Corrections, the process is expected to be carried out over four months, and estimates say it could save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.
The plan, however, drew mixed reactions from state lawmakers, unions and the communities surrounding the chosen facilities.
“As the budget continues to be negotiated the timing of this decision makes no sense,” said Michael Ohler, president of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (PSCOA). “The department is more interested in playing budget games than focusing on the safety and quality of life of our brave corrections officers and staff.”
The Department of Corrections (DOC) said the facilities were chosen based on a number of factors, including projected maintenance costs, the potential impacts to local economies and their proximity to other facilities where staff can be transferred.
All staff at the prisons will be given the opportunity to transfer to another facility within 67 miles at their same employment classification and pay rate, according to the agency.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers representing the surrounding areas issued statements opposing the plan following the final DOC report’s release.
“I am thoroughly disappointed, frustrated and angry,” Rep. Paul Takac (D-Centre), wrote. “The negative impacts of this misguided and harmful decision to close SCI Rockview and Quehanna will hit immediately, and, for many, the ripples will continue to resonate for a lifetime.”
“This decision is shortsighted and destructive, with real-world consequences for our community,” Sen. Wayne Langerholc (R-Clearfield) wrote in his own statement. “At the center of this decision are our corrections officers, men and women who put their lives on the line every day to keep violent offenders off our streets and maintain order inside our correctional facilities. By moving forward with this closure, the Shapiro Administration has abandoned these dedicated professionals, stripping them of their livelihoods and undermining the very system that relies on their courage and discipline.”
Fears over potential economic impact
The final report, put together by a steering committee convened by the DOC, outlined complaints received during a public comment period.
One common criticism was that the closures could ultimately cost taxpayers money, with the facilities still requiring maintenance and upkeep unless they can be sold to a third party.
But the Department of Corrections said closing the facilities will ultimately bring down a ballooning budget. And, with a declining incarcerated population, the move shouldn’t lead to overcrowding.
“The proposals to close SCI Rockview and Quehanna Boot Camp will provide the greatest opportunities for our staff, enable the continued care, custody and control of inmates and mitigate the worst of the economic consequences for communities that host our facilities,” the department said.

The department estimated the annual costs of running SCI-Rockview and Quehanna Boot Camp at roughly $112 million and $34 million, respectively, including personnel costs, which made up the bulk of spending.
The report also said SCI-Rockview would require around $74.3 million for maintenance over the next five years, while Quehanna could require $6.9 million over the same period if they were to stay open.
Alternatively, it placed the estimated annual costs of mothballing the facilities at nearly $1.6 million for SCI-Rockview, and $633,600 for the boot camp until the plots could be sold.
Ultimately, the report noted the closures could save nearly $100 million that could be “more expediently delivered to other facilities.”
Another issue raised was the impact the closures could have on local economies around the facilities.
The DOC’s report included an estimated economic impact from the state Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED). They found the local economy around SCI-Rockview may face losses of up to $5.8 million in annual payments to local vendors, and another $167,000 annually per employee that moves from the area. Around Quehanna, the impact may be  up to $1.1 million in losses from annual payments to vendors and around $190,000 annually per employee who moves from the area.
A letter from three Clearfield County commissioners was included in the report, warning that the closure of Quehanna Boot Camp could result in the loss of 200 to 300 jobs in the rural area.
“Urban areas have the potential to absorb the numbers because of having numerically more employers,” the letter said. “One has to apply the economics of scale to approaching situations such as this.”
Similarly, the Centre County Board of Commissioners warned of adverse impacts due to the closure of SCI-Rockview. 
“We estimate over $50.2 million in lost wages annually from the corrections industry alone,” the letter said. “These losses are also felt in the spinoff jobs created from the corrections industry.”
The DCED said SCI-Rockview employs around 658 staff, and supports around 295 additional jobs in Centre County.

Area vendors who supply the prison, its staff and their families could collectively lose around $5.8 million annually when the facility shutters.
Quehanna Bootcamp has around 234 employees and supports another 99 jobs in Clearfield County. Local vendors there could lose up to $1.1 million annually.
The facility provides low security programming for inmates with the goal of rehabilitation before reentry to society. It utilizes a unique six-month, military-style boot camp program, and is the primary facility for the State Drug Treatment Program. According to DOC, it provides inmates with physical training, work and education, as well as therapy and rehabilitative programs.
Numerous parties, including former inmates, wrote the DOC to recommend against closing it because of the opportunities it provides.
“Without hesitation, I can say that SCI Quehanna Boot Camp is an effective and essential facility,” said a respondent who claimed to be a former Quehanna Boot Camp teacher. Names and contact information were redacted from the report.
The department, however, said there is a small number of inmates who meet the requirements to enter the program. The boot camp is the lowest-security facility in Pennsylvania, and with an aging inmate population, fewer who would be allowed to transfer there meet the physical requirements for the boot camp-style training.
They said the program will also continue in another form at other facilities following Quehanna Boot Camp’s closure.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rockview-2-1024x605.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

Michelle Lujan Grisham says special legislative session is ""about protecting the people who need help most.""","The Seal of the State of New Mexico inside the Roundhouse on Jan. 10, 2024. (Photo by Anna Padilla for Source NM)While the main focus of the special New Mexico legislative session starting at noon on Oct. 1 remains the state impact from the federal budget bill, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a proclamation Tuesday for the session that includes additional topics, such as interstate medical compacts and criminal competency.
Regarding the state impact from the so-called “big beautiful bill,” a news release from the governor’s office said the session will include bills to address funding cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as public broadcasting. A few bills had been pre-filed as of late afternoon Tuesday.
“We’re not going to stand by while Washington abandons New Mexico families,” the governor said in a statement. “This special session is about protecting the people who need help most.”
Among the states, New Mexico has the highest Medicaid enrollment per capita at 42% of the state’s population, according to the state Health Care Authority’s fact sheet released in September. The HCA estimates that the state’s Medicaid program could see losses exceeding $8.5 billion over the next decade from lowering how much they pay providers.
Five things to know about Medicaid heading into New Mexico’s special session

“The cuts coming from Washington are not theoretical, they are happening now and will directly harm New Mexican families who are struggling to put food on the table or cannot afford healthcare,” Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth said in a statement.“This special session allows us to respond immediately to Washington’s dysfunction and take the first critical steps to protect our state’s progress.”
To that end, a news release listed several bills to address funding cuts and health care, including:
• amending the Rural Health Care Delivery Fund to allow for grants to health care providers and facilities in high-needs geographic health professional shortage areas and stabilize the provision of existing health care services.
• adjusting eligibility requirements for participating in the state health insurance exchange
• allowing the state health department to set vaccination standards for adults and children

“While the new federal law brings significant changes, our focus is clear: protecting benefits and services for the 40 percent of New Mexicans who rely on our programs for health care and food assistance,” Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement. “We’re committed to maintaining a strong safety net through these challenges.”
The federal budget will also cut into the state’s food assistance programs. As of August 2025, 459,535 New Mexicans use SNAP — about 21% of the state’s population, which is the highest rate in the country.
“Deep federal budget cuts and continued chaos in Washington, D. C. are making life harder and more expensive for New Mexicans now. But New Mexico’s leaders are ready for this fight, so we’re stepping up to address the most pressing issues facing families: skyrocketing healthcare premiums, seniors losing food benefits, and rural healthcare providers on the brink,” House Speaker Javier Martínez said in a statement. “This special session is about making sure families across our state have access to the things they cannot live without.”
Five things to know about federal food assistance cuts before the special session

The governor had said previously the session would not include legislation to increase the state’s participation in interstate medical compacts, which Republican lawmakers and advocacy group Think New Mexico have said would help address the shortage of health care workers in the state. State Democratic leaders, however, have resisted tackling the topic in advance of next year’s special session. A compromise, however, appears to have been reached, as the “studying and preparing for the implementation of any interstate medical licensing compact” will be on the agenda.
“We’re serious about compacts,” Chris Nordstrum, a spokesman for Senate Democrats, told Source NM Tuesday. “The full intention is to get them tackled in January, and this just gets us one step closer to being able to move quickly once we do.”
Similarly, while criminal justice topics were not expected for the session, the agenda will include a bill to amend competency laws to allow metropolitan courts to determine competency.
Other additions to the agenda, include: confirming Western New Mexico University regents; appropriating funds to the Administrative Office of the Courts for a competency pilot program and behavioral health support for parties in legal proceedings; transferring funds into the Appropriation Contingency Fund to ensure New Mexico has money set aside for emergency response; and appropriating funds to supplement the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department’s budget.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0521-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

The 104-99 vote was one of three held Tuesday to try to toughen the commonwealth’s gun laws. They highlighted the complexity of passing firearms reforms in the narrowly split House, where the divide between rural and urban interests doesn’t always follow party lines. 
Five Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in support of the background check bill, which now goes to the Republican-controlled state Senate for consideration. It is one of four gun bills quickly passed out of the House Judiciary Committee last week in the wake of high profile shootings in September. They included the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah and an ambush that killed three law enforcement officers during a shootout in York County.
A bill to create a red flag law allowing courts to temporarily ban people deemed a risk to themselves or others from possessing firearms failed by one vote – 101-102. A third measure banning undetectable ghost guns also came up short by the same margin. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Democratic leaders did not call a vote for the fourth bill, which would ban devices intended to make semi-automatic weapons fire at the same rate as automatic ones. 
As in past gun safety votes, Democratic Rep. Frank Burns, whose largely rural district covers part of Cambria County, broke ranks by voting “no” on all three gun bills. 
Democratic Reps. Jim Haddock, of Luzerne County, and Anita Kulik, who is chairperson of the House Game and Fisheries Committee, joined Burns in opposition to the background check legislation.
Republican Reps. Joe Hogan, Kathleen Tomlinson, Kristin Marcell and Craig Williams, who each represent districts in the Philadelphia suburbs, voted in favor of the bill as did Rep. Martina White, the only House Republican who represents part of Philadelphia.
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said during debate on the House floor that more gun laws would not prevent “those who are most dangerous” gaining access to firearms.
“We’ve seen it nationally and through various states … the only thing that these restrictions have led to is an infringement on the constitutional rights of Americans who own and use guns legally,” Topper said.
Rep. Aaron Bernstine (R-Lawrence) raised a question on the constitutionality of House Bill 1859, the red flag law measure, claiming it violates the state constitution’s provision that the right to bear arms “shall not be questioned.” The motion failed in a 101-102 party-line vote.
House Bill 1099 would ban firearms made entirely of non-metal materials, or not containing at least one major component made entirely of metal that can pass through metal detectors unnoticed.  “Ghost guns” are often built by amateur gunsmiths using plastic parts that skirt federal serial number regulations or are produced using 3D printers.

Rep. Tim Bonner (R-Mercer) said “ghost gun” is a sinister name for something that has been common throughout the nation’s history, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court recently held that gun laws must be considered in a historical context to determine whether they are constitutional.
“We call them ghost guns today. Our Founding Fathers and our true patriots called them homemade guns,” Bonner said.
He  added there are already federal and state laws that require all firearms to be detectable by metal detectors.
“We all want to see this violence stopped,” he said. “But recycling the same gun laws that have either been declared unconstitutional or where we already have legislation on the books to deal with it is not a solution to the problem of violence in this country.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

Fidelis Malembeka, a former Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba appointee, said after heading up Jackson’s finances for the last four years, Tuesday was his last day with the city but that he would still be around to answer questions. 
Jackson plans to announce a permanent chief financial officer appointment “very soon,” Horhn told Mississippi Today. In the meantime, to aid in the development of next year’s budget, the city has contracted with Michael Thomas of Systems Consultants Associates to create performance indicators for city departments.
“He is evaluating the financial department to see where there are greater efficiencies that can be had, and he is also looking at any possibility that a deeper dive may need to take place on a forensic audit,” Horhn said.

Thomas’s contract, which the city opted to issue without a bid, is not to exceed $50,000. The shift in financial leadership comes just after the city adopted a flat budget earlier this month — a precautionary move resulting in part from the city’s failure to maintain annual audits. 
The city is still working to complete its 2023 audit, which it was supposed to finalize last year but faced challenges in doing so due to the privatization of the city’s water system in 2022. The financial statements from the city and the water utility must be combined, but JXN Water, the third party manager, produced an audit by calendar year instead of municipal fiscal year, making the reports difficult to reconcile, Thomas said.
Thomas said the city’s goal is to finish both the 2023 and 2024 audits by next September. 
As an example of a performance indicator Systems Consultants Associates might recommend, Thomas mentioned the city’s Public Works Department. The department might be given a timeframe to complete a task — say, 24 hours from the time a pothole is identified to the time it is paved — that the department could be measured against. 
Thomas said it’s too early in his assessment to tell which departments are already effectively measured versus ones that need new benchmarks.
It’s also up to the administration to take the consultant’s recommendations. Thomas said the last time he helped the city in this capacity was during the Tony Yarber administration. He was tasked with finding efficiencies, such as with the in-house print shop — an enterprise fund that generates revenue for the city. Instead of using outside companies for the Jackson’s printing needs, Thomas said he suggests the city use its own shop. 
Public Works, a crucial yet challenged city department, has lacked a permanent leader for nearly two years now. The city council filled the vacancy Tuesday, confirming Lorenzo Anderson as the next director.
WLBT reported that Anderson most recently served as Washington County’s engineer while working for IMS Engineers – a familiar contractor to the city of Jackson – but was removed in 2024. 
This work history was not raised by council members during the confirmation, but Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes noted that he’d recently had an opportunity to check out  Anderson’s former jurisdiction.

“I had a chance to go to Washington County, to the Delta Blues festival. I presented Bobby Rush a plaque, and the roads are great,” Stokes said. 
Just after confirming Anderson, Horhn announced the city had signed on a $40 million bond issue for ditches, drainage, street and bridge repair that “might have just made Mr. Anderson’s job a little easier.”
The city is still working to fill two other major positions: the Jackson Police Department Chief after Joseph Wade stepped down in August, and director of planning and development, a position Von Anderson has held since July on an interim basis.
The city is holding listening sessions to engage the public on the search for a new police chief. As for Planning and Development, Horhn said the city is still working through applications.
“We think we need a planning and development director with more breadth and depth of experience,” he said. 
Shortly after his inauguration, Horhn announced that Grace Fisher, communications director at the Mississippi Department of Corrections, would serve as the city’s new communications director, but after the announcement, she remained at MDOC. 
The council on Tuesday confirmed Nic Lott, a government affairs consultant and former Republican gubernatorial staffer, as the director of communications and constituent services. In addition to spearheading the city’s social media, Lott will work on a committee alongside Information Technology Director Nathan Slater, also confirmed Tuesday, on rebuilding the website. 
Ward 5 Councilmember Vernon Hartley asked Lott if he would work with council members who he said have not had the opportunity to coordinate with the city’s communications department in the past. 
“I believe we should go about telling the story of what we’re doing in the city better,” Lott said.  
A staple in city and county government, Pieter Teeuwissen, was also confirmed as chief administrative officer. Stokes, the most tenured member of the council, recounted that when he left the city in 2012 for a stint on the Hinds County Board of Supervisors, he asked Teeuwissen, then city attorney, to follow him there.
“I asked him would he consider coming to Hinds County to keep us out of jail and he came to Hinds County, did a wonderful job, kept us out of jail,” Stokes said.
Speaking before her confirmation, Municipal Clerk Angela Harris said she was continuing efforts she began in 2022 to digitize the city’s files. 
While confirming Harris, two council members urged the mayor to look at bringing the city clerk’s office back under the council, where it resided before the Lumumba administration moved it under the mayor.
“We have that under review. We have just been dealing with crisis management since we started here 12 weeks ago and as things settle down, we’ll get into the reorganization that we’ve been talking about,” Horhn responded.
During the confirmation of City Attorney Drew Martin, Hartley recommended taking more frequent legal action to hold parties accountable for the poor conditions, such as blight, that Jacksonians are experiencing. He implored the legal staff to find more ways “to make sure that we have our knife sharpened when it comes to these issues affecting our quality of life,” Hartley said.

“We hear the complaints, we hear the issues, and a lot of times there is a legal remedy, and I’d like for us to be a little bit more nimble, a little but more flexible in applying it so we can get some results so we can’t tell the folks that there’s nothing we can do,” Hartley said.
When it came time to confirm Director of Human Resources Toya Martin, a Lumumba holdover, Ward 4 Councilman Brian Grizzell said he was “completely against” the nomination and said he had drafted a resolution for a vote of no confidence in the director he may introduce later. Martin was confirmed by a 5-2 vote.
The council also confirmed six municipal court judges, Taurean Buchanan, Kevin Bass, Lilli Bass, June Hardwick, Jeffrey Reynolds and Virginia Watkins.
The following cabinet appointments by Horhn were confirmed Tuesday:

Chief Administrative Officer Pieter Teeuwissen
Fire Chief RaSean Thomas
Director of Human and Cultural Services Pamela Junior
Information Technology Director Nathan Slater
Director of Communications and Constituent Services Nic Lott
Municipal Clerk Angela Harris
Director of Human Resources Toya Martin

It will rise 2.8% to $17.13 per hour, starting Jan. 1, the state Department of Labor and Industries announced Tuesday. The current $16.66 per-hour wage already leads the nation, though California and parts of New York are close at $16.50. The federal minimum wage is set at $7.25. 
The cities of Seattle, Bellingham, Burien, Everett, Renton, SeaTac and Tukwila all set minimum wages higher than the state. As does unincorporated King County. Advocates in Lynnwood are looking to join that list, as they gather support for a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage to $20.24 per hour there.
The annual statewide minimum wage increase is calculated based on inflation. California’s minimum wage, by comparison, will jump slightly to $16.90 in 2026. 
The state is also upping the threshold for exempting salaried workers from overtime pay. 
In 2026, Washington employers will need to pay overtime exempt workers at least 2.25 times the minimum wage, totaling $80,168 per year. It’s a big jump from this year, as the tipping point for small employers is $69,305 and $77,969 for bigger employers. In 2028, the figure is set to rise to $93,392 and 2.5 times the minimum wage for all businesses.
Workers aged 14- and 15-years-old are allowed to make 85% of minimum wage, so their rate will be $14.56 per hour in 2026. 
Minimum wage for ride-booking drivers, for services like Lyft and Uber, is also increasing. For trips in Seattle next year, drivers with passengers will earn 70 cents per minute and $1.63 per mile, or $6.12, whichever is greater. Trips outside Seattle will earn drivers 40 cents per minute and $1.38 per mile, with a minimum of $3.55.
This year, state lawmakers considered accelerating increases to Washington’s minimum wage, to $25 in 2031. The legislation didn’t advance in the Legislature, but could return in the 2026 session that begins in January.

Circuit Judge Daniel Green, in his second ruling on the ballot description of the measure proposed by lawmakers, said that Hoskins got most of the language right.
But Hoskins’ language on the portion that will be the issue the question turns on — repealing the abortion rights protections approved by voters last year —  is “insufficient and unfair” and must be revised, Green ruled.
Hoskins rewrote the ballot language prepared by Republican lawmakers after Green ruled it, also, did not alert voters that it would repeal the voter-approved amendment.
The measure would repeal the citizen-led initiative passed in 2024 that made Missouri the first state to overturn an abortion ban by guaranteeing the constitutional right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability. 
On Wednesday, Green ruled that Hoskins also missed the mark by failing to inform voters of the repeal, taking issue with just one bullet point in Hoskins’ summary that reads: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:  

Amend Article I, section 36, approved in 2024; allowing abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;”

This summary “fails to adequately alert voters that the proposed constitutional amendment would abrogate Article 1, Section 36 of the Missouri Constitution, which voters recently approved,” Green wrote. 
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s Office in briefings submitted Monday said Hoskins’ latest language was sufficient because it stated the new amendment would cause a “modification” of state statute and that repeal language would be inaccurate because the new amendment “does not abolish all the constitutional rights first enshrined in Article I, section 36,” including the right to miscarriage care.
For example, the attorney general wrote, the new amendment “recognizes a right to abortion in some cases, and such a right was unprecedented in the Missouri Constitution before the voters enacted Article I, section 36 in 2024.” 
Prior to the passage of the abortion rights amendment, nearly all abortions were illegal in Missouri, with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Attorneys with The ACLU of Missouri and Stinson Law in briefings Monday said Hoskins’ new language “at best, pays lip service” to Green’s order but “does not describe the probable effects of the measure.”
Hoskins is obligated, they argued, “to tell voters that they are being asked to repeal, not merely amend, the right to reproductive freedom.”
Jefferson City attorney Chuck Hatfield, in his filing, also took issue with the use of a semi-colon in the statement, saying it contributes to the “grammatical nonsense” of the language sure to leave voters confused.
Green on Tuesday ruled that the remaining bullet points are now acceptable. They read: 
“Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:

Guarantee women’s medical care for emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
and Prohibit sex-change procedures for children?”

Under a law passed this year and upheld in a separate case by Green, Hoskins has five days to submit revised ballot language to the court. If after that, Green decides the language still doesn’t follow the law, Hoskins has one more opportunity to rewrite it. If Green still doesn’t find the language satisfactory, the judge will rewrite it himself. 
Hoskins was also responsible for writing the fair ballot statement that appears in polling places and on the office’s website that summarize what both a “yes” and “no” vote mean.
Campaign gears up to defeat Missouri abortion ban amendment

Green previously told Hoskins to rewrite the “fair ballot language” summary posted to the secretary of state’s website, calling the old language misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases.  
In his ruling Tuesday, Green deemed the new summary was sufficient. 
This approved summary states that a “yes” vote would guarantee women’s medical care under specific scenarios, including ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages and allow abortions in the first 12 weeks festation in cases of rape or incest. It would also ban gender-affirming health care for minors.   
A “no” vote, Hoskins wrote, would “limit abortion” to specific scenarios.
As the one-year anniversary of the abortion rights amendment approaches, access to the procedure in Missouri remains limited as legal battles challenging a series of abortion regulations play out in the courts.
Medication abortions remain halted. Procedural abortions are available on a limited basis at Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis.

Since the August decision, more than 215 households have appealed their emergency housing cases to the Human Services Board, according to the board’s chief hearing officer.

A citizen panel’s decision, which challenged the state’s view of the motel program’s 80-day limit and caused a rush of appeals, will stand for now after a Vermont Supreme Court order last week. 
The order is part of an ongoing case examining how the limit is enforced, and will likely allow many vulnerable households to remain sheltered, or regain access to housing for the time being, advocates said.
The state’s motel voucher program, which has constricted throughout the last two years despite increases in unsheltered homelessness, provides temporary housing for people without other financial resources who are in particularly vulnerable situations.

The Human Services Board concluded last month that the state’s Department for Children and Families had incorrectly enforced the motel program’s 80-day limit for a petitioner referred to as “H.D.” The central point of contention was whether the department could consider a participant’s use of the program in the previous fiscal year — before July 1, 2025 — when reviewing their application. 
The department, which believes that a “rolling,” or retrospective, calendar is the correct approach by law, appealed the decision to the Vermont Supreme Court in a case that is still pending. 
Since the August decision, more than 215 households have appealed their emergency housing cases to the Human Services Board, in addition to “numerous” cases which were already pending, according to the board’s chief hearing officer Joe Reinert. While the Department for Children and Families claimed the board’s decision would result in an unlawful use of taxpayer money, advocates said the state budget supports the board’s interpretation, which would provide important respite to people in need.
In last week’s order, the Supreme Court declined to suspend the Human Services Board’s decision as these hearings move forward. Both sides of the argument are “rooted in conceivable analyses,” read the court’s decision, and therefore the state “has not met its burden” for its motion to be granted.
This allows the board to continue using its previous decision as an informal precedent, according to Vermont Legal Aid staff attorney Maryellen Griffin. So far, her organization’s clients under similar circumstances to “H.D.” have had positive initial rulings. Many have been granted “benefits pending appeal,” allowing medically vulnerable people and children back indoors while their case is decided, Griffin said.
“We are definitely having trouble keeping up with demand,” Griffin said, adding that eligible people can also appeal their denial themselves when possible.
DCF officials declined to comment, but the state’s Sept. 9 motion, filed by the Attorney General’s office, said that the board’s decision would allow taxpayer dollars to be “misspent,” and cause confusion in the administration of the program.
“The Hearing Officers overseeing HSB cases have continued to overturn DCF decisions related to the interpretation of the 80-day cap,” read the motion, adding that the board’s decision last month “fundamentally contravenes law.”
In addition to incurring added costs of up to $2.1 million, the department estimated, the decision would likely cause the motel program to become full too quickly. Advocates have countered that the program appears to be well below its 1,100-room maximum as of Sept. 29.
“They have the resources,” said End Homelessness Vermont Executive Director Brenda Siegel, adding that the department’s motion “would have caused a lot of harm.”
Siegel said her organization was representing roughly 60 people who had been denied benefits, with “more coming every day.” In some cases, given their age or medical circumstances, Siegel said she would fear for the lives of her clients were they forced to remain outside.
The end of Gov. Phil Scott’s executive order extending motel stays for certain medically vulnerable people and households with children forced hundreds to leave shelter on July 1. 
“These were all highly medically vulnerable people, or children or people who were pregnant,” Siegel said.
Griffin said she had recently been representing a family of six in their appeal to the Human Services Board. Both parents work, she said, and are raising four children while trying to locate more stable housing.
“I just don’t know how they could do that without having a safe place to stay,” Griffin said. The ability to access benefits, even during the period where the family’s case is being processed, could be crucial, she said.
“It seems that we’ve lost sight of what the purpose of this (program) is,” Siegel said, “which is to help human beings to be safe and be sheltered.”

Mississippi is one of the poorest and most federally dependent states, and President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” includes the largest spending reductions to Medicaid and food assistance in history. Even sectors that don’t face direct cuts from the law, such as child care, will be heavily impacted by shifts in state budgets, experts say. 
Women stand to lose the most from these changes, with effects on children, families, communities and businesses.

Changes to Medicaid disproportionately impact women, not only because women participate more often in the program – due to the wage gap and life events such as childbirth – but also because they are more often caregivers to those on Medicaid. Women are also the bulk of rural health care workers who could be impacted by hospital closures. 
Those trends are even clearer in Mississippi, where nearly two-thirds of births are funded by Medicaid. That’s the second highest in the country. 
While the law doesn’t change eligibility criteria for pregnant women, the spending cuts will trigger downsizing of many rural hospitals – and labor and delivery units are often the first to go when hospital budgets shrink. 
Women in rural areas already have too few options for giving birth. Half of Mississippi’s counties are maternity care deserts, and the state Health Department recently declared a public health emergency for the state’s infant mortality rate – the highest in the nation.

Many of the law’s provisions will disproportionately harm women, including pregnant patients, and children – even though it was touted as “family friendly,” said Megan Cole Brahim, a health policy researcher at Boston University. 
“It makes it more difficult for eligible people to remain enrolled through more administrative burdens,” Cole Brahim said. “And secondly, it ultimately cuts funding available to states and forces states to make difficult decisions about who it will cover and what it will cover. It impacts the entire health care ecosystem.”
Fewer Mississippians will lose coverage than people in other states, but experts say that’s not a win. The main group losing coverage in other states are those Mississippi already doesn’t insure because it is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid to the working poor.

“The coverage losses will primarily be felt by those adults covered by Medicaid expansion – folks who are already shut out of coverage in a state like Mississippi that has not picked up expansion,” said Joan Alker, a Medicaid expert at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families. 
Despite having among the strictest income requirements for Medicaid in the nation, Mississippi has one of the highest rates of Medicaid enrollees – a fact that reflects the number of poor people in the state. 
To qualify for Medicaid, able-bodied adults in Mississippi must make less than 28% of the federal poverty level, a mere $7,000 annually for a family of three. 
More than a quarter of child care workers nationwide are on Medicaid, and losing coverage or access to services may weaken the already tenuous child care workforce, speakers said Tuesday at the Capitol during a hearing hosted by the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus.

“The law’s cuts to Medicaid will hit the child care workforce particularly hard, and that is going to have major ripple effects,” said Ruth Friedman, who was director of the Office of Child Care in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the Biden administration.
“Its unprecedented cuts to health insurance and food assistance and the mandates it places on states is going to make the child care crisis much worse for millions of families,” she said.
Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will be one of the most significant impacts to Mississippi’s budget, said Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center.
“This law forces states for the first time to pay for SNAP benefits, which will shift billions of dollars in costs to states,” Lau said.
It will also expand work reporting requirements for the food assistance program, which Lau said kicks many eligible families off the program, especially in states like Mississippi, where many people live in rural areas without consistent internet access.

Caregiving responsibilities in the home fall primarily to women – not to mention 95% of child care workers nationwide are women. 
Women also make up more than 80% of people working in rural hospitals who would be laid off as the facilities close under budget cuts. 
The cuts to Medicaid will also affect nursing homes and residents. In a national survey this year, more than half of nursing homes said they would have to reduce staff under Medicaid cuts. 
Cutting staff in an industry where 99% of facilities already don’t meet staffing requirements will have drastic repercussions on those served by and employed in nursing homes – both predominantly female.

Conversation around the federal spending law signed by Trump highlights a major partisan rift. Both parties centralize their arguments around the concept of family, with Republicans capitalizing on rhetoric about “tax breaks for working families” and Democrats capitalizing on rhetoric about protecting the most vulnerable. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, who voted against the federal spending cuts, spoke to the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus over video conference Tuesday and quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)The Bank of North Dakota is working on a new loan assistance program for farmers in response to tough financial conditions facing the industry.
Don Morgan, president of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota, said the state’s agricultural industry has been hit hard by a combination of low commodity prices, a sustained period of high interest rates and inflation. 
“We believe we have an extreme stress situation coming up in our agricultural sector for 2026,” Morgan told the North Dakota Industrial Commission on Tuesday. 
The Bank of North Dakota is preparing a new relief program for farmers and ranchers modeled after a 2019 program that worked very well, Morgan said. 
“It allowed our banks and credit unions to restructure some agricultural debt at some below-market rates,” Morgan said. 
Federal trade, health policies add to concerns for North Dakota farmers, state ag commissioner says

The details of the program have yet to be determined. Morgan will return to the Industrial Commission in November or December, he said, with a finished product for the board’s approval “so that we could roll out for the 2026 ag renewal season,” he said. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, urged bank officials to keep in mind that there is discussion in Washington, D.C., about a federal relief program for farmers this year, though he noted the exact timing may change. 
“My concern is not knowing what the federal government is going to do,” Armstrong said. 
The other factor to keep in mind, Armstrong said, is there will likely be a special session of the North Dakota Legislature at the start of 2026. If the Bank of North Dakota is rolling out a loan assistance program at the same time, the governor said it will likely be a topic of discussion for lawmakers. 
Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring, Armstrong’s colleague on the Industrial Commission, suggested the Legislature could consider additional aid for farmers if the state-owned bank’s program is insufficient. 
Morgan said it’s important to get the relief program rolled out with time to spare before banks begin working with farmers to renew agricultural loans this winter, even if the Legislature decides to provide additional assistance after the program is implemented.
“The banks do need some time to prepare because most of the ag renewals come in February, March, April, May,” Morgan said.

A Manchester woman arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents was granted a request to be released on bond at a Detroit Immigration Court hearing Tuesday morning.
Davona Williams, 42, was held at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility after her arrest on Aug. 25. Williams was transferred to North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, a week later, where she is currently detained. Originally from the island nation of Jamaica, Williams had been living with her three children and partner in Manchester, Vermont. Williams had resided in the U.S. for nearly two decades, and was engaged in a yearslong process to gain legal status. 
Detroit Immigration Court Judge Mark J. Jebson ruled that Williams was not a flight risk and posed no danger to the community, according to Williams’ attorney Christopher Worth, a Vermont Law and Graduate School visiting professor who is representing her pro bono through the school’s Center for Justice Reform. At the Tuesday hearing, Jebson awarded the request to release Williams from ICE custody on $7,500 bond, Worth said. 
Rutland Area NAACP President Mia Schultz organized a group to show support for Williams by appearing at the virtual hearing, but said they could not join in because the mass attendance bogged down the online systems. 
Despite the technical difficulties, Schultz said the show of support proved positive for the outcome of the hearing. The immigration judge noted the number of people attempting to join Tuesday’s hearing as evidence of Williams’ strong community ties before granting the release request, Worth said.
Once Williams returns to Vermont, Worth said the Center for Justice Reform will file a motion to move the case to Chelmsford Immigration Court in Massachusetts and continue seeking legal relief to prevent deportation. 
Schultz said the next step is to fundraise through GoFundMe and pool community resources to post bond and pay for Williams’ transportation back to Vermont.
“There’s still things to address, but the biggest hurdle was getting her home to be back with her children,” Schultz said. “She gets to come home.”

“While I am leaving this office today, I am not leaving the fight,” Walters wrote in his resignation letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained. “The challenges before us remain significant, but the opportunities are even greater. My commitment to serve this state and its people is as strong as ever, and I will continue to seek ways to advance the principles of freedom, accountability, and excellence in the days ahead.”
Walters announced last week his intentions to resign to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, an anti-teacher-union nonprofit. His resignation letter states his final day in office is Tuesday. He is expected to step into his new role Wednesday.
Walters, a Republican, has not disclosed whether he intends to run for elected office in the future. He would have been eligible for another four-year term as state superintendent had he won reelection.
All eyes now turn to Stitt to decide who will finish the remaining 15 months of Walters’ four-year term. The appointee will lead the Oklahoma State Department of Education and chair the Oklahoma State Board of Education until January 2027.

Stitt said last week he will seek a “leader who is fully focused on the job Oklahomans expect: delivering real outcomes and driving a turnaround in our education system.” 
After Walters delivered his resignation letter, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office said there would be no announcement of an appointee on Tuesday.
Walters addressed his resignation letter to Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton. 
He credited his administration at the Education Department as having “advanced reforms many believed could never be achieved,” including empowering parents, demanding transparency in public schools and expanding school choice options.
He closed his letter by thanking his family, the people of Oklahoma, and public school educators and families.
“I leave this position with gratitude, optimism, and confidence that Oklahoma’s best days are still to come,” he wrote.

(Photo by Barbra Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma’s Public Safety Commissioner vowed Tuesday to continue the crackdown on commercial truck drivers passing through the state without legal status.
“Moving forward, we’ll continue with these types of operations because our desire is to make sure that every Oklahoman is safe,” said Public Safety Commissioner Tim Tipton. 
During a three-day operation last week conducted in conjunction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 120 people were arrested for immigration violations, Tipton said.
Troopers made 520 contacts at the port of entry along eastbound Interstate 40 in Beckham County during the enforcement blitz, dubbed Operation Guardian, Tipton said.
About 25% of the people were not in the country legally, Tipton said.
“Approximately 90% of those illegal aliens were commercial motor vehicle drivers,” Tipton said.
Those arrested came from several countries, and all had crossed the southern U.S. border, Tipton said.
Some had reentered illegally after being deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said.
Several had final deportation orders in place and had not responded, he said.
Others had made an undetected border crossing, he said. The list of those arrested also included people who had overstayed their visas, Tipton said.
Some had prior criminal histories that included charges for money laundering, assault, driving under the influence, assault, human smuggling and drug trafficking, he said.
“Everybody was taken into custody without any resistance,” Tipton said.
Those arrested were taken to ICE offices in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, before being moved to holding facilities in Oklahoma and or Texas, Tipton said.
The vehicles the individuals were driving were impounded, he said.
“The owner of the trucking company can go to that yard and recover the truck,” Tipton said.
On Monday, Gov. Kevin Stitt said one driver had been issued a New York commercial driver’s license  that listed “No Name Given” as the name.
The New York Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement Tuesday that the license was issued in accordance with all proper procedures, including verification of the individual’s identity through federally issued documentation.
“The individual has lawful status in the United States through a federal employment authorization and was issued a license consistent with federal guidelines,” according to the statement.
“It is not uncommon for individuals from other countries to have only one name.”
Tipton said under new federal guidelines, he doesn’t believe New York will be able to continue that licensing practice.
The blitz involved 20 troopers, employees from ICE, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma lawmakers Tuesday probed why Oklahoma consumers face the highest insurance rates in the nation and what steps they can take to mitigate those soaring costs.
The bipartisan legislative interim study is expected to be the first of two interim studies, digging into why Oklahomans have seen their homeowner’s insurance premiums top $6,100 annually, more than double the national average. Lawmakers often use interim studies to help craft legislation on issues. 
The high insurance costs hurt everyone, said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, who led the study. Homeowners lose protection, insurance agents lose business and home ownership is harder to attain, he said. 
Fugate said he wants to find a way to keep homeowner’s insurance affordable, fair and reliable for Oklahoma families without cutting coverage. 
“I’m a big believer in trying to identify a problem in a way that helps other people get on board,” he said. “And it’s great that we have a number of experts who are going to be here today, not the least of which is our (Insurance) Commissioner, to help us kind of dig in and navigate what’s driving the cost and what we might do to mitigate.” 
Glen Mulready, Oklahoma’s insurance commissioner, told lawmakers Tuesday that rising homeowner’s insurance costs are not just an Oklahoma problem but a national one. 
“When we come together as insurance commissioners from around the country, that is what we are talking about,” Mulready said. “The property insurance problem, specifically homeowners, because it touches so many people, and everybody is dealing with it.”
Severe weather, like Oklahoma’s March wildfires and over 100 tornadoes this year, are part of the reason insurance costs have increased, he said. Every state has different “perils,” like hurricanes or other severe weather events, it has to attempt to mitigate with insurance costs, Mulready said. 
But Oklahoma Watch reported that data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did not show significant differences in severe weather events between Oklahoma and neighboring states, which have lower insurance costs. 
On average, Americans spend 2.4% of their annual income on homeowner’s insurance, but Oklahomans spend over 6.8%, according to Oklahoma Watch. Residents in Arkansas and Texas spend over 4% while Kansans spend 5.5%. 
Mulready said Oklahoma’s insurance industry is a competitive marketplace. 
Oklahoma’s insurance marketplace has maintained an Herfindahl-Hirschman Index score below 1,200 since at least 2020. A score under 1,500 on the index, which measures competitiveness and compares the size of companies relative to the size of the industry, is indicative of a competitive market, he said. 
Oklahoma’s insurance market is a “use and file” state, meaning insurers can immediately use new rates but must file them with the Oklahoma Insurance Department within 30 days.  
Other states require prior approval when new rates are filed and must be approved by the state before they’re used or “file and use,” meaning new rates can be immediately implemented while the state reviews them. 
For Oklahoma to change the way its homeowner’s insurance rates are regulated, lawmakers would have to approve statutory changes, Mulready said. 
He said neighboring states like Texas, which is a “file and use state,” does not have a less competitive market because of its process. 
Heather Morton of the National Conference of State Legislatures said other states have begun proposing policies to mitigate rising costs, like state-run insurance plans, disaster relief savings accounts or programs and tax credits to help homeowners fortify their homes. 
Oklahoma has already launched a program, Strengthen Oklahoma Homes, to provide grants to some Oklahoma residents for wind and hail mitigation on their homes. 
Ward Tisdale, a regional vice president of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, said pressures on the insurance industry, like severe weather from climate change, inflation, regulatory challenges and “legal system abuse,” have contributed to rising costs. The association works to continue education for insurance industry professionals and advocate on their behalf. 
The U.S. has experienced over $123 billion in “severe convective storm losses” in 2023-24, Tisdale said. In comparison, the two most costly hurricane seasons in U.S. history were in 2004-05 at $182 billion. 
Rep. Preston Stinson, R-Edmond, led the study along with Fugate, but was not present Tuesday. He said in a statement that he believes the Oklahoma Insurance Department is doing the best it can within statute, he wants to explore changes that can bring Oklahoma’s rates closer to neighboring states. 
“While the immediate impact of these increases is on home ownership affordability, the ripple effects extend much further,” he said. “Higher insurance costs make it harder to recruit and retain merchant businesses. They add financial pressures that can lead to food insecurity, divert health care and even contribute to domestic violence.”

(Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — Dawn Wheeler, a small business owner in Edwardsville, receives treatment for her metastatic breast cancer almost weekly.
One shot, which she gets every other week to treat cancer in her liver, costs around $10,000, she said.
“That doesn’t include all the doctor visits, all the regular testing I have to have, two other chemo pills I have to have, all of which I would not be able to afford if I did not have the ACA,” Wheeler said Tuesday during a virtual press call organized by U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat.
Wheeler is one of more than 187,000 Kansans who rely on Affordable Care Act premium tax credits to subsidize health care costs, but those credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and advocates are warning of lost coverage and a more than 75% spike in premium costs as they wait for lawmakers to decide the credits’ fate.
Unless Congress extends the tax credits, health care costs for the more than 22 million Americans who have health insurance through the ACA Marketplace are expected to increase, and community hospitals could bear the burden of uncompensated care. In Kansas, the vast majority of the more than 200,000 people enrolled in the marketplace receive premium tax credits, according to data from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research and news organization.
Cindy Samuelson, senior vice president of member and public relations for the Kansas Hospital Association, said on the call that hospitals have made it clear that premium tax credits have played a key role in reducing the number of uninsured patients in Kansas and across the country.
On average, enrollees’ annual premium costs could increase by an estimated $700, or 77%, if the tax credits are not extended. Samuelson said. Projections from KFF estimate that between 48,000 and 61,000 Kansans could lose coverage because of higher premium costs over the next decade. An estimate from the Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund projects 108,000 Kansans losing coverage over the same time frame.
“The reality is, when someone doesn’t have health insurance, we know that they are more likely to stop taking care of themselves,” Samuelson said.
People are more likely to halt preventative health care services, and people with chronic conditions are more likely to delay health care, waiting until their health worsens and they end up in an emergency room, which is often the most expensive kind of care, Samuelson said.
Wheeler, who owns a health screening business with her husband, said she doesn’t know what they would do without ACA coverage.
“I honestly don’t think I’d be alive,” she said. “I know we wouldn’t have a house anymore. That’s the reality of it.”
Davids said she supports a permanent extension to the tax credits. In her district, which represents 4½ counties in and around the Kansas City area, she said a family of four could see a $7,000 increase in their premiums. A 60-year-old couple could see a nearly $17,000 increase, she said.
“If we don’t act, the ripple effect of this increase will be devastating,” Davids said.
She said she is willing to work with either party to pass a feasible extension.
“We are also staring down another challenge that, unfortunately, we’ve become too familiar with, which is a potential government shutdown,” Davids said.
Congress has until midnight Tuesday to avoid a government shutdown, which could impact Kansas’ nearly 20,000 federal employees and active-duty service members, as well as access to federal services.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250930_wheeler.png,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

(Photo: AdobeStock)Anti-hunger advocates highlighted a new report Tuesday showing how rising food costs are straining families in North Carolina and across the country. Non-profit group No Kid Hungry said its research shows how vital free and reduced-price school meals are as students settle into the fall semester. 
The 2025 Back to School Report, released earlier this month, surveyed more than 1,200 parents and caregivers whose children rely on school meals. It found that 41% of parents said their financial situation is worse than a year ago, while nearly 70% said inflation has made it harder to buy the groceries they need.
“We wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the hopes and concerns of parents and caregivers about the upcoming school year, and to better understand the vital role that school meals play for kids and families, both inside and outside of the classroom,” said Corey Filiault, who oversaw the research.
In North Carolina, close to 60% of students in traditional public schools qualify for free or reduced-price school meals. With many households juggling rent, utilities and transportation costs alongside food, advocates say federal nutrition programs provide critical stability.
A mother of five from North Carolina told researchers that soaring grocery and gas prices forced her to cut back on essentials. “It’s just certain things that we really cut back on doing. You just gotta know what you can actually go without and still be okay,” she said in the report. 
Nationally, more than one in three parents said they worried about running out of food over the summer, when school cafeterias are closed. Two out of three parents expect food prices to rise further this year.
The report also found that 83% of parents said their children struggle to concentrate when hungry, and 88% said school meals help them do better in school. Beyond the classroom, two out of three parents said school meals reduce family stress, easing household finances and improving overall well-being.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_hunger-school-lunch.jpg,,,2025-09-30 18:58:33.661892

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Two former lawyers within the state’s Office of Attorney General are officially vying to replace Peter Neronha as Rhode Island’s next top prosecutor when his term ends next year, with at least one more Democrat eyeing a 2026 run. 
And the state’s current Democratic AG already has made his choice for a successor.
Stopping near the Providence pedestrian bridge Tuesday for the campaign kickoff of one of those candidates Tuesday afternoon, Neronha outlined the stakes of being an AG in today’s political climate. To serve Rhode Islanders, he said the office needs to be “active and aggressive” in areas like health care and the environment in addition to enforcing public safety.
“There is one person who I believe that is suited to become our next attorney general and he is right behind me,” he said. “There is no doubt in my mind that Keith Hoffmann is that person.”
Hoffmann, 38, a resident of Providence’s East Side, most recently served as the chief of policy and senior counsel for Neronha’s office after working as the head of the AG’s civil rights unit. He left his job in August when he filed papers to make his first run for elected office.
“I stood up for children who were being lead poisoned in their homes, I worked with police chiefs and police departments on civil rights and hate crime initiatives, I enforced fair housing laws, and I helped to pass important public health and and public safety and anti-corruption laws,” Hoffmann told the crowd of over two dozen supporters.
Hoffmann’s campaign kickoff came a day after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, announced his bid for the office in a two-minute video. 
Craven, now in private practice, served as an assistant attorney general from 1983 to 1992 under three attorneys general, including a stint as chief of the office’s Public Corruption Unit.
“I’ve spent my life in front of juries as a lawmaker and state prosecutor fighting for what’s right to protect Rhode Islanders,” Craven said in his announcement video. “Now I want to put that experience to work for you as Rhode Island’s next attorney general.”
Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat who served as a special assistant attorney general from 2006 to 2010, is also said to be weighing a run for AG. He told Rhode Island Current Monday he has “a campaign event” scheduled in Warren on Monday, Oct. 6.
Knight said he was also aware of his potential opponents’ announcements.
“We’ll have something to say on that point next week,” he said in an interview with Rhode Island Current Monday afternoon.
Article IV of the Rhode Island Constitution limits all five state general office holders to two four-year terms. Neronha was first elected in 2018 with the support of 79.8% of voters; he was reelected in 2022 with 61.5% of the vote.
Hoffmann may be entering the race with the attorney general’s support, but his opponents already have established campaign accounts. 
Craven reported a balance of $320,617 and expects to have more than $360,000 on hand when the next filings are due Oct. 30. Knight had $90,419 as of Sept. 30. 
Hoffmann does not yet have a balance listed with the Board of Elections, but told Rhode Island Current his campaign will likely make an announcement within the next week.
In introducing himself at his 20-minute campaign event, Hoffmann said he was born at Newport Hospital in the same birthing center Brown University Health nearly closed this year “because of budget cuts.” He said he grew up in Portsmouth and now resides in Providence
His mother Robin Hoffmann was a professor of criminal justice and criminology at Salve Regina University for more than 30 years. His late father, Bill, a Vietnam War veteran and doctor, who died of cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure when Hoffman was 13.
“I learned from my parents not only the importance of perseverance and the value of public service, but the strength of our community when it comes together,” he said.
Hoffmann said being a public servant has always been his goal since attending college at the University of Pennsylvania and Fordham University Law School in New York.
“That’s all I wanted to do,” he said. “This is my home, and I want to fight for it, and I want to stand up for you.”
‘Point person’
Craven in his kickoff video has vowed to take on the Trump administration and protect Rhode Islanders during what he described as “unprecedented times.”
“As the Trump administration escalates its attacks on Rhode Island — gutting health care, slashing school funding, ending clean energy programs, killing jobs, seizing people on our streets, defying the law — we need an attorney general who is tested, with the guts to fight and the experience to win,” Craven said in a statement on his campaign website.
But Neronha believes his most recent right-hand man is best suited for the task. He described Hoffman as his “point person” on everything he thought was important.
“He’s been there when we’ve made decisions — sometimes hard decisions — to take on the powerful interests that hurt Rhode Islanders, including Donald Trump,” Neronha said.
As Hoffman tells it, he and Neronha were strategizing on how to tackle a second Trump term as early as last summer.
“The impact could be devastating for Rhode Islanders — to our budgets, to our green energy projects, to our rights  and our public institutions — and we would have to be prepared to fight,” he said.
And not long after Trump took office, the federal government announced its first funding freeze and Hoffman said he was up late to draft the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island in Providence
“Within about a day, we had an injunction from the court preventing that illegal, unconstitutional policy from taking effect,” Hoffmann said.

(Photo courtesy of Des Moines Public Schools)Des Moines Public Schools superintendent Ian Roberts has resigned from his position effective immediately, lawyers representing him said Tuesday.
Roberts, who was detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement Friday, had been placed on unpaid administrative leave by the Des Moines School Board Monday after the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his license. ICE agents had arrested the superintendent, who was born in Guyana, during a “targeted enforcement operation” Friday, and he allegedly evaded arrest. According to an ICE news release, Roberts’ vehicle contained a handgun, hunting knife and $3,000 in cash.
ICE stated Roberts had been given a “final order of removal by an immigration judge” in May 2024. The federal agency stated Roberts was in the country unlawfully, having first come to the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Attorney Alfredo Parrish, representing Roberts, confirmed that Roberts was a citizen of Guyana and served in the country’s military, but said his office was trying to work on getting more information on the immigration case proceedings that led to his arrest by ICE. In April 2025, a Texas immigration judge had decided not to reopen Roberts’ case in absentia.
Parrish said Roberts had received a letter from the prior attorney for his immigration case in Texas which said “his case had been closed successfully, and he was under the impression that it had been.” Parrish said his firm is in the process of filing a motion to reopen Roberts’ immigration case.
The attorney said it was a “complex case.”
“There are several jurisdictions that are involved, there are several law enforcement entities that are involved,” Parrish said. “… There (are) so many entities involved that we have touched bases with to try to work through this, through the consulate in New York for Guyana, through all the many other entities we’ve been trying to work through this case with. We want you to know that Dr. Roberts’ greatest concern is about his students who he actually loves, and the students who love him back, and his staff.”
While Roberts is resigning from the superintendent position, Parrish said his law firm has filed a request for stay on behalf of Roberts in the Omaha, Nebraska, federal immigration court. Roberts is currently being held at the Woodbury County Jail in Sioux City. Parrish said two of his staff drove to Omaha to file the motion Monday, and that earlier Tuesday, the law firm was in communication with Roberts.
“He understands that he has the support (of the community), and it really gives him inspiration,” Parrish said. “His spirits are high. He was very well-engaged in all our discussions this morning, for about the last two hours.”
District’s hiring procedures questioned
Some of the questions surrounding the case are focused on the Des Moines school district’s vetting process for hiring Roberts. DMPS officials have said Roberts completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted the required documentation showing his employment eligibility when hired.
The National School Board Coalition, a conservative K-12 advocacy organization, claimed in a news release the consultant Baker-Eubanks, one of the entities hired by DMPS to perform third-party background checks during Roberts’ hiring process, “admitted that it did not perform a basic I-9 verification.”
This claim is referring to a statement made by Baker-Eubanks CEO Kim Cockerham to the Des Moines Register. Cockerham said the criminal background check performed does not confirm a person’s ability to legally work in the U.S., saying “that’s not even a service that we offer.” Cockerham said, according to the Register.
Laura Zorc, chair of the National School Board Coalition, said Roberts’ hiring process “reveals a critical oversight” in schools boards hiring search firms to fill school administration positions.
“If advising the Des Moines school board, NSBC would recommend working with their board attorney to review their contract agreement with consultants JQ Consultants and Baker-Eubanks for potential recourse, including seeking a full refund, legal, staff time, and covering the costs of rehiring a new superintendent if the contract was breached,” Zorc said in the release.
Board President Jackie Norris said Monday that the board asked Roberts’ attorney to provide documentation and verification of his citizenship status by 12 p.m. Tuesday, with plans to meet at 7:30 p.m. that day to discuss ending Roberts’ employment contract. Parrish said the letter of resignation was being sent to school officials Tuesday.
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn said late Monday the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed with the U.S. Department of Justice through a Freedom of Information Act and formal inquiry that Roberts was subject to a final removal order under the Immigration and Nationality Act. He also said in a statement it was “unacceptable that someone under a final order of deportation and without legal work authorization was allowed to lead Iowa’s largest public school system.”
“Every parent should be able to trust that school leaders are fully vetted, legally employed, and held to the highest standards of accountability,” Nunn said. “I want to thank our federal agencies for their timely response and commitment to transparency as we work to protect our communities.”

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A new report is sounding the alarm over the presence of harmful chemicals and heavy metals in Southeast Louisiana’s drinking water. 
The Southeast Louisiana Residential Water Quality Study, conducted by the Water Collaborative of Greater New Orleans, tested for contaminants in home tap water from seven parishes. Nearly every home among the 105 total tested in St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes had at least trace amounts per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS for short. 
The consumption of PFAS – also known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally degrade – has been linked to high cholesterol, liver damage, increased risk of thyroid disease and reduced vaccine response in children. 
PFAS have widespread uses in consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, cleaning products, carpets, waterproof clothing and firefighting foam. As contaminants, they have been found in air, water, soil and fish. 
The study was conducted to inform residents about the long-term health risk of low-level exposures to lead, arsenic and PFAS “even when most detections fall below enforceable limits,” according to the study. 
Out of 105 homes tested in the study, 101 had at least one detectable PFAS. The study did not report any differences between parishes that get their drinking water from aquifers – St. James and St. John – and those that draw their supply from the Mississippi River.
The study also tested for other contaminants, including excessive heavy metals and salt levels. 
Varying amounts of arsenic were found in 70% of samples, and lead was present in 67%. Salt levels exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’s recommended thresholds for drinking water quality in 100% of the samples taken during low water levels for the Mississippi River.  
Taya Fournette, who led the study as policy coordinator for the Water Collaborative, said that while the testing provides just a snapshot of what people can be exposed to in drinking water, “these small amounts of exposures can add up, which is why ongoing monitoring and mitigation is important.” 
The amounts of PFAS and heavy metals detected were below levels federal health officials deem harmful, but there is consensus among physicians that no amount is safe. 
PFAS concentrations measured in the study ranged from trace amounts to one instance in Plaquemines Parish where the sample measured 43% above the pending federal limit. 
Regulations limiting the amount of PFAS allowed in drinking water, first introduced during the Biden administration in May 2024, were partially rolled back under the Trump administration this past May. The effective date for the new limits was also pushed forward from 2029 to 2031, with some PFAS maximums removed entirely.
“Something that makes PFAS unusual, compared to the vast majority of chemicals that we toxicologists study, is that PFAS dissolve in water. Now PFAS also contaminate the drinking water of millions of Americans,” said Jennifer Schlezinger, an environmental health professor and toxicologist at Boston University School of Public Health who assisted in the study.
Researchers tested for 18 different PFAS compounds, seven of which were detected at least once across the study. Perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid were, by far, the most frequently encountered, appearing in 97.2% and 72.9% of tap water tested, respectively.
Homes were chosen for testing to reflect the makeup of Louisiana’s population, Fournette said. The results revealed “sharp disparities” in terms of who was exposed to contaminants. While white households had more frequent detections, Black and lower-income households recorded the highest concentrations when it came to heavy metals. 
This same trend in heavy metal exposure appeared across income and educational differences. 
Study subjects with a high school education or less, as well as those earning under $25,000 a year, recorded the highest peaks in heavy metal exposure, while more educated, higher-income groups recorded generally lower levels of exposure. 
PFAS appeared to contaminate more uniformly across race, education and income, with widespread detection in smaller amounts. 
“That variation shows how different the challenges can be depending on where you live, how your water is treated and how your water is delivered to you, either through public or private plumbing,” Fournette said. “Our results show that stronger safeguards are needed to protect Louisiana residents.” 
“Clearly there is a need to regulate PFAS. We know that they’re found in drinking water, and we know that they are dangerous to human health,” Schlezinger said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_0861-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 17:57:54.163610

Jones during the panel's Sept. 30, 2025, meeting in Providence. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission on Tuesday approved two proposed rule changes regarding gifts given to public officials: one which is likely to please some state lawmakers, and the other to satisfy the wishes of government watchdogs.
The first rule change increases the gift cap for public officials, who will soon be able to receive $50 single gifts, or $150 worth of gifts in aggregate in one year, from the same person. The previous limits were $25 and $75, respectively.
The proposal to increase the gift cap had virtually no public support and was related to failed legislation in the Rhode Island Senate earlier this year that would have increased the individual gift limit to $50. The dead bill was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III, a Providence Democrat, and nine other senators.
The second measure widens the state’s ethics code’s definition of an “interested person” to include all lobbyists, including ones working on behalf of nonprofits. A loose stitch in ethics regulations allowed for a hypothetically limitless amount of gifts from nonprofit lobbyists, who were technically absent in the code’s definition of an “interested person.” 
The Ethics Commission affirmed both rule changes, each consisting of several line-by-line refinements to existing ethics code, via unanimous roll call votes. Commissioner Matthew D. Strauss was not present at Tuesday’s meeting.
The newly modified rules are scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, as the panel agreed to adopt a single effective date for all the changes to take effect. Ethics Commission Executive Director Jason Gramitt said his office will need time to compile the documents and revise the regulations.
No time like the present to change lobbyist gift rules, open government advocates tell ethics panel

“I’m not going to file immediately after today’s meeting,” Gramitt told the commission. “There’s some drafting I need to do, I need to make sure I’ve got certain forms filled out properly. I have some narratives I’m going to have to write and upload.”
Gramitt said his office will also have to tweak the state’s annual disclosure forms, which had removed a once-included section asking officials whether they received over $100 in gifts. Since the previous limit was $75, that section was removed, but now it will need to return, Gramitt said. The question will make its return to 2027 disclosure filings in 2027, which will cover 2026.
Tuesday’s decision concludes a nine-month decisionmaking process which began at the behest of Common Cause Rhode Island in December. The open government advocacy group pushed for the “interested person” regulations to include all lobbyists.
“It’s disappointing they chose to raise the gift limits, even though they didn’t receive any testimony asking them to raise the gift limits,” John Marion, the executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, said after the commission’s vote.
Commissioner Scott Rabideau spoke in favor of the bigger gift limit from a municipal perspective, and he noted the $25 “applies to all municipal employees, to all of the people who serve on these little boards.”
“The guy who delivers oil, who knows the members of the town council, but he also delivers all over the school — you know, those things happen in small towns,” Rabideau said. “I think that going to $50 is not going to hurt.”
Commissioner Frank Cenerini, a retired Rhode Island District Court judge, has previously voiced his support for raising the gift limit and did so again Tuesday, arguing from the premise that “people who enter public service do so for good reasons.” He said the increased gift limit was simply a means of adjusting for inflation.
Marion was more pleased with the commission’s adoption of the new rule language his group suggested, and called it “an important loophole that needed to be closed by the commission.”
The rule is one which will affect Marion, too, since he is a registered lobbyist for his nonprofit good government group. Grammit told the commission that the state’s approximately 650 registered lobbyists will eventually be sent an email informing them of the rule change. 
“John Marion, for instance, will receive an email,” Grammit said, motioning with his thumb backward to Marion, who was sitting in the audience.
“You can just hand deliver to him when he’s here,” added Commission Chair Lauren E. Jones.
The rule change bundles in a carveout for “food or beverage for immediate consumption at a reception or fundraiser to which all members of the General Assembly or statewide officers are invited and is hosted not more than once in any year by a not for profit entity that is not an interested person.”
Another exception allows gift giving to public officials or employees from interested parties if the official “is not a member or employee of the state or municipal agency that the interested person is lobbying.”
This is the first time the ethics commission has “voted to strengthen the state’s ethics laws” since 2012, according to a Common Cause news release.
Jones noted this was the first time he completed a rulemaking procedure since joining the commission four years ago. 
The remainder of the work now falls on Gramitt’s shoulders. Before the vote, the executive director had laughed while explaining to commissioners what comes next.
“Quite a lot of paperwork,” Gramitt said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission on Tuesday approved a petition from Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat and criminal defense attorney, to apply to rejoin the state judiciary’s roster of court-appointed lawyers available to represent indigent defendants. 
Commissioners voted 6–2 to adopt a staff recommendation concluding that the state Code of Ethics does not disallow Knight from returning to the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s attorney list. Normally, as an elected official, Knight would be barred while in office and for one year after leaving his elected position. 
Knight was on the list in 2016 when he was first elected to the state’s House of Representatives, which is not in violation of the Code of Ethics. Knight voluntarily asked to be removed from the list in 2019, citing low pay.
State general revenue covers the cost of providing legal services for indigent defendants by private attorneys who take on clients when the public defender cannot. The judiciary considers list appointees “not state employees but…independent contractors,” according to the ethics office, which interviewed the judiciary’s finance director.
This spring, the Rhode Island Supreme Court increased pay from $90 to roughly $112 per hour for most cases, and from $100 to $142 per hour for murder cases — a bump in pay motivating Knight’s bid to rejoin.
The Ethics Commission’s executive office crafted a new opinion of Knight’s case after an Aug. 19 meeting sent the office’s staff back to the drawing board. Staff had originally concluded that, per the state Code of Ethics, Knight could not rejoin the court-appointee list because of the “revolving door” rule, which blocks a sitting legislator from returning to a panel if they previously stepped off it.

Now the new opinion says Knight can pursue re-certification for the court-appointed defense lawyer roster.
“The Executive Order creating the court-appointed panels states that the goal is to create ‘as large a list of qualified and willing attorneys as is feasible,” the new opinion reads. “Finally, the court-appointed attorneys are not supervised or directed in their work by any state employee or official but owe their fiduciary duty and loyalty only to the indigent client being represented.”
Vice Chair Holly Susi said Knight’s desired return to the court list serves a “higher purpose” and that the lawmaker is “willing to do work that so many others are not.”

Tuesday’s decision follows the commission’s earlier debate over whether Knight’s case fell under the “revolving door” rule that blocks a sitting legislator from returning to a panel if they previously stepped off it.
“I don’t accept that he’s either an employee or a true independent contractor of the state of Rhode Island,” said Commission Chair Lauren E. Jones. “He’s only being paid to perform the service that he’s providing.”
Commissioner Frank Cenerini cited part of the new opinion which noted a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Polk County v. Dodson, that determined state-appointed counsel, even if paid by the state, are “free of state control.”
“If they’re free of any state control, then I don’t see how even the historical fact that he was on or off makes any difference,” Cenerini said. “And if I were to choose between the United States Supreme Court and the interpretation going around in the Mayberry court, I’m going with the Supreme Court.”
Commissioner Scott Rabideau, one of the two nay votes, disagreed. The biologist and wetland scientist said that, in his profession, people who give up their grandfathered perks don’t usually get them back.
“I look at it again in my profession: If you were grandfathered and you gave it up, shame on you, because you’re not going to get grandfathered again,” Rabideau said.
“Unfortunately for your analysis, the United States Supreme Court doesn’t agree with it,” Cenerini retorted.
Hugo L. Ricci, Jr., who also voted no, argued that Knight’s maneuver to reenter the attorney pool exemplified a revolving door case. 
“The fact that he did come off and come back on, he’s now fallen under the purview of the statue,” Ricci said. “And to deconstruct that statute is something I’m not comfortable with.”
John Marion, the executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, said in an interview after the commission made its decision that the public body had contorted itself into a certain result.
“Oftentimes the commission seems uneasy with where the law leads them, but they accept it,” Marion said. “This is a rare instance where they were uneasy with where the law led them, and they chose to read the law in a way that got them their preferred outcome.”
Knight did not attend Tuesday’s meeting and did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Two public school teachers are suing the New Jersey Education Association, alleging the teachers’ union violated the law when it funneled $40 million to former union president Sean Spiller’s gubernatorial campaign this spring.
The suit, filed Tuesday in state Superior Court by Roselle teacher Marie Dupont and Hamilton teacher Ann Marie Pocklembo, alleges the union improperly used dues it said would not fund its political committees to fuel the independent expenditure groups that backed Spiller’s failed bid for the Democratic nod for governor.
“We are here today because the Fairness Center’s clients, two New Jersey public school teachers and a New Jersey policy nonprofit, believe the New Jersey Education Association should play by the rules and follow the law when it comes to its political spending,” Nathan McGrath, president of the Fairness Center, a nonprofit law firm that opposes public-sector unions, told reporters Tuesday.
New poll finds dead heat in NJ governor’s race

The plaintiffs allege the union breached its contract by sending union funds to Garden State Forward, the union’s super PAC, which then sent the funds to Working New Jersey, the independent expenditure group that put $40 million behind Spiller’s Democratic primary bid. The only reported donations on Working New Jersey’s campaign filings came from the union super PAC.
Spiller finished in fifth place out of six candidates, nabbing 11% of the vote. His term as the union’s president ended after June’s primary.
The plaintiffs also charge the union misrepresented how it would use member dues and, by doing so, breached its fiduciary duty to its members.
“When I signed my union membership card, I did not check the back saying I wanted to contribute to the union political action committee,” DuPont said during Tuesday’s press conference. “That was a contract stating my dues wouldn’t go to the union political apparatus, but a handful of insiders ignored that choice and broke that trust.”
The union’s membership cards include sections for voluntary contributions to the NJEA Political Action Fund and the National Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education. They do not mention Garden State Forward.
A spokesperson for the union did not return calls and a text message seeking comment.
Spiller’s campaign for governor was unusual. Despite a statewide profile, he was the only Democratic gubernatorial hopeful to fail to qualify for the state’s public fund matching program.
His fundraising and campaign infrastructure were both limited, but Working New Jersey ensured ads, mailers, and other campaign materials boosting his candidacy blanketed airwaves and inundated mailboxes starting in the fall of 2024.
The suit alleges the union improperly reported its contributions to Garden State Forward on annual IRS filings, marking them as cash grants rather than political or lobbying contributions. The union reported giving Garden State Forward $8.5 million in grants in 2023 on its most recent IRS filing.
And they argue Spiller controlled Protecting Our Democracy, a separate issues advocacy nonprofit that ran ads boosting and featuring Spiller before he launched his campaign. The group faces limited disclosure requirements as a 501(c)4 nonprofit.
Filings show Garden State Forward gave Protecting Our Democracy $5 million between April 2022 and January 2024, though it remains unclear how much of that money the group spent boosting Spiller. Quarterly reports filed by the candidate show Protecting Our Democracy gave his campaign $5,800 last September.
Spiller, a former Montclair mayor, was the Protecting Our Democracy chair before the organization dissolved in March.
“Union officials must put employees’ interests ahead of their own and cannot use their position for self-dealing or personal gain, but the union put its own president’s interests ahead of 200,00 teachers across the state by bankrolling his political interests with members’ money,” McGrath said.
Separate complaints filed with the IRS and the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission by the New Jersey Policy Institute, which is backing the teachers’ suit, allege other violations of law.
The group asked the state election law commission to investigate whether the teachers’ union violated state campaign finance law by giving Spiller maxed-out contributions through its PAC and Protecting Our Democracy.
The New Jersey Policy Institute’s complaint to the IRS requested the agency launch an investigation into whether it violated federal law by disclosing its contributions to Garden State Forward outside the section of the 990 form devoted to political giving.
“Every taxpayer deserves transparency about the role powerful special interests play in our elections, and every candidate, no matter how well connected, must be bound by the same laws as everyone else,” said Rosemary Becchi, the institute’s president and a former Republican congressional candidate.

Lawmakers will address cuts to federal food assistance at the upcoming Oct. 1 special session. (Source NM file photo)Ensuring New Mexicans don’t go hungry will be at the top of lawmakers’ agenda when they convene for the Oct. 1 special session to address impacts from federal legislation, in addition to public health care, health insurance rates and vaccine policy. 
State officials said recent federal changes to the federal food assistance program approved in the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” such as work requirements and program cuts, may worsen hunger for New Mexicans, and require the state to pay significantly more for the program to continue.
Here’s a closer look at the potential impacts from cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program (SNAP).
What is SNAP and how many New Mexicans use it?
SNAP is a federal program that sends monthly benefits to low-income households to purchase food.
As of August 2025, 459,535 New Mexicans use SNAP — about 21% of the state’s population, which is the highest rate in the country.
According to the Legislative Finance Committee, one in seven New Mexicans and nearly one in four children lived in households without consistent access to adequate food.
New Mexico consistently ranks toward the bottom of the nation’s food security ranking and was 4th worst this past year.

How will changes to the federal law impact New Mexicans’ SNAP program?
Previously, the federal government paid for 100% of the SNAP program and funded half of the state’s administration for giving out the benefits.
The budget bill reduces how much federal funding states will receive, requiring states to pick up 75% of administration costs for a federal match of 25%.
Under the new law, New Mexico will need to contribute an estimated $203 million annually to keep the program running, according to the state Health Care Authority.
Then, between two and four years from now, the state may have to pay up to 15% of the actual program, depending on its error rate for administering the program.
In addition, as of Oct. 1, the federal government will reduce maximum SNAP benefits for households, and narrow SNAP eligibility for non-citizens here legally, which will affect an estimated 16,220 New Mexicans, according to the Health Care Authority.
 
How do SNAP cuts affect New Mexico’s food security?
New Mexico’s grocery stores, farmers’ markets and convenience stores rely on customers’ SNAP funds, putting nearly $1.2B in SNAP revenue at stake, according to the HCA.



	
Food bank officials said earlier this year that they will not have enough food to replace what SNAP delivers for families.
“There’s no way we can just suddenly multiply everything we do times nine to make that happen. We couldn’t do that in 10 years,” Jason Riggs, director of advocacy and public policy at the Roadrunner Food Bank, said in August. “No business can grow nine times. So any thoughts that, ‘Well, charity will take care of this,’ are very misguided.”
 
When do the cuts go into effect?
Starting in January of 2026, the upper age requirement for exemption from SNAP’s work requirements will be raised to 64.
New Mexico will have to pay additional money to administer the program starting in October 2027.
The state match program could be implemented in October 2027 or as late as 2030, depending on the state’s error rate — which occurs from either administering too much or too little in SNAP benefits.
New Mexico’s error rate is currently about 14.6%. Higher error rates result in higher cost shares, but New Mexico and other states with high error rates are allowed more time to bring them down.
 
What do New Mexico lawmakers intend to do?
In presentations to lawmakers, legislative analysts said the state would need to pay $18.9 million every year for what the federal government pays now in administration. In order to pay for newly ineligible SNAP recipients, the Health Care Authority said it would cost $109 million in fiscal year 2027.
Lawmakers in committee meetings leading up to the special session also floated allocating funding for food banks and farms, which also received cuts via the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Dueling press releases and news conferences from Minnesota Democrats and Republicans Tuesday can only mean one thing: Negotiations for a special legislative session on gun violence and school safety have reached an impasse and are unlikely to be resolved. 
Gov. Tim Walz and legislative leaders have been meeting for weeks behind closed doors, negotiating the terms of a special legislative session after the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in August. 
Walz and Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislative leaders released a proposal for a special session that includes a ban on so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They’re also pushing for a special legislative session on Monday. The proposal also included expanded “school safety funding” and increased “funding for mental health treatment,” which are Republican priorities. None of the proposed bills included details. 
Republicans are not on board, however, and because the two parties share power in the Legislature, bipartisan agreement is necessary. The House is tied 67-67 between Republicans and Democrats. The Senate is currently short two members until a Nov. 4 special election, after which Democrats are expected to maintain their slim majority, but until then, they are a vote shy of the necessary 34 to pass any bills. 
Democrats say Republicans are unwilling to even consider any new restrictions on guns. Which wouldn’t be surprising: Republican voters are against new gun regulations, recent polling shows. 
In a statement Tuesday, Walz said the DFL proposal “meets the expectations that Minnesotans have for their elected leaders — that we respond to threats to public safety and take direct action on guns.”
 “Our offer addresses mental health, school safety, support for law enforcement and most importantly, common sense gun laws,” Walz said.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, said that negotiations between Walz and leaders broke down Tuesday morning after Democrats “indicated they would no longer work with Republicans to find agreement for a special session.” 
“If Gov. Walz wants a special session, which only he can do, Senate Republicans will be there to do the important work to keep our kids and communities safe. Minnesotans deserve better than slogans and press conferences, they need solutions,” Johnson said in a statement.
House Republicans in their latest offer outlined that during a special session, lawmakers would would take up bills related to school safety, mental health funding and “improving public safety.” In recent years, House Republicans have sought to increase criminal penalties, especially on violent crime. 
The House GOP offer doesn’t mention guns, and it states that lawmakers can also propose other legislation.
Republicans, who are aligned with the gun rights movement, have said that school safety is a priority but have been reluctant to discuss guns at all, whereas Walz and Democrats have been firm that considering gun control measures would be a requirement of any special session agreement.
Walz, who first floated a special session weeks ago, has the sole ability to call lawmakers into session, but only lawmakers can gavel themselves out, which is typically why the governor and lawmakers come to an agreement beforehand, including what bills will be passed, as well the duration of the session. 
Rep. Zack Stephenson, a north metro Democrat who leads the DFL House causus, said the two sides are stuck: “We’ve reached a clear impasse.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_9143-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 17:57:54.163610

Blaise Ingoglia talks about property taxes in Jacksonville on May 9, 2025. (Screenshot via governor's X livestream)Assailing whom he deemed as “big government apologists,” Florida Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia brought his statewide tour spotlighting what he alleges is excessive local spending to Broward County on Tuesday.
Speaking from Pembroke Pines, the CFO said his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team of auditors had scrubbed spending by the (Democratic-controlled) Broward County Commission from the fiscal years of 2019-20 to 2024-25 and determined that they have expended more than $189 million in wasteful, excessive spending.
He added that Broward County’s budget had increased by $617 million in that time, a 48% increase.
As has been the case in his similar visits to Hillsborough, Alachua, and Orange counties as well as the city of Jacksonville, Ingoglia offered no specific instances of alleged wasteful spending. That information, he said, will be included in follow-up DOGE reports due in the coming weeks. But he added that it wasn’t really his responsibility to detail examples.
“The government expansion itself is waste, fraud, and abuse,” he said. “The government expanding is the excessive spending itself.”
Neither is it his job to go in and cut a local government’s budget, he continued. That’s the job of city managers and county administrators who he made sure to note get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to do so (in the case of Broward County Administrator Monica Cepero, it’s $461,232, according to OpenPayrolls).
The affordability crisis in the state
The CFO’s press conferences highlighting local government’s (allegedly excessive) spending practices are part of his (and Gov. Ron DeSantis’) campaign to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes on homesteaded properties that will likely appear as a proposed constitutional amendment on the November 2026 statewide ballot.
While it’s leading Republicans in the state like Ingoglia and DeSantis who say that the public is demanding property tax relief, Democrats like gubernatorial candidate David Jolly are criticizing what they say is an affordability crisis in the state, referencing high costs of property and auto insurance, among other issues.
The CFO on Tuesday linked the two arguments, saying a major reason why Floridians are suffering through an affordability crisis is because of the big-spending ways of local governments.
“Almost every elected official in local government starts complaining about affordable housing — to the point where they give a lot of money to nonprofits and they try to subsidize affordable housing. The easiest way to make housing more affordable is to give them property tax relief,” he said.
“Let’s stop spending money on programs that don’t work and subsidize, and let’s start giving people a reduced cost in the form of government. That is a surefire way to give property tax relief and affordability at the same time.”
‘Big government apologists’
As Ingoglia continues to make his case around the state, he’s received pushback in the form of biting newspaper editorials criticizing his efforts. It’s criticism he says he expected.
“Just like we saw in the mid-2000s, we are seeing it right now: Big government apologists are coming out of the woodwork trying to make excuses for a lot of the spending that you will see,” he said. “They’re going to be saying things like, ‘Well, if we cut, we’re going to have to cut fire and police, right?’ That is just nonsense.”
The Broward County Commission voted earlier this month to lower its millage rate for the first time since 2018, although property owners will still see their property taxes increase as property values continue to rise. Representatives for the county government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ingoglia’s appearance came a day after a poll commissioned by the James Madison Institute showed that 65% of Floridians would support a constitutional amendment

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A battle is brewing over ownership of a storied Omaha site — a downtown property that, while largely grass and dirt now, is known for six decades of high school graduations, circus acts and concerts from Elvis Presley to Kiss.
One of the more notable moments in the history of the now-demolished City Auditorium was the 1988 vice presidential debate when Lloyd Bentsen delivered his famous zinger to Dan Quayle: “Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.”

Today, a different controversy envelops the four city blocks cleared in 2016-17, as the city said it will try to reclaim ownership from a private developer it says has defaulted on the terms of a redevelopment agreement.
White Lotus Group, which has owned the tract for two years, disagrees. CEO Arun Agarwal told the Nebraska Examiner he is confused at the city’s pivot and that his team was “full speed ahead” on a $200 million-plus plan to create Civic Square: a campus of housing, offices, a grocery store and fitness, dining and nightlife venues. 
Road and utility installation started
Agarwal said his team has done what is contractually required. Road and utility installation started recently, following a springtime groundbreaking and initial grading work. He said crews have faced unexpected barriers, including buried arena parts that obstructed utility work, but the group is working to transform the city property it bought for about $1.4 million.
Assistant City Attorney Jennifer Taylor said Omaha officials, however, believe the developer has failed to meet certain deadlines laid out in the contract regarding the site bounded by 17th, 19th and Chicago Streets and Capitol Avenue. 
“The city is disappointed we have not seen the progress we requested, anticipated and expected,” she said. “It is the city’s opinion he is in default.”

In a first step to claw back the property, Taylor said the city sent Agarwal written notice on Sept. 8, giving 60 days to correct what city officials see as unmet terms. She said she can’t imagine it could be accomplished in the time frame.
At the crux is language in the right to repurchase provision, which says the developer will make “best efforts” to complete installation of at least 50% of the public infrastructure within 18 months of closing (the sale closed in September 2023). It said that within two years of closing, the developer shall “commence construction” of footings, foundations and/or road work for at least half the infrastructure and building structures.
Agarwal said his crews “commenced” road and installation work after the city issued an applicable permit last month. White Lotus has made “more than best efforts,” he said, asking: “What am I missing?” 
Taylor said White Lotus has “paved half a street” and said the developer has not done what was mandated. “There is a point where you have to fish or cut bait.”
Mayoral debate offered clue 
A hint of the battle over the nine-acre area surfaced earlier this year in an April mayoral debate. 
Then-Mayor Jean Stothert said White Lotus had not met certain benchmarks and announced that a different developer, which she didn’t identify, was in the wings wanting to do something “really incredible” on the property.
Opponent John Ewing Jr., in turn, criticized Stothert’s handling of the deal and lamented what he believed was the project’s sluggish pace. 
Now with Ewing at the helm, the Mayor’s Office reiterated in a statement concerns about “insufficient progress” and questioned White Lotus’ ability to complete the transformation.
Asked about the developer mentioned by Stothert, Taylor said she did not know if that was a viable option. She said what mattered was execution of the contract.

“At this point we want to see that property developed.” 
Agarwal said the city process became “murky” after the mystery developer came to light. He said his group has committed and spent “millions” and has acted in “good faith.” He said he was told the interested developer is a tax-exempt nonprofit.
“If there is a better use, anything that is going to progress the city, I’m in,” he said. “But this is not about us going slow.”
He pointed to White Lotus’ multimillion dollar mixed-use redevelopment project at Lincoln’s old Pershing Auditorium site as a similar effort and said the company’s portion there is on track to wrap up later this year.
TIF application stalled
Agarwal said White Lotus months ago submitted an application for about $35 million in tax-increment financing for Civic Square, but had not heard back from the Omaha city committee that reviews such projects.
To that, Taylor said an applicant must have control of the property and currently “control and ownership is up in the air.”

“We have a duty to the taxpayers,” she said. “Taxpayers have a right to have their assets be productive.”
By the time White Lotus acquired the property from the city in 2023, it had been cleared for seven years at a cost then of $3.1 million. Tetrad Property Group had been selected early on to redevelop the site but backed out in 2018, partly over a dispute about city incentives and without having announced a major tenant.
White Lotus stepped in, and revealed renderings and key components in May 2023.
As envisioned, Civic Square is to include up to 400 housing units. Other components anticipated include a hotel, health and wellness services, office and retail space.  A local and a national firm is working with the developer to secure commercial tenants.
At least a few hundred new surface parking spaces and an existing 454-stall city-owned parking structure are to be available onsite. 
Of the much discussed demand for a downtown grocer, Agarwal said: “We fully expect a grocery to be at the site.”
Agarwal sees access to Interstate 480, and walkability to major employers such as Union Pacific and First National Bank of Omaha, as a key benefit in attracting housing and commercial tenants.
The ‘Nest’ allure
White Lotus is counting on nearby Creighton University students to fuel activity, and has nicknamed the project the “Nest” — a nod to its mission to draw Bluejays and other talent deciding where to hatch careers.

“Every great university has a collegiate extension to it,” Agarwal said, citing the Haymarket District and University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Aggieville and Kansas State University, Wrigleyville and DePaul University.
White Lotus sees the Nest helping to stem “brain drain” while enhancing the urban core. About 80% of Creighton  undergraduates come from outside Nebraska, and the private developer wants to help build an environment where students feel so at home that they’ll plant roots.
“This generation has a choice whether to stay or leave,” said Agarwal, noting recent studies that show Omaha lagging behind peer cities in job growth. “What are we doing to foster that integration? Increasing population growth has to be topic No. 1.”’ 
Agarwal would like to replicate a Blue Jay Bar aura, for example. The longtime near-campus Creighton hangout shuttered in 2017. He envisions proposed health and fitness services to be alluring to students of the university’s popular exercise science program.
Competition in urban core
The Nest would compete with other nearby developments for business, including the mixed-use Builder’s District, whose representatives shared the stage with Creighton officials Sept 18 when they announced a $300 million donor-funded plan to reshape a 12-block corridor on the university’s east side.
Creighton leaders described then how the school’s planned upgrades to athletic and recreational facilities will link to the Builder’s District — and its developing office, housing and entertainment offerings — via a new pedestrian passageway called the Jaywalk.
$300M Creighton donor-funded plan aims to reshape part of downtown Omaha

The Rev. Daniel Hendrickson, Creighton president, said the university’s connection with the Kiewit Corp.-anchored Builder’s District was intended to strengthen its eastern border. But he said Creighton is “excited about all developments near us and around us,” including the Nest.
The revamped riverfront parks, the Old Market, Millwork Commons and other attractions are good for Creighton and growing its 8,000-plus student enrollment, Hendrickson said.
“Anything we can do to keep revitalizing and activating downtown is just the best possible outcome for Creighton,” he said.
Agarwal said he welcomes competing development in the urban core, including the Builder’s District, adding that “a rising tide lifts all boats.”
He is on the urban core development committee for the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, and sees the Nest as a part of the chamber’s 20-year strategy announced in 2022 to create 30,000 new jobs and 30,000 new residents in the downtown and midtown area.
White Lotus planned to start “going vertical” with Civic Square-Nest buildings by mid-2026, Agarwal said.
“We believe this is the best project for the city,” he said.

And the state could see additional furloughs depending on how long the shutdown lasts, leaving those workers on leave without pay until Congress comes to a budget agreement.
A news release from the state’s Human Resources office called the furloughs “a decision of last resort.”
“The decision to implement furloughs is not one that has been taken lightly, and I deeply regret the hardship it will cause,” Gov. Josh Stein said. “I am upset with this federal dysfunction, and my administration is committed to doing everything in our power to advocate for a swift resolution.”
Furloughed employees will retain health care coverage through the month of October. If the shutdown extends past October, employees “should contact their agency HR office” for information about costs and premiums, according to the state HR office.
State officials could not immediately say how the initial round of 200 furloughs breaks down by department and job title.
Congressional leaders are meeting in Washington on Tuesday ahead of a shutdown set to begin at midnight. The White House has outlined plans to furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers, while others are set to continue work without pay.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe proposed new wholesale tax on marijuana products to fund road repairs in the next state budget and years down the road is much too high and would result in job losses for a booming Michigan cannabis industry, advocates and lawmakers said Tuesday as they rallied for a lower tax rate.
At least two Democratic lawmakers who attended the rally – state Reps. Donavan McKinney of Detroit and Mike McFall of Hazel Park – also signaled that they were working behind the scenes to get that rate much lower before a final vote is taken. 
At present, both McFall and McKinney said they would vote no on the final budget if the rate remained.
Michigan lawmakers reached a loose framework to fund the government last week, but it included a new 24% wholesale tax on products sold at dispensaries across the state. That sent the cannabis industry and their allies into a frenzy as they warned that such a tax would hamstring the industry’s growth and result in fewer jobs.

On Tuesday, lawmakers were still in the throes of hammering out a final budget plan, with no clear end in sight despite signals that the government would stay open and not shut down on Wednesday when the new fiscal year begins.
Still, the money for the Legislature’s road funding plan had to come from somewhere, whether that was from schools – which advocates rallied against Tuesday – or from the new proposed tax on pot for potholes.
Those working for or on behalf of the cannabis industry gathered for a rally on the Capitol steps in Lansing to send lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who had earlier in the year proposed a more than 30% tax, a clear message: Keep off their grass.
“Our industry is not their piggy bank. Our wallets are not their budget overruns,” said Mike DiLaura, CCO and general counsel for House of Dank, one of many cannabis companies operating in Michigan. “It is our time, not just as an industry, but as citizens of this great state, to put our feet down and say, ‘enough is enough.’”

DiLaura continued by saying that the industry has, since recreational cannabis was legalized in 2020, raised nearly $2 billion in taxes for Michigan over the last five years.
“But they say it’s not enough,” DiLaura said. “When will it ever be enough?”
Several other advocates and industry leaders spoke at the rally, all mentioning that even if they lost the battle to either stop the tax hike or reduce it, they would continue the fight in court or seek a full repeal of the law down the pike.
The rally also featured two allies in McKinney and McFall.
Both said they voted against the proposal in House Bill 4951 when it passed the House last week, noting that their communities have greatly benefited from recreational cannabis shops and associated businesses like grow operations.
“Hazel Park was all in on marijuana from the very beginning. As some of you might know, we even gave Tommy Chong the key to the city at one point,” McFall said. “But what a lot of people don’t realize is how this is going to impact local municipalities. They’re talking about cutting revenue sharing, which is the money that goes back from the state. This is also going to impact that.”

McFall said Hazel Park got half a million in tax dollars last year, and that money helped pay for emergency services and other amenities.
McKinney said that the Eight Mile corridor is filled with marijuana shops that have transformed vacant, abandoned buildings while also delivering what he called the best marijuana in the nation.
“I think Snoop Dogg said something like that,” McKinney quipped.
But in all seriousness, he said that the proposal was “BS,” and the new tax rate was too high. McKinney added that he and McFall were just two of a few legislators who were willing to stand firm against the proposal, and that there was work going on behind closed doors to lower the rate if it was absolutely necessary to fund roads.
“We don’t know what that number will be, but we for sure know it’s not going to be 24%,” McKinney said.

MONTPELIER — Vendor payment delays caused by the rollout of VTBuys, the state’s new digital procurement system, are a result of “human side” problems, not the technology itself, Vermont’s IT chief told lawmakers on Tuesday. 
Denise Reilly-Hughes, secretary of the Agency of Digital Services, told the Joint Information Technology Oversight Committee that state departments and agencies have developed their own disparate processes for dealing with vendors and invoices over decades, and not all of these offices have completely switched to VTBuys.
That includes her own digital services agency, which Reilly-Hughes said had decided it would be “better for internal operations to hold off” on completely adopting VTBuys while the agency helped other state offices do so.

VTBuys, the new e-procurement platform, is intended to modernize the way the state government works with vendors, creating a single streamlined interface for bids, contracts and payments. Previously, the state relied on manual, sometimes tedious, processes. The new platform is set to create efficiency and unity across state governments, according to state administrative leaders. 
Coding quirks delayed VTBuy’s launch in July, leading state business offices to resort to contingency workflows. 
But in late August, Reilly-Hughes and Wanda Minoli, commissioner of the Department of Buildings and General Services, which encompasses the state’s primary contracting office, told lawmakers in the IT oversight committee that the state had gotten through VTBuys rocky debut. 
Yet after that assessment, three vendors with the state told VTDigger about tens of thousands of dollars in delayed and missing payments — problems they blamed on VTBuys.
At Tuesday’s meeting, state officials addressed the complaints. If the media had identified three businesses decrying late payments out of thousands working with the state, “those are positive metrics,” Reilly-Hughes said. 
Minoli, for her part, acknowledged a limited ongoing “backlog” of invoices, and said questions about delayed payments were among the top three VTBuys topics her department hears about from businesses.
As for parts of the state government still using old workflows rather than VTBuys, the department and agency heads said it’s happening more than they’d want but did not provide specifics. 
The change to VTBuys has caused frustration for state government business offices, Minoli said. But there’s something those involved agree on, she said: “the state needed a procurement system.”

The state has earned a reputation as the furniture manufacturing capital of the world. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)President Donald Trump announced “substantial” tariffs on imported furniture on Monday, a move that he said would help manufacturers in North Carolina.
“In order to make North Carolina, which has completely lost its furniture business to China, and other Countries, GREAT again, I will be imposing substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Details to follow!!!”
Trump announced last week a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture. Those will take effect Wednesday, Oct. 1.
The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina refers to the Tar Heel state as the furniture capital of the world. There are more than 850 furniture manufacturers in the state, employing about 32,000 workers, according to its website. Major furniture manufacturers in North Carolina include Ashley Furniture, Lexington Home Brands and Ethan Allen.
According to the EDPNC, North Carolina is home to a furniture manufacturing workforce nearly four times larger than the national average, as well as more than 550 wood product manufacturing establishments and more than 650 textile and textile product mills.
The state also exports $296 million worth of furniture annually, which could be affected if countries retaliate with their own tariffs. Neighboring Mexico and Canada are some of the biggest importers of these goods.
Mike Hubbard, director of international trade at the EDPNC, said it’s uncertain for now whether other countries will retaliate.
“As we’re negotiating these trade agreements, it may be somewhat more of a moot point,” Hubbard said. “The only question outstanding would be, ‘What is the rate going to be?'”
China, Vietnam and Mexico are the biggest furniture exporters to the U.S., according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. Canada comes in fourth, and Italy, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand and India round out the top 10.
In particular, North Carolina is known for its customizable upholstered furniture, which is more affordable and quicker for U.S. consumers to purchase domestically than overseas.
“Aside from just the fact that we’re good at it, and companies have reinvested so much,” Hubbard said, “you buy a sofa and your next-door neighbor wants the exact same one, and you don’t want your house to look the same, you can get whatever upholstery you want,” Hubbard said.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said he doesn’t understand how this tariff fits into Trump’s overall policy.
Stein said he thinks the economy is best served when there’s consistency, so that businesses have an expectation of policies and how to invest around them.
“When there’s wild fluctuations in policies, a great deal of uncertainty, you’ll see the business investments freeze, and there has been a diminishment in business investment across the country,” Stein said. “I would like to get off this roller coaster and have a lot more stability.”
Swedish company Ikea, which has 52 locations in the U.S. and is known for its affordable flat-pack pieces with self-assembly, has a store in Charlotte.
The company is anticipating higher prices for customers as a result of the tariffs, Newsweek reported.
“Our goal is to offer affordable, good-quality home furnishings to everyone,” an Ikea spokesperson told Newsweek. “In our experience across the markets we operate in, tariffs make these ambitions more difficult.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NC-Furniture_Capitol-1024x544.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

Essential services would continue even as other government operations grind to a halt, and certain federal employees keep working, albeit unpaid, until it’s over.
But the prospects of a prolonged and indefinite shutdown could mean trouble for certain government programs, especially those supporting many working and low-income families who have come to rely on nutrition aid and child care services.
The uncertainty around this particular shutdown has made it harder to predict exactly how things could play out, especially as President Donald Trump said Tuesday that his administration could wield its executive power in ways he called “irreversible.”
Gov. Ned Lamont said he sees the funding impasse in Congress as only the most recent example of Washington becoming an unreliable partner to the states. That’s on top of the administration’s other changes and reversals that have directly affected Connecticut, including the attempt to halt work on Revolution Wind.
“We’re really worried about the shutdown — not in the near term. We can mitigate things in the near term. We’ve got reserves. Nothing’s going to happen tonight or tomorrow,” Lamont told reporters in Hartford on Tuesday hours before the funding deadline and end of the federal fiscal year. “But if this goes on for a couple of months, there could be some people that are really hit.”
States like Connecticut have inevitably felt the strain when Congress failed to meet its funding deadline in past years. But the stakes are even higher with a shutdown that could begin early Wednesday with no immediate indications of how long it could last or how it’ll get resolved.
Consequences for Connecticut
In remarks opening the second annual “Insuring the Future” conference on Tuesday in downtown Hartford, Lamont said Connecticut needs the support of the federal government. He said he supports the push by congressional Democrats regarding their health care demands but doesn’t see a shutdown as tenable either.
“Make a deal. This is bully-boy brinksmanship,” Lamont said, “Look, I’m with the Democrats. You don’t want everybody’s health insurance to spike up and all of a sudden you can’t afford to provide health care for your kid. And you also can’t have a shutdown. There’s got to be a compromise you guys can make.”
In a shutdown, essential functions and services continue, including the intelligence community and other national security agencies. The most immediate consequences are furloughs of federal employees who work for various government agencies.
Some workers, however, are exempt, such as the active duty military, some federal civilian employees and most air traffic controllers. But they won’t get paid during a shutdown and will receive back pay only after government operations resume.
Connecticut has about 7,300 people in its federal civilian workforce, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service. It used data from September 2024, months before the Trump administration started slashing federal jobs.
“There’s no question we need to be mindful of the pain that will be caused,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said. “Federal workers are going without paychecks. It’s an outcome that we’d like to avoid.”
The longer a shutdown lasts, the more it could interrupt other key services. Connecticut’s senators warned of risks to veterans’ affairs facilities, as well as Head Start child care centers, that might not be deemed essential, as they had not been in the past. During the 2013 shutdown, Connecticut was one of half a dozen states that saw closures of Head Start centers, including one in Bridgeport.
But given an already-diminished federal workforce, a shutdown this time around brings new risks, including the slowdown of important grants to some programs and services..
Nutrition assistance is also one of those areas that could see disruptions more quickly. That includes federal programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — better known as WIC — and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP benefits.
WIC appears to be particularly under threat in a shutdown. An administration official told the publication RealClearPolitics  that the program’s funding will dry up in October, which will likely affect new enrollment and benefits for current recipients. 
But DeLauro said there’s a $150 million in a WIC contingency fund that would keep things running but would be unlikely to last throughout a protracted shutdown. She also noted there are ways to “repurpose” funds and redirect to some of these programs running low, though SNAP appears to have a longer runway.
“My hope is that … the contingency fund can help us through. In other areas, there are programs that can go through SNAP and others that can go through November. We will hopefully see that Republicans will come to the table and deal with a negotiation to move forward,” DeLauro said on a Tuesday press call. “States are going to have to take a look at what a Plan B might be. But there’s $150 million in a WIC contingency fund.”
There are nearly 7 million pregnant and postpartum individuals, infants and young kids who rely on WIC, which also includes about 40% of infants born in the country, according to the Food Research & Action Center.
Lamont said funding would continue for major entitlement programs like Medicaid. But he echoed that federal money for WIC, the supplemental nutrition program for about 50,000 people in Connecticut, would disappear quickly.
“I think we have reserves in place that can keep us going for the near term, but just the very near term,” Lamont said.
Ongoing debates
The likelihood of a shutdown — the first in more than six years — comes at a time when there’s an ongoing debate over expiring health care subsidies, further reductions in the federal workforce and economic strains like tariffs.
The “deferred resignation program,” which was offered to federal employees months ago to voluntarily resign from their roles, will go into effect starting Oct. 1, just as a shutdown begins. Government agencies will now feel the full weight of a hollowed-out workforce, leading to some uncertainty over future operations.
On top of that, Trump and the Office of Management and Budget instructed agencies to move forward with reduction-in-force plans for nonessential employees. This could lead to permanent firings instead of just furloughs during a shutdown, but critics push back that this effort wouldn’t hold up in court.
The funding standoff also comes when Congress has ceded much of its constitutional authority of the “power of the purse” to the executive branch. 
Connecticut’s lawmakers and the rest of the Democratic Party are holding firm to their health care demands. But so are Republicans, who are pushing Democrats to accept the short-term bill in front of them. That passed the House with GOP support but stalled in the Senate without the votes from Democrats needed to pass the 60-vote threshold.
The parties couldn’t agree to a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, that would keep government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time. A short-term deal buys them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package for fiscal year 2026.
Republicans and Democrats had different versions. The GOP pushed for legislation to keep things running through Nov. 21. Democrats countered with a version that would fund the government until Oct. 31 but would also include some health care provisions and prevent Trump from rescinding funding Congress already approved. Both included additional funding for lawmaker security.
It would be the first shutdown since one that started in late December 2018 and lasted into January 2019, during Trump’s first term.
As the government inched closer to a shutdown on Tuesday, Democrats tried a last-minute procedural maneuver that Republicans shut down.
A group of House Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, wanted to force a vote on their funding bill during the pro forma session. But the limited opportunity quickly flamed out, with Tuesday’s session wrapping up in a matter of minutes.
DeLauro, who is the top Democrat of the House Appropriations Committee, which helps craft spending bills, sought to be recognized so she could offer a motion for unanimous consent, but the GOP lawmaker presiding over the floor quickly adjourned the House until the next pro forma session on Friday. Democrats yelled in objection as the chair banged the gavel.
The House was initially supposed to be in Washington the first two days of the week, but GOP leaders cancelled votes for Monday and Tuesday and will not be back in full session until next week — days after the funding deadline passed.
Politics of a shutdown
A last-minute meeting at the White House on Monday ended when neither side would back off their approach. It was the first time leaders in both parties plus the president were all in a room to negotiate before the Wednesday deadline.
Democratic leaders said big differences remain. Vice President JD Vance declared that the country is heading toward a shutdown and blamed Democrats.
But the fruitless meeting drove home a larger point: how will Congress get out of a shutdown if neither side will budge?
Meanwhile, the finger-pointing has intensified in recent days over who would get the blame. 
“Until they’re serious about a negotiation, it’s pretty clear what their desire is. We’re in this position today because Republicans boycotted negotiations,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Monday shortly after congressional leaders went to the White House to talk about the funding impasse. “But they’ve got to start getting serious about what’s about to happen to our health care system, what’s happening to our democracy.”
Frustrated by Democrats’ demands, Trump threatened cuts to programs that the Democrats support.
“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump told reporters Tuesday from the Oval Office. “And you know all you all know [OMB Director] Russell Vought. He’s become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn’t do any other way. So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.”
Back in Connecticut, most Republican state representatives wrote a letter to Senate leaders in both parties, urging them to approve the House-passed version of a short-term bill. They argued a shutdown would cause needless hardship for Connecticut residents and families.
“Allowing a shutdown would needlessly disrupt our local, state and national economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions,” they wrote in the letter sent to the Senate last week. “Connecticut families and communities would feel the pain with immediate effect and confusion. Put simply, a government shutdown should not be used as political leverage to pass partisan reforms — our constituents are not chips Congress should be bargaining with.”
Other looming crises
While a shutdown is at the forefront of conversations in Washington, Congress will still need to eventually deal with expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and whether it’s part of any funding negotiations. Those enhanced premium subsidies will expire at the end of the year, and if they’re not extended in some way, premiums will spike in 2026.
Republicans have resisted including the expiring subsidies in a funding bill and believe they can be addressed later in separate legislation. Democrats argue there’s an urgency to get it done now, particularly with open enrollment in the state-based exchanges beginning on Nov. 1.
If the subsidies expire at the end of the year, states would have to pick up the costs. For Connecticut, officials could spend more than $295 million a year, according to a spokesperson with Access Health CT.
Nationally, if the subsidies expire at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projects that more than 4 million people would lose health care coverage over the next decade, citing increases in out-of-pocket expenses because of more costly premiums. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
The expiration of enhanced tax credits will lead to out-of-pocket premiums for ACA marketplace enrollees increasing by an average of more than 75%. Insurers expect healthier enrollees would drop their coverage and cause premiums to then go up, according to a Peterson-KFF analysis.
“The people I talked to this morning in Connecticut before I came down here are asking me, ‘How do I know whether I can afford this insurance?’ Blumenthal said in an interview Monday after he came down to D.C. for votes. “There are real lives and real people who are going to be really hurt if we don’t extend this insurance now.”

Laura Kelly's administration to turn over food program data to the federal government. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas district court judge on Tuesday dismissed a case filed by Attorney General Kris Kobach that challenged the right of Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration to withhold Kansans’ personal data from the federal government.
In a 21-page order, Judge Teresa Watson sided with Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard, citing multiple issues with Kobach’s request to force the release of data related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The federal government’s Food and Nutrition Services program in May began demanding the release of personal information of people who have applied for or used the SNAP program. Howard repeatedly denied the release, pointing to regulations guiding how data should be shared between agencies.
Kobach took Howard and the state to court to force the release of the data, indicating in court filings that he believes compliance is required by state and federal law. He also expressed concern that $10.4 million related to SNAP administrative funding would be withheld from Kansas by the federal government because of the failure to turn over the data.
“We disagree with the judge’s interpretation of ripeness and are considering an appeal. Regardless, the governor continues to defy Kansas law,” Kobach said in a statement to Kansas Reflector. “Needy Kansans have now lost $10.4 million in food assistance because of her political theatrics. That money is not coming back.”
Ripeness refers to part of Watson’s reasoning for choosing to dismiss the case and refers to whether a case is developed and appropriate to be heard.
Watson said the ripeness requirement prevents courts from becoming entangled in abstract disagreements. In this case, she found that because the state has filed an appeal and the full administrative review process has not been completed, the case is not “ripe.”
Kelly, in a news release, accused Kobach of engaging in “low-rent political theater, wasting taxpayer dollars, and spreading misinformation.” She emphasized that no money has been lost from federal funding for SNAP administrative costs.
“I appreciate the court granting my administration’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the Attorney General’s actions were premature as we continue through the USDA’s administrative review process and that my administration does not have a legal duty to turn over Kansans’ personal information at this time,” Kelly said.
Watson stated in her decision that considering the duties of Howard and the Kansas administration to work with the federal program doesn’t mean that they must “perform in a prescribed manner without regard to the exercise of judgment.”
The Food and Nutrition Services department offers a multi-step administrative process to appeal the decisions to withhold any dollars from Kansas, and the state has filed an appeal, Watson said.
“The comprehensive administrative review available for the disallowance itself (suggests) that the state agency has some discretion in deciding how to respond to the request for SNAP participant data — or at least gives rise to the possibility of a ‘substantial dispute’ about how to respond,” Watson wrote.
Kelly’s news release said Kobach has made false claims multiple times that the state has lost $10.4 million in administrative funding.
“After the (U.S. Department of Agriculture) rejected the Kansas Department for Children and Families (DCF) Corrective Action Proposal, DCF filed an appeal with the USDA,” the news release said. “The filing of that appeal immediately prevented the USDA from withholding the $10.4 million.”
Kobach disagreed. 
“It is laughable to suggest that she will be able to persuade the USDA to change its decision,” he said. “And now, because of the governor’s desire to thumb her nose at the Trump administration, needy Kansans will lose another $10.4 million of food assistance in December.”
The $10.4 million funding loss, if upheld after the appeal, will occur quarterly until the state turns over the data, according to a USDA letter sent to the state. The dollars are designated for administrative cost and do not affect SNAP recipients.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090263-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Some of Iowa’s private universities are touting increasingly large and diverse student bodies as enrollment numbers for the 2025 fall semester are confirmed, statistics college officials attribute to their efforts to subdue sticker shock and ensure all students feel welcome.
Universities from Orange City to Des Moines and Sioux Center to Sioux City saw growth in enrollment this fall, including Drake University, Northwestern College, Dordt University, Buena Vista University and Morningside University.
Morningside University beat last year’s numbers and its own expectations for enrollment this fall, breaking 400 when the goal was to top 350. This was a surprise to Interim Vice President for Enrollment Management Steph Peters, who said the university wasn’t alone in seeing dips in interest the previous year due to problems with the rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.

After hearing from families who were leaving Morningside off their college decision lists due to uncertainty around how much they’d be expected to pay, Peters said the Sioux City university worked to expand Access to MSide, a program which provides financial aid to students based on their residency and Pell Grant eligibility.
“It puts a lot of concerns at ease if you know out the gate that your tuition is going to be covered, and you really just kind of have those auxiliary fees then to come up with,” Peters said. “If nothing else, it helped us have a conversation with those families.”
Tuition aid, access draw student interest
Other colleges and universities across the U.S. have implemented programs aimed at covering some or all of tuition for certain groups, Peters said, having seen them pop up more frequently over the past two years.
Drake University last November launched two initiatives that cover 100% of tuition after other financial aid is factored in. One is for students hoping to earn a bachelor’s degree and the other is for its two-year programs housed in the John Dee Bright College.
Joel Johnson, Drake University dean of admission, said these efforts have helped to grow interest in the university from both in and outside of the state. According to a news release from the university, Drake’s first-year students for four-year degrees increased by nearly 11% this fall to 653 students and enrollment in the John Dee Bright College saw its enrollment increase by close to one-third.
The Des Moines institution’s incoming class also reached a “33.2% level of diversity,” the release stated, which Johnson said relates to ethnic diversity and mirrors levels of diversity in the U.S. Johnson holds an educational doctorate in higher education leadership and organizational studies from Bay Path University.
When asked whether comments made by Drake University President Marty Martin in the spring reaffirming the college’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in the face of state actions to limit such activity had any impact on enrollment this fall, Johnson said he didn’t believe so and pointed to the tuition programs as having generated interest in the college.
“We’ve been very intentional about making sure that we can be accessible to all people across, you know, not just the state of Iowa, but obviously across the nation as well,” Johnson said.
Some families did have questions about potential impacts on the institution from state and federal shifts relating to higher education, including directives for universities to shut down diversity, equity and inclusion programs and offices.
Dealing with “the current federal rhetoric” and quick, but sometimes uncertain, changes made at the national level has been a challenge, Johnson said, as it adds more noise to an already difficult time for students trying to figure out which college would be best to attend and how to make that happen.
Drake is an adaptable university that will be able to handle shifts coming its way, Johnson said.
“It’s just … an environmental factor that is frustrating because it’s out of our control, like we could do everything right, they can see that Drake as a great fit for them, but something in the political ether could just change the narrative, and they’ll say, ‘Maybe not,’” Johnson said.
Preparing for further competition
Only a month or so into the 2025-2026 school year, Peters said Morningside is already offering prospective students tools to predict whether they’ll qualify for the university’s tuition saving programs. The Sioux City university has partnered with an Student Aid Index, or SAI, estimator to allow families to input their information and learn how much aid they could potentially receive.
Peters said this was a helpful tool in allowing families to get an early jump on their college decision process before the FAFSA was released. The U.S. Department of Education announced the launch of the FAFSA Sept. 24, its earliest release date in the form’s history.
Over her nearly 25 years working at Morningside, Peters said she’s seen how the competition between colleges has changed from private universities only having to worry about other private institutions to all colleges competing against each other. It’s not an unhealthy competition, she said, there are just more options now for students to choose from and have more reasons to compare different kinds of higher education.
It’s not just other schools that Iowa universities are competing against, Johnson said, but all of the other distractions in young people’s lives as well. Marketing has become more important than ever as social media and other technology keep students’ attention, but once that attention has been drawn toward Drake, Johnson said it’s not so hard to generate interest.
“I’m happy with the things that we’re doing and putting in place so that families … don’t have to initially eliminate right away (based on) the sticker shock,” Peters said. “That’s what we have combated for years and years, and I think that we’re making some good inroads as far as that goes in showing families that we are a possibility.”

Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he has been rejected by potential nominees for vacancies on the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, whose chair is resigning after months of conflict and a threatened impeachment effort.
“We’re working as hard as we can to get those five nominees there, and we’ve interviewed an awful lot of people,” Lamont said. “To be blunt, I’ve been turned down more than a few times, too.”
There are currently two open seats at PURA, with a third soon to be created by the departure of the authority’s chair, Marissa Gillett, on Oct. 10. 
Lamont has long expressed a desire to fill those vacancies with applicants that share a similar background to Gillett — an attorney and engineer who previously worked as a staffer to utility regulators in Maryland — as opposed to more political appointees. 
The two remaining members of PURA, Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron, both served several terms in the state legislature before being appointed as regulators. (Caron, the board’s only Republican, is serving out a term that formally expired in 2022, potentially creating a fourth opening if Lamont chooses not to reappoint him.) 
“I can get five generalists on there pretty quickly, if that’s good enough for you,” Lamont said Tuesday. “I’d also like a couple of people who really can match wits with Eversource and [United Illuminating], who will hit the ground running, because we have some big dockets in front of us.”
Asked what reasons he had been given for the lack of interest in the job, Lamont pointed to “negative publicity, lawsuits,” and threats of impeachment swirling around the agency in recent months. In her resignation letter to the governor earlier this month, Gillett said the “emotional toll” on her and her family from those controversies had influenced her decision to step down.
“I did not make this decision lightly, but there is only so much that one individual can reasonably endure, or ask of their family, while doing their best to serve our state,” she wrote. 
Another factor that Lamont said was hampering his recruitment efforts is the pay scale at PURA. Salaries for commissioners range from $151,950 to $207,198, making it difficult to compete for candidates from the private sector, he said. 
“I’ve got lots of retired people would love to sit on this board, and we’ll have some of those on there, which is often our norm,” he said. “But I also need some folks who really can match wits” with the utilities, he said.
“Maybe it’s somebody who’s had a pretty good career, lot of experience, wants to give back for five years,” he added. “Maybe it’s somebody who’s really smart who started their career and thinks this is really a chance to build up their resume and make a difference for us in the meantime.”
The governor did not share the names of any of the candidates who he said had turned him down. Asked about their backgrounds, he said said they were people “who know a lot about regulation” and had “sense” about business and finance. 
Lamont will have to make at least one appointment to PURA before Oct. 10 in order to guarantee the authority a quorum of three members to issue final decisions in pending cases, his office has said. Appointees are able to serve in an interim capacity until they are confirmed by the lawmakers during the next legislative session. 
One person who is widely viewed as being under consideration by Lamont is former state Rep. Holly Cheeseman. In February, Lamont announced plans to appoint Cheeseman, a Republican, to one of the two vacancies at PURA as part of a deal to secure Gillett’s then-pending confirmation to a second four-year term.
That plan fell apart, however, due to complications involving the other planned appointee, state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford. Fonfara faced criticism over his business dealings before PURA as well as legal prohibition against joining an executive-branch agency before his Senate term expires in 2027. 
Cheeseman said this week she has not spoken recently to the governor about the position.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-CANNON-113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

ST. ALBANS CITY —- On Tuesday, Dairy Farmers of America workers showed up to strike for the sixth day on Federal Street and stood with picket signs, their backs facing the towering silos and white warehouses where they usually work. 
The workers, part of the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 union, went on strike Thursday in a push for higher pay and what they consider to be a more fair overtime work policy. Employees are asking for an 8% increase in hourly wages. And after Lt. Governor John Rodgers visited the picket line Sunday, he said in an interview that he could be getting personally involved in negotiations. 
Union members have been bargaining with the Kansas based dairy company since June, said Curtis Clough, the union’s organizer. 
Then, earlier this month, the company hired a number of temporary employees in non-union roles, which the teamsters considered to be an act of bad faith, said Dustin Reed, a teamster on strike. 
“We’re in a struggle against corporate America,” Reed said. And he feels like the little guy. 
Dairy Farmers of America reported making over $108 million in net income in 2022, with $24.5 billion in net sales that year.
The dairy company did not respond to requests for an interview and instead emailed a statement that stated they’ve been actively negotiating with the union. “We are disappointed that the Teamsters walked away from that process and have initiated a strike at the St. Albans plant,” the company wrote.

The St. Albans facility receives milk shipments and processes that milk into cream, condensed skim milk and powdered skim milk. In addition to Ben and Jerry’s, the facility sells to Kate’s Butter and others. 
Since the strike began, Clough said he estimates the facility is operating at about 10% capacity, with the temporary non-union employees filling some gaps in staffing while the strike continues. 
Clough said that transport trucks have had to dump out thousands of gallons of milk because the facility doesn’t have the capacity to process the perishable product without the union employees. 
‘They’re not asking for a lot’
Over the weekend, the strike drew the attention of Lt. Governor John Rodgers, who visited the picket line Sunday and posted a video on Facebook voicing support for their cause. 
“If we’re going to maintain healthy agriculture, we’ve got to pay the workers good, we’ve got to pay the farmers good. Everybody needs to make a living,” Rodgers said in the video. He asked “everyone” to support the teamsters’ strike and to push the dairy company to show up to the bargaining table. 
Teamsters also visited the Ben and Jerry’s Factory in Waterbury on Sunday. Union members handed out flyers to customers and visitors to make them aware of the ice cream company’s ties to their employer, Clough said. 
Reed, who lives in Enosburg and grew up on a dairy farm, has worked at the facility for 22 years. He said that, recently, managers have been forcing senior employees to work significant overtime, which violates the company’s contract with the union. Clough said some company employees rejected those claims during meetings with the union. 
Another worker on strike, Alan Boutin, doesn’t trust management. He believes he was wrongfully terminated last fall, but wasn’t re-hired until last week after the union negotiated with management for months. Throughout the process, managers made many promises they didn’t keep, he said. 
“There’s a lot of bullshit going on here. It shouldn’t be that way,” he said. 
Many workers on the picket line also said that dairy workers are notoriously underpaid. And Rodgers, who grew up on a dairy farm in the Kingdom, said he knows that to be true as well. 
Conversations with management on Monday moved things in the right direction, but still aren’t meeting workers’ needs, Clough said. They hope to include Rodgers in the process to put more pressure on the company, he said. 
In an interview, Rodgers said he offered to support the teamsters however they saw fit. 
“They’re not asking for a lot,” Rodgers said. He said that a company as large and profitable as DFA should be able to pay their workers more. Rodgers is happy to sit down at the table with them. 
“I want to see them back to work,” Rodgers said.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The Centurion Foundation, the Atlanta-based nonprofit trying to buy a pair of safety net Rhode Island hospitals, still can’t lure investors, prompting a fourth revision to the deal conditionally approved by state regulators. 
In a letter to Centurion Foundation CEO Ben Mingle on Tuesday, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha agreed to ease up on the terms his office imposed on the pending sale of Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence. A copy of the letter was shared with Rhode Island Current.
The revisions come as Centurion continues to struggle to sell the $165 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds needed to finalize its purchase of the hospitals. Credit ratings agencies highlighted “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s pending bonds in ratings assessments earlier this year.
The bond amount reflects the $80 million purchase price plus an $80 million cash injection into the struggling hospitals’ balance sheets — one of 85 conditions state regulators imposed in granting conditional approval of the sale in June 2024. The proposed change in ownership, and corresponding switch from for profit to nonprofit status, requires the sign off of state regulators under the state’s Hospital Conversion Act.
Neronha has already pulled back on certain regulatory and financial conditions three times in an effort to help Centurion sell the bonds and close the deal and keep the safety net hospitals open.
Their existing owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Dallas in January. If the sale to Centurion falls through, the Rhode Island hospitals risk shuttering or being sold as assets in an out-of-state federal bankruptcy proceeding. 
“If you want to ask why I keep betting against myself in the Centurion transaction, that’s why,” Neronha said at an unrelated press conference Tuesday. “The alternative is worse than that.”
He continued, “Prospect, you know, wants to close these hospitals. They want to close them right now. That’s what I am trying to avoid.”
The two hospitals, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
The long-delayed deal is now expected to close Oct. 31, assuming Centurion can sell the bonds under the revised terms. 
“I suspect if they didn’t close by the end of October, that will be the death knell for the transaction,” Neronha said.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, did not return inquiries for comment on Tuesday.

– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha 


In July, Neronha agreed to cut the upfront cash requirement from $80 million to $45 million, giving Centurion 90 days after the deal closed to come up with the remaining $35 million. But that was still not enough.
Centurion told Neronha that even the more lenient financial conditions “have frustrated its ability to obtain sufficient bond financing,” the letter states.
Now, Neronha will shave off another $9 million from the upfront cash requirement, reducing the initial injection to $36 million. He also granted Centurion’s request to waive the condition that it invest another $35 million in the first 90 days. 
However, like prior revisions, there are strings attached.
“Stop interrupting my vacation,” Neronha said Tuesday when asked what new protections he imposed.
His letter proved more illustrative, outlining two new conditions tied to the waiver. 
One cuts $10 million from the sale profits that will be transferred to federal bankruptcy court in Dallas to fulfill Prospect’s obligations to creditors. The other specifies that Centurion has to spend its own money – versus bond sale proceeds – to cover $1.5 million of the closing costs. They must wait at least six months before tapping $2 million of bond sale proceeds for additional administrative costs. If Centurion meets the previous requirement of a $45 million cash injection for hospital operations, the cost deferral is not required. 
Neronha said Tuesday he denied a request from Centurion seeking the state’s help to cover the sale. Details, including the amount requested, were not immediately available. 
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey put up $700 million in state incentives and taxpayer money to lure buyers for a string of hospitals at risk of closing under the bankrupt Steward Health Care. That included St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River and Morton Hospital in Taunton, which Brown University Health bought for $175 million last year.
John Fernandez, CEO of Brown University Health, reiterated Tuesday that the health system had no interest in buying Roger Williams and Fatima because of their financial struggles.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)TWIN BRIDGES – Brian Wheeler has spent a fair bit of the last six years wearing waders in the middle of the Big Hole River documenting river conditions and collecting samples of macroinvertebrates.
Put simply, the river guide and conservationist has spent a lot of time scrubbing rocks and collecting bugs in small sections of the Big Hole River. Their relative abundance helps show river health, he said in late September while crouched over his sampling gear at a site near Twin Bridges.
Fish populations have been declining in some of Montana’s most famous rivers, and Wheeler is part of a growing number of people trying to figure out why. The undammed Big Hole River is one of Montana’s precious gems, known for its renowned fishing and breathtaking beauty.
“If we’ve learned anything across the nation with resource destruction, it’s these places aren’t just automatically gonna stay that way forever,” Wheeler said. “They take active work to preserve.”

Wheeler is Save Wild Trout’s program director, an organization that merged with the Big Hole River Foundation earlier this year. His organization also works with Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, and Wheeler got into the work with Trout Unlimited in Dillon, where he lives.
Save Wild Trout and its partner organizations have a fairly straightforward goal: Find out what is behind declining trout populations in southwestern Montana. Their method is to try and collect data state agencies aren’t and then give that data to those agencies.
More importantly, they want to give the state data it can accept as scientifically valid.
“We researched like, ‘OK, what are their protocols? What lab do they use? What are the scientific metrics that we have thresholds for, like nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen?’” Wheeler said.
He added: “You can’t manage what you don’t measure, and there’s some serious measurement gaps.”
Wheeler said their organization — which includes scientist Kyle Flynn — works with the Department of Environmental Quality on standards for their data. Flynn formerly worked for DEQ and has more than a decade of water quality experience.
This summer, Save Wild Trout released a report showing warm temperatures and low oxygen levels in the Jefferson River Basin. Water temperatures at 77 degrees can kill fish within hours and the river reached 80 degrees in the summer of 2024, the report noted. Low oxygen levels at night, which can be caused by algae blooms, are also a concern – most plants don’t photosynthesize at night.

They observed four rivers (The Big Hole, Beaverhead, Ruby and Madison rivers) during 2023 and 2024 for the study, efforts that included hundreds of miles of overhead flights with thermal imaging equipment mounted on a helicopter.
The data collection is not always glamorous. Wheeler did a quick estimate with his phone calculator, saying he’s done about 200 bug samples since the project began in 2019. 
At sites along the Big Hole, he goes out to a spot in the water, trying to keep it as random as possible. Once he’s picked a site, he puts down his sampling contraption. There’s multiple types of macroinvertebrate sampling, and he does his work with a Hess stream bottom sampler. 
The sampler is about as large as a chili pot and is connected to a net that funnels into a sample cup. He puts the device in the water, crouches down and holds it in place.
He then uses a brush and begins to scrub rocks, and the current of the river pushes anything that comes off into the net. Tiny creatures, including midges and salmon flies, live on, around and under those rocks. They all play a part in the food web, Wheeler said, and their abundance is information that might help explain problems with larger aquatic organisms.
And it’s not just fish impacted by warmer temperatures and less oxygen in the water; other creatures are too.

“A healthy river for aquatic life is a healthy river for the rest of us,” Wheeler said. “Like, it’s why we collect bugs. This is, like the foundational health indicator of a river.”
Once the large rocks in the area he’s sampling are cleaned off he makes sure anything crawling inside the net is knocked into the sample cup. He likes to joke the clean rocks are creating spawn habitat for trout, which brush off rocks in efforts to create better areas to lay their eggs.
“I also like to think that if I scrub rocks, I did half the work for them creating their spawning reds,” Wheeler said.
With the contraption over his arm, he trudges back to shore and prepares the samples in several meticulous steps.
“Man, it’s not sexy, dude,” Wheeler said of the work.
An alcohol solution is used to preserve the samples, which are later sent to entomologists at River Continuum Concepts in Manhattan. Wheeler, who does not trust shipping companies to deliver the samples, drives them over to Gallatin County himself. 
The research has already netted a 178-page report on macroinvertebrates in the Big Hole River, covering 2019 to 2022, authored by Brett Marshall with River Continuum Concepts. The hope is to put out a 10-year report in a couple years, Wheeler said.
The sampling process at any one site can take multiple hours, especially when driving time is included. Wheeler puts hundreds of miles on his Tundra truck every year, often along Montana’s many backroads.
In September, Wheeler was also picking up what they called “data loggers,” which record several river conditions and were one of the main data collection tools for the report Save Wild Trout released in the summer.
They aren’t cheap, and Wheeler has resorted to camouflaging the loggers, which have been vandalized and in one case stolen. 
“If you’ve got a resource that’s struggling because people make their living on it, people appreciate it beyond the economic value or the ecological value,” Wheeler said. “So I mean, it’s kind of hard to avoid getting a bit emotional.”
There is very real tension and frustration over the river.
Ranchers have water rights and need water for their cattle. Extended drought has caused agricultural producers across the country trouble rebuilding their herds. Some ranchers have voluntarily put water back in the river, Wheeler said, but others don’t and that’s their legal right.

Guides and outfitters, who rely on the world-renowned trout fishing in the area to support their livelihoods, have a major stake in the river, too.
Some communities, like Butte, also pull water out of rivers in the area, Wheeler said. Irrigators — there are some crops near the river — are also part of the puzzle.
The fish population issue caught the attention of the Governor’s Office in 2023, which resulted in Gov. Greg Gianforte holding a summer meeting in Wise River with various river stakeholders.
A lot of ranchers and irrigators showed up to that, Wheeler said, and not as many anglers. He kept his comments short on the whole thing.
“I thought it was a lost opportunity for some broad representation,” Wheeler said.
That meeting did result in a yet-to-be-released study into fish mortality on the river.
This is an effort through Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which is coordinating with researchers at Montana State University. Researchers at the school are expected to submit annual fish mortality reports until 2028, when three doctoral students at MSU are expected to finish their dissertations, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Morgan Jacobsen wrote in an email on Tuesday.

“In addition to the dissertations, MSU is expected to provide a final report including the raw data and analysis code as well as submit three manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication,” Jacobsen wrote.
It is an ongoing project and Save Wild Trout, which meets several times per year with FWP, is coordinating their work with that state agency, too. Those meetings, along with the organization’s work with DEQ, allow conversations to take place on the issue between the state and organizations like Save Wild Trout.
As part of the fish mortality effort, FWP is also tagging fish. Similar efforts have been undertaken in Idaho to study effects of hatchery-reared sturgeon on the Snake River.
“Ultimately, tagging allows biologists to track individual fish, which provides insight into movement, survival, and growth throughout the life of a fish,” Jacobsen wrote.
That is often done by electrocuting and stunning fish, which can kill fish on occasion. Recently, a tagging effort by FWP apparently killed some fish in the Big Hole River.
“While we didn’t see any immediate mortality during this fish sampling effort, clearly there was some impact,” Jacobsen wrote. “Moving forward, conditions and population abundances will need to be significantly better in the next year or two for us to consider a fall sampling event on the Big Hole.”
FWP is also actively working with irrigators to improve efficiency, work with power companies on things like the Madison River Drought Plan and identify areas ripe for restoration. FWP is also closely working with Montana State researchers on the trout issue.
“Although those efforts are not considered research, they address some of the issues associated with the MSU research,” Jacobsen wrote. “Other FWP staff and partners are working with existing data and past environmental conditions to better understand exactly how water temperatures and flows influence recruitment of juvenile trout and adult survival, which will complement the ongoing MSU studies.”

The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, along with DEQ, is part of what Wheeler called a “three legged stool” of government oversight of Montana watersheds. There’s also only so much money and manpower, with Wheeler saying resources can only extend so far.
That’s where organizations like Save Wild Trout can help fill in gaps, he said. The organization receives some state grants, but most of its work is funded through donations. Reports, even with some volunteer hours working on them, are still expensive, Wheeler said.
The sampling device Wheeler uses is not cheap either, which is why the organization only has one. Gas is pricey too, and between running people down the river as a guide and collecting data, he does not have a ton of free time in the summer.
But this work is important, he said, and he sees a lot of value in the data they’re gathering. Even if it comes at cost to his knees and back.
“We started this program, we didn’t know if the river was better, worse or the same as it has been 20 years ago, because there was no data to show that,” Wheeler said. “And so I think about the next person, you know, the next iteration of me in this role, at least that person will have a historic record to compare against.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BigHole1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

On Tuesday, Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward and acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio sent a letter to Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and lawmakers from both parties saying that there were still unanswered questions about the protection of personal health data, the use of the scanners in certain situations and overall protocols. 
The body scanners, similar to those used by TSA at airports, are part of a pilot program at Manson Youth Institution and York Correctional Institution, the state women’s prison. They were scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1. 
But Quiros agreed to pause the implementation of the scanners until he was able to meet with Ghio and Ward to address their concerns, according to an email to CT Mirror from Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction. 
“In light of this upcoming meeting, the DOC will continue to review and refine its policies as they relate to the use of the body scanners,” Banevicius wrote. 
Criminal Justice reform advocates have long been advocating for body scanners as a less invasive solution to strip searches. In February, advocates reiterated their call at a press conference memorializing the 2018 death of J’Allen Jones, who died after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as nine correction workers. Jones had refused to submit to a strip search. 
Data showed that the department conducted about 355,000 strip searches on incarcerated people in 2024.
The state Bonding Commission put aside funding for four body scanners in August.
In the letter, Ward and Ghio underscored that it needs to be clear that the purpose of the body scanners is to use them to reduce the number of strip searches. Ward told CT Mirror that he’d seen a social media post by the union representing correction officers that made him question whether everyone understood the purpose of the scanners in the same way. He said the post seemed to indicate that correction officers viewed the scanners as a way to enhance surveillance of incarcerated people, with a particular focus on detecting drugs. Advocates, on the other hand, viewed the scanners as a means to reduce strip searches. 
“I think the bridge between those two interpretations leaves a world of potential misunderstanding and misuse by staff,” Ward said. 
In the post, the union lists the body scanners as one of several “practical and effective solutions” that would “address the growing crisis of drugs entering our state correctional facilities.”
A spokesperson for AFSCME local 391, which represents correction officers, did not respond to a request for comment from CT Mirror. 
Ghio told CT Mirror that the Office of the Child Advocate supported the use of body scanners but said that policies needed to be “well thought through and clarified” before the department started to use the machines. She said it needed to be “crystal clear” how often the scanners are allowed to be used on an individual person. 
In meetings with the legislature’s budget committee in February and March, Quiros said he believed the body scanners were “100% better” than strip searches at identifying contraband. He said he supported the use of body scanners for department staff as well as the incarcerated population. Union representatives, however, have cast doubt on the efficacy of the scanners and said they don’t support requiring corrections staff to pass through them. 
Ward and Ghio’s letter also raised concerns around how the scanners would be used on pregnant women or people who have insulin pumps or pacemakers. The advocates said it was unclear how often the scanners would be used, and what kind of radiation incarcerated individuals — particularly children and teens — would be exposed to. And if contraband was found through a scanner, it’s not clear what would happen after.
“Transparent and consistent procedures must also be established for circumstances in which contraband is suspected, so that both residents and staff understand what steps will follow a scan,” the letter read. 
They also questioned how the data and images collected by the scanners would be stored, and who would be able to access them. Ward told CT Mirror that the scans will allow corrections officers to view protected health information about incarcerated individuals, since the scans reveal images of someone’s body. 
Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary CT and a strong advocate for the scanners, told CT Mirror that she shared many of the concerns that Ward and Ghio outlined in the letter. She said she agreed that there needed to be a meeting with the Department of Correction to discuss those points. 
State Rep. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror that if people want to create a policy for the use of the body scanners, they should be able to do so “relatively quickly.” 
Ghio and Ward asked the Department of Correction to convene a meeting no later than Oct. 15 to discuss the body scanners.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

University of Missouri System President Mun Choi’s call for a campaign to address crime in Columbia earned support Monday but few details emerged on how it would play out.


Support ranged from Gov. Mike Kehoe to several members of the Columbia City Council and Mayor Barbara Buffaloe, who has agreed to form a community task force to address crime following the early morning incident on Saturday that left a woman dead and two wounded.


Stephens College student Aiyanna Williams died Sunday at University Hospital. Williams was on East Broadway at 1:40 a.m. when a shooter fired into the crowd that she was in.
The criminal process began Monday for Misael Covarrubias when he made his first court appearance in connection to the shooting. He is charged with three counts of first-degree assault, three counts of armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon causing death or injury.


Covarrubias is being held in Boone County Jail. He has a hearing scheduled for Oct. 7 and a preliminary hearing on Nov. 6.


In a Facebook post Monday evening, Williams’ family thanked the community for support, but called for space to grieve.


“I have already asked, at my daughter’s memorial, that her death not be turned into a political statement,” the post said. “That request has not been respected. We are grieving our daughter. We’re not furthering anyone’s agenda.”


“There is a crime crisis in Columbia,” Choi said during a news conference at Jesse Hall. “And that’s why I called on the mayor, the city manager and the prosecuting attorney to take immediate and long-term actions.”


 City leaders respond to Saturday’s shooting



While the mayor and other top city officials were in meetings throughout the day and declined interview requests, some council members expressed support for a renewed focus on crime in response to the fatal shooting on Saturday.


Third Ward councilperson Jacque Sample said she agrees with Choi’s encouragement of collaboration between the Columbia and MU Police departments to jointly patrol the city.


“I support his support of the Police Department,” said Sample. “We have increased our police numbers, and I believe the chief is doing a good job of making sure that her team is where they need to be.”
In regard to the police response on Saturday, “police can’t predict the future or the behaviors of people who choose to do bad things. Their response time was there, and they were able to immediately detain and arrest the person,” Sample said.


Fourth Ward Councilperson Nick Foster said increased police presence alone won’t solve the issue.


“I believe that presence of law enforcement does deter some crime, but it doesn’t deter all of it,” Foster said. “We are not going to police our way to eliminating violent crime or crime of any kind.”


The Columbia Police Department brought in additional officers on overtime pay to try and prevent shootings like the one that took place on Saturday. However, Fifth Ward Councilperson Don Waterman said that an increased police presence is helpful but won’t stop every incident.


“You could have a cop on every corner, I don’t know that it’s absolutely going to prevent it,” Waterman said. “It’s tragic.”


Still, he said the increase in size the police force has seen over the past few years is positive.


“(Columbia Police) Chief (Jill) Schlude said in her budget request that she’d like to see 50 new officers over the next few years,” Waterman said. “It’s not gonna stop it completely, but I believe it would maybe give some individuals pause.”


Sample said the city is making strides toward increasing police presence downtown.
“I do think that there’s certain times that we do need additional police officers in certain spaces such as downtown, and they’re working on tracking those trends and putting people in places where they need to be,” Sample said.
Choi, Schlude, University of Missouri Police Department Chief Brian Weimer and other university officials met with Buffaloe on Monday afternoon to discuss next steps.
In a Monday night Facebook post, Buffaloe said there have been 58 confirmed incidents of gun shots fired in Columbia during the first nine months of this year. This is compared to 105 during the first nine months of last year.



Buffaloe attributed this to the city’s “proactive policing efforts,” but acknowledged that police presence is not the only action needed to prevent violence. She added that the shooting this weekend occurred despite police officers being “directly in the area.”


In the post, Buffaloe also referred to the incident as “senseless gun violence” and pledged her commitment to “reduce violence (and) address homelessness.”


In an emailed statement, Kehoe’s office confirmed that he had been in contact with Choi and local leaders “regarding the crime crisis plaguing Columbia.”


“As public safety and cracking down on crime remains his top priority, Governor Kehoe will continue to consider options to assist Columbia and communities across the state to address crime,” the statement said.


In an emailed statement, Columbia College Senior Vice President and Provost Sandra Hamar said college students “deserve to feel safe both on campus and throughout our city.”


She expressed the college’s support for Choi “who, along with many community leaders, is seeking meaningful change to ensure the safety of our city.”


 Choi makes demands of city



In an email to Mizzou faculty, staff and students on Saturday, Choi called for a variety of steps ranging from more policing downtown to the elimination of policies and practices that “attract criminals.” He also suggested calling on state support to fight crime in Columbia.


Sample expressed some need for caution when it comes to state involvement.


“I think we need to find what getting involved is,” she said. “I do not think they should be directive in how our city addresses it, but I would very much welcome a partnership and collaboration.”


While Choi had called for changing some policies, he had no specifics when asked about those on Monday.


“If there’s a particular policy that he is concerned about drawing crime, then I think that needs to be said out loud so that it can be appropriately investigated and addressed by the city,” Sample said. “As we move forward, we do have a lot of work to do and we need community.”


Foster also questioned Choi’s comment about city policies.


“I think the suggestion that there are policies that attract a criminal element to our city, and that city leadership is responsible for that, is disappointing,” he said.


Foster emphasized the need to address underlying factors that can lead to an increase in crime, such as poverty, generational trauma and a lack of access to adequate mental health services. He added that supporting the Office of Violence Prevention and other similar work that is being done in neighborhoods throughout the community is imperative.


During the news conference, Choi referenced crime numbers, which he said were provided by Schlude, showing crime against property is up 40%. According to the Columbia Police Department, crimes against property includes robbery, larceny, burglary and motor vehicle theft. The Police Department confirmed that crimes against property are up in the area. However, the city’s crime trends dashboard shows crimes against property are down compared to last year.


Foster noted that the latest report the council received from the Police Department included year-to-date data that showed a 6% increase in violent crime and an overall 29% decrease in firearm-related incidents.


First Ward Councilperson Valorie Carroll urged that “we take time to acknowledge the victims and the families.”


“It feels rather sudden to me,” she said about Choi’s call for emergency action.


“I’m afraid that we have moved past this too quickly into a politically charged narrative in a way that does a disservice to the communities involved,” she added.


Sample and Foster emphasized the community’s need to support Williams’ family in their loss.


”The focus needs to really be on the family that lost their loved one. This is not over for them, and the community needs to show love and comfort to that family,” Sample said.

Free.,Fake video of Dem leaders posted by Trump draws fire amid shutdown fight,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fake-video-dem-leaders-posted-trump-draws-fire-amid-shutdown-fight,,"WASHINGTON — A group of Democratic caucus leaders on Tuesday blasted a vulgar deepfake of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries posted by President Donald Trump on social media. The chairs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Democratic Women’s Caucus, New Democrat Coalition, Congressional Progressive Caucus and Congressional Equality Caucus also refused to back down on their health care demands as the federal government barrels toward a shutdown.The GOP and Democratic lawmakers are in a deadlock, and funding is set to run out by midnight Tuesday, when the new fiscal year begins.“We won’t vote for anything that doesn’t restore the cuts to Medicaid and doesn’t protect people that will be paying higher premiums,” Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Adriano Espaillat said at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol, referring to Medicaid reductions made in the “big, beautiful” law enacted by Republicans earlier this year.The New York Democrat said “we won’t mess around with Americans’ health care — people that are sick that deserve to have a first-quality health care system providing assistance to them in one of the most serious periods of their lives.” While Republicans want a “clean” stopgap funding bill to keep the government open, Democrats are calling for the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025 and the reversal of sweeping health care changes brought by the GOP’s mega tax and spending cuts law, including the massive funding cuts to Medicaid. ‘Racist meme’ by Trump slammedTrump posted the deepfake on his social media platform Truth Social just hours after his White House meeting with Schumer, Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, which failed to yield any funding deal. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Tuesday that some 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed if the government shuts down. The 35-second video appears to be AI-generated and uses the setting of Schumer and Jeffries, both New York Democrats, speaking to reporters outside the White House after their meeting with Trump. The fake video shows Jeffries with a sombrero and mustache and Schumer ranting that “if we give all these illegal aliens free health care, we might be able to get them on our side so they can vote for us.” Espaillat of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus described the video as “insulting,” saying it shows Trump is “out of touch with the health care challenges of the American people.” The New York Democrat said “with your health care on the line, all he could do is put out this deepfake racist meme — not funny at all, not for any of us here, particularly for people that are ill and fighting for their lives that need health care.” Democratic Women’s Caucus Chair Teresa Leger Fernández also blasted the video, saying “that’s not how you get to a deal.” Instead, the New Mexico Democrat said Trump’s decision to post it “looks like a little 6-year-old having a temper tantrum.” 'Bigotry will get you nowhere'Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, a New York Democrat, said “the juvenile behavior coming out of the White House should not be dignified by any American.”   Clarke noted that her caucus “will not support a partisan spending bill that slashes health care, guts federal jobs and raises costs, all while targeting the very communities that keep this country running.” In a social media post Monday responding to the fabricated video, Schumer said “if you think your shutdown is a joke, it just proves what we all know: You can’t negotiate.

An E. coli bacterial impairment in Lander Creek, which passes through livestock lobbyist Jim Magagna’s grazing allotment and ranch, would swing back toward compliance with the Clean Water Act under a state proposal.
The post Wyoming tries again to delist remote Wind River Range stream for fecal contamination appeared first on WyoFile .","A decade-plus-long fight over potentially hazardous levels of fecal bacteria in a scenic Sweetwater River tributary may be closer to ending — at least on paper — if a Wyoming proposal to reclassify the stream and change regulatory thresholds goes through.
At issue is Lander Creek, a small stream along the southwest tip of the Wind River Range that has seen on-again, off-again environmental impairment listings for a strain of intestinal bacteria that can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach pains when ingested. The waterway’s noncompliance with the Clean Water Act directly traces to Cora-based environmental activist Jonathan Ratner, who in 2010 submitted water quality samples that led to its initial impairment. 
Reached Monday in India while convalescing from a bike wreck, Ratner said he’s not surprised by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality’s current proposal, which reasons that an impaired stretch of Lander Creek ought to be held to less-stringent E. coli standards because it’s seldom-used and too small for immersive recreation. 
“They will do anything to avoid admitting that there is tons of cow shit in our water,” Ratner said. “I’ve collected E. coli data across multiple states over multiple decades, and basically there is no place where cows have access to a waterbody and it does not violate Clean Water Act standards.”
Ratner’s involvement in the Lander Creek saga has directly caused its yo-yo-like impairment status. 
After the Wyoming DEQ first recognized its waters to be unfit for recreation back in 2012, Lander Creek’s and two other streams’ impairments were undone when the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, Wyoming Stock Growers Association and Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts voiced concern that the samples came from Ratner, who then worked for the Western Watersheds Project, a livestock-focused and combative environmental advocacy group. Explaining the reversal, state regulators reasoned that Ratner’s incubating machine was “self-made” and “wasn’t certified” and produced questionable results.

At the time, the Wyoming Stock Growers Association’s executive vice president, Jim Magagna, specifically took issue with Lander Creek, asking that its listing be scrapped. The stream flows through his state land grazing allotment, where Ratner took his sample.  
“Of utmost importance to us, this sample was taken while trespassing on state lands,” Magagna wrote to the DEQ in 2013. “The only authorized public access to state lands off of a public right of way is … for the exclusive purposes of hunting, fishing, and ‘casual recreational uses.’” 
That dispute precipitated a change to state trespass laws criminalizing data collection, including photography, on private and “open” land. That law, however, was challenged in court and ultimately found to be unconstitutional and repealed. 
Other regulatory changes related to Ratner’s grazing-focused water quality sampling followed. 
The Wyoming DEQ updated its sampling requirements, making it more difficult for individuals and non-governmental organizations to assist in water quality monitoring.  
Then, in 2015, the DEQ categorically relaxed E. coli standards for streams with modeled average flows of less than six cubic feet of water per second. For the last decade, those waters statewide have had a regulatory threshold for fecal coliform bacteria that’s five times higher than it used to be. The state agency’s rationale is that immersive, full-body recreation wasn’t possible in the smaller streams, and so higher concentrations of fecal constituents should be allowed. 
Environmental regulators took samples from Lander Creek in June, July and August 2016 to verify findings that came out of Ratner’s samples. The water was noncompliant, registering an average of 318 bacterial organisms per 100 milligrams — about 2.5 times the safety criteria. The stream reappeared as having E. coli issues in Wyoming DEQ’s 2020 impaired water report.

Two other streams that Ratner had previously sampled were tested again, but both were found to be compliant with the new, less-stringent E. coli threshold for low-flow waters. Pacific Creek, another Wind River Range drainage, was assessed and cleared and so was Clarks Draw, a diminutive Hoback River tributary. Data from the assessments show that both would have been listed as E. coli-impaired using the DEQ’s earlier, more stringent regulatory threshold. 
Lander Creek was listed as impaired because modeling suggested it carried too much water and should be subject to E. coli standards more protective of human health. 
That’s a judgment that the Sublette County Conservation District disagreed with. The county-funded organization conducted the sampling and analysis on Lander Creek, using a Wyoming Department of Agriculture water quality grant.
Responding in writing to Lander Creek’s proposed listing in 2020, the conservation district successfully convinced the state to trim the length of impaired waters from 6.3 miles to 2.5 miles, arguing that low volumes above a tributary named Ord Creek should subject that section of stream to the less stringent E. coli standard.

A 2.5-mile-long stretch of Lander Creek is considered unfit for “primary contact recreation” because of E. coli contamination. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality originally sought to classify 6.3 miles of the stream as impaired, but reduced the length of polluted stream after a request from the Sublette County Conservation District. Now the state agency is proposing to remove the impairment entirely. (Wyoming DEQ)
The conservation district also asked Wyoming DEQ to reevaluate the lower stream for its recreational potential, a request that led to the state’s current proposal. Mike Henn, who manages the district, said that his intent is not to circumvent the Clean Water Act. 
“It’s not like we were pinpointing Lander Creek and trying to get it off [the list] by trying to find a loophole,” Henn told WyoFile. “The model was not accurate.”
Henn disagreed with Ratner that the situation was a clear-cut case of livestock polluting Lander Creek. 
“Grazing is not the only source of E. coli,” Henn said. He listed other sources: “Wildlife, recreation, humans, canines.” 
Not far away in the region, breathtaking Lonesome Lake — where few livestock tread, but people swarm — is being investigated for a potential E. coli impairment.

Environmental regulators’ proposal for Lander Creek is outlined in a “use attainability analysis,” which is a “relatively uncommon” maneuver for the state agency, according to Eric Hargett, DEQ’s assistant supervisor for surface water monitoring. The DEQ last prepared one in 2011 covering 11 waterbodies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to it, redesignating those streams and subjecting them to the less-stringent E. coli standards. 
Wyoming DEQ’s analysis argues that “full body contact water recreation is not attainable” in Lander Creek. 
“Field observations and surveys indicated that fishing, camping, wading, and picnicking were minimal along the 2.5-mile segment, and with no reports of full body contact water recreation such as swimming or child’s play,” the document states.
Magagna, whose land and grazing allotment are bisected by Lander Creek, agrees. 
“I’ve not seen primary recreation taking place there — swimming or getting in the stream,” Magagna told WyoFile. “It’s rare to see anybody even camping near that part of the stream.”

Not everybody in the neighborhood is on the same page. A landowner survey appended to Wyoming DEQ’s analysis includes a statement from an unnamed person — their identity was redacted — who stated that fishing and camping take place there. 
“I see a lot of camping and picnicking and wading,” the landowner wrote. 
Wyoming DEQ is accepting feedback on its proposal until Oct. 22. Comments can be submitted through the agency’s electronic portal.  
Ratner, for one, won’t be weighing in. It’s not because he’s out of the country, dealing with broken ribs and nerve damage. After years of tussling with state authorities over livestock grazing’s impacts on water quality, he gave up the fight. 
“It was such a torrential downpour of effort to avoid complying with the Clean Water Act that I just gave up on Wyoming,” he said. “I just couldn’t take it.”

(Photo illustration by Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch, with receipt and signage from U.S. District Court filings)The Casey’s convenience-store chain is facing a potential class-action lawsuit alleging it overcharges consumers by advertising in-store discounts that aren’t applied to purchases at the cash register.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, names Casey’s Retail Co., Casey’s General Stores Inc., and Casey’s Marketing Co. as defendants. The companies operate more than 2,500 convenience stores in Iowa and 15 other states.
In court filings, Casey’s has yet to respond to the basic allegations in the lawsuit, but has asserted that if each of the chain’s 2,500 stores “failed to give just one $2.76 discount per day” from August 2023 to the present, the compensatory damages in the case would total $5,043,900.

In a written statement, a spokesperson for Casey’s said, “We are aware of the allegations and intend to vigorously defend against them. We will respond formally through the legal process.”
Attorneys for the plaintiff, Kit Mason of Allerton, are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, alleging Casey’s uses in-store signage at store locations to promote product discounts that the stores then fail to apply to customers’ purchases.
Among the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit:
— On July 10, 2025, Mason visited a Casey’s store in Humeston, where the store promoted a “2 for $4” special on 24-ounce cans of Four Loko flavored alcoholic beverages. At the cash register, the lawsuit claims, Mason was charged $7 rather than $4.
— On July 20, 2025, Mason visited a Casey’s store in Corydon, where the store promoted a “2 for $6” special on 24-ounce cans of Smirnoff Ice alcoholic beverages. At checkout, Mason was allegedly charged $7 rather than $6.
— On Aug. 19, 2025, Mason visited a Casey’s store in Urbandale, where Blue Moon beverages that were normally priced at $3.50 and $4.29 were promoted through a discount that offered $3 off the combined purchase of any three 19-ounce cans. At the cash register, the $3 discount was not applied, the lawsuit claims.
Each of the in-store signs promoting the discounts allegedly state the “instant rebates” are “automatically given at register,” with no indication that membership in the Casey’s Reward Program is required.
While most of the alleged examples cited in the lawsuit pertain to alcoholic beverages, some are specific to food items, such as a “2 for $5” special on bagged candy. The lawsuit claims that at the cash register, the bags rang up at $5.99 each.
“Similar misleading in-store advertisements were present across the defendants’ network of stores …,” the lawsuit alleges, including but not limited to those in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuit, Casey’s competitors, such as Kum & Go, Kwik Trip and Kwik Star, have similar in-store promotions but their advertised sale prices are reflected in the customers’ final bill.
The lawsuit seeks damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair or deceptive acts.
The lawsuit also seeks an injunction barring Casey’s from “not applying the advertised discounts at the register as promised,” and prohibiting Casey’s from collecting taxes on the amounts that should have been discounted.
The lawsuit was originally filed in Polk County District Court before being moved this week to federal court.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Izaak Walton League of America’s Iowa division has started a grassroots campaign to raise funds for a water quality monitoring program, formerly funded by the state, at the University of Iowa.
The Iowa Water Quality Information System, or IWQIS, gives real-time measures of pH, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, discharge rates and temperature in streams across the state. But funding for the program was diverted by the state Legislature in 2023 and the system is poised to shut down if funding doesn’t come through by July 2026. 
Dale Braun, president of the Iowa Division of the Izaak Walton League of America, said the monitoring network plays a “vital role” in protecting public health and “environmental resilience” for rural and municipal water systems.

“Without it, Iowans lose transparency and accountability during a worsening water quality crisis,” Braun said in a news release. 
Larry Weber, director of hydroscience and engineering in the College of Engineering at UI, said the IWQIS program received about $500,000 from Iowa State University’s Nutrient Research Center, until the 2023 state budget for agriculture and natural resources diverted the funds. 
Weber said IWQS, which put out its own sensors and collected data from water quality sensors managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey, was the best collection of real-time water quality data in the state. 
“Not only in this state, but in any state,” Weber said. “What we’ve built here is really best in class in terms of water quality monitoring and information sharing.” 
Weber said IWQIS is often looked at as “telling the bad side of the story” because it highlights spots along Iowa streams that have high concentrations of nitrate, or other nutrients. But, he said, the monitoring also shows where water quality initiatives are making a difference and reducing the concentration of nutrients in Iowa waterways. 
Weber said the system was able to secure part-time funding through the Walton Family Foundation, which will keep it running until the beginning of July 2026. 
“If we’re not able to find replacement funding … the water quality information system will be shut down,” Weber said. 
The Izaak Walton League initiative aims to raise $500,000, which it said would keep the network running at its “most basic capacity.” Funding at $600,000, the news release noted, would allow the program to fully fund its operations while renewing equipment and supporting professional data work. 
“We’re very appreciative of what they’re doing,” Weber said of the Izaak Walton League campaign, noting it was independent of the UI department. “We would happily accept those funds to help our program.” 
At its peak, Weber said, the system put out about 60 sensors, which were complemented by the nearly 30 sensors USDA and USGS have on Iowa rivers. 
Right now, Weber said IWQIS has reduced the number of sensors it puts out to about 50 — if funding doesn’t come through, all of those sensors will be pulled, leaving just around 30 in place from the federal agencies. 
As part of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia task force, Midwestern states, including Iowa, are meant to reduce the concentrations of nutrients entering the Mississippi River. 
Weber said as nitrate levels in Iowa streams continue to be high, as noted by the IWQIS data, the state is headed “in the wrong direction.” 
The fundraising efforts will be highlighted at the upcoming Iowa Nature Summit at Drake University. 
Neil Hamilton, the summit’s organizer, said the fundraising project is “critical.” 
“One of our core goals is to identify concrete actions Iowans can take to protect our natural resources,” Hamilton said in the news release with Izaak Walton League. “Funding the water monitors gives us the information needed to make smarter decisions about improving Iowa’s water quality.”

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Gov. Gretchen Whitmer reportedly told state employees in an email that their jobs would be unaffected by the ongoing state budget negotiations considering the Michigan Legislature has not yet passed a consensus budget into the mid-afternoon on Tuesday – the final day of the current fiscal year.
While the email, which was shared with Michigan Advance, projected confidence in a budget being completed soon, there were still rumors swirling that a continuation budget might be in order to keep the government open as plans are finalized in the coming days.
Gongwer News Service, a Lansing political newsletter and intelligence service, was first to report the existence of the email.
“As you woke up this morning, got ready, dropped your kids off at school, and went to work, I know you might be feeling a lot of uncertainty about the state budget,” Whitmer wrote. “You’re wondering what the daily churn of news means for you, your family, and your finances. I wanted to tell you directly about the work we’re doing to keep government up and running and pass a state budget as soon as possible.”
Whitmer said that the House and the Senate have an agreement to pass a full fiscal year budget, and that all state government operations would continue as normal on Wednesday, Oct. 1.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The governor, however, said that the government would stay open as the budget was finalized throughout the week, which signaled that lawmakers might not be done with negotiations or produce a final budget this evening.
No one in the state government has plainly said that the government planned to shut down tomorrow. 
The last time the government shut down was in 2007 and 2009, but only for a few hours because the respective chambers of the Legislature and then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm approved a continuation resolution of current year spending to keep dollars and operations flowing.
A message seeking comment from the Michigan State Employees Association was not returned at the time of publication. The president of UAW Local 6000, one of the largest state employee unions, told Michigan Public Radio that they received word from Whitmer that there will be either a budget deal or some short-term extension of the current budget to tide the state over.
Whitmer in the late afternoon on Tuesday was seen meeting with state Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton), the House minority floor leader, and state Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn), who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, as negotiations continue.

Susan Collins said. “The GAO has found seven instances in which the rescissions violate the act and it has standing to sue.”Collins, R-Maine, also told reporters that she doesn’t agree with the Supreme Court’s decision last week on its emergency docket that allows the Trump administration to cancel $4 billion in foreign aid. “I disagree with the Supreme Court's temporary decision, but it was not a decision that delved into the merits of the case,” Collins said. “That's yet to come.”Collins, one of the more vocal members of her party over preserving Congress’ constitutional power of the purse, said “Well, let’s see,” when asked if she expects the GAO, a government watchdog agency, would win a lawsuit over the Trump administration impounding funds. The GAO and White House budget office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Funds frozen for libraries, medical research, FEMARepublicans in Congress have been either supportive or relatively quiet about the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze or cancel funding approved by Congress. The GAO has cited the Trump administration for illegally impounding funding for electric vehicle charging, museums and libraries, Head Start, energy efficiency upgrades in K-12 schools, funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., released a statement earlier this week rebuking the Trump administration’s actions after the GAO released its seventh impoundment decision. “Today, we have another stark reminder of how President Trump’s lawless assault on our spending laws is hurting real people in every part of the country—as funding is held up to address homelessness, prepare for disasters, and much more,” Murray wrote. “It is time for Republicans to join us in insisting that every last penny that is owed to the American people gets out to the American people.”",,,,2025-09-30 15:58:40.304926

U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston agreed with several university associations that the policy they described as ideological deportation violates the First Amendment as well as the Administrative Procedure Act, a law governing how federal agencies develop and issue regulations. Young also found the policy was “arbitrary or capricious because it reverses prior policy without reasoned explanation.”
“This case — perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court — squarely presents the issue whether non-citizens lawfully present here in United States actually have the same free speech rights as the rest of us. The Court answers this Constitutional question unequivocally ‘yes, they do,’” Young, a nominee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, wrote.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Plaintiffs in the case welcomed the ruling.
“The Trump administration’s attempt to deport students for their political views is an assault on the Constitution and a betrayal of American values,” said Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors union. “This trial exposed their true aim: to intimidate and silence anyone who dares oppose them. If we fail to fight back, Trump’s thought police won’t stop at pro-Palestinian voices—they will come for anyone who speaks out.”
The ruling came after a trial during which lawyers for the associations presented witnesses who testified that the Trump administration had launched a coordinated effort to target students and scholars who had criticized Israel or showed sympathy for Palestinians.
“Not since the McCarthy era have immigrants been the target of such intense repression for lawful political speech,” Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, told the court. “The policy creates a cloud of fear over university communities, and it is at war with the First Amendment.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration put up witnesses who testified there was no ideological deportation policy as the plaintiffs contended.
“There is no policy to revoke visas on the basis of protected speech,” Victoria Santora told the court. “The evidence presented at this trial will show that plaintiffs are challenging nothing more than government enforcement of immigration laws.”
John Armstrong, the senior bureau official in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, testified that visa revocations were based on longstanding immigration law. Armstrong acknowledged he played a role in the visa revocation of several high-profile activists, including Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil, and was shown memos endorsing their removal.
Armstrong also insisted that visa revocations were not based on protected speech and rejected accusations that there was a policy of targeting someone for their ideology.
One witness testified that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Out of the 5,000 names reviewed, investigators wrote reports on about 200 who had potentially violated U.S. law, Peter Hatch of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Unit testified. Until this year, Hatch said, he could not recall a student protester being referred for a visa revocation.
[RELATED: At CT college campuses, agitation reignites — with a wider scope]
Among the report subjects was Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate Khalil, who was released last month after 104 days in federal immigration detention. Khalil has become a symbol of Trump’s clampdown on the protests.
Another was the Tufts University student Ozturk, who was released in May from six weeks in detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to the war in Gaza.
Young accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents of misusing their powers to target noncitizens who were pro-Palestinian in order to silence them and, in doing so, “intentionally denying such individuals (including the plaintiffs here) the freedom of speech that is their right.”
“Moreover, the effect of these targeted deportation proceedings continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day,” he added.
Young also criticized Trump in his 161-page ruling, suggesting he supported the policy, even though he may not have authorized its operation. “The facts prove that the President himself approves truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech” on the part of two of his senior Cabinet secretaries, he wrote.
He went further, saying the policy targeting pro-Palestinian activists was part if a pattern in recent months in which Trump has “unapologetically increased his attack on First Amendment values.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Unknown.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 16:58:08.570424

The Delaware Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (DUHCDA)
is Effective Sept. 30, making significant changes!
 By George D. Rotsch, Publisher of Delaware LIVE
WILMINGTON — A sweeping overhaul of Delaware’s medical decision-making law takes effect Tuesday, September 30th, changing how families, health-care providers and patients handle treatment choices when someone lacks capacity to make their own decisions.
At the heart of the law is the advance directive  — a legal document that allows people to outline their wishes for medical care and designate someone to make health decisions if they cannot. An advance directive typically includes a living will describing what treatments a patient does or does not want, and a health-care power of attorney naming a trusted “Health Care Agent” to carry out those instructions.
“An advance directive is your voice when you can’t speak for yourself,” said Catherine B. Read, Esquire, a Certified Elder Law Attorney with Estate & Elder Law Services in Greenville, Delaware and member of the Special Needs Alliance®. “It helps families avoid conflict in a crisis and gives doctors clear guidance about what you want. Without one, decisions can be left to people who may not know your wishes or to a system that defaults to who the law provides. The new law is intended to enable more people to prepare an advance directive, and to express priorities and wishes for quality of life that guide decision-making when unforeseen medical circumstances arise or expressed instructions don’t fit the situation”
The Delaware Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (DUHCDA), effective Sept. 30, replaces the state’s previous Health-Care Decisions Act and makes the most significant changes to health-care directives and surrogate authority in decades. Lawmakers and advocates say the new rules are designed to give health-care providers more meaningful guidance, patients more autonomy, and families more clarity, and importantly, consider that family structures are much different today.  However, legal experts caution that uncertainty remains over how the very new law will be applied.
Major Changes in the Law

Capacity Presumed, With Exceptions
An individual is presumed to have the capacity to make health-care decisions unless a court rules otherwise or they are found to lack capacity by a physician, psychologist, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or licensed social worker.  This expands the number of people who can make this determination, as under past law a physician was required to determine incapacity. The new law also allows these determinations to be challenged in the Court of Chancery under newly established rules.
Optional Advance Directive Form
Delaware adopted a new optional form that allows a person to specify priorities and wishes for care in addition to treatment instructions. An important change in the new law is certain powers must  be expressly stated in the advance directive. These powers include the ability of the agent to arrange for admission to a nursing home or for mental health treatment, have access to medical records, and have flexibility in making health-care decisions. Without this language, health-care agents may struggle to carry out a patient’s wishes for admission to a nursing home, mental health treatment, or specific medical procedures.
The optional advanced directive form is required to protect the patient from abuse by ensuring that important decisions such as  nursing home placement or psychiatric care are clearly defined in writing.
Streamlined Execution
The law eliminates the state Ombudsman’s office as a required witness for directives executed in nursing homes, a step intended to reduce formalities and make planning easier.
Expanded List of Health-Care Agents
The surrogate list has been broadened beyond those named in a power of attorney or a spouse to include adult children, parents, cohabitants, siblings and adult grandchildren. Supporters argue that this change better reflects modern families, which often do not conform to traditional forms.
Advance Mental Health-Care Directives
For the first time, Delawareans are expressly authorized to create directives specifically addressing mental health treatment. These allow individuals to authorize or exclude experimental treatments and even specify that a care plan created while healthy cannot later be revoked during a period of crisis.

First-in-the-Nation Law
The DUHCDA is the first State in the nation to adopt the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of 2023, meaning there is no precedent to guide attorneys, health-care workers or courts. The Delaware Court of Chancery only finalized its rules on the new law weeks ago, leaving uncertainty about how disputes will be handled in practice.
“This law is intended to encourage people to plan ahead and make it easier for them to do so,” said William W. Erhart, Esquire, another Certified Elder Law Attorney at Estate & Elder Law Services. . “But the law is new, and lawyers, health-care professionals, social workers, and those who serve vulnerable individuals in long-term care settings are still learning the details.”
Read advises seniors and families to take three immediate steps:

The first priority is to select a loving, trusted person as your health-care agent, clearly communicate your intentions, and maintain relationship with that agent so the agent will know how to advocate for you when you need it.
Ask your estate planning attorney whether your current advance health-care planning documents comply with the new law.
Make any adjustments needed to ensure your plan matches your wishes under the new law.

Concerns and Issues Raised
While the law passed without significant opposition, questions remain.
Authority and Oversight: Some medical professionals worry that capacity determinations by non-medical professionals, such as social workers, could create inconsistent outcomes.
Expanded Surrogate List: Elder Law attorneys note that including domestic partners, cohabitants and extended family may lead to disputes in high-stakes cases, potentially delaying urgent medical decisions.
Advance Directive Safeguards: Simplified witnessing requirements could make directives easier to complete, but may also increase the risk of confusion or misuse.
Mental Health Directives: Hospitals and psychiatric providers are awaiting detailed guidance on how to implement the new Advance Mental Health-Care Directive requirements, raising concerns about uneven adoption across facilities.
Patient Protections: Disability rights advocates warn that the law’s definition of decision-making capacity could be misapplied, particularly for patients with dementia or psychiatric conditions, leaving some vulnerable to unwanted decisions.
Implementation Gaps: Health-care facilities are required to update policies and staff training, but administrators say the lack of finalized state regulations creates uncertainty.
 
Related Legislation
Two companion bills also worth noting:

Senate Bill 83 expands the long-term care resident’s bill of rights to include domestic partners in visitation and room-sharing rights and prohibits discrimination based on protected class status.
Senate Bill 85 establishes a new Class A misdemeanor for endangering the welfare of a vulnerable adult is pending approval in the House of Representatives.

Preparing for Change
Certified Elder Law Attorneys urge Delawareans to review their existing directives now. DUHCDA’s combination of broader surrogate recognition, expanded mental health protections and streamlined execution requirements is expected to reshape how end-of-life and long-term care decisions are made across the state.
“This is the biggest change in decades to how Delawareans designate their healthcare wishes in advance and how those wishes are carried out,” Read said. “The sooner people understand that health-care institutions and long-term care settings may have new processes to implement the new Health-Care Decisions Act, the better families will be prepared to advocate for their loved ones. Individuals should review their advance health-care documents with their attorneys and make updates to ensure their health-care agents have the powers they need under the new law.”

(NCGA screenshot0A federal district judge ruled for the General Assembly in a redistricting lawsuit, saying Republicans did not create Senate districts in northeastern North Carolina that improperly dilute Black voting power. 
Two Black residents, Moses Matthews and Rodney Pierce, sued the legislature in 2023, arguing that the Republican-drawn state Senate map split eastern Black Belt counties in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. The plan deprives Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice, the lawsuit said. 
Republicans said they did not use racial data in drawing the election districts. 
“Today, the court confirmed the #NCGA was right not to use race in its redistricting process,” Senate leader Phil Berger said in a statement on X.  “The VRA can’t be weaponized to make up for the shortcomings of the Democratic Party. I am glad this latest attempt by partisan interests to undo our fair and legal Senate districts was rejected by the court.”
District Judge James Dever III pointed to the election of Sen. Dan Blue of Raleigh and US Rep Valerie Foushee to argue that successful Black politicians do not need to run in districts where a majority of voters are Black.
“The evidence demonstrates that legally significant racially polarized voting does not exist in North Carolina generally,” in northeast North Carolina, or in Senate districts that were the subject of the lawsuit, wrote Dever, a President George W. Bush appointee.
This is the second time Dever has ruled against Matthews and Pierce, who is now a state Representative. 
When they filed their lawsuit in 2023, their lawyers failed to convince Dever that the districts should be redrawn before the 2024 election. Tuesday’s order can be appealed. 
Voting in the state demonstrates polarization based on party rather than race, Dever wrote, with white voters choosing Republicans and Black voters choosing Democrats.

The 58th Sanderson Farms Championship, the 13th and apparently final with America’s third largest poultry producer as a sponsor, tees off Thursday at 7 a.m at Country Club of Jackson.
Mississippi’s only PGA TOUR Tournament, which faces a cloudy future, will feature a strong field of players, including an impressive list of golfers with Magnolia State ties.
With the golf world still buzzing over last weekend’s Ryder Cup matches, the Mississippi tournament will feature several players with Ryder Cup notoriety, including Denmark’s Rasmus Hojgaard, a member of this years victorious European team, and his twin brother Nicolai, who played on the victorious European team in 2023. The twins are the first brothers to ever win back-to-back on the DP World Tour and the first identical twins ever to play in the Masters together. They will be joined by Italian Francisco Molinari, vice captain of the European team and  a three-time Ryder Cup standout, who in 2018 became the first European player in history to win all five of his matches.
Otherwise, six-time PGA TOUR winner Max Homa, the top U.S. points winner in the 2023 Ryder Cup with a 3-1-1 record, will play at CCJ, along with Brandt Snedeker, a U.S. assistant coach, and a nine-time winner on the PGA TOUR.
The field will include five of the top 50 players in the world golf rankings, including No. 34 Akshay Bhatia, the top ranked player in the field. Bhatia made his professional debut at CCJ in 2019 at the age of 17.
Defending champion Kevin Wu, who set a scoring record last year, returns, along with a strong contingent of Missisippians, including:

Hattiesburg native Davis Riley, a two time PGA TOUR champion and winner of nearly $11 million in career earnings.
Tupelo’s Hayden Buckley, who has won on both the Korn Ferry Tour and PGA TOUR Canada.
Fulton native and former Mississippi State golfer Chad Ramey, a winner on both the Korn Ferry and PGA tours.
Former Ole Miss golfer Braden Thornberry, who won the 2017 NCAA Championship, and is a rookie on the PGA TOUR.
Former Ole Miss golfer Jackson Suber, a tour rookie already with over $1 million in earnings and three top 10 finishes.
Walnut native Kye Meeks, another former Ole Miss golfer and PGA TOUR rookie.
Ole Miss golfer Michael LaSasso, the reigning NCAA Champion, who is making his sixth PGA TOUR start while still an amateur.

The Sanderson Farms Championship field includes 28 players who have won PGA TOUR tournaments over the past two years.
The Sanderson Farms/Lyle Machinery Pro Am will be played Wednesday beginning at 7 a.m.
Since 2013 when then-Sanderson Farms CEO Joe Sanderson saved the tournament, the event has raised nearly $19 million for Children’s of Mississippi and additional $2.75 million for various Mississippi charities.
Players will be competing for $6 million in prize money and a first prize of $1.08 million.

Peach State residents can register to vote ahead of the Oct. 6 registration deadline by going online to the secretary of state’s website or by mailing a voter registration application to the secretary of state’s office. Residents can also fill out voter registration paperwork as part of the application for a Georgia driver’s license, and the state Department of Driver Services will transfer the application to the secretary of state’s office. 
Georgia voters who need to change or update their existing voter registration can do so online through the secretary of state’s My Voter Page tool.
The Nov. 4 election is set to include candidates for two seats on the state’s five-member Public Service Commission, the body that regulates utilities like Georgia Power and plays an important role in deciding how much Georgians pay for services like electricity and gas. 
In District 2, which spans a plethora of east Georgia counties, Democrat Alicia M. Johnson is aiming to unseat Republican incumbent Commissioner Tim Echols, who has been a member of the commission since 2011. In District 3, which encompasses Clayton, DeKalb and Fulton counties, Democrat Peter Hubbard will face off against incumbent Commissioner Fitz Johnson, a Republican who was appointed to the seat in 2021. The candidates are required to live in their districts, but the seats are elected statewide.
Notably, the November election will be the first time commissioners have faced voters since 2020. Regularly scheduled PSC elections were delayed after a 2020 lawsuit challenged the statewide electoral process and its impact on Black voters. The lawsuit is currently pending with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to attorney Bryan Sells, who represents the plaintiffs. 
The Public Service Commission election will be the only statewide office on the ballot this fall, but some cities and towns are also scheduled to hold municipal elections for offices like mayor, city council, and school board representatives.
But at least one notable election will not be on the Nov. 4 ballot: Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat who is running for governor of Georgia, recently announced that he is resigning from the state Senate to focus on his gubernatorial bid. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has set the special election to replace him for Nov. 18, meaning that voters in parts of Fulton and Cobb counties may have to go to the polls at least twice this election season.

Republican-led legislatures in Texas and Missouri have already approved new maps that could add six new GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Growing the historically slim party margin in Congress has been a priority for President Donald Trump, whose agenda could be stymied by a Democratic majority in the U.S. House.
California will put a new map before voters in November that could counter Texas’ maps, adding five new seats for Democrats. The fight over redistricting, which traditionally occurs once every ten years, has rippled into other states, including Utah, Maryland and Kansas.
Two of Indiana’s nine congressional seats are held by Democrats — one in northwestern Indiana and one in deep blue Marion County. Boundaries for Indiana’s congressional districts were last drawn in 2021.
The public records request from Count Us IN, filed under Indiana’s Access to Public Records Act, specifically mentions references to “federally funded programs, initiatives, projects or pending waivers that the White House has threatened to stall, delay, or cease if Indiana policymakers do not agree to redraw the state’s congressional maps.”

Previously, Republican leaders haven’t said if there have been threats to state funding.
“Hoosiers deserve to know what kind of pressure is being applied to state leaders and what’s at stake for our communities,” said Count Us IN founder Jalyn Radziminski. “Full transparency is the foundation of accountability, and we hope the Governor’s Office will be forthcoming about what Hoosier priorities may be held up or canceled if Indiana doesn’t cave to Washington’s whims.”
Braun on Sept. 23 told reporters he doesn’t think the state will lose federal funding if it doesn’t move forward.
“I really wouldn’t expect that that would probably occur. It’s just something that, why would you mess with a relationship where Indiana has been accruing a lot of benefits from it?”


Indiana law doesn’t require a speedy response to public records requests — only an acknowledgement within seven days, which was shared in the release.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A professor who Southeastern Louisiana University administrators pulled from a project looking into water pollution was removed for not completing her work on time, according to internal documents and interviews with university personnel. 
The researcher, Fereshteh Emami, an associate professor of chemistry, was removed from the Air Products Lake Maurepas Monitoring Project this summer. The decision sparked backlash against the university because Southeastern didn’t immediately explain her removal, creating speculation she was removed because of her findings or outside influences. Air Products is pursuing a carbon sequestration project that would store the gas under the lakebed.

But Emami’s research never implicated Air Products in pollution of the lake, and the university stands by her findings, which were published in two open-source academic journals, Environments and ACS Omega. Rather, documents and emails indicate  she was removed because she and researchers she supervised had fallen behind on sample analysis and stopped regularly visiting monitoring sites. Additionally, her boss claims she did not hire employees needed to complete the work and refused help from an administrator. 
Other documents show Emami made complaints against her bosses stemming from a late revision to her research budget and an administrator’s payment request that she felt crossed an ethical line.    
A little over a week after she learned of her removal, Emami received a letter from project director Kyle Piller, explaining his decision with a list of objectives and deadlines he said she failed to meet as a principal investigator on the project. At the time of her removal, Piller didn’t provide Emami with a reason for the decision. 
“Southeastern Louisiana University’s decision to remove you from the Air Products Contract–Grant are strictly related to project management and execution of the project in a timely manner,” the letter stated. 
The university denied the Illuminator’s public records request to see Piller’s letter, but Emami’s attorney William Most provided a copy of it and rebutted several of its claims.

“Almost a week after the university removed Dr. Emami from the project, she was told that the removal was for issues such as delays in data collection,” Most said. “It is implausible that this is the university’s true motivation: abruptly removing a project’s leader with no replacement does nothing to speed things up. We are working to determine the real reason for Dr. Emami’s removal and whether it is consistent with the university’s academic freedom principles and the law.” 
Over the past three years, Emami led a team of researchers who analyzed 400 water and sediment samples collected throughout Lake Maurepas. The results set off alarm bells in communities around the lake because they showed high levels of pollution and heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium and lead, among others. 
Emami hasn’t yet taken legal action over her removal. She remains employed as a tenured professor at Southeastern.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an interview, Piller said he wanted to give her an explanation but believed it was against university policy. When public outcry intensified over news of Emami’s removal, Piller got permission to provide her the information, he said.
Southeastern has monitored Lake Maurepas since early 2023. Air Products plans to use carbon capture technology to trap emissions from its hydrogen plant in Ascension Parish and inject them about a mile underneath Lake Maurepas. Many community residents, advocacy organizations and political leaders have voiced strong opposition to the plan from the start. 
When the university refused to explain Emami’s removal, social media users began speculating without evidence that Piller and the university conspired with Air Products to suppress Emami’s research. Southeastern President William Wainwright called out the misinformation in a public message, and Piller criticized the Illuminator’s story on Emami’s dismissal for perpetrating a false narrative, which he described as impugning his reputation. 
At the time of publication, the Illuminator was aware of some of Emami’s disputes with coworkers and possible reasons for her removal but did not explore these reasons in its initial story. 
Factors for removal
Piller’s Aug. 4 letter to Emami detailed five factors that led to his decision to remove her. 
The first was that in meetings the previous year in which administrators expressed concern over her lack of progress and staffing, Emami told them she didn’t have enough time to manage the project, Piller wrote. One of the administrators offered to help manage her team, but she declined, Piller wrote. 
That administrator, Daniel McCarthy, then Southeastern’s dean of research, had offered to help Emami on a volunteer basis, emails show. Emami said she never refused his help and pointed to subsequent emails showing they collaborated for about two months until she noticed someone changed her research budget by adding a pay stipend for McCarthy.
In a recent interview, McCarthy said the added expense was the idea of Pat Moyer, then dean of the College of Science and Technology. Moyer insisted the research dean be paid a stipend from the project budget, McCarthy said. 
It’s not unusual for grants to include supplemental pay for researchers affiliated with the project, though Emami said she never approved this expenditure. The dispute continued through March when McCarthy submitted a pay request for dates and times Emami claimed he never worked. She returned the request with a note asking him for clarity but got no reply, so she met with the university provost to try to resolve the matter, records show.   
McCarthy said he wasn’t in that meeting and never saw Emami’s note, but he withdrew his pay request and his offer to help. 
“We had gone out of our way to help her,” McCarthy said. “We agreed I would take a fairly modest payment … Then she rejected it, and I backed off.”
McCarthy is now the college dean, having replaced Moyer, who left Southeastern over the summer. Moyer didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
‘Missed opportunity’
For the second point in his letter, Piller cited what he called a “severe delay” in Emami’s sampling and chemical analysis. 
He said her last completed water and sediment analysis was in December, noting Southeastern’s grant contract with Air Products requires the researchers to demonstrate adequate progress on data collection. 
Third, he cited three vacancies on Emami’s research team — one post-doctoral researcher and two full-time technicians. Funds were pulled from other budgets to help pay for the extra personnel, he wrote. 
“Dr. Emami did advertise the positions and had many applicants, but ultimately Dr. Emami never hired anyone,” Piller wrote.
When the Illuminator first interviewed Emami for a June 19 article about her research, she mentioned concerns about a statewide hiring freeze Gov. Jeff Landry ordered. Emami said she didn’t seek a waiver to the freeze because she believed it would take too long. Documents the Illuminator obtained from the Division of Administration showed it quickly approved waivers submitted by universities. Southeastern did eventually get a waiver, but the freeze still slowed down the hiring process, Emami’s attorney said .
Fourth, Piller referenced Emami’s absence from a May 22 meeting to discuss the project and Air Products’ funding modification. The company wanted Emami to perform more monitoring of the rivers that flow into Lake Maurepas. 
“All of the other principal investigators were in attendance, and Dr. Emami’s lack of a response or participation in the meeting is further evidence of her noncompliance on this project,” Piller wrote.

For his final point, Piller cited boat and vehicle logs from Southeastern’s Turtle Cove Research Station, located on Lake Maurepas, that showed little activity in the late spring and summer months. Most of the sampling locations are accessible only by boat. The logs, obtained through a public records request, show her team last checked out a boat on April 22 and last used a truck on July 16. 
Piller also said Emami was behind on analyzing animal tissue samples he and other researchers had collected. This analysis would’ve allowed them to determine if crabs and fish in Lake Maurepas were suffering from heavy metal poisoning as physiological signs on crab shells were indicating, he said in a phone interview. 
Emami said the student on her team trained to pilot the boat left Southeastern. She said bad weather derailed some of her site visits but said her sampling and analysis never stopped.
Chris Murray, a biologist and another principal investigator on the project, described his relationship with Emami as a “missed opportunity” to collaborate.
“It was not the same as with the other [principal investigators],” Murray said. “She was kinda removed. We called meetings and tried to share information, and I wasn’t getting much back.”
Piller offered a similar take. 
“She was sort of isolated, but I just want to be clear — we didn’t isolate her,” he said.
Emami said she was under stress during the spring semester from the situation with McCarthy. 
During that period, she exchanged several messages with a colleague at LSU for advice on how to handle the situation, telling him she felt pressured by the “power dynamics” of being asked to approve pay for a superior, emails show.  
“I am very uncomfortable with this situation,” she wrote to her friend.
Piller said he never addressed Emami’s work delays directly with her through any type of performance review or warning, and he acknowledged her removal may cause further delays but said it was in the long-term interests of the project. 
Grievance unrelated to removal
Emami was involved in a separate workplace dispute this year in which someone filed a grievance against her, though administrators said it wasn’t a factor that led to her removal from the Lake Maurepas project.
The grievance arose after Emami sent a curt email to another professor’s employee because the employee refused to hand over a fuel card to Emami’s research assistant.
Moyer found the employee’s refusal to hand over the fuel card in line with state policy. Although the employee requested the grievance be escalated, the provost closed it on July 3 without disciplinary action, according to emails shared by Emami’s attorney.
Emami was also scolded by an administrator for purchasing a vial of diluted uranium standard without proper approval. Uranium standards are used for calibrating lab equipment and do not emit harmful radiation.
Piller and McCarthy said Emami’s removal from the Lake Maurepas project had nothing to do with either incident. They said they had no direct knowledge of the grievance. 
Kelly Benjamin, spokesman for the Association of American University Professors, said Emami could use the grievance process to protest her removal and suggested she contact a local AAUP chapter to explore the option. 
She could also bring the matter to Southeastern’s Faculty Senate to which Emami was recently elected, though Alan Cannon, a math professor who chairs the senate, said the body can only make recommendations and has no authority to reverse her removal. 
Most, Emami’s attorney, said they plan to look into their options.
Another removal
Gary Shaffer, a biologist at Southeastern, was one of the original four principal investigators on the Lake Maurepas monitoring project until Piller removed him last year with“absolutely no warning,” he said. Piller told him his team’s annual report was too short and two weeks past his deadline, Shaffer said. 
“When our in-house report was late, Piller got annoyed because he had to edit it over Christmas break,” Shaffer said. 
Piller said he removed Shaffer for the same reason he removed Emami. 
“The work wasn’t coming in on time,” he said.
Matt Ginder-Vogel, a biogeochemist and director of the University of Wisconsin’s Sustainability Research Hub, said removing a principal investigator is typically only done in cases of research misconduct. He is not affiliated with Southeastern or its researchers, and he questioned whether any unstated reasons could be at play in Emami’s removal. 
“I’ve been in academics a long enough time to understand how petty the people can be,” Ginder-Vogel said.

Democrats in the U.S. Senate, backed by Democratic governors, have been unable to persuade their Republican counterparts to extend them. The issue has become a sticking point in negotiations over the federal budget. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, the federal government appeared to be heading toward an Oct. 1 shutdown.
Read more below about what New Mexicans need to know about Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, the federal healthcare subsidy that could shut down the government.
What is the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit? 
The Enhanced Premium Tax Credit is an expanded version of a tax credit first created in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation.

The original Premium Tax Credit reduces premiums for certain healthcare customers who rely on state-run healthcare marketplaces, known as exchanges. The expanded version created in 2021 reduced premium costs further and also expanded the credit to customers who make more than 400% of the federal poverty level. 
New Mexico’s marketplace is called BeWellNM. Seventy-five thousand New Mexicans use it. 
Who is receiving the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit? 
According to BeWellNM, more than 65,000 New Mexicans receive the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit. Of them, about 6,300 recipients report income at 400% or more of the federal poverty level ($128,600 for a family of four.)
The EPTC recipients are among roughly 88% of 75,000 New Mexicans on the exchange who receive some form of federal or state subsidy. According to the New Mexico Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, 50% of customers pay less than $10 a month for coverage, thanks to the subsidies.
Who will be most affected if the credits expire?
Those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level will be unaffected by the expiration, a BeWellNM official told Source New Mexico in a statement Tuesday, because the state’s Health Care Affordability Fund will cover the loss of those tax credits. 
But  the 6,300 recipients who make above the income threshold will see the full brunt of the credits expiring, according to BeWell NM. Alex Sanchez, chief experience officer at BeWellNM, said at a roundtable last month with U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) the majority of all New Mexico EPTC recipients are aged 50 to 70 and are therefore likely “medically fragile,” she said. 
The state insurance superintendent said last month that the HCA will provide up to $68 million to help BeWellNM enrollees afford increasing premiums. 
Those above the income threshold won’t be able to afford the full price of health insurance and will lose coverage, she predicts. 
As a result, those people will stop scheduling primary care appointments or other preventive care, leading to an even greater burden on a “strained” statewide hospital system, she said. 
How much will health insurance costs increase? 
The average premium for enrollees will greatly increase in 2026. The OSI, which approves proposed rate increases, announced last month that BeWellNM enrollees should expect an average premium increase of 35.7%.
Viara Ianakieva, the Life and Health Division director at the OSI, told Source New Mexico on Tuesday that rising healthcare premiums are an “issue nationwide.” She cited an increase in claims nationwide in 2024, along with rising health care costs and “uncertainty.”
How much do the tax credits provide?
That varies based on a lot of factors, but they are significant. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a calculator here. 
According to the calculator, a non-smoking couple aged 50 in Bernalillo County making 200% of the federal poverty level would receive $1,151 a month, or $13,809 a year, with enhanced premium tax credits. That covers 91% of the monthly cost for a “silver” health insurance plan, which offers a moderate level of coverage on the exchange. 
What can the Legislature do? 
The Legislature’s role in addressing the health insurance credits remains to be seen. Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) previously told Source NM lawmakers plan to appropriate about $177 million in order to try to prevent rising health insurance costs from a tax credit under the Affordable Care Act.

Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, speaks on the state House floor on Jan. 16, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Less than 24 hours before South Dakota lawmakers met last week to consider building a prison, one of them disseminated “shocking new revelations” in a press release.
“I have confirmed,” the press release said, “that the South Dakota Department of Corrections has been using your tax dollars to provide transgender cross-sex hormones to convicted criminals in prison.”
The release went on to accuse the department of “hiding” a policy that includes a treatment committee and payments to an “East Coast college professor” for gender dysphoria services.
The last-minute sabotage attempt didn’t come from a rogue lawmaker on the fringes of the 105-member Legislature. It came from Dell Rapids Republican Jon Hansen, the speaker of the state House of Representatives.
South Dakota lawmakers approve $650 million prison construction project in Sioux Falls

The late onset of Hansen’s sudden interest in prison health care was peculiar, to say the least. He could’ve dug up his information and shared his claims at any time during the last several years while he was participating in prison debates.
Hansen has been a state representative since before the planning to replace the 144-year-old penitentiary started gaining momentum in 2021, and he was a member of Gov. Larry Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset task force that met four times this year from April to July.
Hansen voted “no” during the past couple of years on bills to authorize planning, site preparation and funding for a men’s prison at a controversial site in rural Lincoln County. But when the prison task force came up with a new plan and voted in July to recommend a 1,500-bed prison at a maximum cost of $650 million in Sioux Falls, Hansen voted yes with all other task force members in attendance.
Earlier, between the task force’s first and second meetings in April, Hansen announced his 2026 campaign for governor with his running mate, House Speaker Pro Tempore Karla Lems, R-Canton.
Gov. Rhoden, who’s made a penitentiary replacement one of his top priorities, hasn’t declared himself a candidate to keep his job yet. He’s expected to run, which would pit him against Hansen and at least two other declared candidates for the Republican nomination: U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden. That’s why the political stakes were high last week when legislators traveled, at Rhoden’s invitation, to the Capitol in Pierre for a special session to consider the prison plan.
The bill’s legislative journey began in a committee that approved it by a vote of 13-2. Nobody was surprised when Hansen and Lems cast the two “no” votes, after Hansen’s “shocking new revelations” of the prior day. The bill then passed the Senate and House with little mention of those revelations, and Rhoden immediately signed the legislation into law.
Although Hansen’s surprise attack failed, some of his claims were true. The state does in fact pay an expert from Baltimore to consult with a committee and evaluate incarcerated people who seek gender dysphoria treatment. The expert’s last three annual contracts are viewable in the state’s online financial portal, OpenSD, including the current one for up to $48,353.76 worth of services this year. The state is required to offer those services, because courts have upheld inmates’ rights to gender-affirming care.
Those aren’t shocking revelations.
The shock is in the revelation that a legislative leader seeking the state’s top elected office tried, at the 11th hour, to derail an important public policy debate by drumming up fear about transgender people.
The hope is in the realization that it didn’t work.

However, if last year’s statistics repeat themselves this new cycle, it is likely that few Utahns are aware of that date.
With 38.25% of Utah 12th graders filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form — widely known as FAFSA — the state had the second-lowest completion rate in the country, according to a survey by Sallie Mae, a financial institution that provides private student loans, and the market research consultant Ipsos.

“Filing early matters,” according to a news release from Sallie Mae. That’s because some aid is first come, first served. 
New data from the same survey shows that only 21% of families in the country know about the Oct. 1 applications start date, which could come at a cost since aid packages can include competitive grants, scholarships, work-study programs, federal loans, and state or school funding to pay for tuition, housing, meals, books, or other expenses. 
According to the survey, during the 2024-2025 academic year, undergraduate students nationwide spent an average of $30,837 on higher education, a 9% increase from last year, when they reported spending $28,409 on average. 
The typical family covered about 38% of those expenses with parents’ incomes and savings. But, 27% of college funding came from scholarships and grants, 11% from parent borrowing, and 12% from student borrowing.
According to the study, “40% of undergraduate families did not use scholarships in (academic year) 2024–25. Among them, a striking 70% did not even apply. The leading reasons families didn’t pursue scholarships include lack of awareness (34%) and a belief that the student won’t win (28%).”
The new FAFSA is easier to complete, the release says, but still 58% of families have reported needing help with it. Resources about the process are available online on the Utah System of Higher Education website.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)A selection committee has settled on seven finalists for three open Ethics Commission seats, narrowing down the pool from 39 applicants.
The finalists are:

Nicole Bredahl, a Fargo attorney
Patrick Frise, a University of North Dakota law student and former Ethics Commission intern
Jared Huibregtse, a Mandan resident and project manager for an engineering firm
Jenna Mueller, a Fargo nonprofit leader
Murray Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney and current Ethics Commission member
Pamela Sharp, a Bismarck consultant and former director of the North Dakota Office of Management and Budget
Mark Western, a Fargo attorney

The new commissioners will be selected based on a consensus vote of Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
Interviews will start Friday afternoon from 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the North Dakota Capitol in Bismarck. They will be open to the public, according to the North Dakota Governor’s Office. 
The seven names were selected based on lists of favorite candidates that selection committee members provided to the Governor’s Office at a Sept. 23 meeting, Hogan said. Names that appeared on at least two committee members’ lists were picked as finalists. The finalists were not discussed or announced during the meeting.
After the application window closed, the committee asked applicants to answer eight questions about their qualifications, how they perceive the role of the commission in state government and what kinds of policies they think the board should implement.
Ethics candidates to face questions on agency’s role in North Dakota government

Twenty-five advanced for consideration after two applicants withdrew their names and 11 did not submit responses to the committees’ questions. Another applicant was determined to be ineligible.
The seven finalists have varied backgrounds, though many work in the legal field. They also have different perspectives on the Ethics Commission’s purpose, according to their responses to the selection committee’s questions obtained by the North Dakota Monitor. 
Some applicants expressed that they don’t believe the commission has the authority to hand down punishments to people found to have violated ethics rules. Applicants disagreed on whether the commission has a responsibility to educate the public about government ethics.
Multiple finalists also said that the commission needs to do more to clearly define its role in state government.
Some applicants acknowledged the friction between the Ethics Commission and the executive and legislative branches of the state government. The governor and Ethics Commission have been openly at odds over the role of the regulatory agency.
There are three open commission seats. One applicant will be selected to fill the term of former chair Dave Anderson, who died in May. 
Ethics Commission highlights time management in annual report

Two other seats are open after the terms of Sagsveen and Commissioner Ward Koeser ended at the end of August. Both will stay on the commission until the search committee announces their successors. Sagsveen is seeking to be reappointed to a four-year term.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency. It is not part of the executive, legislative or judicial branches of the North Dakota government.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

A $625 million coal spending package, along with more deregulation, will cost ratepayers and result in more deadly emissions, critics say.
The post Gordon cheers Trump’s coal revival plan while environmentalists warn of disaster appeared first on WyoFile .","Citing the power demands of a global artificial intelligence race, the Trump administration on Monday underscored its mission to revive and expand the U.S. coal industry to help meet the data industry’s enormous forecast for electricity. 
Federal agencies will slash more regulations, open 13.1 million federal acres to coal leasing and spend $625 million on various coal initiatives, including one to “retrofit” old coal plants that might otherwise be retired, according to the administration.
“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a prepared statement. “These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption.”
Wyoming, its coal communities and electric ratepayers are among the primary benefactors of the administration’s suite of actions to “unshackle” the industry from the “anti-coal” policies of the Biden administration, said Gov. Mark Gordon, who joined top administration officials in D.C. on Monday to celebrate Trump’s coal revival package.

Seated next to him are Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Under Secretary of Energy Preston Griffin III. Behind Gordon is Sen. John Barrasso. (Gov. Mark Gordon’s office)
“Instead of talking about restricting, limiting, regulating our energy, we want to make sure it’s appropriately managed,” Gordon told reporters Tuesday morning during a virtual press conference. “But at the same time, we’re not going to use regulation to try to curtail or stymie any particular type of production.”
The coal industry’s dramatic 15-year slide has cut Wyoming production by nearly half, coinciding with the retirement of aging power plants, a shift to natural gas-fired electric generation and increasingly price-competitive wind and solar energy. 
Those market shifts, however, were unduly influenced — at least in part — by punishing regulations on coal and tax incentives that obscured the actual competitiveness of renewables, Gordon said.
President Donald Trump’s coal initiatives will help level the playing field, he said, and provide the coal industry an opportunity to “upgrade” technologies such as coal-carbon capture while bringing down the cost. To date, the technology remains too costly and, if installed on an existing coal plant, would sap electrical output by up to 30%, according to Wyoming utilities.

“Some of the [federal coal] grants will go to those technologies, so we’ll continue to work on that,” Gordon said, responding to a WyoFile question. “You’re right, some of these plants are decades old, and there’s been a view that we’re going to [phase out coal], so [there’s not been enough investment] in that. This is an opportunity to reinvest and be able to equalize those costs over time.”
Conservation groups, however, say the Trump administration is waging a war on renewable energy while placing a risky bet on coal that threatens public health and environmental safety.
“There’s no such thing as clean coal,” Center for Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby said in a prepared statement. “This announcement is just a plan to pollute more and rip off taxpayers while insisting that power companies use a more expensive fuel that they don’t even want.”
Earthjustice vowed to “continue to take the administration to court to oppose unlawful actions to prop up coal at the expense of the American people,” according to a statement by the group.
“Clean energy and other climate solutions are driving significant growth in our economy, but this administration is choosing to throw its weight behind fossil fuel industries and stymie progress,” Earthjustice Vice President of Litigation for Climate and Energy Jill Tauber said in a prepared statement.
Asked about the near-term carbon-emission implications of extending the use of coal-burning power plants, Gordon said, “I think, probably, the answer is fairly clear: There’ll be more CO2 production.
“It’s also pretty clear,” Gordon continued, “that just doing renewables did not stop that, and I think that’s the reason why this [carbon capture technology] is so exciting to continue … to be able to develop the technology to do a better job of being able to manage our carbon emissions.”Click this U.S. Department of Energy link to learn more about the Trump administration’s coal funding package.

(Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)In an executive order, President Donald Trump announced he would hike the price of H-1B work visas, which used to cost about $5,000. Those visas will now cost $100,00 per person, per year, according to the new executive order.
H-1B visas are generally used to fill high-skill jobs, like nurses, and allow for longer careers in the U.S. by providing a path to permanent residency, like a green card. In recent years, H1B visas have become increasingly popular for Alaska schools to hire teachers from abroad.
But there’s concern that many Alaska school districts can’t afford the price hike.
“With a pen stroke, we possibly have ruined the future of education for Alaska students,” said Cyndy Mika, the Kodiak Island Borough School District’s superintendent. She said she texted that to another superintendent in Alaska after she heard the news this weekend.
“I can’t imagine what our classes would look like without our classes would look like without those international teachers filling the need.”
There are over 30 teachers in Kodiak’s school district who were hired abroad, many of whom currently hold H-1B visas. And earlier this year, Mika organized a recruiting trip to the Philippines for administrators representing the Nome, Bering Strait, and Kenai Peninsula school districts.
Districts across the state have faced shortages for teaching staff and struggled to fill positions with domestic hires, including from the Lower 48. For some, international hiring efforts are a sort of stopgap measure to ensure classrooms and kids’ needs are met.
Much of the justification outlined in Trump’s executive order, however, targets large information technology firms. But immigration lawyers, like Anchorage attorney Margaret Stock, say multiple industries – like Alaska’s public education system – are collateral damage.
“It’s been complete chaos since last Friday,” Stock said.
She said Alaska’s university system, healthcare, accounting, and financial service, and tourism sectors all use H-1B visas, too. And Trump and his team haven’t had consistent messaging about how they might be affected.
“It’s hard to figure out what to do when the president issues a proclamation that is then contradicted by everybody who works for the president,” said Stock. “It’s just hard to advise clients.”
She’s seen the White House and various federal agencies issue conflicting statements surrounding the new H-1B fees. A staffer with Sen. Dan Sullivan’s office said via email on Tuesday that previously approved visa applications won’t be subject to the new fees. Mika’s heard something similar from the school district’s legal team.
But it’s unclear what final decisions will be made.
“They seem to be motivated mainly by collecting a lot of money from people, but they didn’t even roll out a way to pay this $100,000 per person fee,” Stock said.
Mika said she’s already working with Alaska’s congressional delegation to find some kind of solution for Kodiak and other school districts.
U.S. Rep. Nick Begich III, who was in Bethel last week, said he’s already brought up how important internationally hired teachers are with the Trump administration.
“I do support the ability to bring in J-1 and H-1Bs to support as a supplement to local Alaskans and Americans generally,” Begich said on a visit to KYUK in Bethel on Tuesday. “The education workforce in rural Alaska – we know it’s a hard job to fill and when you’ve got positions that go unfilled, it means kids are going uneducated.”
Staffers for U.S. Senators Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski both also said via text and email on Sept. 23 that there’s a lack of clarity and want schools to have the resources they need.
For now, the consensus is that everyone’s waiting for more details from the White House.

The rally and press conference, organized by the Michigan Education Justice Coalition, called on lawmakers not to cut any of the public school funding that has been allocated in prior years. That includes funding for school breakfast and lunch programs, as well as categorical funding for programs like English language learning, special education and other equity concerns. 
State Rep. Jimmie Wilson, Jr. (D-Ypsilanti) said that he could not vote for a budget that did not include these items. 
One attendee of the rally, Katie DaCruz, is a former school psychologist at Godfrey-Lee Public Schools who was laid off weeks into this school year along with other administrators and staff. One of the main reasons cited, she said, was the budget uncertainty. 
“They tried to keep cuts away from the classroom as much as possible. But ultimately, when teachers are less supported, they’re less able to support their students as well,” she told the Advance. “It’s going to have an impact on students.”

Another demand of the groups was maintaining funding for programs designed to support mental health, especially for at-risk students. Emily Busch, a mother of a survivor of the school shooting in Oxford, Mich. in 2021, called it a “moral responsibility” to keep that funding in the state’s budget.
“We saw last year the state step in and invest $300 million for mental health in our schools. That was a step in the right direction, and today I implore you: keep those funds in the budget,” Busch said. “Because make no mistake, cutting at-risk and mental health funding does more than just shrink line items. It makes us less able to intervene early, to see a student struggling, to connect a child in crisis to help, exactly when it matters most.”

No budget has yet been signed, though the Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced last Thursday that they had reached a deal. State Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) and state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) both told the crowd that they had not seen any final text of the budget as of the start of the noon event. 
“We are now in the last few hours of passing a massive budget, and our representatives don’t know what’s in it or what they’re going to be asked to agree to, is unacceptable and undemocratic,” said Rachelle Crow-Hercher, director of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition after the event. 
Dr. Tonya Whitehead, president of the Michigan PTA, though, said she was “cautiously optimistic” about a budget deal.

Would the joining of the state’s largest hospital operator and the 500-physician practice — which despite similar names are unrelated and independent from each other  — violate  antitrust protections? Neronha decided it didn’t matter.
“If you’re asking everyday Rhode Islanders what they care about, they want to see a doctor,” Neronha said Tuesday. “They don’t care about Brown Health being too big.”
That’s why Neronha suspended the state investigation and granted the two health care entities the green light to merge in exchange for a series of conditions meant to soothe the state’s primary care crisis. Chief among them: taking on 40,000 new primary care patients by the end of 2029, and making “best efforts” to see new patients within 14 days of calling for an appointment. 
“If you’ve called around trying to get a new patient appointment over the last several years, you know how difficult it is to get an appointment within 14 days,” Neronha said. “If you’ve been able to accomplish that, you should go play the Powerball.”
Analysis by Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School suggested 343,000 people in Rhode Island don’t have a primary care provider. That was before the June closure of Anchor Medical Associates, which left another 25,000 people without primary care physicians or pediatricians. 
The Federal Trade Commission already granted its own approval for the acquisition, issuing a decision on Sept. 26 to not challenge the transaction. The deal is expected to close Oct. 1.

27 more primary care providers
The additional 40,000 patients will bring the health system’s patient roster to 231,7000, a little less than one-fifth of the state population. The bulk of them,152,000, are Brown University Health patients, while Brown Physicians serves 39,000 patients.  
To treat them all, Brown University Health will hire at least 27 more primary care providers over the next four years. The health care system has already determined a pay scale for its new health care workers as part of negotiations, which is referenced in the agreement with the AG but not available for public view.
The hiring commitment comes with an estimated $4 million annual cost along with a one-time $20 million capital investment to bring the electronic medical records for Brown Physicians Inc. in sync with those of the health care giant’s existing 1,000-physician network. 
The doctors at Brown Physicians, a nonprofit specialty practice founded eight years ago by faculty at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School, already work side-by-side with their Brown University Health counterparts in primary care and hospital settings, and on academic and research endeavors. 
Making the two halves a whole will make it easier for doctors to work together and care for their patients, said Dr. Angela Caliendo, president of Brown Physicians Inc. Caliendo is also the Warren Alpert Foundation Professor of Medicine and Executive Vice Chair of Medicine at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
“Really, the merger is all about driving better patient experiences and better patient outcomes,” Caliendo said. “The more fragmented we are, the more difficult this is for us to accomplish.”
And, the more difficult it is to compete with health care systems in neighboring states like Massachusetts, which have already successfully lured away many Rhode Island’s medical providers due to higher reimbursement rates.










If you’re asking everyday Rhode Islanders what they care about, they want to see a doctor. They don’t care about Brown Health being too big.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


John Fernandez, president and CEO of Brown University Health, lamented the problems with Rhode Island’s low reimbursement rates in finding and keeping health care workers.
“People are coming after the doctors in our state every day, twice on Sundays,” Fernandez said. “You can’t have a disorganized health care system if you want to compete.”
Nor can you compete on slim or negative profits, a recurring problem for Brown University Health during and after the pandemic saw rising expenses for labor, supplies and drugs. A 2024 partnership between Lifespan Corp. and Brown University that coincided with the rebrand as Brown University Health brought temporary relief to its bottom line.
But the system returned to the red after its $175 million purchase of a pair of Massachusetts hospitals last year, which have not performed as well as initially expected. Brown University Health lost $32.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, ending June 30, according to its most recent earnings release, dragged down by too few patients at St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River, Morton Hospital in Taunton, and associated physician groups. Its Rhode Island business ended the three-month period with a $28.4 million profit — up 68% over a year ago.
Yet it was Rhode Island health care facilities and services — including the acclaimed Newport Hospital birthing center — that were put on the chopping block by the health care system earlier this summer. Amid strong public backlash, company executives agreed to keep the award-winning labor and delivery unit open and funded through the upcoming fiscal 2026 year which starts Oct. 1. The health system committed to creating a birthing center task force, now expected to be formed by late October or early November, Sharon Torgerson, a spokesperson, said in an email Tuesday.
However, other cuts remain on the table, including inpatient psychiatry at Rhode Island Hospital.
The new agreement with the AG’s office, and associated costs, will not change the one-year funding pledge for the birthing center, along with similar commitments to maintain behavioral health services through Gateway Healthcare and Samuel Sinclair Dental Care, Fernandez said Tuesday.
But the promise has an expiration.
“If we continue to have economic problems, we will be forced into tough decisions about which programs we have,” Fernandez said. He specifically called out the federal budget cuts for hospitals and health care providers, and the federal administration’s rescission of public health research grants, as “not helpful.”
A ‘real transformative moment’
Neronha acknowledged mandated hiring and patient intake was no panacea for the health care crisis facing Rhode Island. There’s no guarantee the new doctors hired by Brown University Health won’t come from other health care practices in Rhode Island, for example. And patients clamoring for a doctor won’t get in tomorrow. A system that can take 40,000 more people will take a full four years to develop, said Dr. Babar Khokhar, president of Brown Health Medical Group and chief physician officer for Brown University Health.
Nonetheless, Khokhar praised the marriage of the two physician groups as a “real transformative moment” for health care in Rhode Island.
Brown University Health will be required to meet incremental benchmarks in hiring and adding patients over the four-year period, with twice-yearly reporting of its progress to the AG’s office, along with other metrics on payroll spending, recruitment efforts and wait times for new patients.
“We want to know how it’s going,” Neronha said. “If we have to push them, we will.”










People are coming after the doctors in our state every day, twice on Sundays. You can’t have a disorganized health care system if you want to compete.


– John Fernandez, CEO of Brown University Health


And if the health care system fails to meet the terms by the 2029 deadline, there will be consequences — restarting the state review of antitrust violations, or even legal action to undo the merger, Neronha said.
While Neronha and Fernandez exchanged multiple handshakes and warm smiles over the course of the hourlong press conference, the negotiations that got them to this moment were not so collegiate.
“We didn’t sit down over coffee to work this out, did we John?” Neronha asked Fernandez.
“I wish we had,” Fernandez replied.
“It was pretty intense,” Neronha concluded.

Phil Murphy signed a bill Tuesday adding Latino and Hispanic history as a requirement in the state's learning standards. (Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor's Office)New Jersey students will learn Latino and Hispanic history under a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Tuesday.
The law requires the State Board of Education to adopt new social studies learning standards that include sections on Latino and Hispanic history and calls on local school boards to insert lessons on the same in their curriculums.
“Through today’s bill signing, we are cementing the legacy of New Jersey’s Latino and Hispanic communities,” Murphy said in a statement. “By teaching students about their neighbors, we are raising a more informed next generation of future leaders in the Garden State.”
The law, which cleared the Senate in a unanimous vote and saw a single no vote in the lower chamber from Assemblyman Sean Kean (R-Monmouth), requires the Department of Education to provide sample learning activities that could be used to implement the requirement, which applies from kindergarten to 12th grade.
The lessons could appear as early as the 2026-2027 school year.
“By integrating Latino and Hispanic American history into the core curriculum, we acknowledge the ever-evolving diversity of America and affirm the need for an education system that is not only equitable in knowledge but also instills pride in all of its students,” said bill sponsor Assemblyman Julio Marenco (D-Hudson).
The instruction requirement is the latest in a series enacted by New Jersey lawmakers. Other statutes require education on the contributions of LGBT people, the history and contributions of Black Americans, and instruction on the Holocaust.
The state’s student learning standards also require instruction on civics and diversity and inclusion.
“Representation matters, and as New Jersey’s Latino population continues to grow, it’s important that our students learn a history that reflects the diverse voices and contributions that make up our state and nation,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), who represents Newark. “In my district, this growth is part of our daily life.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/32914797248_5f455889b5_c.jpg,,,2025-09-30 14:58:04.211018

You can read more about the section here.

As a parent with two children in public schools, I attended the recent public hearing of the Select Legislative Committee on School Choice held at the state Capitol.
The meeting was standing room only as the committee heard testimony from researchers who were school choice advocates. I wanted to ask a rather simple question, how is “school choice” a real answer to what the proponents of school choice are saying is the problem they are trying to solve – too many (black and brown) students “trapped” in failing schools?
The presenters posited school choice, such as allowing parents to choose from a variety of educational options by making public tax dollars available to parents to fund their children’s education in any format or context the parents deem is best for their children, as a solution. In this perspective, where is the real solution for children and families in so-called “failing” schools?

I am disheartened by the rhetoric around school choice in our state. The support for “school choice” has proven to be little more than an ages-old scheme from some political leaders in our state to funnel public money into private, segregated schools. I wonder if supporters really think that creating educational vouchers and tax credit schemes will really solve the challenge of children being taught in “failing” schools? What are the real choices parents have if their children are “trapped” in a “failing” school?
The presenters suggested that they could take the proposed voucher, which would be worth about $8,000.00, and hire a tutor or enroll their children in “micro-schools” where a small group of families contract with a teacher to teach children in small classes of five to 10 students
The presenters also suggested private tutors, homeschooling, or even using the voucher to pay full tuition and cost of attendance to a yet to be opened private school that would cater to the needs of these children and only charge about $8,000.00 per year. I cringe at thinking about the quality of education that could be offered by such a school.
Ultimately, the funding schemes proposed would siphon much needed tax dollars from our already underfunded public schools and into a variety of educational contexts (including private schools that have origins in our dark, segregationist past) with little to no accountability for how those dollars would be spent. 
Why would any citizen see this school funding system as a better way forward for our state? None of the alternatives suggested would make much practical sense for the families that are said to be targeted by these “reforms.”
Nor does there seem to be a real citizen demand for a “school choice” reform law that calls for tax dollars to be given directly to parents rather than schools that are proven to be making great gains in educating our children.
Are the public schools perfect? Of course not.
Reforms are needed to help families who are in communities where the schools are rated as “failing.” The most important reform being fully funding the schools in those communities, not subjecting them to less resources for the neediest children. 
One glaring reality that was not mentioned one time in the hearing was the impact that poverty has on schooling. What is seen mainly as a failing school cannot be divorced from the concentrated poverty that is evidenced in most of the communities in which failing schools are located.
Poverty’s impact of academic skill development in children is well documented but often overlooked in school policy debates. The assumption is that all children can learn if the schools “just did a better job” with the resources already given to them.
While teaching and learning can always improve, the biggest factor in the academic skill development of children is the social economic class of their family and community.
It is no coincidence that the highest rated schools in Mississippi are in the most affluent communities.This isn’t because they all have better teachers and leaders in schools, or innately “smarter” children, but because the children in these communities are advantaged by access to more resources such as healthcare, more community support, better educated parents and networks, and safe, more stable homes and communities. These social economic factors weigh heavily in the academic skill development of all children.
If a school is over-concentrated with children living in poverty, due mainly to residential segregation, it is much harder to provide children with the educational experiences and support they need to actualize their full potential. 
Yes, we all want every child to have access to the best education that works for them and helps them fulfill their dreams and potential. We can disagree on the ways to make this happen, but we cannot step backward as a state and allow for the most advantaged to gain even more resources at the expense of the least advantaged in our communities.
Public schools are a part of the commitment we make to provide all citizens with the tools they need to live the best life they can, with the responsibilities of freedom, as they pursue the happiness that makes life enjoyable. When we do this, we enhance the quality of life and affirm the humanity of everyone.
A “school choice” scheme that further divests in the humanity of some of our children is a pathway to an even more segmented society that history has taught us doesn’t help us grow as a state.

Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet heartily voted Tuesday to give a pricey parcel owned by Miami Dade College to a Trump family foundation for a future library honoring President Donald Trump.
The unanimous vote by DeSantis and the Cabinet, augmented by their crowing praise of the 47th president, officially approved the transfer of the $66 million real estate from the state-run college to the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation, led by Trump’s son, son-in-law, and lawyer.
“President Trump has a great story to tell as a Florida resident, and I think it’s quite fitting that we house it … as Miami becomes kind of the capital of the world in many respects,” said James Uthmeier, the state’s Attorney General. DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia echoed the acclaim, lauding Miami Dade as the first state college to potentially house a presidential library.
These officials are elected statewide independent of Florida’s governors and help shape policy in a range of areas, including public lands.
Although the White House had stayed largely quiet about the library’s location after the Miami Dade College Board of Trustees unanimously approved the property transfer last week, Eric Trump, executive vice president of Trump’s library foundation, took to social media to thank the Florida officials for their resounding support.
“Consistent with our families [sic] DNA, this will be one of the most beautiful buildings ever built, an icon on the Miami skyline — rest assured it will not look like President Obama[‘s] ‘prison like structure,'” the younger Trump wrote. He heads the foundation alongside Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and James Kiley, a Trump attorney.
The 2.63 acre parcel belonged to Miami Dade College as an employee parking lot for its Wolfson Campus.
It neighbors the Freedom Tower, declared an historical landmark for its role in sheltering Cuban refugees in the 1960s, and the Miami Heat’s basketball arena, located on Miami’s expensively iconic Biscayne Boulevard.

If Minnesota doesn’t take steps to voluntarily rectify the alleged Title IX violations within 10 days, the state will face “imminent enforcement” that could jeopardize federal funding.  
The civil rights offices for the federal education and health and human services departments issued the joint noncompliance finding Wednesday, which states the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota State High School League are violating Title IX by allowing males to compete in girls’ sports and occupy female locker rooms.
Previously, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a formal legal opinion that states barring trans athlete participation would violate the Minnesota Human Rights Act. 
Ellison also sued the Trump administration over its anti-trans executive orders, arguing in his suit that the administration can’t rescind federal funding under Title IX because doing so violates state sovereignty. 
The Minnesota State High School League earlier this year announced that it would not comply with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump barring trans athletes from competing, because Minnesota’s anti-discrimination laws prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. 
U.S. Department of Education’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor issued a scathing statement Wednesday: “For too many years, Minnesota’s political leadership has found itself on the wrong side of justice, common sense and the American people. Now the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota State High School League find themselves on the wrong side of Title IX by allowing males to compete in women’s sports,” he said.
Minnesota must now take steps as part of a “resolution agreement” or risk losing funding: changing policies “permitting males to compete in girls’ sports”; restoring “female athletes all records and titles misappropriated by male athletes competing in female categories”’ and requiring all federally funded entities that participate in Minnesota athletic programs “to adopt biology-based definitions of ‘male’ and ‘female.’”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lindamcmahon_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 14:58:04.211018

A Coast Guard plane carrying several dozen people in immigration custody landed in Alaska in early June.
Several of the men said that they didn’t have bathroom access on the plane — or even seats. They flew shackled in the cargo area of the plane.
They’d been transferred from the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington, to the Anchorage Correctional Complex, a facility run by the state Department of Corrections.“From that moment on, I personally felt dehumanized,” said one man who kept a journal from the experience.
Capital & Main is not identifying him or several other people in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement due to retaliation concerns.
Transfers of people in ICE custody between facilities are becoming more and more common under the Trump administration. According to an ICE Flight Monitor report from Human Rights First, transfer flights from January through August increased 43% compared with the same time period last year.
“These frequent transfers not only disorient individuals but also make it significantly harder for them to access legal counsel and maintain contact with family,” the report says.
ICE and the Alaska Department of Corrections did not respond to requests for comment. GEO Group, the private prison company that runs the Tacoma facility, deferred to ICE.
Luis Peralta, who was transferred from Miami to Tacoma, told Capital & Main that officers did not allow him to bring his personal documents with him when they moved him. That meant that he didn’t have access to any phone numbers for family members — his mother’s had been written on a piece of paper in his belongings at the Miami facility.
That also meant he hadn’t been able to reach the attorney that his family found for him, he said. Peralta, who has been in the U.S. since he was a child and was arrested by ICE outside his home in Miami, said he hoped to fight to stay in the U.S. because he has several children here and provides for them.
“Hopefully we don’t get transferred again,” Peralta said. “Being transferred is like the worst experience that anybody could go through.”
He said that during the transfer, officials didn’t tell the group where the plane was headed until they had been flying for several hours. Each man received a piece of bread and cheese and a bottle of water as the only sustenance for the entire day, he said.
Their wrists, ankles and waists were shackled together, he said.
“If something malfunctions in the air, there’s nothing you can do about it,” he said. “It’s very, very, very scary.”
Another man transferred from Miami said that ICE transferred him after a judge approved his request for bond so that he could get out of custody.
“It was like a strategic move,” the man said. “I went to court. The judge approved me for a bond, and literally two days later I was here.”
He said a judge in Tacoma later denied him bond.
“I don’t see like it’s fair to us as human beings to just be shipping us around the country like this,” the man said. “I’m on the other side of the country away from my family. My family can’t come visit me.”
When guards informed men in one of the housing units at Northwest ICE Processing Center that they were being transferred to Alaska, some at first refused to go, according to accounts from several men in the unit. 
One man who was waiting to be deported said an ICE officer saw his name on the list and took it off, along with several others, so he stayed in Tacoma. He said other people who were sent to Alaska were also waiting for deportation.
“If I’m waiting to get deported, why would I go to Alaska?” he said. “It makes zero sense.”
After several of the men refused to leave the Tacoma facility, officials threatened them with federal criminal charges, according to multiple accounts. Then officials arrived in riot gear, according to the detainees. Some people used sheets to hold their doors closed, according to the detainees, while others watched, worried that they would be swept up in whatever violence might come, even though they weren’t participating.
Before the officials in riot gear entered the unit, those on the list negotiated with ICE, according to the detainees.
“They’d rather go rather than be hurt and then go,” one man recalled other detainees saying.
The men sent to Alaska said their transfer there meant they spent several weeks in conditions even worse than those they had previously complained about at the Tacoma facility run by GEO Group — conditions that contradict ICE’s own policies and standards.
“I felt frustrated,” José Alvarez recalled in Spanish of his transfer to Alaska. “I felt powerless.”
Several of the men told Capital & Main that they were not allowed to make phone calls for days, so they were unable to inform their families or their attorneys what had happened to them or where they were. Under the ICE detention standards, facilities are required to provide phone access to detainees during waking hours.
When, after several days, one man asked for access to his belongings so he could get a phone number to make a call, a guard at the facility left and returned with other guards who launched pepper spray, according to several of the men.
“You are completely unable to breathe for two days, and you’re coughing every 10 seconds because all the residue is stuck to the walls and the floor,” one man recalled.
The men were held in overcrowded cells, with one sleeping on a mattress on the floor, they said. In another violation of ICE detention standards, they weren’t given daily access to the yard, they said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska wrote a letter to the Alaska Department of Corrections and ICE about the conditions that the men were held in, including the incident involving pepper spray, which the letter calls a “particularly egregious and excessive use of force.”
The letter says that the facility staff did not follow ICE guidance which would require a consultation with medical staff prior to using pepper spray.
“If they had, they would have been made aware that one of the individuals whom they pepper sprayed was diagnosed with borderline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that exposure to such an irritant could be deadly,” the ACLU of Alaska wrote in the letter.
In the letter, the ACLU noted that it had already sued over conditions in the facility in the state criminal system before ICE moved people in its custody there, and it said that multiple people have died in the facility this year.
“In other words, ACC currently does not safely house those charged with or convicted of crimes,” the ACLU wrote in the letter (emphasis in original). “And immigrant detainees are entitled to even greater protections.”
That’s because people in ICE custody are in civil detention rather than criminal custody, meaning that they cannot be held as punishment and the standards for what custody looks like for them are supposed to be different.
“On June 4, 2025, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) agent asked how many immigrant detainees the Anchorage Correctional Complex (“ACC”) could safely house for longer than 72 hours,” the letter says. “Given the inability of ACC to meet federal standards of care, the answer should have been zero.”
A few of the men were deported while in Alaska. The rest returned to Northwest ICE Processing Center after a few weeks at the Alaska facility.
But as ICE transfers continue to increase, the detainees do not know how long they might remain there.
“We’re not animals,” Peralta said. “Animals are treated better than the way we are being treated in here.”

In a memo sent to her cabinet and shared with the media Tuesday, Sanders put the onus of funding the government on Democrats, stating she hoped they would not “obstruct” the clean stopgap spending bill extending funding to November that GOP leadership in D.C. and President Donald Trump want.
Federal funding expires at midnight Tuesday, the end of the federal fiscal year, unless Congress passes appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to fund the government before then.

“As a state, we must be prepared to ensure the continuation of those services vital to the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, while temporarily suspending government services that rely on federal funding” if the government shuts down, Sanders wrote.
In the event of a shutdown, cabinet secretaries are to work with the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Shared Services to determine which programs will be suspended and which employees will be furloughed, according to the memo.
Employees in federally-funded programs that have been identified as “being necessary to protect public health, safety, or welfare” may continue if federal funding is guaranteed during the shutdown, Sanders wrote. Programs that have “sufficient federal funding and authorization from current or previous federal grants to fund a program or position” may also continue as long as that money remains available.
But starting Wednesday, programs and positions that do not fall under those two categories and rely fully or partially on federal funding will be suspended until the shutdown concludes, Sanders wrote.

“The federal government will not allow us to make any exceptions unless the protection of public health, safety, and welfare would be compromised,” Sanders wrote.
House Republicans have already passed a continuing resolution extending government funding until November, but the measure requires Democratic support to reach 60 votes in the Senate. Democrats have not provided it so far, accusing the GOP of refusing to negotiate with them on the extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Republicans have accused Democrats of “hostage-taking” for not supporting the funding extension. Both parties insist the other will be blamed by voters for the first shutdown since 2019 if a deal doesn’t materialize.
The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported Tuesday that Arkansas legislative leaders wrote to top Senate Democrats and Republicans last week urging them to adopt a continuing resolution before the deadline.
Arkansas Senate Majority Leader Blake Johnson of Corning and Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester of Cave Springs, both Republicans, wrote that a government shutdown would “needlessly disrupt our economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions. … Put simply, a government shutdown should not be used as political leverage to pass partisan reforms — these are not chips Congress should be bargaining with.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott has introduced federal legislation to codify that order.
Antifa is a decentralized leftist movement that stands for “anti-fascist.” It has no hierarchical organization structure, bank accounts, or revenue streams. Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, said last week that the president had incorrectly labeled the group.
“Never in our history has the U.S. government named a domestic terrorist organization,” he said.
In 2020, former FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional committee that Antifa was a movement or an ideology, not an organization.
The Department of Homeland Security issued a press release Friday entitled, “DHS is fighting back against Antifa violence.”
It went on to say that the agency had arrested “dozens of Antifa-aligned left-wing violent extremists who have attacked law enforcement, murdered innocent civilians, and launched a wave of violent riots throughout the United States.”
Scott’s Stop ANTIFA Act directs the National Joint Terrorism Task Force to coordinate and supervise a comprehensive national strategy to “investigate, prosecute, and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law.”
The legislation also calls upon the U.S. attorney general to issue specific guidance that “ensures domestic terrorism priorities include politically motivated terrorist acts such as organized doxxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder.”
“Antifa has gotten away with its evils and terrorized cities across our country for far too long,” Scott said in a written statement.
“Violence against our brave law enforcement officers and ICE agents will not be tolerated — especially when it’s domestic terrorists like Antifa wreaking havoc on our communities. These people actively work to destroy the American way of life and call for the overthrow of American government and society.”

,DC,2025-09-30 18:00:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"About 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed in shutdown, nonpartisan CBO projects",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/about-750000-federal-workers-will-be-furloughed-shutdown-nonpartisan-cbo-projects,,"WASHINGTON — A government shutdown could have significant economic consequences, though an analysis released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it’s difficult to pinpoint ramifications without knowing the length of a funding lapse or how exactly the Trump administration will try to reshape the federal workforce. Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote in a four-page letter the agency projects about 750,000 federal workers would be furloughed, leading to a $400 million impact per day. “The number of furloughed employees could vary by the day because some agencies might furlough more employees the longer a shutdown persists and others might recall some initially furloughed employees,” Swagel wrote. New plans from the Trump administration to lay off federal employees en masse, he wrote, could significantly change those calculations. The economic impacts and ramifications for business activity are hard to predict, he wrote, because it’s not yet clear how exactly the Trump administration will handle a shutdown or how long it will take congressional leaders to broker a stopgap funding agreement. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 and lasted through January 2019 led to a loss of about $3 billion in gross domestic product that couldn’t be recovered, according to a prior CBO analysis that was referenced in the letter. That represented about 0.02% of annual GDP in 2019. Swagel wrote the “effects of a government shutdown on business activity are uncertain, and their magnitude would depend on the duration of a shutdown and on decisions made by the Administration. “CBO expects that if a government shutdown persisted for several weeks, some private-sector entities would never recover all of the income they lost as a result of the suspension of federal activity.”CBO conducted the analysis after receiving a request from Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst. Thune, Schumer debate shutdown on Senate floorA government shutdown will begin Wednesday unless congressional leaders broker a stopgap funding agreement before the new fiscal year starts. That seemed like a long shot early Tuesday afternoon as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., engaged in a brief debate on the floor, a rarity. Thune said Democrats would have the same leverage on health care issues they have now in mid-November, when the stopgap spending bill that passed the House but stalled in the Senate would expire. “They will have another funding cliff they can take advantage of come November the 21st,” Thune said. “This funds the government and protects federal workers and the American people from the hostage-taking that has become, evidently, now the Democratic norm. Even though it’s something they decried not that many years ago.”Thune told reporters afterward the chamber would likely be out of session for Yom Kippur, which begins shortly before sunset on Wednesday and continues until Thursday night, but would otherwise hold votes during a shutdown.“We will observe the Jewish holiday, but I would expect additional votes throughout the week,” Thune said. “I mean, we filed last night on a whole new bunch of (nominees) and I would expect additional votes on funding the government.”Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., canceled the House’s schedule for this week and doesn’t plan for that chamber to go back into session until Oct. 6 at the earliest.Meeting breaks up with no dealCongressional leaders, including Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, but were unable to make progress toward a stopgap funding agreement.Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday that Democrats need a deal with GOP leaders to extend the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, which are set to expire at the end of the year. “In a day or two, millions of Americans — millions — are going to get notices that their insurance premiums will rise an average of $400 a month, $5,000 a year,” Schumer said. “A middle-class family can’t afford that. We want to renew those credits, among other things in health care. But renew those credits so that people won’t pay that horrible increase.”Schumer called Republican assertions that Democrats want immigrants without legal status to have access to federal health care programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, “utter bull.”“There is no money, not a penny of federal dollars that are going there. So why do they bring this up? Because they’re afraid to talk about the real issue, which is health care for American citizens, health care for people who need the health care and can’t afford these premiums,” Schumer said.Without a new funding law before the start of the fiscal year at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, the government will begin shutting down.The ramifications will be significantly broader than the 35-day shutdown that took place during Trump’s first term, when five of the dozen full-year government spending bills had become law.That isn’t the case this time around and a shutdown is expected to affect every department and agency to varying degrees.'They're taking a risk'White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought has also called on Trump administration officials to implement mass layoffs during a prolonged funding lapse.Trump said during a press conference in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he didn’t want a shutdown but that his administration might take sweeping action to restructure the federal government if one does begin. “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said, referring to Democrats. “So they're taking a risk by having a shutdown, because because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits.”",,,,2025-09-30 14:58:04.211018

(Stock photo by Paul Souders/Getty Images)A federal judge ruled this week that Maine’s lawsuit against major fossil fuel companies can move forward in state court after some defendants tried to elevate it to federal. 
Last year, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey sued Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP, Sunoco and the American Petroleum Institute for failing to warn consumers and concealing their knowledge of the consequences increased use of fossil fuels can have, such as extreme weather, sea-level rise, warmer temperatures, property damage and negative impacts on public health.
At that time, the state demanded a jury trial and relief through damages, penalties and more. The suit also asked the defendants to pay for both past and future climate-related harms caused by the fossil fuel industry and stop their alleged deception in Maine. 
However, two of the defendants used the “federal officer removal statute” to have the case moved from state to federal court, according to legal documents. The defendants cited various activities they carried out under direction from the federal government as to why the case should be relocated. 
AG Frey sues fossil fuel companies for deceiving Mainers about climate change

Frey’s office filed a motion to bring the case back to state court and recover the costs and fees associated with the initial removal, arguing that moving the case was “objectively unreasonable.”
On Monday, U.S. Judge Nancy Torresen ordered the case be sent back to state court and that the fossil fuel companies pay for the expenses incurred by the state. She said the defendants’ arguments in support of the move were “slightly— and cleverly—revised versions of the same removal arguments to at least a dozen federal courts across the country” that have all rejected them.
Frey told Maine Morning Star he appreciates the court’s “thorough analysis” and decision to send the case back to state court, where it was originally filed. 
“Enough with the delays, Mainers deserve their day in court to hold the defendants accountable for the high costs of surviving the impacts of their deception,” he added. 
Maine is one of 10 states, along with Washington D.C. and dozens of city, county and tribal governments, that have filed lawsuits intended to hold major oil and gas companies accountable for deceiving the public about their products’ role in climate change. 
Frey filed Maine’s lawsuit two weeks after documents published by the international investigative outlet DeSmog showed that scientists were warning fossil fuel companies as early as 1955 about the long term consequences of their work, which they in turn sought to conceal. 
With these lawsuits moving closer to trial, there have been efforts to create legal protections for fossil fuel companies. In June, more than a dozen attorneys general proposed creating a “liability shield” for oil and gas companies similar to a 2005 law that protected gun manufacturers from lawsuits.

(Photos by West Virginia Department of Health and Kristian Thacker)Newly-released documents from the governor’s office verify that the company buying the state’s four long-term care hospitals won’t be required to build new facilities in the current hospital locations.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey is selling hospitals in Beckley, Fairmont, Terra Alta and West Columbia to a subsidiary of Marx Development Group, a New York-based company. The hospitals, which need extensive repairs, are operating at a $6 million yearly loss to the state.
The facilities currently serve mostly elderly patients who are reliant on Medicaid and can’t afford private care. 
On top of the purchase amount, the buyer has committed $80 million to build at least three new hospitals, according to sale documents obtained by West Virginia Watch through a public records request. 
It’s still not known what nursing homes might close or where the new locations will be — a point of concern for communities that rely on the facilities for family members’ care and jobs. The contract doesn’t include any location requirements. 
House of Delegates member Jonathan Pinson’s district includes Lakin Hospital, a 114-bed long-term care facility in Mason County.
“I believe it is vital that any future hospital improvements prioritize the communities where existing facilities already serve patients,” said Pinson, R-Mason, on Tuesday. “While I welcome investment and modernization, I would like to see the long term investments of new facilities being made in our communities.”
He added, “New hospitals should be built in the same communities to ensure continuity of care and stability for families and workers.”
The buyer can continue operating the hospitals that don’t require new construction. 
Company required to meet milestones in hospital construction 
The sales agreement includes construction deadlines for Majestic Care, a subsidiary that will operate the nursing homes in West Virginia. 
The company must acquire at least three new long-term care facility sites within six months or pay $5 million to the state. Majestic Care would have to pay a separate $5 million in damages if substantial completion of the new long-term care facilities isn’t completed in roughly 14 months of when the sale is expected to close Oct. 1.
Paul Pruitt, CEO of Majestic Care, has told news outlets that the goal is to build new facilities close to the current ones. The company aims to use labor and materials from West Virginia. 
“I think one of the major concerns is that these facilities would be moved to metropolitan areas and especially away from rural locations,” said Sen. Joey Garcia, whose district includes the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont. “That will affect patient care, families’ ability to visit and employees’ ability to work at these facilities.”
Garcia, an attorney, has said he intends to sue the Morrisey administration over the sale of John Manchin hospital. He argues that the governor didn’t have statutory authority to sell the hospital without the Legislature’s approval.
The concern is that the patients who are being cared for and those who need this type of care in the future will be able to retire in the state of West Virginia.
Morrisey has promised current patients won’t lose care and many staff will retain their jobs. The state has been heavily reliant on contract nurses to staff state-owned hospitals. 
The sales agreement said Majestic Care must evaluate the performance of current employees and and make “good faith efforts to offer employment to substantially all existing employees at the facilities on or before the closing date.” The company has to prioritize the hiring of current employees over third-party applicants. 
Letters have been sent out to state hospital employees asking them to indicate if they will apply for a position with MDG, explore retirement options or resign from their position with the state.

Lawmakers plan to take up DOH’s authority to address vaccination policy amidst federal tumult during a special legislative session. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)During the special legislation session starting Wednesday and focused on federal health insurance and food assistance programs, New Mexico lawmakers also plan to address state laws on vaccine policy.
Current federal tumult over vaccine availability requires providing state officials the flexibility “to set their own standards,” Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth recently told Source NM.
New Mexico Department of Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham told Source NM she hopes the changes in the law will offer state officials more leeway as federal vaccine policy faces delays and uncertainty.
The hope is to “bulletproof” the state’s vaccination policy infrastructure and send clear public health messages, she noted.
“We are essentially hoping to just broaden the guidance that we can rely on in making vaccine decisions,” Durham said.
Durham pointed to the recent challenges the state faced in offering COVID-19 vaccines. State law requires pharmacies to follow guidelines set by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. But under the current federal administration, those guidelines have not been finalized. Thus, the state “was left in limbo,” she said.
As such, DOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie issued a public health order on Aug. 29 that directed the state pharmacy board to update its protocols to ease access. Then Durham wrote a statewide prescription for all residents. The situation, Durham noted, illustrated that the state needs to “craft its own recommendations.”
NM health department provides COVID-19 vaccine prescription for all residents

Durham pointed to clinical guidance released by professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics or others as a means for the department to craft effective policy guidance for pharmacists and other medical professionals.
“[American Academy of Pediatrics] and others have reviewed vaccines independently and just usually come to the same conclusion as ACIP, so we haven’t had conflicting recommendations,” Durham said. “What’s happening with ACIP right now — it’s not meeting in a timely manner and not providing strong evidence-based recommendations.”
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Recent uncertainty may be worsened by the federal shutdown expected on Oct. 1 if Congress doesn’t pass a budget to fund the government.
“I would hope the acting CDC director would be considered an essential worker, but there’s really no way to know,” Durham told Source NM.
Durham said having a state policy will also help “screen out the noise” of misinformation about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
“We think the Department of Health is well positioned to be really clear about what’s best for New Mexico. And again, it doesn’t necessarily have to be different than what’s best for other states, but we really do want to focus on that,” Durham said.
Other states have also begun charting their own vaccine policies. California, Oregon and Washington announced a public health alliance, while New York declared a disaster, citing the Trump Administration’s limits on the use of COVID-19 vaccinations.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)A plan to allow cellphone jamming in prisons can move forward, the Federal Communications Commission decided Tuesday.
The three-person commission’s unanimous vote represented a major win for state officials who have long said jamming is the best way to deal with an inundation of contraband cellphones in the state prison system. The voted will open up the policy for public comment, to be followed by another vote at a to-be-determined date.
SC officials hopeful FCC will allow cellphone blocking in prison: ‘Jamming is the answer’

Current and former state Department of Corrections directors praised the commission for considering the change at all, after more than a decade of trying and failing to get any movement on the issue.
“Inmates with illegal cellphones commit serious crimes,” agency director Joel Anderson said in a Tuesday statement. “It’s that simple.”
Commission Chairman Brendan Carr told the story of Capt. Robert Johnson, an anti-contraband officer who in 2010 was shot six times at his Sumter home. Angry about the loss of a recent contraband package Johnson’s team had seized, inmates used an illegal cellphone to order the hit.
“Thankfully, Capt. Johnson survived, but in many ways, his story is not unique,” Carr told the commission Tuesday.
Cellphones have also allowed inmates to run extortion schemes and major drug rings, all from within prison walls, state officials have said. Similar crimes have taken place across the country, Carr said.

Officials have said the technology within prisons is extremely precise, blocking signals only within the walls.
But Commissioner Anna Gomez said she still worried about jamming devices interfering with nearby homes and businesses, as well as emergency calls. She asked for the commission to start with a smaller pilot program to see how the technology works.
Cellphone jamming is already used in federal prisons.
“While the problem we are trying to address is of critical importance, I worry about the potential unintended consequences of permitting jamming by non-federal actors and permitting jamming equipment to formally enter the American market,” Gomez said.
South Carolina will be ready as soon as a change takes effect, officials said earlier this month.
The state was the first in the nation to use a technology tracking cell signals within prisons, which allows officials to alert cellphone companies of unauthorized devices and get them turned off. Officials have compared to the process to a game of “Whac-A-Mole,” saying it’s time-consuming to identify and get phones turned off individually.
That technology, which legislators have spent $18.5 million over two years to install and maintain, can be adjusted to block all cellphone signals within a prison instead of just detecting them. All the state needs is the commission’s OK.
Tuesday’s vote follows turnover at the commission.

Both the House and Senate worked last Friday, Sept. 26, spending nearly 19 hours in a joint conference committee to hash out the loose framework announced late last Thursday. Members left that meeting confident that the deal would hold with some aspects dropped in favor of others.
State Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen), who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said that all parties felt that the conference budget was balanced and that they were close to being comfortable with putting it forward. 
But that development was over the weekend, and there was little public action on Monday and negotiations continued into Tuesday. As of 1 p.m., neither chamber had passed a conference committee budget and top level negotiations were still taking place.

The governor’s office and the state budget team were meeting midday as the House and Senate were also still talking to each other.
Negotiations were not described as having stalled out or at an impasse, as the House had most of its pieces regarding new revenue in the face of cuts and policy changes to bolster its $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion road repair and rebuild spending plan. The Senate was taking a bit longer on its revenue pieces and roads policy bits.
Members of the House were confident that they had the votes on their side to pass the plan as brokered, but a question remained on whether the Senate had the votes to do the same. There was also some struggling going on in the Senate over the proposed 24% wholesale tax on marijuana products that would be an integral part of the road funding deal.
That bill is House Bill 4951, creating the new tax.
The Senate was planning on holding an appropriations committee meeting midday but after gaveling in at 1 p.m., they immediately recessed until further notice.
While the House and Senate floor sat quiet, the halls of the Capitol rang out with the voices of protestors opposing the House’s plan to raise revenue for roads by implementing a 24% wholesale tax on marijuana, expected to generate $420 million.

When asked whether the House’s marijuana plan had created a hold up in the upper chamber, Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township) said “everything’s rolling forward,” and that he did not have any further comment.
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) pointed to larger concern as far as any issues holding up the Senate.
“I mean, it’s a rock in the shoe that I haven’t seen a budget yet, and it’s almost October 1,” Irwin said.
Either way, the respective chambers had a sense that the night would go long but an end goal was in sight to have a budget ready to present to the governor by at least the morning. 
Time will tell if the conference committee plan holds as the night wears on.

Here’s a brief introduction to some of the important facts and figures around the federal-state health insurance program for low-income residents.
Why is Medicaid important to New Mexico?
Among the states, New Mexico has the highest Medicaid enrollment per capita at 42% of the state’s population, according to the state Health Care Authority’s fact sheet released in September.
Medicaid is the largest expenditure in the state’s health care budget. The state’s Medicaid program covers pregnant women, children; families; people with disabilities; people who are elderly and need long term care; people experiencing mental health crises; and more. The majority of people on Medicaid in New Mexico are employed.
Medicaid pays for more than half the births in New Mexico, and covers 294,566 children as of August 2025.
According to the HCA’s analysis in March, Medicaid patients make up nearly one-third of the state’s hospital volume and New Mexico receives approximately $3.9 billion in annual Medicaid payments per year.
New Mexico hospitals and patients face closure from ‘domino effect’ of potential Medicaid cuts

How does the federal budget bill impact New Mexico’s Medicaid?
The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by congressional Republicans earlier this year included cuts to the Medicaid program and limits on eligibility. Officials expect those changes will shift more costs to the state.
Currently, New Mexico pays about 30% for Medicaid while the federal share is about 70% (it can be up to 90%, depending on the patient’s income).The federal government wants to reduce that percentage, which could cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars to replace.
“No state can meet such an abrupt and costly funding need, which is the point — this proposal is intended to force states to stop covering working-age adults,” the Health Care Authority said in its memo, possibly leaving a large uninsured population.
The New Mexico Health Care Authority estimates that the state’s Medicaid program could see losses exceeding $8.5 billion over the next decade from lowering how much they pay providers.
New eligibility requirements will mean an estimated 88,530 New Mexicans will lose Medicaid coverage permanently, according to the Health Care Authority. That includes nearly 10,000 active Medicaid non-citizens.
At least 254,400 adults on Medicaid will be subject to Medicaid’s new work requirements.
Additionally, the federal mandates will require patients who make less money to pay for cost-sharing of up to $35 per service. While primary care, mental health, and substance use disorder services are exempted, advocates worry this will deter people from seeking care.

When do the Medicaid changes go into effect?
The bulk of the changes will take several years to go into effect. The permanent disenrollment of active Medicaid non-citizens will occur by October 2026. New work requirements go into place in January 2027, and the state’s rate cuts will begin in January 2028, along with cost-sharing.
What other concerns about Medicaid will lawmakers address?
Lawmakers will address additional funds for the state’s food assistance and Medicaid computer system, which will require $24 million to update and run.
The Health Care Authority said new eligibility requirements will impact the state’s marketplace for transitioning people off of Medicaid, but who do not have health insurance through their employers. Members who were brought to the U.S. as young children classified as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are no longer eligible for the state’s marketplace coverage starting on Oct. 1, 2025.
What opposition will shoring up the state’s Medicaid face?
Republican lawmakers have said in meetings and in interviews that concerns about cuts to federal health care and food assistance programs are overblown, and noted they will not go into effect for several years.
In a Sept. 19 interview with Source NM, Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said he opposed the governor’s call for a special session.
“But the question is: What is her big emergency? And as far as I can tell, there is no big emergency other than my belief, she just simply wants people to stand up and talk bad about President Trump,” Sharer said.

TRIO programs help students who are first in their families to go to college, have lower incomes or live with disabilities.
David James, TRIO director at Fort Peck Community College, said Monday his college has a “legacy program,” funded since the 1980s, and it has appealed its initial grant denial.
The status is pending.
However, the current grant runs only through Tuesday, and on Wednesday, James said the 230 students served through TRIO at the tribal college may not have the mentoring or tutoring or other support offered by the program.
“There will be nobody here to help them,” James said.
Chief Dull Knife College, on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, also was denied funding, according to TRIO leaders.
Chief Dull Knife College could not be reached Monday about its TRIO Student Support Services program, although James said he believes it likely appealed its initial grant denial as well.
The Trump administration has been making moves to significantly change education policy, including appointing Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who is charged with dismantling the federal Department of Education.
The changes have led to national uncertainty for TRIO programs, major cuts to the federal department, and other significant shifts to public education, including changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.







Critics allege the changes hurt students and middle-class families, but proponents say they will cut unnecessary bureaucracy, and states could design their own programs with less cost and hassle.







 TRIO in limbo

Although James had yet to hear a final decision Monday about TRIO funding for Fort Peck college students, staffing changes are underway.
He said one TRIO staff member took another job, and another job will end Tuesday. James said he is working on a transfer within the college, but he also could be furloughed.
Blackfeet Community College President Brad Hall said his school had a TRIO Student Support Services program in the past, and its application to reapply this year was denied.
Data, however, show significant student achievement for students who participate in TRIO programs.
Daniel Benge, program director for TRIO at the University of Montana, said 77% of students at UM “persist,” or continue college from one year to the next. By comparison, he said, 88.3% of those who are part of TRIO Student Support Services “persist.”
Montana State University also exceeds its goals for TRIO Student Support Services.
In the 2023-24 school year, MSU had a goal that 79% of all TRIO SSS students “persisted,” and it surpassed that goal, reaching 85%, according to data on its website.
James said he didn’t have data immediately available for TRIO students at Fort Peck, but they show similar high achievement.
“It’s really going to impact the students here,” James said.
 Historically, bipartisan support

In 2024, all TRIO programs in the state received $9.7 million in funding, including $4.6 million for TRIO Student Support Services, according to UM.
Other TRIO programs include Upward Bound, which provides tutoring, counseling and other services to high school students in preparation for college, and Veterans Upward Found, which focuses on helping military veterans enroll in and finish college.
At Montana State University, the TRIO Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program received full funding for the academic year, said MSU spokesperson Mike Becker.
The McNair program supports “exemplary undergraduate students” who have not traditionally participated in higher education to participate in graduate programs.
In 2024, TRIO served 9,976 students in Montana, according to data from UM.
Historically, Benge said TRIO programs have had strong bipartisan support in Congress, including from the Montana delegation, given participants’ achievement records.
Benge said TRIO outcomes reflect research results, and TRIO can show a return on investment to policymakers.
Research shows students stay motivated to complete college when they have a connection with somebody on campus — “TRIO is that connection,” said Benge, who has worked with TRIO programs for 30 years, earlier at MSU-Billings.
The students get frequent one-on-one support and mentoring at a rate an academic adviser doesn’t have capacity for, he said.
At UM, he said, students also connect with the campus through TRIO lunch-and-learns and in the TRIO computer and study lab, for instance.
The cost of TRIO at UM is about $1,382 a year per student, and one study found a TRIO graduate’s average contribution to the federal budget through taxes means that investment is paid back in 12 to 18 months.
“It’s a good return on investment,” Benge said.
The late U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns supported TRIO, he said, as did former U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg, both Republicans, and former U.S. Sens. Jon Tester and Max Baucus, Democrats.
Members of Montana’s current all-Republican congressional delegation did not respond to requests for comment sent Monday afternoon about TRIO.
However, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines in 2017 was among the lawmakers who called for support for TRIO Upward Bound after the Department of Education found some programs ineligible for funding based on a grant formatting error.
 Always ‘topsy turvy,’ but funding uncertain in the future

President Donald Trump has been taking an aggressive stance on federal funding, one that has created unpredictability for education.
But Benge said only Congress has the authority to dismantle TRIO.
He said he’s been in TRIO long enough to have seen uncertainty before, and at least a couple of the previous attempts to gut TRIO have resulted in increased funding.
“There’s always topsy-turvy,” Benge said. “There’s always been significant bipartisan support.”
He said that support could continue, or Congress might shift its priorities under the Trump administration.
“They might bend to the will of the president and say, ‘We no longer want to have TRIO programs,’” he said. “Then the House and the Senate have to battle it out and decide whether they’re going to agree or disagree.”
 TRIO at Fort Peck

James said some students walk in the door at Fort Peck not knowing how to use a computer or write a resume, but TRIO helps them get degrees.
“(There’s) no greater thing in the world than watching one of my students graduate,” James said.
Especially as a Native American himself, James said he hopes that he might be able to support those students in the future, possibly in a transfer to a different job on campus.
“I’m a warrior, and that’s what warriors do. They help their people. They uplift them,” he said.
James said he doesn’t know when he might hear an answer from the Department of Education on the appeal, but he’s concerned about the possible effects on students if the answer is no.
“It’s going to be such a great loss. It really is,” James said.



MSU lauded McMahon for focus on economic opportunity, spokesperson says 
Although some federal changes in education have led to unpredictability, including for TRIO, some political leaders also have praised the Trump administration’s focus on jobs and the economy.
Earlier this month, Education Secretary Linda McMahon visited Montana State University, and MSU President Brock Tessman presented her a special pin for her “exemplary” support for the university.
MSU spokesperson Michael Becker said Tessman made the decision himself to present McMahon with the pin, which has an enamel MSU logo, because McMahon stressed the importance of aligning education with economic opportunity.
He said McMahon also has stressed the importance of “skills-based and job-focused learning.”
“Those are values shared by Montana State as we prepare our graduates to be successful in their careers after college when they take what they have learned and use it to the benefit of our local communities, state and nation,” Becker said in an email.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1383546236-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 13:56:58.293789

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A New Mexico Supreme Court order reorganizing the state’s water courts goes into effect Wednesday, Oct. 1, the Office of the Administrative Courts announced this week.
The order creates a “regional structure for water courts more closely aligned with the boundaries of New Mexico’s stream systems,” a news release announced, with designated water judges presiding over water law cases in a particular regions. Prior to the order, each of the state’s 13 judicial districts had one water law judge. water law judge in each of the state’s 13 judicial districts. Under the order, five district court judges are appointed to serve as water court judges in the three regions.
“This plan helps the judiciary address complex, technical water disputes that occur regularly because of conflicts between water users and appeals from administrative decisions,” state Supreme Court Chief Justice David K. Thomson said in a statement. “Having regional water courts will be particularly important during periods of sustained severe drought when water disputes likely will become more frequent and can impact agricultural users, communities and businesses across many counties.”
The water courts will cover cases that involve conflicts over water usage; special water districts such as irrigation districts; and appeals of decisions by the Office of the State Engineer, the news release said, but the new structure won’t impact water rights adjudication cases within specific stream systems or basins.
Justice C. Shannon Bacon, who led the reorganization, according to the news release, said the new structure “will help judges develop more specialized subject matter expertise in water issues covering large regions of the state. New Mexicans will benefit from having regional courts resolve disputes over water that can involve many interconnected technical issues.” The order requires the water judges to attend annual water law training and earn continuing educational credits in the topic.
Three water regions
Water Region 1 encompasses north-central and northwestern New Mexico and includes nine counties in the First, Second, Eleventh and Thirteenth Judicial Districts. Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Farmington are among the communities in the region, which includes the San Juan and Chama rivers and portions of the Rio Grande. First Judicial District Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid is the region’s designated water judge.
Region 2 covers southwestern New Mexico, including Doña Ana County, and includes eight counties in the Third, Sixth and Seventh Judicial Districts. Las Cruces, Deming and Silver City are among the communities in the region, which includes portions of the Rio Grande and the Gila River systems. Sixth Judicial District Chief Judge Jarod Hofacket and Third Judicial District Judge Manuel Arrieta are the designated water judges in the district. Hofacket also will continue to preside over adjudication of the Animas Underground Basin.
Region 3 covers the eastern half of the state, and includes 16 counties in the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Twelfth Judicial Districts. Las Vegas, Tucumcari, Raton, Taos, Clovis, Portales, Roswell, Artesia, Carlsbad and Hobbs are in the region, which includes the Canadian and Pecos rivers and the northernmost portion of the Rio Grande. Fifth Judicial District Judge Dustin Hunter is the district’s designated water judge.
Second Judicial District Court Judge Erin O’Connell will serve as an alternate water judge for any of the regions, and retired Court of Appeals Judge James Wechsler will “continue to preside over general stream adjudications in state court to determine the legal scope of individual water rights in certain hydrogeologic areas of the state, such as the lower Rio Grande and the Pecos River,” the news release said.

Richardson will be stepping down as division director by the end of October. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).MO Healthnet Division Director Todd Richardson will step down from his position leading the state’s Medicaid program at the end of October, according to a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services.
Richardson’s decision comes as his division prepares to implement a series of new directives from Congress on how states administer the federal healthcare program for low-income and disabled Americans, including work requirements and a cap on a key tax states use to pay for the program.
Baylee Watts, spokesperson for the department, said Director Jessica Bax will work with the governor’s office to select an interim director by mid-October, and that the department does not anticipate any interruptions to the healthcare of Missourians enrolled in the program. 
“I think they have a strong bench that is willing to step in and cover any gaps,” Watts said. “But no, we don’t foresee any changes or gaps in operations.”
At the end of August, roughly 1.3 million Missourians were enrolled in Medicaid, according to the Missouri Family Support Division.
Richardson, a Republican from Poplar Bluff, served in the Missouri House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018, when former Gov. Mike Parson tapped him to helm the state’s Medicaid program. 
Richardson helped coordinate the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and took a months-long leave of absence in 2021, as lawmakers debated whether to fund the voter-approved expansion of Medicaid in the state. Upon his return, the division began enrolling  Missourians who newly qualified for coverage, after a judge ordered the Department of Social Services to carry out the plan approved by 53.3% of voters in August 2020.
There are more than 350,000 people ages 19 to 64 enrolled under the expansion program. Under the budget act passed this year by Congress, Missouri has until December 2026 to require adults covered under expansion – those under 65 who earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level – to work, volunteer or study at least 80 hours per month to receive benefits. 
Georgia, one of the only states with current Medicaid work requirements, spent $54.2 million over five years to administer work requirements, according to Stateline. That is more than twice the amount spent on medical benefits for those in the work program.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Last year, Detroit pulled off something remarkable. The 2024 NFL Draft shattered attendance records. It drew visitors from all over the country and generated an estimated $200+ million in direct economic impact. That’s the kind of headline number that turns heads in Lansing. But here’s the catch: the draft lasted three days. By Monday morning, the cameras packed up, the fans drove home, and the city went back to business as usual. However, the positive economic impact is undeniable.
While Detroit’s sports legacy has instilled a sense of civic pride for decades, the city was built and continues to thrive thanks to its strong immigrant past, present and future.
Andrew Roth’s July 31, 2025, story, “Detroit wants to be a major sports city. But it needs state funding to help,” chronicles efforts to seek state funding to support pursuing similar major sporting events in the future.
Michigan generates significant economic impact in addition to the marquee sporting events, year-round. The playbook is already in our hands: investing in international students and global talent.
Every year, Michigan’s colleges and universities educate more than 38,000 international students. These students come from abroad, pay significant international student tuition and spend money on housing, food, entertainment, goods, and services. According to the Institute of International Education (IIE), the Open Doors report, international students in Michigan spend $1.45 billion each year in Michigan’s economy, supporting over 13,000 jobs. It’s important that we continue to benefit from these expenditures, which are the equivalent of hosting an NFL Draft every other month, year-in and year-out.
The problem is, we train them, then lose them. Too many take their skills, in engineering, AI, health care, and advanced manufacturing, to states like Illinois, Texas, California, or Washington, where employers are more open to using existing immigration pathways to hire them.
And according to the 2024 report, Contributions of New Americans in Michigan, released by the American Immigration Council—in partnership with the Michigan Global Talent Initiative (MGTI)—the data underscores the crucial role immigrants play in the state’s population growth, labor force, business creation, and consumer spending power. In fact, immigrants accounted for 57.7 percent of Michigan’s population growth over last decade and contributed $67.8 billion, or 9.9 percent, of the state’s total GDP in 2022.
Let’s do the math. If Michigan kept just 500 more international student STEM graduates here each year, their combined lifetime earnings would exceed $2 billion, generating tens of millions in state and local tax revenue. In addition to dedicating funds to attracting major sporting events, we need that same competitive mindset for attracting talent.
When Michigan invests in an event, we’re making a calculated bet on short-term tourism dollars. When Michigan invests in international students, they are locating here for years of study, and when Michigan invests in retaining those students after graduation, we’re betting on many more years of their spending and long-term innovation that will drive workforce growth, and the industries that will define the next 50 years.

We’re in a race, not only for fans in stadium seats, but for engineers in our auto plants, researchers in our labs, and for entrepreneurs launching the next great Michigan startup. And it’s not just in high-tech industries—immigrant entrepreneurs already power much of our hospitality sector, from hotels to restaurants, making sure Michigan is ready for visitors and residents alike.
I’m an international student graduate. While I came to America to obtain a master’s degree in public service after a successful career in Albania, I have been working for MGTI post-graduation to help develop and implement strategies to ensure Michigan meets its workforce and talent goals. We’ve seen what’s possible when you give international graduates a reason to build their lives here. Since MGTI was developed in 2019, Michigan has added over 54,000 college-educated immigrants to its workforce. Graduates we’ve helped are now designing advanced robotics in Grand Rapids, leading AI projects in Ann Arbor, and expanding manufacturing in Saginaw. Each of them is a walking, working return on investment.
While Michigan invests millions into attracting sports tourists for a weekend, I urge State leaders to invest millions into keeping the innovators, scientists, and engineers who will power our economy for decades. MGTI was conceived of as a five-year investment, and its third year of funding is pending before the Michigan Legislature.
Sports can put Michigan into the spotlight. Global talent and international students help keep the lights on. It’s important to continue talent funding, just like we’re considering for sports, so we can win the long game. The roar of the crowd fades. The impact of investing in people doesn’t.

Ties, indeed; before becoming UNF’s president in 2022, he was dean of USF’s business college for 10 years.
“The University of South Florida and the Tampa Bay region are special to my family and me,” Limayem said in a news release. “I have always enjoyed working with USF faculty, staff, students, alumni, supporters and the community’s business leaders and I am honored to be considered to lead this great university in its continued pursuit of excellence.”
Community forums regarding Limayem’s potential presidency are yet to be scheduled. Following forums, USF trustees must vote on Limayem. If approved, final confirmation is in the hands of the Florida Board of Governors. 
USF joins presidential hunt — incumbent Rhea Law to step down

USF started searching for a new president in February after Rhea Law announced she would step down at the conclusion of a presidential search. 
Law, an attorney and former chair of the school’s board of trustees, started as interim president in 2021 before officially becoming president in 2022. Former governors Jeb Bush and Charlie Crist appointed Law to the board from 2001 until 2013, overlapping with Limayem at USF at the beginning and end of his stint as dean. 
“We conducted a thorough process that included reviewing an outstanding group of highly qualified candidates from across the nation before deciding that Moez is the best choice for our USF community,” Mike Griffin, chair of the USF search committee, said in a news release. Griffin, a Tampa real estate figure, is vice chair of the trustees. 
“He brings a strong track record of presidential success in Florida in his current role, and we experienced the impact of his leadership firsthand when he led our Muma College of Business,” Griffin continued. “We are confident that Moez is the right person to accelerate our momentum and lead us to even greater heights in the next chapter of our university.”
Limayem became UNF’s president in August 2022. USF touted his presidency at UNF, marked by record enrollment this year. 
He received a master’s of business administration and doctorate degree in information systems from the University of Minnesota in 1988 and 1992, respectively. 
Before his first stint as USF, Limayem was an associate dean at the University of Arkansas College of Business. 
USF keeps with a trend of announcing sole finalists for a president’s position despite regulations requiring “an unranked list of final applicants.” Florida International University and the University of Florida, twice, did the same.
“The search committee is required to submit more than two qualified applicants, selected by a majority vote of the search committee, to the board of trustees for consideration, other than in exceptional circumstances making fulfillment of this requirement infeasible, in which case the committee must discuss why fewer than three applicants are being recommended and whether additional applications should be considered,” Board of Governors regulations state.
If Limayem is confirmed, USF will have swerved a trend of selecting presidents with histories of political service — unlike FIU, Florida Atlantic University, New College of Florida, Florida A&M University, and at the University of West Florida (an interim president). 
Now, UNF will become the latest state institution to begin a search for a new president.
Florida House Rep. Fentrice Driskell (D-Tampa) celebrated the announcement on social media.
“Great news from the USF Presidential Search Committee! I’m excited about this recent update and wish Moez all the best throughout the selection process,” she posted on X.

(AP) — A firearms industry trade and lobbying organization secretly built a database containing the personal information of millions of gun owners and used the data to reach gun rights supporters with political ads dating back to the 2000 elections, according to a new lawsuit.
The suit against the National Shooting Sports Foundation, based in Shelton, Connecticut, alleges the organization obtained the data from major gun manufacturers, whose customers never agreed to share their personal information for political purposes. The suit filed by two gun owners alleges “unjust enrichment” — that the NSSF benefited from using gun owners’ information without paying for it.
The NSSF, whose members include thousands of gun manufacturers, distributors and retail shops, did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment Monday. The organization has said that there was nothing illegal or improper about its data collection.
The lawsuit, filed in Connecticut on Sept. 22, seeks class-action status on behalf of gun owners nationwide. It seeks damages in excess of $5 million but does not provide a specific dollar amount.
The plaintiffs are gun owners Daniel Cocanour, of Oklahoma, and Dale Rimkus, of Illinois, who provided their personal information to gun makers when they filled out warranty cards after buying firearms, the lawsuit says. The cards are used by consumers to obtain rebates and repair or replace their firearms.
The lawsuit mirrors reporting by ProPublica on the NSSF’s use of gun owners’ information for political purposes.
The NSSF began compiling its database in 1999 using warranty card information from manufacturers in the wake of the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado that killed 12 students and a teacher, as gun companies sought to defend their industry against legal action and protect their image, the lawsuit says.
The cards provided a wealth of information about firearms buyers, including contact information, gender, age, income, interests, what vehicles they own and why they bought a gun, according to the lawsuit.
“For decades, NSSF violated the right of firearms purchasers to know who receives their personal information and to control how that information is used,” said Ben Gould, a Seattle-based lawyer for the plaintiffs.

Before the 2000 election, outdoor goods and gun seller Cabela’s shared information on 356,000 customers with a group created by the NSSF that put the data into the database, despite Cabela’s privacy policies telling its customers that their information would only be shared with “reputable companies” to keep them informed of “other outdoor products and manufactures,” the lawsuit says.
Using the Cabela’s information and data bought from a broker, the NSSF group mailed political ads to 2.5 million people, according to the lawsuit.
Bass Pro Shops, which acquired Cabela’s in 2017, said in a statement that it could find no records or anyone with knowledge about Cabela’s violating customers’ privacy.
“Safeguarding our customers’ privacy is something we take very seriously, and we can state unequivocally that Bass Pro Shops has never sold or made available our customers’ personal information to any organization for partisan political purposes,” the company said.
Database grew to include millions of records
By May 2001, the database contained 3.4 million records, including 523,000 from warranty cards and 2.9 million from voter and hunting license lists, the suit says.
Less than a year later, the database — called “Data Hunter” — had grown to 5.5 million records, with the NSSF revealing in an internal document that several firearms manufacturers including Glock, Smith & Wesson, Marlin Firearms and Savage Arms were contributing customer data, the lawsuit says. Those companies did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Monday.
The NSSF claimed in a public report that its advertising using the database was a “critical component” of Republican George W. Bush’s narrow presidential victory in 2000, the lawsuit says. The NSSF used the database in similar political advertising efforts in subsequent elections, the lawsuit claims. In 2016, the group hired the Cambridge Analytica consulting firm to use the database to mobilize gun rights supporters in swing states, according to the lawsuit.
Cambridge Analytica later folded amid revelations that it paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of 87 million Facebook users.
Justin Wagner, senior director of investigations for Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun violence group, said the lawsuit makes it appear that the NSSF was amassing data on gun owners, while at the same time warning that such databases could be used by gun control supporters for mass firearm confiscation.
“We look forward to seeing the NSSF face accountability as the truth about this breach of trust comes to light in the courts,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25272605417765-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-30 12:58:39.963677

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)In remarks after the Council of State meeting Tuesday, Gov. Josh Stein condemned efforts to redraw North Carolina’s congressional map in the middle of the decade after comments by Republican leadership.
“It would be ridiculous to do so. We just redistricted for the second time last cycle. So every two years is the theory that we’re gonna redistrict, so we can maximize the political advantage to stick it to one party and enhance another party?” Stein said. “We cannot get into this maximalist political power worldview because it will destroy this country.”

Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger wrote in a social media post Thursday that he would be open to pursuing mid-decade redistricting in North Carolina after Republican-led states like Texas and Missouri have adopted new maps at President Donald Trump’s behest.
“We have drawn four Congressional maps in the last six years in redistricting fights with Democrats because of their sue-until-blue strategy,” Berger wrote on X. “If we have to draw one more map this year, we will.”
Currently, North Carolina’s congressional map consists of 10 Republican-held seats and four Democratic-held seats. Only the 1st Congressional District, held by Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), was decided by a margin of less than 10% of the vote in 2024.
“That’s not how redistricting works,” Stein said. “You do it once a decade unless you’re ordered by the courts to redraw because your first effort violated the law. And then you wait till the next census, and then you redistrict again.”
He characterized the attempt as symptomatic of a larger win-at-all-costs mentality overtaking American politics.
“We have to be able to recognize, sometimes you win an election, sometimes you lose an election. When you lose, you gather your forces, you work hard, you try to convince the voters the next time,” he said.
The Republican redistricting campaign has driven Democratic efforts to redraw maps in states they control, most notably in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is backing a referendum that would allow his party to draw out Republican seats after suspending a map created by an independent panel.
Stein said that Newsom’s approach is the right one despite his concerns over politicized congressional maps.
“Sadly, I think he is, because of what’s going on in Texas, what’s going on in Missouri,” Stein said. “Again, it’s this political maximalist position that is not good for our democracy, but you can’t have one side that’s willing to abuse the rules to gain power and then the other side say, oh, we will do the honest, true, and right thing.”
“I’m sympathetic to what California’s going through and I understand why he’s doing it,” he added.
 Stein still reviewing crime bill 
Stein declined to give further insight into his thinking on provisions of Iryna’s Law, a crime bill passed by the General Assembly in response to the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte. The legislation has remained on the governor’s desk since its passage last Tuesday.
State Auditor Dave Boliek said in a Sept. 30 Council of State meeting that “the prayers of everyone in North Carolina” go out to the people of Southport and Brunswick County in the wake of a deadly mass shooting. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
“It’s an immensely complicated law, and it’s an immensely complicated subject, how do we promote public safety?” Stein told reporters. “I want to make sure that the law is making us safer instead of making us less safe. And so I’m doing a thorough review as I hope people would expect me to do.”
Asked about provisions in the bill seeking to resume executions in the state, Stein said he is “studying the bill in its entirety to understand what its full impact is.”
He also reiterated a call he made in Southport days after a mass shooting in the city for greater mental health support.
“There are a lot of people out there who are struggling, the vast majority of whom are no threat to anybody else, but they deserve to be healthy,” Stein said. “But there are people out there who do live in a paranoid world of violent fantasies and we, a lot of times, know who they are, we just don’t have systems to address those concerns. We’ve got to figure out a way to do that and we can.”
The attack in Southport, which left three dead and five hospitalized, loomed large over Tuesday’s Council of State meeting, with Stein, Lieutenant Governor Rachel Hunt, and State Auditor Dave Boliek among those who acknowledged the victims. Attorney General Jeff Jackson said he has been “offering full support” to the Southport police and Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1282-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 12:58:39.963677

Hayden Kozak, who had fallen asleep on the couch with the family’s new pet cat Nacho, got to the kitchen the same time as her husband. Seeing the worsening storm outside, she rushed to wake the children, herding them downstairs and away from the windows.
It was not long after Kevin Kozak peeked out the french doors of their home in Greenville that a massive oak tree — more than 5 feet in diameter — came crashing through the roof less than 15 feet from where he stood.
Growing up in Pittsburgh, he’d never taken storms too seriously.
“I do now,” the 52-year-old Navy veteran and staffing agency executive told the SC Daily Gazette.
A high price
They lived through deadly Helene. Now families across western SC seek to rebuild, help others.

It’s been a year since Hurricane Helene swept across South Carolina and much of the Southeast, becoming one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.
Helene reached the Palmetto State as a tropical storm, with drenching rains and 75 mph winds that toppled trees and snapped power lines, leaving 49 people dead and 1.3 million homes and businesses in the dark. The storm spun off 21 tornadoes and caused significant destruction across 33 of South Carolina’s 46 counties, according to the state Emergency Management Division.
The storm damaged more than 5,000 homes, including that of the Kozaks.
A year later, their home remains under a tarp in disrepair. After much delay, their insurance company declared it a total loss and cleared it for demolition and rebuild. They’d been living there for less than a year when disaster struck.
“I just thank the Lord every day that we all made it out safe,” Kevin Kozak said. “You can rebuild a house, but you can’t bring back a life.”
In all, the storm killed at least 250 people along its entire path, according to the National Weather Service.
In South Carolina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has since provided more than $323 million in assistance to individual uninsured and underinsured homeowners and renters in 28 counties and the Catawba Indian Nation.
The agency’s National Flood Insurance Program has paid policyholders over $9.72 million for flood losses, with more than 368 policyholders having filed claims.
Five of those claims remain open.
The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved more than $145 million in low-interest home and business damage loans.

And the state has mostly cleared an estimated 10 million cubic yards of storm debris. The state’s forestry agency estimates the total direct damage to the timber industry at $78.4 million, plus another $60 million worth of tree removal in the state’s more urban areas.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday announced $38.3 million in grant funding for South Carolina to help cover the timber losses.
“While the road to recovery is long, we have made measurable progress over the last year,” Kim Stenson, director of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, said in a statement. “We know recovery doesn’t stop after the storm leaves. It’s a process, and we’ll continue working together until the job is done.”
A deluge of generosity
Luckily for the Kozaks, insurance paid to rent a home across town while they’ve waited for approvals, so they haven’t had to rely on federal aid to make ends meet.
Still, the back-and-forth with a litany of different insurance adjusters has been frustrating and the family of six is looking forward to the day they can return to a home with more space.
The kindness of their neighbors was unmatched, Kevin Kozak said. In the days without power following the storm, the neighborhood came together to cut trees off vehicles and hold cookouts to feed everyone.
“I think we’re closer now than ever before,” he said.
Along with the rain, the storm also brought in a deluge of generosity, marking the largest single activation of the state’s disaster charity fund.
A series of disasters taught SC how to work with FEMA. Leaders encourage reform, not ending it.

The nonprofit One SC Fund, founded in response to catastrophic flooding in 2015, has raised nearly $6.2 million to help South Carolinians recover from Helene, said Georgia Mjartan, president and CEO of the Central Carolina Community Foundation, which operates the fund.
So far, the fund has made $4.15 million worth of grants to 65 nonprofits that have helped meet survivors’ basic needs and clean-up efforts. The remaining $2 million will go to long-term rebuilding and recovery, Mjartan said, and the fund is still open for donations.
It was a $25,000 grant that helped Cherokee County Meals on Wheels respond to demands never seen before in the organization’s four decades of operation.
“Funding during that time was critical; there were so many needs,” said Executive Director Terry Dennis.
‘People get discouraged’
For many of the people served by Meals on Wheels, wells were their only source of water. And without power, they couldn’t pump the water into their homes, Dennis said. The food pantry had to call in shelf-stable meals, something it usually doesn’t need until late October or November.
A year later, Meals on Wheels remains at some of its highest numbers on record as people are still feeling the financial burden caused by the storm, Dennis said. The group provides 20 meals to 20 homes daily, as well as extra groceries, toiletries and pet food.
The 49 people in SC killed by the deadliest storm in state history

“Our community also found that a lot of families weren’t properly insured, especially our older generation, and those that were in rental properties couldn’t go back,” Dennis said.
With a shortage of rent-controlled and handicap accessible housing in the rural county, Meals on Wheels had to help one woman in her late 60s move to nearby Spartanburg County when she couldn’t find a place that would take her and her two dogs.
The Meals on Wheels volunteers also have provided emotional support to people who, in the immediate aftermath, were alone, scared, without food and didn’t know what they were going to do. That support has continued as those same people grew frustrated while waiting for home repairs.
“When you’ve never had to live like that before, people get discouraged,” Dennis said.
There’s still unfinished clean up from downed trees on properties, where the elderly residents can’t afford to hire someone for the work they can’t do themselves.
Even in her own neighborhood, Dennis said a family just now got to pull the tarp off and put a new roof on.
“I don’t know how much time will go by before everyone’s back to normal,” she said.
In Pacolet, Gary and Patricia Brinkley have had to abandon their home of 33 years after FEMA thrice-denied the elderly couple’s claims and the insurance payout fell short of covering repairs. Town ordinances also wouldn’t allow the couple to place a new mobile home on the lot.
With nowhere else to go, the Brinkley’s son took out a loan to buy his parents another home, located about a mile from where a 90-foot oak tree came crashing through the roof of their former bedroom and living room.
Insurers expect Helene’s damages to be historic. That’s not counting what they won’t pay.

The couple spent two months living with just a tarp and blankets for cover, sleeping in their car. Water seeped in and mold and mildew started to grow, making Patricia Brinkley sick.
The Brinkley’s homeowners’ insurance carrier declared their home in rural Spartanburg County a total loss.
The new home is nice. Built near the turn of the 20th century, it has hardwood floors and a big front porch.
Gary Brinkley wishes he would have received some form of aid. Living on Social Security, the couple has no way to pay their son back.
“Basically, we started over from scratch,” he said.
Years of work ahead
While many South Carolinians face rebuilding their homes, the cities, counties and utility companies also face their own challenges as they seek federal help paying for the massive cleanup efforts many have already undertaken.
The state has identified approximately 1,500 projects with a total cost of over $1.3 billion. So far, FEMA has doled out just $65 million.
SC lays plans to rebuild or repair an estimated 900 homes damaged by Hurricane Helene

It starts with a town, a county or a utility company proving their eligibility under a presidential disaster declaration, Emily Bentley, the state Emergency Management Division’s Chief of Recovery, told the SC Daily Gazette.
Then governments must separate the work into multiple projects — removing debris is separate from repairing a bridge.
And the entity has to be able to produce a mountain of paperwork for every step along the way. For small towns and utilities that don’t handle disasters on a regular basis, this creates a huge volume of work for a small number of people dragging out months and years. If FEMA rejects a town and it files an appeal, it can take even longer.
The city of Columbia, for example, waited nearly a decade after the 2015 floods for approval to repair the canal that is the source of the city’s drinking water.
That was a complex project that involved multiple environmental reviews and permits, Bentley said, but there are many other things that can snag up recovery work.
For debris, for example, governments have to show the volume of debris, where it picked up that debris, what type it was, where it stored the debris and where it disposed of it. Towns also must prove contractors did not overcharge for hauling it away.

If a town doesn’t apply for permits for a debris site or it takes debris to the wrong site, it’s enough to disqualify a project.
If debris is in a waterway, the town must prove it’s a risk to public health and safety to be reimbursed for removal.
For things like roads, towns have to prove that they’d been performing regular maintenance before the storm.
And if staff worked overtime, governments have to show the work they were doing and the equipment they used.
“So there’s a lot of a lot of little details like that that have to be reviewed and figured out,” Bentley said. “Those are the things that tend to slow stuff down.”
Large projects — anything that costs more than $1 million — must go through extra reviews at FEMA, which take 30 to 45 days. The federal disaster agency, this past spring, also added reviews for anything costing more $100,000, an additional step that is causing more delay, Bentley said.
“This is all taxpayer money, so you do want it to be spent appropriately,” she added. “But it does get a little frustrating sometimes for local entities that don’t have to deal with this on a regular basis.”
To help cover the cost, the state Legislature set aside $35 million in the budget for the state Department of Transportation to cover debris removal and road and bridge repairs not reimbursed by the federal government. The DOT has since reopened 99% of the more than 900 state roads closed due to Helene. The vast majority were reopened within weeks, according to the agency, which marked the progress last Friday with a ceremony at Jones Gap State Park.
The Legislature also provided nearly $200 million in state dollars to match federal funding for state agencies and local governments that couldn’t afford their share.
It also set aside $3 million for a new South Carolina Public Assistance program to help those cities and towns that don’t qualify for federal aid. The Emergency Management Division, which runs the program, says it will need more money for the fund in the next budget.

Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, is one of three plaintiffs challenging a legislative package that provides incentives for professional sports stadiums. Pictured here, Moon sits at his desk during the first day of the 2024 Legislative Session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Legislators upset that a bill they oppose becomes law don’t have a right to sue over it, attorneys defending the special session measure that provides state support to professional sports stadiums said in court on Tuesday.
“It’s not recognized in the state of Missouri that a legislator can come to the court simply because they don’t like a vote that was taken… the court system would be flooded,” Marc Ellinger, an attorney representing the Missouri General Assembly, argued in Cole County Circuit Court.
Ellinger was joined by assistant attorney general Sean McDowell in arguments seeking to dismiss the lawsuit filed in July by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Bryant Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve and conservative activist Ron Calzone.
Moon and the other plaintiffs want to throw out the entire legislative package, which includes tax credits for home repairs after natural disasters this year and property-tax restrictions for some counties.
The law, they say, goes beyond the bill’s original subject and provides unconstitutional aid to private interests. But if the state’s motion to dismiss is approved, they won’t get to argue these points in court.
Ellinger and McDowell argued the case can’t move forward, saying plaintiffs lack taxpayer standing and dismissing the idea of “legislative standing.”
“I don’t think there’s any standing for specific legislators to bring a case as the plaintiffs have,” McDowell said.
Taxpayer standing requires a direct expenditure and because the bill operates through tax credits and is “subject to appropriation,” there is no direct cost to the taxpayer, he argued.
Attorney Bevis Schock, who is representing the law’s challengers, said there are up-front costs to the bill such as an estimated $10,000 expense to create the tax-credit application.
“If these plaintiffs have no standing and we throw this case in the trash, we might as well pitch the constitution in there with it,” he wrote in a pre-hearing filing.
The purpose of the lawsuit, Schock said in court on Tuesday, is to challenge bills with multiple subjects.
“The problem is.. the voter can’t tell what item the legislator is for or against,” he said. “That is why we are bringing the case.”
If they lose in circuit court, Schock said, he will appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court.

Taylor Royal, 35, a partner at Royal Wealth Partners serving clients in 47 states and managing more than $1.5 billion in assets, launched his campaign Tuesday and said he has always had an interest in government and pairing government and business with a mind toward efficiency. 
“I think Nebraska is almost like a blank canvas or an open slate,” Royal said. “There’s a lot of opportunity ahead of us to really propel our state forward.”

Legislative District 18 covers north-central Douglas County — northwest Omaha and Bennington. State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha has announced that she plans not to seek another four-year term.
Royal said that after graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in accounting and finance, he earned a master’s degree in accounting from Southern Methodist University in Texas and became a certified public accountant. He went on to work at Deloitte in international tax in Texas before returning to Nebraska in 2015.
He said he returned having seen that Texas had proactive leaders traveling nationally to pitch the state as the place to be and contrasted that economic activity with ConAgra pulling out of Omaha.
“It was kind of eye-opening to see that contrast,” Royal said. “That really started the process of researching what we’re doing locally, what we’re doing in the community, what we’re doing at a statewide level, how we can be attractive for businesses, as well as to retain and attract the best talent and bring in new businesses.”
He added: “We would much rather be more foot on the gas or front forward, which is how do we bring in that next, new innovation and provide for entrepreneurship for Nebraska.”
Omaha State Sen. Christy Armendariz will not seek reelection in 2026

Among Royal’s priorities are making Nebraska more attractive to businesses and working families with an eye toward affordability and modernizing Nebraska’s tax code. He also hopes to enhance community safety, serve as a taxpayer advocate, foster workforce development for the next generation of Nebraskans and ensure access to quality schools.
Royal ran unsuccessfully for Omaha mayor in 2017 and made a 2018 bid for state treasurer. He said he has built his family and business since.
This summer, he said he connected with Armendariz. He said he “decided that if there was an opening, if there’s an opportunity to kind of carry the torch or carry the mantle, that I would, and [I’m] excited to put my name out there.”
Armendariz joined a laundry list of Republicans endorsing Royal’s campaign, as has former Gov. Dave Heineman; U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.; State Auditor Mike Foley; State Sens. Beau Ballard, Rob Clements, Ben Hansen and Tony Sorrentino; former Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and former U.S. Rep. Hal Daub, a former Omaha mayor and former University of Nebraska regent.
Royal has also been endorsed by two opposing Republican candidates looking to succeed Bacon in 2026 — former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, who represented Legislative District 18 before Armendariz, and Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding.

If elected, Royal said that, similar to Armendariz, he would not view taxpayers as a “credit card” and would first look internally at state and local operations to raise revenue and reduce spending, before looking externally.
“I feel like we’re just kind of getting nickeled and dimed and kind of pinched at every side,” Royal said.
Royal said he still wants to make Nebraska more attractive to businesses and working families and to modernize Nebraska’s tax code to help veterans and seniors stay in the state and young Nebraskans, including his own children, prosper, grow and remain in the Cornhusker State.
Legislative District 18 is one of the most competitive in the state. Also running in the race is Jess Goldoni, a businesswoman and AI strategist. Royal and Armendariz are registered Republicans. Goldoni is a registered Democrat. Armendariz won the 2022 race with 56% of the vote.
The officially nonpartisan Legislature is currently split 33-15 between Republicans and Democrats, plus one additional nonpartisan progressive. It takes 33 votes to end debate on often contentious bills.
Royal said he hopes to unite Nebraskans and approach politics with a “Nebraska first” orientation, a mindset he said requires cross-partisan collaboration.
“I do hope to represent all,” Royal said. “We’ll work hard to earn every vote.”
He hopes to capitalize on Nebraska’s position, support advancements in technology, including artificial intelligence and bring people together around integrity and common-sense values.
“There’s a sense of urgency,” Royal said, “which is why I’m running to bring that to bear and then working on efficiency and affordability in the meantime.”
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 election.
 



 2026 legislative elections

All 24 even-numbered legislative seats will be on the ballot in 2026, 10 of which are held by lawmakers who will be term-limited come January 2027. State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Christy Armendariz of Omaha have announced plans not to seek reelection. 
Incumbents in the remaining 12 seats have all already announced reelection bids, except for State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who is expected to announce a reelection bid soon.
The filing deadline for non-incumbents is March 1, 2026.

Onwenu, Detroit’s first director of entrepreneurship and economic opportunity and an adjunct professor at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, is the first Democratic candidate to declare in the race. 
The 1st Senate District is located in Wayne County and includes part of Detroit, Ecorse, Lincoln Park, River Rouge and Wyandotte. It is considered a strong Democratic seat, though Lincoln Park and Wyandotte were split between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.
“Michigan needs new and effective leaders ready to bring people together and deliver,” Onwenu said in a statement. “In the State Senate, I’ll work to unite Detroit and Downriver to help rebuild our economy, invest in our neighborhoods, and clean up our government to work for all of us.”
Onwenu pointed to the state’s rising costs and job loss rates, federal budget cuts, the need for neighborhood investment and state government transparency as challenges he hopes to address in the Senate. 
Onwenu’s campaign has also received several notable endorsements from local officials, including the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus, former U.S. Rep. Andy Levin (D-Bloomfield Township), and state Reps. Joe Tate (D-Detroit), Helena Scott (D-Detroit) and Tyrone Carter (D-Detroit).

(Candidate photo courtesy of Goldoni campaign | Capitol photo by Rebecca Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A businesswoman and AI strategist is running for a now-open Nebraska legislative seat in north-central Douglas County with a focus on state spending priorities and listening to voters.
Jess Goldoni, 42, said she has spent the past 20 years building businesses as a marketer who has dipped her toes in many industries, including legal, financial, health care, nonprofit, travel, international, agriculture, innovation, water and artificial intelligence. She is also the co-founder of Nebrask.ai, a firm that seeks to teach and empower businesses not to be afraid of AI.
Goldoni launched her campaign in August and said she sees the best in people and loves Nebraska, but she is tired of seeing “wasted potential” in people, communities and government. She said that includes young adults or businesses leaving the state.
“Too many people on the left and right are digging their heels in on principle, and no one is coming together to actually get anything done for hard-working Nebraskans,” Goldoni said.

Legislative District 18 covers north-central Douglas County — including northwest Omaha and Bennington. State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha has announced plans not to seek another four-year term.
Among Goldoni’s priorities are giving K-12 schools the resources needed for success and supporting veterans “without excuses.” She also hopes to highlight trades and apprenticeships, support dual-credit academic programs, find new ways to build revenue for the state, modernize government and support Nebraska-owned small businesses and startups.
Goldoni is an Omaha native who has lived in the district for 13 years. She is a journalism graduate of the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Goldoni said that similar to Gov. Jim Pillen, she is not happy with property taxes, with her bill increasing annually. But she added, “We have to be smart about this,” as all financial decisions trickle into other priorities.
“It all comes back to money, because if we don’t have the money for these things, we can’t make meaningful changes,” Goldoni said.
Omaha State Sen. Christy Armendariz will not seek reelection in 2026

While schools are essential to strong communities and a strong state, she said, there is a lot of “finger-pointing,” adding that a new state commission to review school finance is a good start.
She said her family includes veterans across multiple military branches, including a father who served as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, a grandfather who taught jungle warfare in Panama and another grandfather who fought in World War II in Italy. She was disappointed this spring that the Legislature, citing financial pressures, delayed a bipartisan “veterans justice program” meant to give all veterans legal support, a funding decision Armendariz helped push for in the budgeting process.
“I think that we need to do more than just shout mottos and give bumper stickers,” Goldoni said.
Goldoni described Legislative District 18 as a “pink district,” calling it one of the state’s most competitive. Also running in the race is Taylor Royal of Bennington, a financial planner who has previously run for Omaha mayor and state treasurer. Goldoni is a registered Democrat. Royal and Armendariz are registered Republicans. Armendariz won the 2022 race with 56% of the vote.
The officially nonpartisan Legislature is currently split 33-15 between Republicans and Democrats, plus one additional nonpartisan progressive. It takes 33 votes to end debate on often contentious bills.

Goldoni describes herself as a moderate Democrat and said she feels the Legislature needs lawmakers willing to drop “party absolutes” and come together with an open mind to listen.
“You’re fighting over principles and identity politics, and we’re getting distracted and we’re not actually helping people take care of their families and take care of their households,” Goldoni said. “I think that pragmatism and problem-solving leadership is desperately needed.”
Goldoni said she has sat around tables with people she has disagreed with but found a path forward and hopes to engage people who are tuning out of politics at “alarming rates.”
“I was one of them. I was jaded,” Goldoni said. “But I’m not one to give up. I’m not one to back down. And I don’t think we always need to fight.”
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 general election.
 



 2026 legislative elections

All 24 even-numbered legislative seats will be on the ballot in 2026, 10 of which are held by lawmakers who will be term-limited come January 2027. State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Christy Armendariz of Omaha have announced plans not to seek reelection. 
Incumbents in the remaining 12 seats have all already announced reelection bids, except for State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who is expected to announce a reelection bid soon.
The filing deadline for non-incumbents is March 1, 2026.

(Photo by  via Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Days after the federal government approved millions for Florida law enforcement partnering with ICE, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet approved the first $14 million of a $250 million state grant to fund immigration enforcement.
Fifty-six agencies’ applications for the costs of compensating officers, transporting undocumented immigrants, and buying new equipment like restraints was roundly approved by DeSantis and the three Cabinet members, who also serve as the new State Board of Immigration Enforcement.
“Today was just the State Board of Immigration grant[ing] the money that the Legislature allocated for the immigration enforcement activity,” said Mark Glass, commissioner of Florida Department of Law Enforcement, following the meeting. The board was created during a special session earlier this year within the FDLE, including a $250 million chest for the new immigration enforcement.
The money totals $14,073,042, including 14 grant awards for transportation adding up to $1,259,525. Some of the money will go to bonuses, detention beds, bullet-proof vests, AI-assisted translation software, and license-plate readers, the News Service of Florida reported.
The initial approval of state money came just days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement publicly touted more than $38 million federal dollars for Florida’s state and local law enforcement agencies working with ICE in partnerships called 287(g) agreements. That money will be used to federally reimburse officers for equipment and transportation costs associated with immigration enforcement.
Florida’s special session, which yielded both the State Board of Immigration Enforcement and its hefty tranche, also mandated that all counties and county sheriffs enter into these agreements. These partnerships allow lower-levels law enforcement to act as federal immigration officials, including arresting, detaining, and prosecuting noncitizens.
As money starts rolling in, Florida is still waiting for an at-minimum $245 million federal reimbursement for the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center located in the heart of the Everglades. Florida’s emergency management agency applied for the roughly $600 million in the Detention Support Grant Program housed under FEMA.
Although DeSantis has vowed that the federal reimbursement is en route, FEMA has said it would award the money by today — and no involved state or federal agencies have responded to the Florida Phoenix’s requests as to whether FEMA will approve Florida’s request.

Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Journalists and other staff of the state’s largest network of independent news and media outlets have voted to join the News Guild of Maine, expanding the Maine Trust for Local News’ unionized workforce and extending labor protections to workers who said they had been subject to pay disparities and more vulnerable to layoffs.
According to a release from the Guild, the National Labor Relations Board tallied the results Monday and found workers voted 34-1 to join the union.
Guild President Megan Gray, an arts and culture reporter at the Portland Press Herald, said in a statement that the vote “confirms what we already knew: Our coworkers want to join the News Guild of Maine. They want to have the same voice and the same bargaining power as their peers across the company.”
The Guild, which is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, already represented about 150 workers at the Trust’s papers and now includes the 50 or so remaining non-union jobs at the Sun Journal in Lewiston, The Times Record in Brunswick and the Trust’s other 17 weekly publications. Workers at the daily Kennebec Journal are represented by a separate branch of the CWA and are in the process of merging with the guild.
The Guild filed an election petition with the National Labor Relations Board in August after the nonprofit Trust, a subsidiary of the Colorado-based National Trust for Local News, declined to voluntarily recognize the expanded union. The Trust did not respond to a request for comment by publication.
Maine Trust for Local News workers rally to expand their union

At a rally last month launching the union drive, several Trust staff highlighted the pay gap between Guild members and those who remained unrepresented. 
Paul Bagnall, who has worked as a full time reporter in Maine since 2022 and now works at The Times Record, said he makes $18 per hour as a nonunion reporter while his unionized colleagues at the Press Herald start at a minimum of $28.75 per hour.
“With the cost of living going up, my paycheck has already stretched to a breaking point,” Bagnall said. “I am currently priced out of potential sources of information — going out to events, restaurants and cafes due to the cost of living — and it’s still rising.” 
Kendra Caruso, a staff writer at the Sun Journal covering health, said, “Those of us who are not represented have little influence over the environment in which we work. That changes today. Today we demand equal pay, equal respect and the same job securities that our represented colleagues have.”
Gray, the Guild president, said Tuesday that the expanded union looks forward to negotiating a contract “that isn’t rooted in old models but reflects who we are today.”
“Under nonprofit ownership, we are building a business model that could be a roadmap to sustainability for local news organizations across the country,” she added. “We are here because we are invested in that future. But we need the Maine Trust to invest in ours too.”
Maine Morning Star is a nonprofit outlet affiliated with the national organization States Newsroom. It is not a part of the Maine Trust for Local News.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Anyone looking for a COVID shot for themselves or their kids in Louisiana is facing a new maze of pharmacy restrictions after changing federal guidance on the vaccine.
Large chain pharmacies, including Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens, started requiring prescriptions for the vaccine this month for anyone under the age of 65 in Louisiana and 15 other states, including Alabama and Mississippi.
And each chain has its own rules for children — if they’re offering them at all. It’s a significant change from last year, when anyone could walk into a pharmacy and get a COVID shot on demand, one that’s causing confusion and delays in getting vaccinated.
“It’s as clear as mud,” said Dr. Matthew Morvant, owner of Downtown Drugs, a family-owned independent pharmacy in Covington, Louisiana. “No one knows the correct information.”
In Louisiana, Walmart said its pharmacies aren’t administering COVID vaccines to anyone under 17 — even with a prescription.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In a statement to the Gulf States Newsroom, Walmart said it is following “guidance outlined by the state,” but did not point to the specific guidance. The Louisiana Department of Health website says children as young as six months are eligible. LDH has not responded to a request for comment. At one New Orleans Walmart location, a pharmacist advised patients to travel to Mississippi to get the shot.
Children five and older can receive a COVID vaccine with a prescription at CVS, according to a statement from Kara Page, the manager for corporate communications. She said that was based on state pharmacy law, which states that pharmacists can administer vaccines without a prescription when they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A Walgreens pharmacist confirmed children five and older can get a COVID immunization with a prescription, but Walgreens corporate office did not respond to a request for comment. The Louisiana Board of Pharmacy did not respond to multiple requests for clarification.
Children under five typically receive vaccinations from a physician’s office. But it’s unclear how many people have been unable to get themselves or their children vaccinated amid the confusion.
Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines and advocacy director of American Families for Vaccines, said she’s heard of people having trouble getting the vaccine, describing it as a patchwork of policies for families across the state.
Dr. Jennifer Avegno, who heads the New Orleans Health Department, said she’s getting calls and texts from people saying they had a prescription, went to their local pharmacy — usually one of the big chain pharmacies — and were told they can’t receive the vaccine because of restrictions.
“I’m hearing nothing but confusion, and it’s not just for kids,” Avegno said. “Each store manager is interpreting it differently and maybe each pharmacist is interpreting it differently. In the absence of standard guidance, that’s what happens.”
That can leave vulnerable patients unprotected.

An ‘enormous confusion’
Part of the confusion stems from overlapping layers of authority and shifting recommendations.
Last month, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Food and Drug Administration changed its COVID vaccine recommendation, approving it for anyone 65 and older, or those with underlying conditions with a prescription.
Then last week, Kennedy’s remade vaccine panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, kept existing recommendations for COVID shots for anyone 6 months and older, but with an emphasis on “individual decision-making.” That should mean insurance can cover immunizations for anyone six months and older, according to HHS.
“They have created this enormous confusion. [It’s a] failure at the national level to harmonize that recommendation in a way so that everybody knows what’s happening,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
COVID vaccines are safe and effective, Benjamin said, and getting one should be no more difficult than getting a flu shot. But conflicting messaging has left providers, insurers and patients uncertain — and pharmacies making their own rules.
“A lot of the pharmacies are simply saying, let’s take the safe route. Let’s authorize it for the people that we know we can do it for, that we can get paid for,” Benjamin said. “Everybody’s basically covering their — you pick the word — in doing this.”
Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and chief medical officer with the Association of Immunization Managers, a national public health non-profit, said limiting access has real consequences. When faced with barriers and confusion, people may simply give up.
“If someone who wants to be protected against COVID-19 goes to one pharmacy and is told that they can’t get that vaccine, or goes to their medical provider and is [told] that they cannot get that vaccination there, there’s only just so many times they’re going to try,” Fiscus said. “Ultimately, it’s the patient who ends up suffering from a disease that they actually wanted to prevent with a vaccine.”
‘The plan is to deter’
Morvant, the Covington pharmacist, said he typically administers flu or COVID vaccines for 40 to 60 people a day during peak illness seasons.
For COVID vaccination, the process used to be simple. Patients would walk in, provide insurance and basic medical history and receive the vaccine within minutes.
Now, requiring a prescription adds hurdles even for adults. Morvant has proactively contacted local doctors to issue blanket prescriptions. If a patient arrives without one, he’ll call their provider directly. Larger chains, he said, aren’t likely to take those extra steps.
He believes the prescription requirement is a deliberate barrier.
“The plan is to deter,” he said. “Some people think the COVID vaccine is dangerous. And if they think that, I would say, then just don’t get it. If 1% doesn’t want it, that’s fine, then don’t take it. But don’t block the other 99% from getting it. That’s just stupid.”
Louisiana’s political climate adds another layer. State Surgeon General Ralph Abraham has been outspoken in his criticism of COVID vaccines, especially for children. In an official LDH statement earlier this year, Abraham called CDC guidance for vaccinating children “woefully out of touch with reality.”
In a September op-ed for The Center Square, Abraham went further, writing that “virtually every parent in the U.S. understands that COVID-19 shots for healthy children are a very bad idea,” and praised federal limits under Kennedy’s HHS.
That skepticism at the top of Louisiana’s health department stands in sharp contrast with the overwhelming consensus of medical research and national recommendations. Last Friday, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reaffirmed that COVID vaccines should remain available to anyone six months and older.
For Morvant, who knows his patients personally, the stakes are even more stark.
“I’m gonna tell you what happens when people don’t get vaccinated for it,” he said. “People will die. And if they don’t, they’re going to end up in the ICU and they’re not going to be the same person when they come out.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The ACLU of Florida has sued Gov. Ron DeSantis on behalf of a Tampa voter, challenging his refusal to call a special election to fill a vacancy in the Florida Senate left when he appointed Jay Collins as lieutenant governor.
The lawsuit, filed in state Circuit Court in Leon County, alleges that the governor has violated his duty under the Florida Constitution and state law by failing to call a special election. Florida’s Senate District 14 seat in Hillsborough County has been without representation since DeSantis selected Collins to serve as lieutenant governor on Aug. 12, some 48 days ago.
The lawsuit notes that in more than 25 instances, the governor took fewer than five days to call for an election upon a vacancy in a congressional or legislative seat. When then-GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia resigned from his Senate District 11 seat on July 18 after being appointed chief financial officer, the governor took just four days to call a special election for that seat (the primary election takes place today).
But more often of late, the lawsuit alleges, the governor has “often chosen to deviate from Florida’s longstanding practice of timely special elections, in violation of his mandatory statutory duty.”
The most egregious delay in calling for an election was in April 2021, after South Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings died, the complaint says. DeSantis waited a month before setting the congressional special election for Jan. 11, 2022, more than nine months after Hastings’s death.
The ACLU of Florida went to court on behalf of voters in Santa Rosa and Brevard counties voters earlier this year, alleging the governor was failing his constitutional obligation to call special elections for the vacant Florida House District 3 and Senate District 19 seats. Those two seats had become vacant following resignations of two state lawmakers to run in special congressional elections.
“I’m not sure why the governor proves himself repeatedly unwilling to call timely special elections,” said Nicholas Warren, staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida, in a press release. “His predecessors like Jeb Bush and Rick Scott always acted swiftly to ensure citizens retained their voice in government. Governor DeSantis’ refusal to follow their example is not just concerning, it’s also against the law.”
Tampa resident Cort Lippe is the petitioner in the case. In a press release, he said Tampa “deserves full representation in the Legislature. By refusing to call a special election, the governor is denying us that right and ignoring decades of established precedent. It’s illegal and wrong.”
The lawsuit notes that with committee hearings scheduled to begin next week in Tallahassee and the regular session on Jan. 13, “[u]nless the Governor sets a special election very soon, Petitioner and other district residents will go without representation for the entirely of the interim committee weeks and 2026 session.”
Senate District 14 was considered a swing seat when DeSantis recruited Collins to run against then-Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz in 2022. Collins ended up winning that race by 10 points.
Democrat Brian Nathan is the only candidate who has filed to run for the seat in the 2026 general election.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Ty Theurer resigned Monday as superintendent of Comanche County schools amid public outrage over allegations he sexually harassed and inappropriately touched a student.
School board member Dean Yoder confirmed the board accepted Theurer’s resignation at a special meeting and named Michael Baldwin as the interim superintendent.
Baldwin previously served as superintendent and was given a two-year deal, Yoder said.
“Everyone’s familiar with him, and it just kind of a calming aspect to maybe put everyone at a little bit of ease now and move forward,” Yoder said.
Earlier this month, Kansas Reflector reported on Theurer’s behavior during the spring semester in his capacity as the South Central High School golf coach. Theurer admitted in a signed statement, obtained by Kansas Reflector, that he told a girl to grip a club like a penis and that he had held the back of her thigh, hips, waist and shoulder — purportedly to improve her golf posture.
Theurer, who faced additional allegations from other students, stepped down as golf coach but remained as district superintendent. School board president Kelly Herd and others tried to protect Theurer, despite law enforcement and Title IX investigations.
Kansas Reflector reported that Herd tried to quash community backlash by refusing to let a parent speak about the allegations at a school board meeting and by instructing other board members that they should stay quiet on the subject. Yoder was an outlier among board members in voicing his concerns.
On Sept. 3, a day after Kansas Reflector published its investigative report, more than 100 community members packed a school board meeting in the small, southwest Kansas town of Coldwater and loudly criticized the board’s handling of the students’ complaints. The board placed Theurer on paid administrative leave during that meeting.
Several weeks later, on Sept. 21, 10 bullets were fired into Herd’s unoccupied vehicle while it was parked in front of her home.
Yoder said 10-15 people attended the school board’s special meeting Monday night. He wouldn’t talk about the details of Theurer’s resignation, which the board discussed during a closed session.
What happens next?
“Healing,” Yoder said. “We try and earn the community’s trust back. I’m not sure we can do it, but we’re trying to get their trust back.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Comanche-County-school-board-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-30 11:59:38.023872

In March, a Hinds County grand jury indicted the then-officers Michael Lamar Rhinewalt and Steven Frederick Jr. on a manslaughter charge in the Sept. 25, 2022, death of the 25-year-old. Both were part of the crime suppression Flex Unit.
“Jaylen Lewis should be alive today,” said Bobby DiCello, a partner in the law firm DiCello Levitt, which is representing the Lewis family. “The actions of these officers were not just reckless — they were unconscionable and indefensible. Jaylen was a devoted father with his whole life ahead of him, and his family deserves justice. We are committed to fighting for accountability, transparency and meaningful reform, so that no other family in Jackson has to endure this kind of heartbreak.”
The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Jackson, seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for “the willful, reckless and malicious conduct of defendants.” The lawsuit, which represents one side of a legal argument, also seeks reforms “to ensure the Capitol Police adopt and enforce policies that prevent future tragedies,” DiCello said.
According to the indictment, Frederick and Rhinewalt said one of them shot Lewis because it “was necessary to protect himself from great bodily harm or death at the hands of Lewis,” but the indictment concluded that was “not a reasonable belief under the circumstances.”
The lawsuit also accuses the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, which oversees the Capitol Police, of permitting “officers who have engaged in excessive force or unreasonable violence toward citizens to avoid the consequences of discipline.”
Spokesperson Bailey C. Martin responded, “We have not yet had the opportunity to review the claims, and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety does not comment on pending litigation.”
An investigation by Mississippi Today has uncovered that Col. Steven Maxwell, then-director of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, rejected hiring both officers, but Capitol Police, also part of the Department of Public Safety, hired them.
Rhinewalt and Frederick at the time of the fatal shooting were conducting a drug narcotics operation when they saw a white Jeep Cherokee turn north on West Street in Jackson driven by Lewis, who had a female passenger.

After the officers saw the Cherokee run a red light at Stonewall Street, they turned on their police lights and pulled Lewis over and blocked him from going forward with his car.
Lewis wound up reversing his car and bumping into the police cruiser behind his vehicle, according to the lawsuit. “Jaylen does not brandish a weapon, reach for a weapon, make any violent gestures, threaten anyone, or take any other actions that could be reasonably perceived as endangering officers or others.”
After this, Frederick and Rhinewalt opened fire into the Cherokee, shooting Lewis in the head and killing him, according to the lawsuit. 
As a result, his family has “endured pain, anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, feelings of powerlessness, harm to self-esteem, emotional distress, fear, anxiety, emotional agony, loss of support, loss of companionship, loss of sense of personal safety [and] dignity,” the lawsuit says.
The state Legislature expanded the jurisdiction of Capitol Police beyond the state Capitol in the city of Jackson. “The shift in jurisdiction drastically altered the role of Capitol Police from limited security to full-spectrum urban policing,” according to the lawsuit. “The expansion coincided with a surge in high-intensity encounters, including pursuits, officer-involved shootings, and use-of-force complaints.”
Within the first six months of the Capitol Police beginning to patrol the expanded area, officers shot at least four citizens. “In each case, there were questions about whether officers followed constitutional standards regarding lethal force and pursuit justification,” according to the lawsuit.
A month before Lewis was killed, Capitol Police officers opened fire on a car, striking a passenger in the head. That victim, Sherita Harris, was taken to the hospital where she had surgery to remove bullet fragments from her head. She survived but now has “permanent neurological and facial injuries,” according to the lawsuit.
A grand jury indicted Rhinewalt and another officer, Jeffrey Walker, for aggravated assault in that case. According to the lawsuit, no weapon was recovered from the car.
Walker also faces federal charges for allegedly violating the civil rights of a handcuffed man by slamming his head into the hood of a car and kicking him in the head and face in July 2022.
Frederick, the son-in-law of Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey, totaled his Capitol Police Ford F-150 on U.S. 49 South in Covington County on March 12, 2023. He flunked the DUI field test with a .15 score, nearly twice the legal limit of .08. He was handcuffed and arrested. He was released without bond into Bailey’s custody.
Five months later, Frederick dodged conviction when a state trooper failed to appear for the court hearing, and the judge dismissed the DUI charge.
State authorities have learned that a prosecutor, who wasn’t from Covington County, said Bailey called him and asked him what would happen if a trooper didn’t show up for a DUI hearing and the prosecutor replied that the case would be dismissed.
Bailey has denied these allegations. “Whoever said that I talked to a prosecutor is a liar,” he told WLBT. “That is a completely false lie.”
The sheriff admitted he spoke to the trooper, Clay Loftin, but denied trying to influence him. He said he spoke to Loftin a “handful” of times and told the trooper to “do his job.”
Authorities have also learned that after the wreck, Bailey reportedly telephoned Frederick’s supervisor at Capitol Police, Porfirio Grimaldo, telling him that he should keep Frederick on the force because “the DUI has been taken care of.” 
Contacted for comment, Grimaldo referred all questions to the lawyers for the Department of Public Safety. They wouldn’t comment on it, and neither would Bailey’s lawyer, Jason Dare.
The sheriff told WLBT, “I can swear on a stack of Bibles, I did not ask anyone for any help on that just because I knew the finger would be pointed at me because of that, and you know, let things take their course naturally. I hate that it happened to him (Frederick) because he is a good guy.”
Frederick resigned three days after the wreck “to prevent termination,” according to his certification records. He had worked for Capitol Police less than eight months and paid nothing toward the Ford F-150 he totaled.
A year and a half after Frederick demolished his Capitol Police truck, he wrecked another patrol vehicle, this time as a deputy for Scott County. The sheriff there has said Frederick no longer works there.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/15095510/AP23065838626676.jpg,,,2025-09-30 10:57:43.258640

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — State Sen. Christy Armendariz plans to not seek reelection to her northwest Omaha seat in 2026, a decision she confirmed and said is rooted in finances for a $12,000-a-year position.
Armendariz, 58, said she signed up knowing about the legislative pay before the 2022 election for an open Legislative District 18 seat. She thought she could juggle both her legislative duties and her full-time job as a strategic sourcing specialist at Nebraska Methodist Health System. She gave up her job at the beginning of this year.
“I just need to go make money,” Armendariz told the Nebraska Examiner on Monday. “I can’t afford to serve a second time.”

Legislative pay
Legislative pay is locked in the Nebraska Constitution, requiring a vote of the people to change. An effort to increase legislative pay to $22,500 failed resoundingly in 2012, and recent efforts stalled, too, often bringing political baggage for any lawmaker proposing the change. 
Legislative salaries last increased from $300 a month (or $4,800 annually) to $1,000 a month (or $12,000 annually) in 1988. Lawmakers receive mileage reimbursements and daily per diems but do not receive health insurance or other benefits.
During debate in March on the latest proposal seeking voter approval for creating a citizen commission to more frequently update legislative pay, Armendariz said she approached former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, her predecessor, about the need to keep her full-time job. She said that during her first two years in office, she worked 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the week and often on weekends.
But Armendariz said continuing to juggle her duties wasn’t sustainable and it had put a strain on her family. She said she also wasn’t giving “100%” to her constituents or her full-time position.
“It just isn’t my nature to do anything partway,” Armendariz said at the time.

Armendariz had argued during that debate that she understood the post is essentially a “volunteer position.” She told her colleagues it would be better for the people to set a ceiling on legislative pay, any increase of which would require legislative funding to match. The proposed constitutional amendment stalled in 2025 but could resurface in 2026.
“I know how much serving pays, and I was OK with that,” Armendariz said this week. “When I got in, [it was] just a different situation, thinking that I could try to juggle a job with it, and that didn’t prove to be something I could do.”
Legislative record
Armendariz has served on the Appropriations Committee, where she became vice chair in January, and she currently serves as chair of the Legislature’s Committee on Committees, an internal group that at the start of each two-year legislative cycle sets committee assignments. The committee also gives assignments to appointees following legislative vacancies.

Other lawmakers and lobbyists told the Examiner in recent weeks that Armendariz had decided not to run. Of her record, some said that while she might be quiet on the legislative floor, they highlighted her committee work, particularly in asking thoughtful, sometimes probing questions during the budget-writing process.
Armendariz has introduced seven bills in her tenure, carrying the fewest of her colleagues each year. Four of those passed either as part of the state budget or with other proposals. One 2025 bill could return in 2026, on whether the state’s option enrollment program — for a family to apply to send a student to a different school district than they live in — could be used to expand school choice.
Her Legislative Bill 557 would give any family $2,500 for the educational support of a student whose option enrollment application is rejected. It set no funding cap.

Armendariz said she intended to narrow the bill to students who qualify for free and reduced-priced lunch (185% of the federal poverty level) or are in “failing schools,” defined by state test scores. Armendariz grew up in North Omaha, a neighboring legislative district that was one of five in the state to vote to keep the state’s most recent school voucher program.
“Really, it’s to give more kids in failing schools some sort of an out,” Armendariz said in January of her bill, adding it “might be a drop in the bucket” of what some people would need.
LB 557 did not advance from the Education Committee in 2025, but it could return next year.
Armendariz has also used her “priority” designation to help other legislation be scheduled, such as in 2023, for former State Sen. Tom Briese of Albion (now state treasurer) to fund an “efficiency review” of state government; in 2024, for State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte to advance a law to infuse an estimated $1 billion in federal funding for Nebraska hospitals; and in 2025, for State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont to increase State Fire Marshal fees that had lagged.
‘Blessing of information’
Reflecting on her service, Armendariz said she ideally would like more people to get the chance to serve as an elected official, gaining insights that she said aren’t available outside of service.
Armendariz said she initially ran because of political polarization, still retaining the belief that the country needs to minimize the impact of being so polarized. She said many belief systems overlap but that some people too often focus on the few issues that cause division.
“They’re elevated at an exponential level that I think is very detrimental to us as people that live in this country. Still believe that,” Armendariz said.
“Serving and serving all different kinds of people and learning the process has just been a blessing of information that I’m grateful that I got the opportunity to learn.”

(New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute screenshot)Drug-related deaths in New Hampshire fell 33.4% from 2023 to 2024, the sharpest decrease in over a decade, according to a new study from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
In 2024, there were approximately 287 drug-related deaths, according to the study. There were 431 in 2023. The study suggests the downward trend in deaths could continue. Preliminary data from 2025 shows an estimated 77 drug-related deaths in the first six months of the year, which is down from 122 in the first six months of 2024.
2024 was the second consecutive year of drug fatality decreases in New Hampshire, following an 11.5% decrease from 2022 to 2023.
The data suggests something of a recovery from the height of the opioid crisis that has ravaged New Hampshire and other parts of the U.S. In 2017, drug deaths peaked at 490 deaths, according to NHFPI’s report. Of those deaths, 424 were opioid-related, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, putting New Hampshire in the top five most affected states per capita. The report also notes the current sharp decline contrasts with the spikes during the crisis. From 2013 to 2014, New Hampshire saw a 72.7% increase in drug-related deaths.
Opioids still remain the biggest driver of drug deaths; 86.3% of the deaths involved opioids. 
New Hampshire isn’t alone in the declining rate of opioid-related deaths. The entire U.S. saw a 25.9% decrease from 2023 to 2024 while neighboring Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine saw 36.4%, 25.5%, and 20.7% decreases, respectively, during the same time period.
The study attributes continued investments in substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery services for the decrease in deaths. New Hampshire invested more than $834.7 million in such services. Of that money, 73% came from the federal government, 22.5% from the state, and 4.5% from an opioid settlement fund that pharmaceutical companies involved in fueling the crisis for financial gain were forced by courts to pay to states for remediation efforts.
Medicaid, which is the largest payer for substance use disorder treatment in the country, is a large driver of the federal funding. The program paid for 21% of all U.S. substance use disorder treatment and 7.2% of all non-senior adults on Medicaid have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder, according to analysis of recent years’ Medicaid claims data by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicaid was expanded in New Hampshire in 2014, but the program’s future remains uncertain after cuts in the budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. The federal government also provided financial assistance by way of a series of grants aimed at ending the crisis.
Behind Medicaid, the Governor’s Commission on Addiction, Treatment, and Prevention is the largest source of funding to reduce drug fatalities. The state commission provided $74.3 million over the past decade..
New Hampshire has thus far spent 49.7% of the $95.8 million it received via the settlement funds, with case management for those incarcerated, more recovery centers, and additional social workers for correctional departments and police stations among the investments.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — CoreCivic signed a new contract valued at $60 million a year with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house migrant detainees at its Leavenworth facility, but the agreement won’t take effect until legal issues are resolved.
The company announced the new contract, which began Sept. 7, in a news release Monday. It replaces a six-month ICE contract in effect since March 7. 
The new contract is for a fixed monthly amount and then additional payments based on the number of detainees held in the facility, which can house up to 1,033. It will not begin until the temporary injunction put in place by a Kansas district court is “no longer enforceable,” the release said. 
CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth have been arguing in court whether the Nashville-based private prison company must follow the city’s development process and apply for a special use permit before reopening. 
As part of those court procedures, CoreCivic was stopped from taking ICE detainees until the legal disagreement was settled. CoreCivic is appealing that decision. 
The press release said the company cannot predict if or when legal issues will be resolved. 
The news release also announced a separate ICE contract for CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed California City Immigration Process Center, located in Kern County, California. Like Leavenworth’s Midwest Regional Reception Center, that facility has been vacant. 
“Once fully activated, these two facilities are expected to generate combined annual revenue of nearly $200 million,” CoreCivic president and COO Patrick Swindle said in the news release. “While the intake process has been delayed at the Midwest Regional Reception Center, we will offer newly hired employees opportunities to be redeployed at our other activations until the legal challenges are resolved.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CoreCivic-full-bldg-1024x533.jpg,,,2025-09-30 10:57:43.258640
